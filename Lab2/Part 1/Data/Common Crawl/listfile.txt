     white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders is seen during a press briefing at the white house on jan  11   matt mcclain the washington post            by  erik wemple          erik wemple media critic with a focus on the ups and downs and downs of the cable news industry    email  bio  follow         media critic  january 15  2018    in a memorable politico magazine piece in 2016  former tabloid journalist susan mulcahy poked at the dishonesty behind president trump s demonization of the media   today  trump calls reporters  disgusting     wrote mulcahy   that s the biggest lie of all  i d argue that his longest and most intimate relationship is with the media  who offer so many opportunities for him to gaze at the person he loves most   such adoration pours out of a transcript published by the wall street journal of an interview between the president and several reporters at the financial newspaper  at one point in the proceedings  trump pronounced himself pleased with one of the newspaper s stories   a lot of tremendous things are happening in the united states  including the fact that you can now live without being strangled by regulation  you people actually wrote one of the best stories that i ve ever seen on regulation  you said more than any president in history   said trump   that was the full pager   after a rep of the journal responded in the affirmative  trump continued   i mean i actually read it because i ve never seen a full page   it s actually a full page article   again  a journal interviewer responded in the affirmative  and again trump marveled at the layout   but  it was a full pager and essentially said there s never been a president that s been anywhere close on regulation   that part of the interview transcript isn t in doubt  another part is  big time  in a part of the dialogue relating to foreign policy  the journal quotes the president as follows   with that being said  president xi has been extremely generous with what he s said  i like him a lot  i have a great relationship with him  as you know i have a great relationship with prime minister abe of japan and i probably have a very good relationship with kim jong un of north korea  i have relationships with people  i think you people are surprised   bolding added to highlight the words that have fueled a several days long controversy  the way white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders tells it  the white house objected to this transcription as early as friday  insisting that the president used a different formulation   i d probably have a very good relationship with kim jong un of north korea   here s sanders on twitter    pic twitter com u9mhhxkot0  sarah sanders   presssec  january 13  2018     here is the official audio showing

one despite clear audio evidence they d misquoted potus   sarah sanders   presssec  january 14  2018   trump  too    the wall street journal stated falsely that i said to them  i have a good relationship with kim jong un   of n  korea   obviously i didn t say that  i said  i d have a good relationship with kim jong un   a big difference  fortunately we now record conversations with reporters     donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january 14  2018   the journal posted a reply to the white house request    we have reviewed the audio from our interview with president trump  as well as the transcript provided by an external service  and stand by what we reported  here is audio of the portion the white house disputes   pic twitter com bx9fgfwapw  the wall street journal   wsj  january 14  2018   journalist yashar ali came down in favor of  i d     former oppo researcher in me has been obsessing over this so i reduced the background noise and slowed his voice down to 40 percent and he says  i d   yashar ali     yashar  january 14  2018   the erik wemple blog has listened to the dueling audiotapes  there ll be no verdict coming from these parts on whether trump uttered a contraction or merely a pronoun  what is remarkable about the episode  however  is how quickly team trump goes from loving the wall street journal and its regulatory coverage to denouncing it as fake news   over a split second of an interview with an ambiguous transcription  a lack of self awareness has to kick off any explanation of the contretemps  trump speaks in ways that discombobulate anyone seeking to write down his words   trump is a very sloppy speaker   said transcription expert elizabeth pennell to cnbc during the 2016 presidential election   he is very hard to transcribe and because what he says can be such a bombshell and so badly parsed by the consuming public and the media  you just got to take so much more care  because everybody out there is literally hanging on every word he says in a way i have never seen happen before in a race   look again at the way trump set up this sequence  according to the journal   with that being said  president xi has been extremely generous with what he s said  i like him a lot  1   i have a great relationship with him  2   as you know i have a great relationship with prime minister abe of japan  3  and i probably have a very good relationship with kim jong un of north korea  4   i have relationships with people  5   i think you people are surprised   take a look  there are five statements highlighted above  four of which aren t in dispute  those four   1  2  3 and 5   are all in the present tense  indicative mood   meaning that they are statements of fact or belief  perhaps because trump was stringing together several such sentences  the journal defaulted to a present indicative transcription of the disputed sentence  no  4  a quick listen to the audiotape  too  appears to confirm as much  what trump claims  however  is that he changed up the mood of his verb in the disputed sentence  from  i probably have a very good relationship with kim jong un of north korea  to  i d probably have a very good relationship with kim jong un of north korea   that s a significant change  one involving the conditional mood  which is a way of expressing a thought that is dependent on some other outcome  which is to say  it s a way of stating a fantasy  i would be very happy if trump were to stop attacking the  fake news  media  what s so strange about trump s diction here is that he decided to use a contraction   i d probably  instead of  i would probably   it s an odd way of proceeding because trump was presumably trying to stress that he would have a very good relationship with kim jong un of north korea if such and such circumstances emerged  yet in this passage  trump doesn t specify the conditions under which he would have a very good relationship with kim jong un of north korea  so  even if the white house is right about the transcript  the president still makes no sense    once again  it doesn t matter  either statement is ridiculous   josh rogin   joshrogin  january 14  2018   one moment  the wall street journal is a glorious publication that runs  full pagers  on deregulation  the next moment  it s a purveyor of  fake news  because of a transcription squabble  in a speech he s drafting on trump s approach to the media  sen  jeff flake  r ariz   has written   i dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of  fake news  are dubious  at best     .

     wait  you actually bought that populist flim flam i peddled during the campaign     win mcnamee getty images            by  greg sargent          greg sargent opinion writer covering national politics  email  bio  follow         opinion writer  february 3  2017    the morning plum  president trump s war on financial elites and his draining of the swamp will gain a burst of new momentum friday  as trump is set to launch his first major steps toward deregulating wall street  the post reports   president trump plans to order a rollback friday of regulations governing the financial services industry and wall street under the dodd frank law and beyond  a white house source confirmed  gary cohn  white house economic council director  told the wall street journal in an interview published last night that the administration would also move against a regulation designed to force retirement advisers to work in the best interest of their clients  the  fiduciary rule   set to take effect in april and designed to eliminate conflicts of interests among professionals dealing with those enrolled in qualified retirement plans and iras    the move  set for announcement at a white house meeting with business leaders  would be in line with trump s campaign pledge to  dismantle the dodd frank act and replace it with new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation     did you attend a protest  tell us what you plan to do next   shockingly  the trump white house s version of getting tough on wall street is to deregulate it  as the post s account notes  trump will try to gut dodd frank by dismantling or modifying regulations where possible through executive action  trump may also  tame  dodd frank s consumer financial protection bureau by replacing its current head   richard cordray   with someone who is less aggressive about  cracking down on big banks and corporations accused of misleading consumers           window havepowaboot true   all of this sets the stage for a broader legislative push by republicans and trump to roll back dodd frank  populist  take that  elites  but this also gives democrats an opportunity  it presents a new and very specific way for them to press the case against trump for more transparency around his own holdings and the unprecedented welter of conflicts of interest   and possibilities for corruption   they may be creating   trump transferred control of his holdings to his two sons  but he retained ownership  meaning he did nothing meaningful to eliminate such conflicts   here s how  as ethics watchdogs have pointed out  the congressional gop leadership s total abdication of any meaningful oversight role on trump means individual members of congress   democrats  or the occasional principled republican who does want to exercise oversight   need to try to mount a stand where possible  they can do this by seizing on individual initiatives to demand transparency into how trump s holdings might be impacted by those initiatives   by calling for the release of his tax returns or demanding an accounting of those holdings  wall street deregulation   whether via trump executive actions right now or via the gop legislation to come   provides a good hook to do this  ethics experts told me friday  norm eisen  the chief ethics officer in the obama white house  noted that one potential area for demanding transparency might be  his debt to the banks he proposes to help   eisen added   this effort to let big banks run wild was to be expected  given mr  trump s own unresolved conflicts    it s about time someone attacked australia  thank you  president trump   richard painter  the chief ethics watchdog for president george w  bush  noted that friday s news provides a hook to demand more disclosure from trump about  the debt he or the corporations he controls have at the corporate level   much of which is  not disclosed in financial disclosure reports    he s deregulating banks   he told me   we re entitled to know about his relationship with banks   the very industry he s deregulating   painter added that these relationships might shed light on how trump s real estate holdings might be affected by such deregulation   the deregulation of financial services will lead to more bank loans for real estate  driving up real estate prices   painter said   deregulation is likely to lead to a bubble in the real estate market  as it has in the past  that ups the value of his real estate holdings  which the trump organization could then sell at the top of the market   now  to be clear  the point here is not that trump s deregulatory initiatives should be judged as policy based on how they affect his holdings  they should be judged on their own merits  and i suspect that serious analysis of them will ultimately conclude that they put consumers at greater risk and make another financial crash more likely  rather  the point is that the public has the right to know how the president s holdings might be affected by his policies irrespective of the merits or demerits of those policies   because this goes to the question of whose interests trump is really looking out for  even if you believe trump when he says he ll only look out for the people s interests  americans still have the right to know whether his holdings are being affected  and how  in order to judge his motives for themselves  of course  trump will probably ignore any such calls for transparency  and congressional republicans probably won t care in the least  because trump is likely to deliver on the huge tax cuts and deregulation they want  but the unique challenges of this moment require democrats   and the occasional principled republican   to find new and innovative ways of waging guerrilla ethics warfare designed to chip away at the opacity of trump s holdings  and the protective wall congressional gop leaders have built around them  by drawing more and more public attention to this cozy little arrangement  friday s news is one place to start                                                                        european leaders increasingly worried about trump  the new york times surveys the view from europe  where there is mounting anxiety over trump s america first ism and seeming contempt for international institutions   hopes among european leaders that mr  trump s bombastic tone as a candidate would somehow smooth into a more temperate one as commander in chief are dissipating  replaced by a mounting sense of anxiety and puzzlement    some european leaders are urging their counterparts to recognize that mr  trump may represent a truly dire challenge  one that threatens to upend not only the 70 year european project of integration and security  but just about everything they stand for  including liberal democracy itself   of course  this can always easily be justified by saying that 1  america will  no longer be taken advantage of   and 2  trump is being  unpredictable  and  disruptive     republicans struggle with obamacare talking points  the post reports that some republicans are increasingly inclined to say that they are going to  repair  obamacare rather than  repeal and replace  it  and there s yet a third option   rep  greg walden  chairman of the house energy and commerce committee and a key architect of gop health care plans  has favored yet another r word in recent days   rebuild    bottom line  republicans cannot create a replacement that will make both the broader public  who wants to keep major elements of the law  and conservatives  who want to obliterate it entirely  happy at the same time    trump approval rating at record low  a new cbs news poll finds that only 40 percent of americans approve of trump s performance as president so far  versus 48 percent who disapprove  cbs notes that this is  the lowest of any president just after his first inauguration since the gallup poll began taking those measures in 1953   but steve bannon tells us there is a  vast and overwhelming majority of americans  that is silently rooting for trumpism to succeed    public opposes trump immigration moves  the new cbs news poll also finds that 51 percent oppose trump s executive order temporarily banning entry by migrants from seven majority muslim countries  versus only 45 percent who approve  those numbers are identical  51 disapprove  45 approve  on trump s temporary ban on refugees  too  and this is a great little nugget  only 36 percent agree that the ban on entry from majority muslim countries will make the u s  safer from terrorism    trump may not deliver on big promise to religious right  trump has been telling the religious right that he ll  destroy  the johnson amendment  which prevents tax exempt entities such as churches from engaging in politics  but mcclatchy raises a good point  it s highly probable that the votes will not be there in the senate to overcome a democratic filibuster  still  he s delivering them the supreme court justice that they wanted  so that should do it   for awhile  at least    trump is oddly quiet about mosque attack  adam taylor points out that trump has tweeted constantly about terrorist attacks all over the world for years  but has said little to nothing about the attack that killed six in a quebec city mosque   on trump s famed social media accounts   the attack in quebec city does not appear to have been mentioned at all trump often quickly and clearly responded to terror attacks on foreign soil    in almost every case  trump was responding to an attack claimed by a militant islamist group    the attack in quebec city does not appear to have been carried out by a muslim or inspired by islamic extremist ideology  in this case  the victims were muslims   gosh  what could explain this    and conway invents terrorist attack to justify  muslim ban   on msnbc last night  kellyanne conway claimed that the obama administration banned iraqi refugees in 2011 and after there was a  massacre  in bowling green  ky  zack beauchamp sets the record straight  pointing out that  no  obama did not ban refugees  and no  there was never a terrorist attack in bowling green  other than that  though  conway s  alternative facts  are right on the money    .

back to top           u s  department of defense  the following is a statement from deputy secretary of defense william j  lynn iii to the dod workforce regarding plans in the event of a shutdown  the department remains hopeful that a government shutdown will be averted  the president has made it clear that he does not want a government shutdown  and the administration is working to find a solution with which all sides can agree  however  prudent management requires that we plan for an orderly shutdown should congress be unable to pass a funding bill before our current funding expires on april 8   the president and the secretary know that the uncertainty of the current situation puts federal employees in a difficult position  and are very much aware that a shutdown would impose hardships on our military and civilian personnel as well as our military families  as we approach the expiration of the current continuing resolution  we will provide you with updated information as soon as it becomes available  for now  i want to provide you with information on how the potential shutdown   should it occur   will impact our military and civilian personnel    department of defense  dod  operations during a shutdown  operations and activities that are essential to safety  protection of human life  and protection of our national security  are  excepted  from shutting down  the dod will continue to conduct activities in support of our national security  including operations in iraq  afghanistan  and japan  libya related support operations  and other operations and activities essential to the security of our nation  the department must also continue to provide for the safety of human life and protection of property   other excepted activities will include inpatient and essential outpatient care in dod medical treatment facilities  emergency dental care  non appropriated funds activities such as mess halls and child care activities  certain legal activities to support ongoing litigation and legal assistance for deployed dod personnel  contracting and logistics operations that are in support of excepted activities  certain education and training activities to include the dod education activity schools  and financial management activities necessary to ensure the control and accountability of funds   in the absence of appropriations  non excepted activities that have not already been fully funded will need to be shut down in an orderly fashion  in accordance with existing laws and regulations  i will issue more detailed guidance to the department regarding specific activities that are considered excepted or non excepted  however  the secretary and i understand that the military departments and defense agencies and individual commanders must tailor this guidance to many different situations around the world  therefore  should there be a government shutdown  dod personnel will be informed through their chain of command about how a shutdown may affect them personally    duty status  military personnel are not subject to furlough and will report for duty as normal during the shutdown  reserve component personnel should refer to the dod contingency guidance document and to their chain of command for more specific information   civilian personnel deemed to be performing excepted activities will continue to work during the period of a shutdown   if there is a government shutdown beginning on saturday  april 9  all dod personnel should still report to work on their next scheduled duty day  beginning at their normal duty hours to receive additional instructions   civilians will be briefed by their supervisors by friday  april 8  as to whether their work and responsibilities fall into excepted or non excepted status  as defined by applicable laws and regulations  excepted status categories are outlined in the dod contingency guidance document  which is being distributed through the chain of command  if their work and responsibilities are non excepted  or if they are not needed to carry out excepted work and responsibilities  employees will be furloughed in a non pay status  furloughed employees may not telework or volunteer to work   generally  contractors performing work on contracts funded prior to a shutdown  whether supporting excepted activities or not  may continue working and will be paid out of the obligated funds  subject to further direction from the contracting officer  new contracts  or increases in funding of existing contracts  needed to support excepted activities may be entered into during the period of a shutdown  but payments under such contracts cannot be made until congress provides additional funding  contract personnel should also report to work on monday  april 11  to be briefed on their status    military  civilian  and retiree pay  if the government shuts down due to the absence of funding  the dod will have no funds to pay military members or civilian employees for the days during which the government is shut down  however  both military and civilian personnel will receive pay for the period worked prior to the shutdown  military personnel  and civilians occupying excepted status positions and required to work  are entitled to be paid for work performed during the shutdown  and will be paid retroactively once the department receives additional funding  congress would have to provide authority in order for the department to retroactively pay non excepted employees for the furloughed period   military retirees and annuitants are not paid from annually appropriated funds  and therefore their benefits should continue without interruption    additional resources  the office of personnel management  opm  has created a document to address some of the questions that i know must be on your mind  the document can be accessed at    opm will provide additional pertinent information for federal employees as the week progresses   the department s leadership will do our very best to provide clear information about the status of events as the week progresses  additional information regarding military and dod civilian pay  leave  and other dod policies applicable to a potential shutdown will be posted on the department s main website as soon as it becomes available   thanks to the hard work and dedication of all of you  the department of defense provides critical services to the american public  your contributions touch people s lives in so many significant ways  and i want you to know how deeply i appreciate your dedication and your expertise  our decisions concerning which functions are excepted or not excepted are based on government wide legal  regulatory  and policy guidance as well as our best judgment on how to reconcile our national security requirements with the limitations imposed by a government shutdown  the fact that certain functions are not excepted or that certain personnel may be subject to furlough should not be taken as a statement that the secretary or i or the department do not value those functions or employees  thank you for your continued service to the department and the nation        back to top           u s  department of agriculture  we received the following information from an agency official familiar with the agency s plans   we still believe there is an opportunity to avoid a government shutdown but are working to ensure that we are prepared for all possible scenarios   agency operational plans are still being finalized  but in the event

ready to work day and night to find a solution with which all sides can agree  given the realities of the calendar  however  prudent management requires that we plan for an orderly shutdown should

      by  ed o keefe          ed o keefe reporter focused on congress  national politics and the federal government  bio  follow         april 5  2011      the look on this scuplture outside the u s  capitol says it all   ron edmonds   ap   in instructions updated and issued tuesday evening  the office of personnel management issued updated guidance on how a shutdown of even one day would impact each worker s bottom line  you can read the full guidance here  but the federal eye read it and summarizes below    question  what is a furlough   answer  according to opm s official guidance   a furlough is the placing of an employee in a temporary nonduty  nonpay status because of lack of work or funds  or other nondisciplinary reasons    q  what is a shutdown furlough and why is one necessary    a  shutdown furlough  occurs if federal funding runs out  it s necessary for agencies that no longer have the funds necessary to keep working    q  who s an  essential  worker   note  opm labels employees who work during a shutdown as  excepted employees     it s people working or may continue to do so by law   essential excepted  employees include people   1  performing emergency work involving the safety of human life or the protection of property   2  performing minimal activities as necessary to execute an orderly suspension of agency operations related to non excepted activities  or  3  performing certain other types of excepted work   top agency lawyers and managers are determining who s considered  essential  and  non essential    other workers may be  excepted  from the shutdown furlough if their agency or program is covered by appropriations not impacted by the current budget impasse   best examples of that are the federal highway administration  which is funded by the federal highway trust fund  the veterans health administration is also handled on a two year budget cycle    q  how will employees be notified whether they have been designated to be handling  excepted  or  non excepted  functions   answer  each agency will communicate with its employees whether they re  essential  or  non essential    q  are all employees who qualify as  emergency employees  for the purpose of weather emergencies considered  essential  during a shutdown    a  not necessarily  emergency employees for weather purposes aren t automatically deemed  essential  during shutdowns   each agency must determine which employees are excepted employees    q  may employees volunteer to do their job without pay during a shutdown   a  no  unless otherwise authorized by law  an agency may not accept the voluntary services of an employee   the anti deficiency act is the law prohibiting voluntary work     q  can workers take another job during while furloughed    a  even if you re furloughed  you re still a federal employee and executive branch ethics regarding outside employment still apply  employees should review those regulations before applying elsewhere   q  will i be paid if i work during a shutdown  if so  when    a  agencies will sort out who gets paid for time worked during a shutdown and those employees will be paid when congress passes and the president signs a new appropriation or continuing resolution    q  will furloughed non essential employees be paid for not working during a shutdown    a  congress will determine whether  non essential  workers receive pay for the furlough period    q  can non esential workers take previously approved paid leave during a shutdown    a  no  all paid leave during a shutdown furlough period must be canceled because the requirement to furlough supersedes leave rights  paid leave creates a debt to the government that isn t authorized by law    q  can essential personnel take previously approved leave or be granted new requests for paid leave during a shutdown   a  no  essential personnel must be either doing their job or furloughed during any absence from work during a shutdown  if an excepted employee refuses to report for work after being ordered to do so  he or she will be considered in an absence without leave  awol  and will be subject to any subsequent consequences   q  will an employee continue to be covered under the federal employee health benefits  fehb  program during a shutdown furlough if the agency is unable to make its premium payments on time   a  yes  the employee s fehb coverage will continue even if an agency does not make the premium payments on time   q  what effect will a furlough have on other benefits that are paid for through payroll deductions   a  it varies  best thing to do is visit  for more information    q  are employees entitled to unemployment compensation while on furlough   a  it is possible that furloughed employees may become eligible for unemployment compensation  but state unemployment compensation requirements differ  some require a one week waiting period before you apply  you should contact your state government directly and visit the labor department s  unemployment compensation for federal employees  information page    read the full opm guidance here  were all of your

           by  greg sargent          greg sargent opinion writer covering national politics  email  bio  follow         opinion writer  october 30  2015    to read much of the coverage   including some on this blog   you d think that the threat of a government shutdown and other mischief that might be wrought by the hard right s shenanigans had been defused  now that a budget deal will fund the government and raise the debt ceiling into 2017  that means no more need to worry  right  well  unfortunately not  it turns out that there are still potential landmines with a lot of explosive power buried in the budget process that could wreak a lot of havoc  and they pose a big test for new house speaker paul ryan  democrats on the house appropriations committee tell me that they are worried about the possibility of major sticking points looming over so called  policy riders   a threat that still remains even though congress has agreed upon new spending levels that are higher than the caps imposed by the budget control act  a k a  the sequester  the problem is that  even though the bulk amount of spending has been agreed upon  congress will have to pass a dozen or so individual appropriations bills that fill in the specific spending in different areas of government  democrats note that half a dozen of these bills have already passed the house  and all 12 are public  they ll have to be renegotiated to align with the new  higher spending levels  but the already existing bills are currently loaded with policy riders on all sorts of conservative priorities  democrats point out  conservatives will likely pressure gop leaders to keep these riders in  and pressure them to make them conditional on passing these bills   creating another leverage point that the right can try to exploit  potentially leading to sticking points that threaten government shutdowns  rep  nita lowey  the ranking dem on the house appropriations committee  says this in an emailed statement    passing this budget agreement and preventing a debt default is a positive step  but let s be very clear   enacting an omnibus spending bill in six weeks that includes hundreds of difficult policy and funding decisions is no simple task   there is still a long way to go before congratulating ourselves for avoiding a shutdown    to get a sense of what sort of policy riders we re talking about here  read david dayen s good piece explaining how serious a problem this could prove  here s his list of riders that are currently in appropriations bills that have already passed   the appropriations bills on offer would cancel all federal funding for planned parenthood  they would prevent enforcement of a proposed labor department regulation to mandate investment advisers to operate in their clients  best interest  they would cancel the federal communication commission s net neutrality rules  they would stop environmental regulations on clean water  endangered species  and air quality standards for ozone  and block an occupational safety and health administration rule on toxic silica dust in the workplace   they would exempt flavored cigarettes currently on the market from regulation  they would halt the securities and exchange commission from completing rules requiring publicly traded companies to disclose political spending  they would block rules limiting the hours long haul truckers can spend on the road without rest  and they would change hundreds of other rules  regulations  and funding priorities   as dayen explains   these aren t primarily funding decisions  but unrelated favors that reward conservative friends  typically businesses seeking to be unshackled from regulations  and punish enemies such as planned parenthood and the consumer financial protection bureau  they would fail as standalone legislation  but can pass when attached to the budget like barnacles to a ship   and they are exactly the type of policies   repealing environmental and safety regulations  attacking planned parenthood   that conservatives deemed important enough to be worth shutting down the government for   this all sets up a very interesting situation for incoming speaker ryan  he has vowed to make the house governable again  and has sought rules changes to insulate himself from blowback from house conservatives if and when he makes governing compromises that anger them  john boehner s shepherding through of a big budget deal did take big steps towards clearing the decks for ryan to take over  but conservatives may regroup and mount a new round of pressure on ryan to use these riders to fight for conservative priorities  such as defunding planned parenthood  rolling back or weakening obama s new efforts to curb carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants  and so forth  to be sure  conservatives will probably expect their leaders to cave on many of these  but it s still an occasion for more infighting between them and gop leaders   and more conservative anger and disappointment towards them   this will be a huge first test for ryan   one senior adviser to a conservative member of congress tells me   conservatives will want their leaders to make a stand on planned parenthood  obama s carbon plan  etc  but there s nothing to give conservatives faith the leadership will do that  this will be another rough patch   meanwhile  liberals will likely pressure democratic leaders not to cave  either   they will demand senate democrats stand firm in filibustering any appropriations bills that do include any of these riders  so  while it s true that the threat of calamity has been dramatically reduced  we could see more games of congressional chicken as the december 11th deadline for an agreement funding the government over the long term approaches   games that could still create a lot of noisy drama and do a fair amount of damage          window havepowaboot true     .

brisbane  australia  nov  16  2014 politicians generally hate to say they have changed their minds about something  with president obama poised to take executive action to address immigration  perhaps as early as this week  he was challenged by a reporter to explain why he believed he could take this action now  after years of saying his hands were tied  the president responded with a pinocchio laden straw man  saying that the questions had a distinct focus   their interest was in me  through executive action  duplicating the legislation that was stalled in congress   but as we shall see  the questions actually specifically addressed the sorts of actions that he is contemplating now  there is precedence for such a shift  in 2011  the president said he could not take action to help

      by william claiborne     july 8  1978  israeli and syrian troops faced off across their common border yesterday in a show of strength precipitated by syria s five day bombardment of the christian quarter of beirut  reacting to thinly veiled threats of intervention by israeli and the rooftop level overflight of beirut thursday by israeli jet fighters  syria deployed troops along its border near the golan heights and put its airport and anti aircraft units on alert  apparently anticipating air attacks either on military posts in south lebanon or on artillery brigades surrounding beirut s besieged christian sector  the israeli army reinforced its military units along the lebanese border and moved units stationed in northern israeli closer to lebanon in a move reminiscent of many previous confrontations with its arab neighbors  the united states and the soviet union were reported to be working behind the scenes to defuse tensions and preclude the latest lebanese crisis from erupting into a full scale middle east confrontation  israeli officials said yesterday s deployment was less a strategic maneuver than another signal to syria that it will not tolerate a movement

      by william claiborne     july 8  1978  israeli and syrian troops faced off across their common border yesterday in a show of strength precipitated by syria s five day bombardment of the christian quarter of beirut  reacting to thinly veiled threats of intervention by israeli and the rooftop level overflight of beirut thursday by israeli jet fighters  syria deployed troops along its border near the golan heights and put its airport and anti aircraft units on alert  apparently anticipating air attacks either on military posts in south lebanon or on artillery brigades surrounding beirut s besieged christian sector  the israeli army reinforced its military units along the lebanese border and moved units stationed in northern israeli closer to lebanon in a move reminiscent of many previous confrontations with its arab neighbors  the united states and the soviet union were reported to be working behind the scenes to defuse tensions and preclude the latest lebanese crisis from erupting into a full scale middle east confrontation  israeli officials said yesterday s deployment was less a strategic maneuver than another signal to syria that it will not tolerate a movement of syrian peacekeeping forces farther south in lebanon  israeli military officials would not say how many army units are involved or where they were moved  israeli government officials toned down noticeably their blunt threats of thursday  apparently by way of waiting to see whether the syrian army renews its shelling of east beirut  moshe arens  head of the israeli parliament s foreign

      by  william branigin          william branigin reporter and editor covering breaking news  email  bio        january 30  1980  for the afghan refugees at this camp in western pakistan  home is just over a snow covered mountain  that is why they refuse to leave their remote  rocky hilltop for camps deeper inside pakistan where they might find easier access to relief aid and a more hospitable climate   we want to live here  as close as possible to our country   says mitta khan  a grizzled villager wounded in fighting against afghan government troops two months ago  nevertheless  he refuses to return to afghanistan without new weapons and ammunition to carry on a guerrilla war against the soviet troops that invaded his country last month  we have to stay here  khan said   because we re helpless and empty handed   for the pakistani authorities who administer and guard this territory  which jabs like a finger into afghanistan s eastern flank  thousands of heavily armed refugees on this side of the border can only mean trouble  in view of what they regard as a soviet threat to their country s fragile integrity  the pakistani armed forces here are taking care to keep a low profile and avoid any activities that might appear provocative to their neighbor  at headquarters in nearby parachinar of the district s frontier corps  the pakistani military s border guards  a young officer acknowledged that the army deliberately was not reinforcing its troops here because that might entail reciporcal action by the soviets   then  just one spark and there would be war   the officer said  so far  he said  the soviets have not made any move to deploy in strength along afghanistan  eastern border with pakistan  although that is where much of the afghan rebel activity has been concentrated  nor has there been any effort by the new rulers in the afghan capital of kabul to man the border posts near the afghan village of patan a few miles north of here  from the pakistani side  the fortress like afghan post shows no sign of life  like many other such posts  according to pakistani officers  it has long been abandoned  except for the nearby pakistani border station  manned by a dozen guards  there appears to be nothing to stop the flow of refugees across the border  the border station is easily avoided  however  local authorities have received reports  which they have not been able to confirm  that soviet forces have mined the dirt roads leading to that crossing point  in any case  most other passes through the area s high mountains have been blocked by snow  and refugee crossings lately have slowed to a trickle  an estimated 600 000 afghan refugees have fled to pakistan since an april 1978 coup brought the first of three marxist governments to power  one place where afghan refugees are still able to cross is over the relatively low mountains just west of this camp  that was the route taken three weeks ago by the 50 families    nearly the entire population of the afghan village of sikram near the town of gardez    that now live in a conglomeration of about 30 tents  20 camels and assorted cattle  goats  chickens and dogs  in mid december  according to ghanam rang  the camps  elder  bombing destroyed many of the houses in the village  even cattle were killed  he said  throughout the year we were subjected to bombing   rang said   then when we could no longer put up any resistance  we had to leave   rang and other refugees claim that even before the dec  27 soviet inspired coup in afghanistan  the air strikes against afghan villages were carried out by soviet pilots  other accounts by refugees in this area vary little  most describe spontaneous local uprisings against a communist afghan government regarded as un islamic and infidel  followed by harsh retaliation including aerial bombardment of villages  then a trek to pakistan because of inadequate means to fight back   nobody incited us to fight against the enemy   rang said   we ourselves started fighting for the glory of islam  we are believers in god  and these people wanted us to leave our faith  tell me  how can i renounce my religion   conditions here are among the most miserable of the afghan refugee camps that have sprung up since moslem rebels began to wage an uncoordinated guerrilla war against the central goverenment 20 months ago  the refugees at matasangar camp live almost exclusively on bread and tea  they say none of the food donated by foreign relief agencies and governments has reached here yet  what they have received so far has been wheat flour sold to them at reduced prices by the financially strapped pakistani government  as well as some donated tents and blankets  the subsidized pakistani food program also is stretched thin  to supplement a u n  world food program relief effort that is just getting off the ground  the pakistanis also are giving the refugees four biscuits a person each month  the world food program is to supply  5 million worth of wheat  lentils  vegetable oil and dry skim milk over a six month period  but that will fall well short of the refugees  estimated needs  the altitude here is higher    about 5 700 feet    and the weather harsher than at any other camp  about 20 persons  most of them children  have died in the subfreezing temperatures since this and an adjacent camp were set up  in their tents    most of them leaky patchworks of hemp matting and sectins of canvas    partitions of dried mud separate the refugees  sleeping areas from spaces for their animals  one reason for concern is growing resentment among pakistani moslems of the shiite sect against afghan refugees  who are almost entirely sunni moslems   the shiites are not happy with the influx of afghan refugees in this area   said taj mohammad khan  the federal administrator of the kurram agency  or district  in parachinar   they fear that if the sunnis settle here  it will disturb the balance  to show their displeasure  they have killed a number of afghan refugees on the road   he said that since november  12 refugees have been killed near parachinar  which has a shiite majority  pakistani sunnis  who are in the majority nationwide  seem to be tolerating the refugees  if not always welcoming them with open arms  local pakistani officials charged with distributing assistance to the refugees here appear genuinely interested in helping them and try hard to allocate their meager resources    .
      by john lantigua     april 8  1985  large areas of the northern nicaraguan mountains have been cleared of civilians  according to government military officials  who say those wilderness areas are now strictly war zones in which the sandinistas will increase their firepower  on a recent trip beyond this town 120 miles north of managua  i walked about seven miles into one of those newly militarized zones where until now the rebels had been able to find food  refuge  information and recruits  the residents evacuated in the past two months were among at least 7 000 families that the sandinistas say they are in the process of relocating to less remote areas  according to local military officials  the road i followed is being improved to facilitate the army s access to the mountainous zone  considered strategic because it is just across the border from honduras and the largest of the rebel camps  called las vegas  the spine of hills that runs out of honduras and by murra has been a principal thoroughfare for the contra rebels who enter nicaragua from that camp  sandinista officials say  houses along the road were abandoned and had been emptied of all possessions  in some cases  roofing material had been dragged away and the insides of the stripped houses were exposed to the elements  in other houses  bread ovens and primitive cooking stoves made of clay had been smashed to prevent use by the rebels  there were no people to be seen  chickens  pigs and cows  which normally surround such rural houses and which the rebels have been known to buy from farmers  were also gone  on trees  the sandinistas had posted a message telling the rebels that 1985 would be a year in which they  continue to be defeated  and offering them amnesty  entitled  a letter of return   the poster featured a drawing of a uniformed rebel turning in his rifle and being welcomed joyfully by his family   the popular sandinista army agrees to respect your life  your physical integrity and agrees to give you just and dignified treatment if you deliver yourself with this document to our troops or to the nearest militia post with your rifle and your equipment   it said  after almost two hours of walking  i rounded a bend and was stopped by the sound of a bullet being shifted to the chamber of a bolt action rifle  no one was visible  as i raised my hands  a sandinista soldier stepped out from behind a canvas lean to farther up the road  lt  felix sanchez  who was at a makeshift camp around the next bend  said no civilians were to be in the area  he said the next sandinista outpost  at an abandoned hamlet called rosario overlooking the border  had been besieged last month by hundreds of rebels  and that 11 sandinistas had died there  sanchez said his men  who patrol for three miles around their camp  taking them close to the border  had not seen a contra in two weeks   we think they are in honduras reorganizing   he said   they used to take advantage of people who lived in areas like this  they used to get food from them  but now they can t anymore and they are having to reorganize   in an interview in managua  tomas borge  minister in charge of internal security  said that with civilians removed from the area  it makes it easier to use our artillery  it clearly becomes a war zone   observers said they expect to see use of soviet made mi24 helicopter gunships  asked if the mi24 would be used in the new militarized zones  borge said   if such helicopters were here  it would be stupid to have them as museum pieces   borge said he expected rebel attacks soon in conjunction with a congressional vote on whether the united states should renew their funding    .

i should not say  are separated   this is too passive  the children and their parents arrive together  and then u s  agents mark the children as unaccompanied minors and send them to a detention facility  may 11  we separate 65 children from their parents  it is like a summer camp  except for the minor detail that you get to go to a summer camp voluntarily and your parents know that is where you are being sent  may 12  we separate 65 children from their parents  may 13  we separate 65 children from their parents  it is just like when a parent commits a crime and goes to jail  defenders of

the border  u s  agents separate 65 children from their parents  give or take a child  give or take a child  may 16  sixty five children  more or less  are marked as unaccompanied minors  although

experience for people around food  and i think richie  brandenburg  the director of culinary strategy for edens  has done an incredible job of curating this mix of local artisans   brandenburg says that union market has been  from day one  about balance  the culinary strategist wants to model the edens project on the spanish markets he visited as a chef with jose andres s thinkfoodgroup   there were experiences throughout the markets in spain where you can buy things there  spend time there and eat there in house   brandenburg says   it s been a constant conversation on what s the right balance  what s the right mix  at union market   it s a destination where you can spend all morning and afternoon  there  and then go home with products to cook your dinner and for the entire weekend  over half of the vendors there  you can bring products home   boyle and brandenburg say that edens plans to roll out more vendors at union market  including ones for groceries  the developer has also signed a lease with a seafood vendor  but both boyle and brandenburg preferred not to name the fish monger at this point  edens had hoped rogers would sign a lease and continue to hawk his delicious  made to order sandwiches  but the farmer says remaining at union market would not have served his purposes  as a livestock producer  rogers says  he needs to sell those cuts of lamb that chefs don t want for their restaurants  he says he couldn t begin to convert all the leftover legs and shoulders into sandwiches  even with his new border springs outlet in reading terminal  in fact  rogers says that over the course of the 11 months that he sold meats and sandwiches at union market  the latter started to dominate his sales  in the beginning  when a handful of vendors displayed their products in plastic storage containers on fold out tables  borders springs sold 100 percent meat  rogers says  during border springs s last weeks at union market  meat represented only 10 percent of sales  as a point of comparison  rogers says his meat sales at reading terminal  far exceeds our prepared food sales   what s more  he sells more meat in one day at his stand at the freshfarm market in penn quarter than he does all week at union market   my brand is better served at a farmers market than just being a lamb shop inside a food court or a watering hole sort of place  no matter how popular   rogers says    you just look like a little side show   edens counters that the  market has gone through sort of its own ebbs and flows where we re seeing different vendors do better than others at different points during the year   boyle says   i think the ultimate personality of the place is still evolving as our clientele and consumer base grows and continues to understand what the place is  for many people still  it s a first time experience   border springs officially closed its pop up at union market on sunday  it has already moved operations into union kitchen  the food incubator warehouse near union station  at union kitchen  border springs will prepare items  whether lambstrami  made from the shoulder cut  or mutton barbecue or lamb prosciutto  which the farm will eventually sell at the penn quarter farmers market and other retail locations  eventually  rogers hopes to open a retail shop in the district  one that would better balance his needs to sell both meat and prepared foods   i would love to find a place in d c  for retail   he says   where the focus is on a butcher shop    timcarman  .

balance  what s the right mix  at union market   it s a destination where you can spend all morning and afternoon  there  and then go home with products to cook your dinner and for the entire weekend  over half of the vendors there  you can bring products home   boyle and brandenburg say that edens plans to roll out more vendors at union market  including ones for groceries  the developer has also signed a lease with a seafood vendor  but both boyle and brandenburg preferred not to name the fish monger at this point  edens had hoped rogers would sign a lease and continue to hawk his delicious  made to order sandwiches  but the farmer says remaining at union market would not have served his purposes  as a livestock producer  rogers says  he needs to sell those cuts of lamb that chefs don t want for their restaurants  he says he couldn t begin to convert all the leftover legs and shoulders into sandwiches  even with his new border springs outlet in reading terminal  in fact  rogers says that over the course of the 11 months that he sold meats and sandwiches at union market  the latter started to dominate his sales  in the beginning  when a handful of vendors displayed their products in plastic storage containers on fold out tables  borders springs sold 100 percent meat  rogers says  during border springs s last weeks at union market  meat represented only 10 percent of sales  as a point of comparison  rogers says his meat sales at reading terminal  far exceeds our prepared food sales   what s more  he sells more meat in one day at his stand at the freshfarm market in penn quarter than he does all week at union market   my brand is better served at a farmers market than just being a lamb shop inside a food court or a watering hole sort of place  no matter how popular   rogers says    you just look like a little side show   edens counters that the  market has gone through sort of its own ebbs and flows where we re seeing different vendors do better than others at different points during the year   boyle says   i think the ultimate personality of the place is still evolving as our clientele and consumer base grows and continues to understand what the place is  for many people still  it s a first time experience   border springs officially closed its pop up at union market on sunday  it has already moved operations into union kitchen  the food incubator warehouse near union station  at union kitchen  border springs will prepare items  whether lambstrami  made from the shoulder cut  or mutton barbecue or lamb prosciutto  which the farm will eventually sell at the penn quarter farmers market and other retail locations  eventually  rogers hopes to open a retail shop in the district  one that would better balance his needs to sell both meat and prepared foods   i would love to find a place in d c  for retail   he says   where the focus is on a butcher shop    timcarman  .
      by  philip kennicott          philip kennicott art and architecture critic  email  bio  follow         may 23  2003  americans  who are protective or even prickly about the meaning of what happened on sept  11  2001  may find filmmaker bahman ghobadi s view disconcerting   you can be 100 percent sure that if these hollywood films were not being disseminated throughout the rest of the world in such a way that everyone can see these special effects       that september 11 probably wouldn t even have happened  it would not have become part of the imagination of the people   this is not an  america s to blame  argument  or echoing certain televangelists  a  decadent america got what it deserved  argument  it s an argument about the power of images  made by a kurdish iranian film director for whom images are sacred  ghobadi  whose  marooned in iraq  opens in washington today  comes from a society in which images are constrained because of censorship  difficult to produce because of poverty  and rich in meaning because of scarcity  in an interview in washington last month  on the same day that u s  troops seized saddam international airport in baghdad  ghobadi looked at america from the outside  as a colossus of visual production yet naive about the consequences of how it shows itself to the world  ghobadi s new movie  set in the aftermath of the iran iraq war  among a kurdish people traumatized by saddam hussein  never shows the viewer hussein himself  but the iraqi leader is a presence  as are warplanes  heard but unseen overhead  the film follows the trek of mirza  a famous musician  as he and his two sons search for mirza s ex wife  lost among refugees  everyday life    brutal  bracing and filled with crime and misadventure    is in the foreground  the political background is implied and limned with the barest strokes   it s more impactful to see a child who has lost his limbs because of a land mine or a bomb  or a woman who doesn t have a voice because of chemical war  than to see the action of war   says ghobadi  he also had difficulty getting permission to use military equipment or explosive effects  but as a filmmaker  he makes a virtue of necessity  one of the most haunting scenes in the new film shows dozens of paper airplanes gliding through the air as planes roar overhead  he has a strong distaste for american special effects and the sheer density of violence in american films  and he warns   the films coming out now are probably the worst advertisement of and pr for the american people   ghobadi  born in 1969  belongs to a young generation of iranian filmmakers who are bringing new grittiness to the poetic austerities of iranian cinema pioneered by older masters such as abbas kiarostami and mohsen makhmalbaf  with both of whom ghobadi has worked   ghobadi s first feature   a time for drunken horses   2000   fell into the subgenus of iranian films about children  a convenient form in which directors could bypass strict censorship rules about how women can be depicted and society criticized  american movies about children are often about infantilized adults  children as proxies for adult desires and ambitions  iranian films about children tend to be about children as children  but bearing the burdens of the world and responsible beyond their years  there was a dickensian sadness about  a time for drunken horses   which follows the efforts of brother and sister to care for each other and their severely ill brother  they don t ape the adult world  but are thrust into it by the hard necessities of life   marooned in iraq   a film about adults who are often more ridiculous than children  is an abrupt departure from that world  the tone is disturbingly unsettled  it opens with suggestions of the three stooges  men engaged in a manic but hard edged interplay that borders on slapstick  yet these are stooges stuck in a landscape scarred by genocidal mayhem  much of the film happens in blindingly white snowscapes  chilly  barren and isolated  the border that divides iran and iraq  the setting for both the new film and  a time for drunken horses   is a silent  terrifying  abstract line in the snow   the biggest enemy to the middle east  to that region of the world  to the world itself  is boundaries   says ghobadi   these are not boundaries that we laid down for ourselves  they were imposed by powers that we do not even see  that are far away from us  they espouse this idea of the global village  yet in our region of the world  they are laying down more and more boundaries  shifting them  changing them so that it benefits their own self interest   ghobadi is a short  compact man  with neatly trimmed hair  and he is dressed in functional  drab clothes  there s more fatigue than rancor in his discussion of what it s like to be a kurd  to be a pawn in an endless historical chess game  ghobadi is against the war  and against saddam hussein  he wants only to see hussein finished  borrowing an analogy from hollywood  he says it s time this trilogy ended  a trilogy that began with united states support of hussein in the iran iraq war  continued with an inconclusive empire strikes back in the gulf war  and is now  finally  reaching a denouement   the kurds have become the football that is tossed around between iraq  america  europe  syria  turkey   he says  being at the mercy of someone else s spectacle is an idea that brings together two facts central to him  the kurdish sense of being out of the game  and the preciousness and power of imagemaking   in kurdistan the families will go up on a hilltop and the blue sky becomes their screen   he says   they watch planes fly overhead and the bombings occur and characters like saddam and bush and tony blair    they all come and go    and  they  sit there with their version of popcorn  this is their movie theater  this is their version of reality   he could be describing a scene from  marooned in iraq  in which school is held on a hilltop  a class watching a jet s contrail faint against the blue sky  in  a time for drunken horses   a terminally ill teenage boy  stunted in size and emotional maturity  receives a hard won gift  a picture of a celebrity bodybuilder  grotesquely oversize with veins bulging under the skin  his brother  who purchased the image  earns money by carrying mysterious bundles across the snowy border  the image is tacked to the wall of their hut  a window  or screen  onto a world that must otherwise be imagined and inferred from the faintest evidence   for me  television and cinema are holy  they should be revered  treated with a great deal of respect   ghobadi says  thus  he finds it odd that american television can t stop showing saddam hussein on his balcony  firing his rifle into the sky  for ghobadi  hussein is a substantial enemy  to be effaced  repeatedly showing his image only legitimizes him   in most mainstream media  the superstars are the saddam husseins  the tony blairs  the george bushes       and the kurds become the extras  the anonymous people  the villagers   says ghobadi   but they are the ones being affected the most  in my films the kurdish people are the superstars  and the rest of the people who don t deserve the attention  they are relegated to the background   the contrast between a kurdish boy drinking in a single image  and western children who live saturated in images  functions like a warning to the viewer  nothing in ghobadi s films can be easily read  kurdish society and american society stand across a chasm from each other  even the sense of slapstick at the opening of  marooned in iraq  may be a misreading   kurdistan  because of all the problems it has had  has been held back one or two generations   ghobadi says   perhaps for you it hearkens back to something from 60  70  80 years ago  for us  this is very much the reality of today  the behaviors  the actions  the motives    foreign film   warn some critics  is in danger of becoming not so foreign  as directors outside of hollywood cater to a western appetite for heartwarming tales of colorful country life  ghobadi s films  however  remain resolutely  uncompromisingly foreign  the behaviors  the actions  the motives  are not always easy to interpret  even the color palette  a vital part of other iranian films  is kept strictly muted  with the success of iranian film at western film festivals  ghobadi s first feature took the golden camera at cannes   new offshoots have developed  some iranian films have become slicker  ghobadi s represent a kind of dissent  a flinty  hard nosed  realist view of a cruel world  with no comforting mysticism  they are so detached that they carry no residue of sadness or horror  they leave one empty  they are  like a mute victim of chemical weapons that figures in this feature  mere evidence  rather than dramatic enactments  of what is wrong in the kurdish homeland  marooned in iraq  97 minutes  in farsi and kurdish with subtitles  at cineplex odeon dupont circle and landmark bethesda row  is not rated and includes war imagery   the biggest enemy       is boundaries   says kurdish iranian director bahman ghobadi a young kurdish girl in ghobadi s  marooned in iraq   which opens in washington today    .
      by thomas w  lippman     march 13  1977  president anwar sadat of eyypt opened the palestine national council meeting tonight with a strongly worded rejection of president jimmy carter s concept of defensible borders of israel  sadat did not mention carter by name  but he told the applauding palestinians that  i want all to listen on this occasion  we shall not cede one inch of our land  the national land is not open to bargaining   it was the first authoritative egyptian response to carter s suggestion this past week that a middle east peace settlement might include some defense lines for the israelis beyond that country s recognized 1967 frontiers  sadat was delivering the opening address at the palestine liberation organization representative assembly s first session since 1974  the position on the issue of secure borders that sadat expressed tonight is the same as it was before carter raised the subject   that it is a thinly disguised excuse to  sanctify  israeli territorial expansion  if it ever had any merit as a strategic concept  he said  that was  blown away by the winds  in the october 1973 war  when the most secure borders the israelis could hope for  the suez canal and the bar lev line  were breached by the egyptians   in the egyptian view  security for israel lies in coming for terms with its neighbors  not in digging in against them  the secure borders issue is  nothing but a fantasy   sadat said   it is not admissible that anybody should speak of secure boudaries as part of the israeli conception  it is absulutely unjust and unacceptable   in any peace agreement  he said  isreal should withdraw completely from the territory occupied in 1967 because  we don t believe in rewarding the aggressor   when he finished  he received a warm handshake and smile from yasser arafat  chairman of the plo executive committee  and in that gesture lies a possible clue to the mood of this council  sadat said nothing  at this gathering of palestinians about regaining all of the former palestinian mandate or eliminating israel  on the contrary  his remarks were in the context of his often stated policy if the isrealis will withdraw from the territories captured in 1967 and allow the creation of what arafat called a  palestinian national authority in a free country   that appears to be the central decision facing the palestinians here   whether to go to geneva and accept officially as they have unofficially  the idea that they will have to settle for a mini state  linked in some way to jordan  in plate of their old dream of a return to all of their form homeland  the leadership insists that this council will not even discuss revision of the palestine national charter  which calls for the elimination of israel  but the palestinians are under heavy economic  military and political pressure from egypt  syria and saudi arabia to accept what they can get in an overall settlement with israel  in practical terms  that means at most a west bank gaza strip state  and many palestinian leaders  including arafat  are said to be resigned to that  the national council  which is expected to last about a week  is also scheduled to take up the rapprochement with jordan  escalated anti israeli activity inside the occupied territories  and reunification of the military units that were pitted against each other in the lebanon war   israeli security forces prevented student demonstration today in four west bank towns in support of the cairo meeting  the military said  according to ap  four youths were detained to nablus   the national council is an umbrella group commonly referred to as a palestinian parliament in exile  its 290 seats are filled by palestinians from throughout the world  representing all shades of palestinian opinion from hard core guerrilla rejectionists to western oriented politicians willing to accept peace with israel  all major known factions to the palestinian movement  are represented  the congress was recently enlarged from 187 seats to give additional representative to independents and the so called palestinian diaspora  that is  those palestinians who have moved to other countries  the dominant group is still the al fatah guerrilla organization led by arafat  which has about 45 per cent of the seats  the pro syrian saiqa group under zoheir mohsen  the plo military commander  his 15 seats  other important blocs are the militant rejection front guerrilla organizations led by george habash of the popular front of the liberation of palestine  and worker and student groups  some seats are expected to be left vacant   those allocated to palestinians living in the israeli occupied west bank and the gaza strip  palestinian sources say that even if these members were allowed to attend by israel  the leadership discouraged them from coming out of fear they might not be allowed to return home    .

      by jonathon c  r and    al     november 1  1979  iraq served notice today that it was withdrawing from its 1975 peace agreement with iran that ended three years of border hostilities  the move reflected seriously deteriorating relations between the two moslem neighbors  as well as baghdad s unease about sectarian religious dissent both at home and in other arab nations  analysts here suggested iraq was seeking to press its relative advantage against troubled iran as revenge for the 1975 accord  when shah mohammad reza pahlavi extracted a high price for ending the kurdish conflict  which was undermining bagdad s authority  in addition to further undermining regional stability  increasing tensions between iran and iraq could seriously threaten a major portion of the world s oil supply  iran s oil producing region is inhabited largely by arabs who are subject to appeals from iraq  while iraq has a large population of shiite moslems whose loyalties constantly are being tested by iran s militant shiite clergy  a major recurring theme among international oil analysts  is a serious disruption of supply caused by worsening relations between iran and iraq  the iraqi move    in a statement released to a newspaper here  a traditional conduit for major arab world pronouncements also underscored tensions with other neighbors  it revealed  in additions an apparent desire to thwart syrian and palestinian mediation efforts aimed at smoothing over misunderstandings between iran and other arab states and indicated the baghdad government s return to its classic odd man out role in arab politics  iraqi ambassador abdel hussein muslim hassan told the independent  daily an nahar that iran should  immediately  grant self rule to its volatile arab  baluchi and kurdish minorities  withdraw from three key persian gulf islands and return to entire shatt al arab esturary to iraq  p under the march  1975 algiers accord  iraq granted iran half of the long disputed estuary  which leads 120 miles from the persian gulf to the confluence of the tigris and euphrates rivers  the two signatories also agreed to define other common borders and stop supporting subversion within the other state  that undertaking ended american  iranian and israeli aid to the late mullah mustafa barzani s rebellion in iraqi kurdistan  which soon thereafter collapsed  the demands in the statement published in an nahar  and the suggestion that iran  voluntarily  agree to the amendments therefore  effectively gut the agreement  the short lived reconciliation between the warring baath party governments in iraq and syria collapsed this summer after less than a year  damascus propaganda resumed its old accusations that baghdad had sold out arab interests in the 1975 accord  relations between iraq and the shiite moslem clergy that now rules iran began deteriorating in the fall of 1978  when baghdad forced ayatollah ruhollah khomeini to leave his iraqi exile in the holy city of najjaf  the ayatollah replaced the shah in february this year  in recent months  relations have declined further as baghdad and tehran have accused each other of arming and otherwise encouraging their respective kurds to revolt  and khomeini s government has backed the shah s controversial 1971 occupation of the arab islands of abu musa and greater and lesser tumb near the strategic straits of hormuz  an estimated 60 percent of the noncommunist world s oil passes through the area  before the 1975 agreement  baghdad claimed iran s oil producing khuzestan province  which originally was populated exclusively by arabs and which the iraqis called arabestan  support for the baluchis  split between southeastern iran and southwestern pakistan  was also a standard pre 1975 baghdad policy  also behind the iraqi move was increasing uneasiness of the sunni moslem government in baghdad in dealing with its shiite moslem majority ever since khomeini came to power  there has been shiite unrest in kuwait and bahrain  which also have sunni minority governments  prompting fears    not only in baghdad    that khomeini aspired to export his shiite led revolution  shiite riots in june were said to have helped prompt iraqi strongman saddam hussein to oust president ahmed hassan bakr and purge leading party and government officials the following month  low level urban guerrilla activity by shiite dissidents has been reported in and around baghdad and other iraqi cities  new president hussein s espousal of such nationalist iraqi themes such as the return of all the shatt al arab  backing for the khuzistan arabs and an end of iran s occupation of the three islands appear aimed at widening his power base  his seeming adoption of the  best defense is an offense  policy toward iran has led him  according to specialists  to encourage the presence of some of the shah s former generals    and former ambassador to washington ardeshir zahedi    in the border area  many of the shah s pretorian guard    the so called javidan  or  immortals     were kurds and the high officers  reported presence in the border area was thought to be connected with anti khomeini activity  analysts were struck by the rapidity of the iraqi government s return to its traditional go it alone attitude  only a year ago iraq reversed a decade of isolation by offering to end its feud with syria and cooperate with other arab governments in an effort to offset a separate peace between egypt and israel  but saddam hussein s master plan soon came undone  contributing factors were the iranian revolution  the iranian kurds  uprising  and the ensuing nervousness about shiite unrest    .

      by  karen deyoung          karen deyoung associate editor and senior national security correspondent  email  bio  follow         may 14  1983  nestled at the edge of san jose s bustling international airport  two hangars house a half dozen small propeller planes and a two seater bubble helicopter  on the grass outside  partially overgrown by weeds and clearly long disabled  a camouflage painted sikorsky chopper lies on its belly   welcome to the headquarters of the air force of costa rica   information minister armando vargas says solemnly  just before breaking into a laugh  government officials here seem to take pride in exposing their country s military weakness  from its handful of unarmed aircraft and four boat navy to the poorly equipped 6 000 man police force that is constitutionally barred from turning itself into an army  but after 35 years of relatively peaceful existence as a regional anomaly  with a stable democracy and no declared internal or external enemies  costa rica is finding it increasingly difficult to remain aloof from the bloody conflicts sweeping the rest of the isthmus  a longtime avid and often amused observer of political strife in neighboring nicaragua  costa rica now sees the problems immediately across its northern border and beyond as a threat to its own political system  its fragile economy and the image of international neutrality it has cultivated carefully for decades  nicaragua s sandinista government has charged that escalating attacks along its southern frontier led by exiled guerrilla hero eden pastora have been launched from inside costa rican territory  while officials here issue public denials  they acknowledge privately that they have little control over rebel activity and note the difficulty of stopping a movement that has widespread public support in costa rica  in the capital  rival representatives from countless factions in the various central american wars gather in freedom to plot and plan and hold press conferences  leading to charges that costa rica condones their actions  despite its gratitude and continuing desperate need for u s  economic aid  the government visibly winces each time the reagan administration loudly proclaims that costa rica shares its concern and supports its policies in the region  as a result  officials here said  longtime democratic friends in western europe and latin america  whose help also is needed  have begun snubbing san jose as they see the long arm of washington draped around costa rica s shoulder   we feel a little bit alone   president luis alberto monge said in an interview   in what he described as an act of near desperation and critics inevitably called a response to u s  pressure to involve other nations in its anti sandinista campaign  monge has called for a multinational latin american force to oversee costa rica s border with nicaragua and certify its neutrality  the effort has been met with suspicion and a thinly veiled reluctance to help   we are not prepared for a situation of this magnitude   information minister vargas said   but we don t want to be  either  we don t want to fall into the trap of creating another power base here  by reestablishing the army disbanded by law a quarter century ago   the nicaraguan problem is a problem inside nicaragua  of nicaraguans fighting nicaraguans   vargas said   at this time of economic crisis for us  costa rica does not want to be involved   yet  whether its government likes it or not  costa rica is involved in nicaragua s problems  for reasons of geography  of history and the clear desire of many of its own people to play a role  one of the first challenges to the newly pacifist costa rica during the early 1950s was an attempt by a disgruntled would be president to overthrow the government here with the help of nicaraguan dictator anastasio somoza garcia  the father of the man the sandinistas ultimately ousted  by the time the sandinistas were ready to make their move against the son  beginning in 1978  costa ricans were only too happy to lend their territory and their support to the effort   we were the ones who gave them guns   said public security minister angel eduardo solano   it was here that the planes landed with arms  they would have been nowhere without us   but if there is one thing costa ricans dislike as much as they did the somozas  it is communism  once the sandinistas veered to the left with cuban help  solano said  costa ricans felt  betrayed   the troubles inside nicaragua coincided with costa rica s worsening economy and a series of strikes and political pressures from the domestic left that many here believed were at least encouraged by cuba and the sandinistas themselves  when monge assumed office one year ago  costa rica was officially in a state of crisis  as washington quickly came to his aid  monge soon became one of the reagan administration s most visible friends among latin american democracies  while not exactly echoing the adminstration position on nicaragua  costa rica rarely disagreed   of course you re going to be nice to someone who s going to give you millions of dollars   former president daniel oduber said  yet he and monge agreed that no costa rican president could survive domestically on an anti american platform   costa rica is basically a pro yankee country   oduber said   perhaps the only one truly so in all of latin america   it is only recently  however  that the cost of such closeness has begun to approach the benefits  monge said he does not share washington s belief that the mere existence of a marxist government in nicaragua poses a threat to regional stability  if the sandinistas would behave  he said  costa rica would be  prepared for peaceful coexistence with a neighbor that has a different philosophy   costa rican officials insist that despite an antipathy toward the sandinistas and a fear of leftist expansionism  they truly want to remain as uninvolved as possible with u s  security strategy in the region   the responsibilities and interest of the united states are different from those of costa rica   monge said  he has offered san jose as a site for u s  opposed open dialogue between el salvador s beleaguered government and its guerrilla opponents  at the same time  at the end of his first year in office  monge has succeeded to a large degree in stabilizing the costa rican economy  the strikes and subversion here have largely ceased  due in the eyes of many officials to costa rica s pledge to stay out of central

     sean hannity of fox news during the conservative political action conference on march 4  2016  in national harbor  md   carolyn kaster ap            by  erik wemple          erik wemple media critic with a focus on the ups and downs and downs of the cable news industry    email  bio  follow         media critic  june 21  2018    peril comes with taking up a position in today s polemical trenches alongside a man with no convictions  in keeping with president trump s hard line on immigration  attorney general jeff sessions in april launched a  zero tolerance  policy vis a vis  criminal illegal entry   noted sessions   to those who wish to challenge the trump administration s commitment to public safety  national security  and the rule of law  i warn you  illegally entering this country will not be rewarded  but will instead be met with the full prosecutorial powers of the department of justice   omitted from the justice department announcement was its core ugliness  the spike in prosecutions  as it turns  out would necessitate the separation of children and parents at the border  with about 2 000 kids so yanked between april 19 and the end of may  once the backlash surged  so did the gaslighting  homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen claimed there was no policy to separate families  that  congress alone  could fix the matter  white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders spoke over and over again about following the law  which brings us to sean hannity  the fox news host who appears to seesaw between parroting the white house line and dictating it  hannity is known as the president s  shadow chief of staff   and a man reaches that exalted perch only via skill  look  for instance  at how hannity maneuvered through this week s awkward events  when criticism of the family separation policy was peaking earlier this week  hannity lashed back at the critics by saying such things as   as i said earlier  no one likes the idea of separating any child from any parent  but this issue has been in the hands of congress  and right now  the whole issue can be fixed  every law can be changed  and if they did their job  it would happen  it is the law   and   fix the law   everyone who had stuck a neck out for the trump sessions act of inhumanity   i e   nielsen  sanders  hannity  corey lewandowski  among many others   found themselves exposed on wednesday  when trump signed an executive order that backpedaled   we re going to have strong   very strong   borders  but we are going to keep the families together  i didn t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated   said trump  while many of the policy s defenders can duck the media spotlight for a few days  hannity has no such luxury  he hosts a weeknight program on fox news  and his ratings are the envy of his competition  accordingly  this man has to find the least intrusive  the most logical sounding  the most plausibly specious way of disappearing his previous remarks and replacing them with a brand new defense of the president  that genius was fully engaged on wednesday night  as hannity offered these words about the executive order   and earlier today   by the way  the president has been saying it all week  the president addressed this important issue  and he signed an executive order undoing their damage and ensuring that illegal immigrant families would be kept intact  by the way  not his law  he didn t pass it  congress did  another president signed it  but he fixed it        if you re a hannity viewer  and you missed the justice department policy announcement or the hundreds of fact checking stories on just who caused this crisis  you might suppose that the family separation policy fell from the scorching skies of the southwest onto the vast u s  mexico border  and there it sat  awaiting a  fix  from the president  elsewhere in his rant on the matter  hannity continued casting the impression that the scandal was purely legislative   by the way  what donald trump signed today  let me be blunt  it ll last five minutes in a courtroom before it s thrown out  but at least gives congress time to do their job   he said  the contortions showcased on  hannity  aren t an isolated or accidental phenomenon  they re programmatic  not to mention unconscionable  earlier this week  the general tenor of fox news prime time apologism for trump s immigration policies caught the attention of hollywood types working with fox news s corporate sibling  in response to a tweet highlighting fox news host tucker carlson s argument that people should believe the opposite of what mainstream outlets are reporting   family guy  creator seth macfarlane riffed   in other words  don t think critically  don t consult multiple news sources  and in general  don t use your brain  just blindly obey fox news  this is fringe  stuff   and it s business like this that makes me embarrassed to work for this company   antagonism from members of the hollywood elite  of course  can only delight people such as hannity  carlson and laura ingraham  the other main feature in fox news s prime time opinion block  in cable news  ratings justify everything  and fox news opinionators won t imperil their standing with the backbone of the trump plume  and that particular demographic cares a great deal about immigration  as voter surveys have concluded  per the atlantic   contrary to popular narratives  only a small portion just 27 percent of white working class voters said they favor a policy of identifying and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally  among the people who did share this belief  trump was wildly popular  87 percent of them supported the president in the 2016 election   we don t know for sure how many of those folks watch fox news   probably a great  great number  we do know  however  that carlson  hannity and ingraham fashion their presentations with them in mind  in her remarks this week  ingraham referred to the facilities holding separated children as  summer camps   hannity grasped for any stray talking point to deflect from the president s culpability  carlson earlier this year shouted down the president when he appeared to go a bit wobbly on immigration   signals to the trump white house that if you want to get even more extreme on this policy area  your cheerleaders on cable news remain with you  no one nourishes white cultural anxiety like this crew    .

aliens   who come from countries with known ties to terrorists or where terrorist groups thrive  those arrested include afghans  iranians  iraqis  syrians  libyans and pakistanis  in all  immigrants from 35 countries in asia and the middle east have been arrested over the past few years in the rio grande valley  the department says there is no known intelligence that specifically links undocumented immigrants to terrorism plots  but the authors warn it s almost certain that foreign terrorist organizations know of the porous border between the u s  and mexico   it is important to note that an unsecure border is a vulnerability that can be exploited by criminals of all kinds   vinger said   and it would be naive to rule out the possibility that any criminal organizations around the world  including terrorists  would not look for opportunities to take advantage of security gaps along our country s international border   even without the threat of foreign terrorists making their way across the border  texas law enforcement officials say seven of the eight major mexican drug cartels operate throughout texas  those cartels have sent assassins as far north as the dallas fort worth area to commit murders  and the drug trade is thriving  the cartels are also branching into sex trafficking  which can present a lower risk and yield a higher profit than the drug trade  the report says  law enforcement officials have uncovered major trafficking rings operating in texas  georgia  mississippi  alabama  louisiana  tennessee and several east coast cities  almost all human smuggling rings have ties to the mexican drug cartels  the report found  and in many cases undocumented immigrants are kept locked in small  confined spaces where they go days without food or water  law enforcement officials found one  stash house  in the houston area crammed with 115 illegal immigrants  the report says the gulf  zeta  juarez and sinaloa cartels have the most prominent footprints in texas  officials are also worried about the growing influence of ms 13  the salvadoran gang that originated in los angeles  the cartels have been  effective in corrupting u s  law enforcement officials at all levels   the dps report says  but the surge of texas dps officers  national guard troops and other law enforcement officials  ordered by then gov  rick perry  r  last june  has worked to stem last year s flood of undocumented immigrants crossing into the rio grande valley   gov  perry to send national guard troops to mexican border amid migrant crisis  border officials apprehended 313 000 immigrants in fy 2014  nearly three times the number caught in fy 2011  in recent months  that number has diminished significantly  the report said the number of arrests per week had fallen from a high of about 6 000 to around 2 000  the surge has also led to the seizure of more than  1 8 billion worth of cartel drugs  or about 150 tons of marijuana  588 pounds of cocaine and 320 pounds of methamphetamines  cartels have shifted marijuana trafficking west  from mcallen to the small towns of escobares and roma  the cartels are sending scouts to watch u s  border patrol officers  and they believe the texas border surge will end soon  once the money runs out  according to intelligence collected by the department of public safety  it is not without costs  dps said the state and national guard have spent more than  102 million deploying troops and officers and bolstering surveillance capabilities  the state has already installed 1 224 surveillance cameras along the border  and another 4 000 cameras will be installed in the coming months  fully securing the border would require the constant presence of an incredible number of troops   as many as 76 000  the report found  this summer  the surge sent about 1 000 national guard soldiers to the border    .

june 18  2018    the administration did not have the nerve to put the vice president or any cabinet official out on the sunday shows to defend its  zero tolerance  policy and the result mass separation of children from their families at the border  you did not see stephen miller out there  nor the white house official who told the post that it was a great idea to use kids to extract immigration concessions from congress  instead  the administration sent out counselor to the president kellyanne conway  a woman who has demonstrated time and time again she will say anything   no matter how preposterous   to defend this president  her performance   and that is what we should call it   on  meet the press  was stunningly disingenuous  she shed crocodile tears for the immigrant kids and invoked her own catholicism to demonstrate how concerned she was about the children her boss is snatching away from the arms of their parents  she blamed the democrats  the courts and even  lack of money  this cowardly non defense suggests that she knows the policy is wrong but hasn t the nerve to call for its end   chuck todd  is the president ready to make that phone call to the attorney general  to  the department of homeland security   to stop this policy  conway  the president is ready to get meaningful immigration reform across the board  and chuck  let me just tell you that nobody likes seeing babies ripped from their mothers  arms  from their mothers  wombs  frankly  but we have to make sure that dhs s laws are understood through the soundbite culture that we live in    these loopholes are allowing open border policies  i think what the president is saying is if the democrats are serious  they ll come together again and try to close these loopholes and get real immigration reform  todd  so it sounds like  and this is going to sound harsh  but it sounds like you re holding these kids hostage    to get the democrats to the table to pass some law  you just laid out   a very compassionate case for   conway  well  i certainly don t agree with that  todd        but it s not very empathetic   the most traumatic things to do to a kid  separate them from their parents once they ve made that traumatic journey  why do that right now  i understand we have an immigration debate going on in this country  why use these kids as leverage  conway  well  i certainly don t want anybody to use these kids as leverage   evasion  denial and blame shifting  you d think she didn t work in the white house and couldn t tell her boss to reverse course  bizarrely  homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen claimed   we do not have a policy of separating families at the border  period   if only conway knew that when she ineptly tried to defend the indefensible policy  melania trump made a rare effort to weigh in on a policy issue   mrs  trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform   a statement from her spokeswoman read   she believes we need to be a country that follows all laws  but also a country that governs with heart   we actually don t need  both sides  to come together  president trump instituted a zero tolerance policy and has continued to carry out child separations with ruthless efficiency  if he needs new funding  his republican allies control congress  so what is the problem here  al cardenas  a longtime republican donor and strategist  let loose on the gop after conway s horrifying performance on  meet the press    i m a refugee  i came to america  i experienced it  the pain  the heartbreak of a child about that experience will never go away in their lifetime  and to justify that by saying they have a clean bed and food is   is such a cruel comment regarding what s going on with the children and their hearts and their parents  i will debunk two myths or lies from the white house right now  number one  things are not the same as before on two areas  number one  office of refugee resettlement  before this white house changed the rules  they would be the ones that would intake these children  they would interview  most of these children had relatives here  mostly undocumented  and they would turn the children over to these relatives  the president of the united states changed it and gave ice  immigration and customs enforcement  the jurisdiction that the office of refugee resettlement for decades has had         and the second policy that s really all here  the president has total authority to deal with the separation of children  and so all of those arguments are fallacious  in the meantime  we ve had more than 2 000 children separated in just a few weeks  that s deplorable  it s wrong  and this thing needs to get fixed   it was left to former first lady laura bush to make the most stirring and convincing case against the trump policy   i appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries  but this zero tolerance policy is cruel  it is immoral  and it breaks my heart   she wrote in an op ed for the post   our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert outside of el paso  these images are eerily reminiscent of the japanese american internment camps of world war ii  now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in u s  history  we also know that this treatment inflicts trauma  interned japanese have been two times as likely to suffer cardiovascular disease or die prematurely than those who were not interned   the problem is that republicans have become so invested in anti immigrant furor that they cannot stop  even if they wind up humiliating themselves and doing real political damage to the party  rick santorum   mr  family values   appearing on cnn blamed the parents  they shouldn t have come  he intoned  first  these are desperate people who in many cases are escaping violence and potential death  second  it is not acceptable for a decent and humane country to visit the sins of the parent on the child  we are responsible for that child   morally required to  at the very least  not traumatize him or her for life  as with so many of his scandals and outrages  trump doesn t want to accept blame for his own decisions  here  there should be no doubt that he could stop child separation  but he won t  americans regardless of party should speak with one voice  enough     .
      mr  obama  tear down this wall    sam hodgson bloomberg news        by  max ehrenfreund          max ehrenfreund reporter  bio  follow         november 10  2014  the berlin wall wasn t just an ugly symbol of communist oppression in eastern europe and russia  for the people who lived behind it  the wall s  practical significance was that it stopped them from leaving their homes and seeking a better life in the west  protesters in berlin breached the wall 25 years ago    on  nov  9  1989    which might seem like a long time ago  but barriers to migration    both legal and physical    are still keeping people in developing countries poor  while posing a real  long term risk to the economies of rich countries  several economists have made this point forcefully in the past few days  tyler cowen argues that in poor countries where the population is projected to grow enormously in the next few decades  the only way people will have enough to get by is if they can move to wealthier parts of the world  meanwhile  as the fertility rate falls in the developed world and the population ages  those countries will have to rely on young migrants from elsewhere to avoid a lasting decline in their economic vitality  the argument for open borders goes beyond self interest  tim harford notes how unfair it is  that that someone s nationality is the most important factor in his or her chances in life  the differences between countries are much greater than the differences within them  mcdonald s employees in the united states make 10 times what they would make doing the same jobs in india  as eric posner and glen weyl note  the poorest americans    those making  3 000 or  4 000 a year    are doing better than three in five people around the world  at least in terms of dollars  a real commitment to fairness  posner and weyl argue  means giving people in poor countries an opportunity to move to richer ones  frustrated crowds looking for barriers made of cement and wire to topple won t always find them  but here are five places that could benefit from the crumbling of  walls  around the world   japan  thecountry could use more liberal immigration policies probably more than any other developed nation  but an antipathy toward immigrations and the pacific ocean keep migrants out more effectively than any wall  given those policies and the country s low birthrates  it s no surprise that the nation s economy has been near stagnant for so long  australia  theislandnation has also taken drastic measures to stop migrants from coming ashore  the country built a detention center in the heart of the jungle on christmas island  hundreds of miles northwest of the mainland at a cost of  370 million    an enormously expensive project to detain around 1 200 people  european union migrants from all over africa cross the mediterranean to seek asylum in the eu on the italian island of lampedusa  last year  the island made headlines when hundreds of people drowned after a overburdened boat bound for the island from the libyan coast caught fire and capsized  then again  there are still places where old fashioned walls do matter  take the spanish enclave of melilla in north africa  where migrants climb fences to cross europe s political boundary  or the eight mile fence greece built along its narrow border with turkey  united states  the u s  maintains a southern fence of about 650 miles  even though just as many mexicans are returning home as are immigrating  tearing down this particular wall might be too bold a measure  but immigration reform could provide a nice boost to america s economy   as the u s  example shows  reforming immigration laws can be difficult politically  posner and weyl s unpleasant suggestion is that policymakers in rich countries seek a compromise with opponents of immigration  as qatar does  they could allow in more workers without extending legal protections to them  it s an idea worth considering  at least  given how much there is to gain from immigration for everyone involved  this is all easier said than done  china isn t eager for north koreans to immigrate en masse across their border  even if pyongyang would let them  in israel and the palestinian territories  concerns about economic freedom are an afterthought given the intensity and intricacy of the conflict there  a border crisis was what finally forced germany s two halves back together in 1989  east germans were leaving illegally in droves through neighboring countries  and demonstrators pulled down the wall after east german officials fumbled their response  following reunification  east germans took advantage of their newfound freedom to move west by the millions    a mass migration that continued until very recently  that s not counting all those in the rest of the soviet bloc who left after the end of communism  especially after some countries joined the european union  per capita income in east germany has more than doubled since reunification  as the economist reports  almost every east german home now has central heating  compared to only three in five under communism  standards of living have improved in the west as well  to be sure  those changes are largely due to the end of soviet planning  not just to emigration from eastern germany  still  the economic case for immigration is as strong today as it was in 1989  the easier it is to cross a border  the better off are the people who live on both sides of it     migrants cross into spanish melilla last month   jose palazon osma afp photo prodein

          window havepowaboot true            by  jennifer rubin          jennifer rubin opinion writer covering politics and policy  foreign and domestic  email  bio  follow         opinion writer  february 26  2018    the post reports   the supreme court on monday declined to enter the national controversy over  dreamers   turning down the trump administration s request to immediately review lower court decisions that keep in place the program that protects undocumented immigrants brought here as children from deportation    federal district judges in california and new york have issued nationwide injunctions against ending the program  siding with states and organizations challenging the administration s rescission  the court orders effectively block the trump administration from ending the program on march 5  as planned  no appellate court has reviewed those decisions  and it would have been exceedingly rare for the supreme court to take up a case without that interim step  in the past  the court has granted such cases only in matters of grave national importance  such as the controversy over president richard nixon s white house tapes or solving the iranian hostage crisis   it bears repeating that this is not a decision on the merits  appellate courts can lift the injunctions at any time  even before a ruling on the merits  at best it is a momentary pause for beneficiaries of the deferred action for childhood arrivals  daca  program  as well as for congress and president trump  trump and the anti immigrant far right took a victory lap when the president s veto threat helped quash the only viable bill to provide relief for the dreamers  now  however  they face a political nightmare  if they do nothing and the court injunctions lift  they ll be faced with the prospect that the midterms will come amidst poignant scenes of family separation  just like the teenagers from parkland  fla   have demolished the national rifle association s media spin  sympathetic dreamers who have spent virtually their whole lives in the united states will be on tv nonstop describing their contributions to america and their loyalty to this country  it s one more political nightmare  especially for republicans running in states such as nevada  florida  california and arizona  where mobilized hispanic voters can deliver knockout punches to the anti daca party  barring a miraculous conversion of house and senate republicans  the only solution that seems possible with gop majorities in the house and senate is a temporary fix  republicans cannot drive too hard a bargain without running the risk of setting off the deportation nightmare  they also know that after november  there may be a democratic majority in one or both houses  therefore  it s in their interest to strike a deal now  one path would be for trump  who started the entire debacle by rescinding daca  to extend the deadline  sure  attorney general jeff sessions claimed daca was unconstitutional  but if it was nevertheless constitutional for the administration to let the program run through march 5  2018  why not march 5  2019  or 2020  trump can claim to be the great savior and also spare his party a pr disaster  alternatively  congress could put together a temporary fix  the hill reports   sen  jeff flake  r ariz   is in talks with sen  heidi heitkamp  d n d   about a plan to tie a three year extension of protections for deferred action for childhood arrivals  daca  recipients with roughly  7 6 billion in border security   i can promise that i ll be back on the floor  again and again  motioning for a vote until we pass a bill providing relief for those struggling due to our inaction   flake said  outlining his plan   procrastination   like serial continuing resolutions   has become a favorite tactic for a dysfunctional white house and inept congress   a temporary daca fix is our only option for this congress   says cato institute s alex nowrasteh  who favors a plan to legalize dreamers   it kicks the legislative can down the road but at least it doesn t kick 700 000 people out of the country   the temporary patch won t satisfy immigration activists  but it seems to be the least horrible alternative   in a world where congress functions in the interest of the american people  we would have a permanent solution for border security and for dreamers  sadly  that is not the world we live in   ali noorani of the national immigration forum tells me   it seems likely the most the legislative market can bear is a temporary solution for dreamers and the border  while we hope congress can get to a permanent fix  a three year patch brings stability to worksites and homes   a temporary deal also would spare trump from a confrontation with his anti immigrant base  he could then claim the border money was effectively a  down payment  on the wall  or something like that   nevertheless  even a short term fix is no slam dunk  frank sharry  who heads the progressive  pro immigration group america s voice  tells me   i wish i could be optimistic but i m not  even a two  or three year extension for current daca recipients requires republican leaders to grow a backbone and trump to release the hostages   he adds   i m not holding my breath   the gop has revealed that its anti immigrant contingent has a stranglehold on the party  whether the gop is prepared to court political disaster to satisfy that contingent remains to be seen  read more by jennifer rubin  the nra is losing its grip   on reality and on politicians don t hire relatives  kushner should have been gone long ago distinguished persons of the week  they re ahead of the politicians on guns and more democratic memo discredits nunes  tantalizes on dossier corroboration maybe rick gates can shed some light   .
