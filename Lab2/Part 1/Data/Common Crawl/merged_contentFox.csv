(“The Late Show”)Stephen Colbert, the host of “The Late Show,” on Monday tore into President Trump for “folding like an origami swan” in negotiations over funding for his long-promised border wall, and said the president is threatening another shutdown and making the same demands.Colbert cited a Wall Street Journal report that quoted the president saying he doubts that he’d accept anything short of the $5.7 billion for the wall in about three weeks.CAPITOL ATTITUDE: Why Democrats are unlikely to budge on next round of border security negotiations""So, just to be clear,"" Colbert said during his monologue. ""He’s making the exact same offer, backed by the exact same threat, but somehow he expects different results. Well, you know what they say, the definition of insanity is Donald Trump.""Colbert was making a play on the famous quote most commonly associated with Albert Einstein, ""The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results."""

Automakers submit their own internal results for approval, and the agency only spot-checks 10 to 15 percent of them with its own evaluations. However, diesel vehicles like the Ram 3500 have been targeted for increased scrutiny after several automakers, including Fiat Chrysler, have been cited for emissions violations in recent years.Heavy Duty trucks account for over a quarter of Ram’s pickup sales, and the automaker is hoping to leverage the buzz created by the Ram 3500’s segment-leading 35,100-pound towing rating before General Motors introduces its new updated HD models later in the year.GM confirmed to the newspaper that a number of its 2020 models are also being held up by the EPA process, but declined to reveal which ones.Ford would not comment on the topic."

          Federal investigators declined for over a decade to investigate consumer complaints about General Motors vehicles that turned off while being driven due to faulty ignition switches, a new report suggests.The New York Times reported Sunday that an analysis done by the paper showed that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) received 267 complaints about the sudden vehicle shutdowns between February 2003 and March 6 of this year, but repeatedly said that there was not enough evidence of a problem to warrant an investigation.The faulty ignition switches, which can shut off engines and power systems as well as disable air bags, have been linked to 13 fatal accidents by GM. The Times reported that GM's own reports to the agency noted that the cars included in last month's recall had been involved in 78 deaths and 1,581 injuries, though it was not clear how many of those could be linked to the flawed ignition system.The Times noted that its analysis of complaints was limited to those about cars suddenly stalling, and did not take into account complaints about other possible ignition-tied problems, including inability to start and stop the engine or loss of power steering.On February 13, GM announced the recall of more than 780,000 Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s (model years 2005-2007). Two weeks later it added 842,000 Saturn Ion compacts (2003-2007), and Chevrolet HHR SUVs, Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars (2006-2007).Earlier this week, the NHTSA gave GM until April 3 to hand over all documents related to the recall to determine if the automaker delayed its response to the issue or withheld information. If it determines either situation to be the case, the agency could fine GM up to $35 million. GM has admitted that it was aware of the potential issue a decade ago, but continued producing the vehicles without addressing it. Automakers are required to inform NHTSA of safety defects within five days of discovering them.GM says a heavy key ring or jarring from rough roads can cause the ignition switch in those vehicles to move out of the run position and shut off the engine and electrical power. That can knock out power-assisted brakes and steering and disable the front air bags. In the fatalities, the air bags did not inflate, but the engines did not shut off in all cases, GM said.Click for more from The New York Times"

          (The Associated Press)Sadly, this is CNN.CNN personalities already blame virtually everything on President Trump and now the network has floated a theory that the earth could be jeopardized by an asteroid because of the government shutdown -- but don't worry, experts have already dubunked the fake news.CNN correspondent Tom Foreman said on ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" that NASA could potentially stop monitoring asteroids during the shutdown.“A big one, by the way, is expected to brush by Earth on February 4,” Foreman said on Friday's show.He explained that this occurred back in 2013 during the Obama administration when the government last shut down. “For more than two weeks, NASA reportedly stopped monitoring potentially dangerous asteroids,” he said. Foreman might not be the best when it comes to measuring things, as he said the anticipated asteroid will “brush by earth,” but it will actually be roughly 2.6 million miles away, according to Space.com.“NASA representatives say there's no chance that it will collide with Earth,” Space.com reported.Center for Near-Earth-Object Studies at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory Paul Chodas told the site, which bills itself as “the premier source of space exploration, innovation and astronomy news,” that the asteroid CNN hyped “has no chance -- zero -- of colliding with Earth on Feb. 4 or any time over the next 100 years.""CNN’s attempt to create a sense of panic was mocked by conservative news organizations such as Breitbart and TheBlaze, while some supermarket tabloids have joined CNN in sensationalizing the asteroid.“You aren’t hearing things.

          PANAMA CITY – Pope Francis insisted Thursday that public officials live simply, honestly and transparently as he opened a visit to a Central America that has been rife with corruption scandals and is now coping with political upheaval in nearby Venezuela.Francis didn't mention the Venezuela crisis during his first remarks in Panama after a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela at the presidential palace. But his spokesman said he was following the situation closely, was praying for the Venezuelan people and supported ""all efforts that help save the population from further suffering.""Francis stuck to his script in Panama, celebrating the country's place as bridge between oceans and cultures and holding up the region's newest saint, slain Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero, as a model for a humble church that accompanies the poor.POPE FRANCIS LAUNCHES 'CLICK TO PRAY' APP AHEAD OF WORLD YOUTH DAYHe welcomed tens of thousands of young people to World Youth Day, the Catholic Church's big youth rally, and urged them to be builders of bridges of encounter, not ""builders of walls that sow fear and look to divide and box people in,"" a clear reference to the proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall.But he warned that those same young people are increasingly demanding that public officials live lives that are coherent with the jobs entrusted to them, and build a ""culture of greater transparency"" between the public and private sectors.""They call upon them to live in simplicity and transparency, with a clear sense of responsibility for others and for our world,"" Francis told Varela and other Panamanian leaders. ""To lead a life that demonstrates that public service is a synonym of honesty and justice, and opposed to all forms of corruption.""Transparency International estimates that as much as 1 percent of Panama's GDP, approximately US$600 million, may have been lost to various corruption schemes during the presidency of Ricardo Martinelli, who governed Panama from 2009 to 2014. Martinelli was extradited to Panama last year from the United States to face political espionage and embezzlement charges.In addition, two of Martinelli's sons have been detained in the U.S. and are being sought on corruption charges in Panama. They are suspected of receiving more than $50 million in ""undue payments"" from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht, which is at the center of one of the largest graft scandals in history.NEW YORK 'CELEBRATES' LEGALIZING ABORTION UNTIL BIRTH AS CATHOLIC BISHOPS QUESTION CUOMO'S FAITHOdebrecht has acknowledged paying nearly $800 million dollars in bribes in a dozen Latin American nations in return for favors and works contracts.That includes at least $59 million in Panama, although authorities say the real figure is likely much higher. In addition to the Martinelli sons, the scandal has already implicated former government ministers under the elder Martinelli as well as people linked to the party of the current president, Varela.The Martinelli family has denied involvement by the sons in the bribery scandal and alleges persecution by political foes. The former president also denies any wrongdoing and says he is being targeted politically.Francis' visit is taking place against the backdrop of both the turmoil in Venezuela and the ongoing migrant standoff in the United States, where the government is partly shut down over President Donald Trump's demand for congressional funding for a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.History's first Latin American pope, who was born to Italian immigrants to Argentina, has made the plight of migrants a cornerstone of his papacy and denounced how fear of migrants was driving populist and nationalist sentiment across the globe.Speaking Thursday to Central American bishops, Francis urged church institutions from dioceses down to individual parishes to welcome and integrate migrants and serve as models for the rest of society to overcome fears of foreigners. And he urged them to look to Romero as inspiration for being a humble church that listens to the poor and accompanies them as a father accompanies his children.Francis said that young people today have few opportunities and face dangerous, difficult challenges, citing ""domestic violence, the killing of women - our continent is experiencing a plague in this regard - armed gangs and criminals, drug trafficking, the sexual exploitation of minors and young people, and so on.""Francis has frequently urged young people to resist easy temptations of drug dealing and gang membership, and to especially avoid the lure of corruption. It is a message that will likely resonate with the youth of the region.

      Transparency International's latest index of perceived corruption ranks the entire Central American region poorly, with the exception of Costa Rica. Panama ranked 96 out of 180 countries surveyed globally in 2017, better than many in the region including Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, but still far from clean.In Guatemala, President Jimmy Morales has hamstrung the U.N.-sponsored International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, which has pushed many high-profile investigations that have swept up politicians, public officials and businesspeople during its decade-plus of existence.In El Salvador, former President Mauricio Funes is wanted for alleged corruption and is currently a fugitive granted asylum with several family members in Nicaragua. Another ex-president, Tony Saca, was sentenced in September to 10 years for embezzlement and money laundering.In Honduras, former President Porfirio Lobo's wife has been suspected of diverting $700,000 in public funds and his brother accused of pocketing about $300,000 in government money. His son Fabio was sentenced in the United States to 24 years for drug trafficking.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"

          The owner of the bakery said he was only trying to be funny and doesn't even support a border wall himself.
          (KING-TV via AP)A Washington baker who found himself at the center of controversy late last week says he was only trying to be funny when writing “Build That Wall” on one of his Valentine’s Day cookies.Ken Bellingham, who owns Edmonds Bakery in Edmonds, Wash., says he began getting complaints after photos of the item – a heart-shaped cookie with white icing spelling out the phrase – was shared to Facebook.RESTAURANT OWNER 'SHOCKED' BY ANTI-IMMIGRANT MESSAGE ALLEGEDLY WRITTEN ON RECEIPT“People were just going off [but] they don’t know anything about me,” Bellingham told KING-TV. “And yet, I was supposedly this horrible person.”Bellingham told the outlet he only wrote the phrase on one cookie that was placed into his display case, alongside other “risqué” cookies, some of which feature phrases such as “Sweet Heart” or “Addicted to Love.”“I try to be funny,” he said.
(KING-TV via AP)A customer who spotted the cookies, however, didn’t think it was appropriate to make light of the subject in the first place, and told KING-TV that it feels the phrase is too often used by “white supremacists” and “the alt-right.”Bellingham said someone else even called for a boycott following the backlash.FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWSThe bakery owner has since apologized and further claimed that building a border wall is “not anything” he would endorse, anyway.“I don’t think building a wall is going to solve our problems,” he told the station.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

(Warner Bros.)One of the most legendary cars in Hollywood history may have been found after nearly 50 years.The 1968 classic “Bullitt” had two stars in it: Steve McQueen and his Highland Green 1968 Mustang GT. A more iconic on-screen duo there never was...for car lovers, at least.However, there were actually two Mustangs used during filming: one kept neat and tidy and another that did most of the dirty work during the movie’s groundbreaking chase scene. The pampered star car was preserved and sold three times over the years and is very privately owned today, while the stunt car was beaten up so badly by the end of production that it was sent to the wrecking yard.At least that’s what most people thought happened to it, but a member of the Vintage Mustang Forum claims the car recently surfaced in Mexico. Its exact location undisclosed.FOR MORE CAR STORIES FOLLOW FOXNEWS.COM LIFESTYLE ON FACEBOOKFede Garza posted photos of a Mustang that, in an ironic twist, was about to be converted into a replica of the “Eleanor” Mustang from the film “Gone in 60 Seconds” at his friend’s restoration shop. But when the owner of both the car and the business researched the vehicle identification number (VIN), he learned that he might have something special on his hands, which were shaking when he brought Garza the news.If authentic, the number is a match with the missing movie car. The vehicle also features other telltale features that it could be the real deal, including reinforced shock towers, a custom 9-inch rear axle, and holes in the trunk that are presumably there to accommodate a generator used to run the in-car camera lights. Garza says the Mustang had been rotting away in Baja California Sur for 20 or 30 years, its history heretofore unknown.Kevin Marti of Marti Auto Works in El Mirage, Ariz., is one of the world’s top experts on classic Fords and owns the exclusive license to the production records of every car the company built from 1967 to 2012. It was a report from his company that tipped off the owner to the possible treasure he had, and Marti tells Fox News that he’s heading to northern Mexico on Friday to validate the car’s provenance in person. Although he’s only seen photos so far, he says he's very optimistic that it’s legit.If Marti gives it his seal of approval, Garza says the plan is to display the car at a local Ford dealership and then send it north of the border for a proper restoration. The timing couldn’t be better. Next year is the 50th anniversary of “Bullitt”, and a recent Ford promotional video staring Dwayne Johnson suggests that the automaker is working on a special edition of the current Mustang to mark the occasion.Automotive journalist Brad Bowling is one of the few people who knew the identity of the third buyer of the other Mustang, but says he passed away a few years ago. He always kept the car hidden away and once told Bowling that he’d only show it publically if Ford built an official Mustang museum, but his heirs have been silent on the subject since his death, so that mystery continues.But if all goes well, and it doesn’t turn out to be some elaborate hoax, the Mexican Mustang could be all fixed up and ready for its close up just in time to celebrate next year. Just don’t expect to see it chasing that black Dodge Charger through the streets of San Francisco. The filmmakers may have considered the Mustang to be disposable, but it’s worth far too much today to end up in that ditch again."

          Charlie Sheen during ""Today"" interview on Nov. 17, 2015, when he revealed he is HIV positive.
          (NBC via AP)Charlie Sheen revealed he went off his HIV medication and sought alternative treatment in Mexico — with frustrating results.During a pre-taped segment for an appearance on “The Dr. Oz Show” on Tuesday, the 50-year-old actor that he was treated by Dr. Sam Chachoua, a physician who claims to be working on a HIV vaccine.""I've been off my meds for about a week now,"" Sheen said. ""Am I risking my life? Sure. So what? I was born dead. That part of it doesn't phase me at all.""Sheen’s admission comes less than two months after he revealed that he is HIV positive and said in an open letter that he never missed a treatment.In an in-studio section of his two-part interview with Oz , Sheen said he was inspired to seek alternative treatment as a result to the side effects that came from his original medication. He did not disclose what his treatment regimen entailed with Chachoua, whom Oz said is a physician not licensed to practice medicine in the United States.The TV host and doctor also shared part of an audio conversation he had with Chachoua, in which he revealed he is confident in Sheen’s treatment. So much so, he said, that he injected some of the actor’s blood into himself.""I drew some blood from him and I injected myself with it and I said, 'Charlie, if I don't know what I'm doing, then we're both in trouble now, aren't we?'"" Chachoua told Oz by phone.However, it seems like the alternative medication did not give Sheen the results he was hoping for. He revealed to Oz that he now has detectable traces of HIV in his blood, which means his numbers have gotten worse.""I'm a little off my game, because right before I walked out here, I got some results that I was disappointed about,” he said. “I had been non-detectable, non-detectable and checking the blood every week and then found out the numbers are back up.""The former “Two and a Half Men” actor said he does not recommend the alternative treatment he is receiving in Mexico to anyone.""I didn't see it as Russian roulette. I didn't see it as a complete dismissal of the conventional course we've been on. I'm not recommending that to anyone – I'm presenting myself as a type of guinea pig,” he said.Sheen's manager Mark Burg told People magazine on Tuesday that the actor is back on his HIV medicine taping the episode, which was on Dec. 8.""Charlie is back on his meds. He tried a cure from a doctor in Mexico but the minute the numbers went up, he started taking his medicine,"" Burg said.On Monday, during the first portion of his appearance on the show, Sheen also revealed that he had been sober for 11 years prior to his diagnosis, but that contracting the disease caused him to fall off the wagon “to suffocate the anxiety and what my life was going to become with (HIV).”However, he said that following his revealing interviewing in New York last year, he decided to change his life.“The geography of it was very symbolic,” Sheen explained. “I was leaving something behind and starting a new journey.”He also said that his diagnosis has brought him closer to his father, actor Martin Sheen.“I don’t want to say it’s specifically changed our relationship but something happened with he and I. We are such better friends than we’ve ever been,” he told Oz. “We don’t judge each other. [It’s] nothing but fun when we hang out. We don’t agree on everything, obviously. I mean what son and father do? He’s a special cat. And I’m really lucky to have him.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"

The mag's cover also teases a story about Charlotte's rise ""from the Super Bowl to worldwide fame,"" which is extra impressive considering the rest of us only rise from the Super Bowl to walk over to the fridge.• In related news, the photographers Charlotte mentions up above — Hunter and Gatti — are the same ones who shot her sizzling pictorial for British GQ. (Some folks get all the good gigs, don't they?) Watch the video below for a preview, then head over to CostCo to stock up on snacks for next Sunday's Super Bowl. You're running low.• Miley Cyrus confirmed on Monday that she's been cast in Woody Allen's six-part Amazon miniseries. The specific details of her role are still unknown, but — since this is Miley Cyrus and Woody Allen we're talking about — it's safe to assume she'll be playing a neurotic worrywart who also enjoys twerking.• Jennifer Lopez split her pants during a Las Vegas concert over the weekend, ripping through the butt portion of her shiny silver jumpsuit while taking a bow at the end of her show. You can watch the whole thing below, but don't pretend to be surprised or anything; we all knew this day would come:• According to E! Online, Rob Kardashian is dating Blac Chyna, a 27-year-old model who happens to be the ex-girlfriend of Kylie Jenner's boyfriend Tyga. Rob's older sister Khloé has since voiced her disapproval using a ""Godfather"" quote, warning Rob to ""never go against the family."" That said, we can only hope Khloé doesn't plan to have Rob whacked during a fishing trip.• On Monday, Britney Spears released three short videos on Instagram, each of which sees the singer writhing around on the ground in only a black bikini (see one below). So far, she's offered no explanation for the clips, so we can only assume she's planning to debut a new exercise program based around hair-whipping and profuse sweating.• FOX is reportedly developing a TV series inspired by ""The Exorcist,"" although they're basing it on the 1971 novel rather than the 1973 film. Regardless, we imagine the people in charge of Campbell's Soup's split-pea department won't be interested in buying any advertising time during the show's fall premiere.• And finally, Sony Pictures has released a new trailer for ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,"" their upcoming zombie film based on the 1813 novel ""Pride and Prejudice"" (below).

Apparently, people just don't want more Ryan Seacrest, even if he's giving away free money.• Judging by ""Trainwreck"" star Amy Schumer's Instagram posts, she and Jennifer Lawrence are new best buds. They've already gone jet-skiing together, and even constructed a human pyramid with bikini-clad Jennifer on top. Now that we think on it, though, perhaps Amy doesn't really like Jennifer that much. Otherwise, she'd have topped the pyramid with someone who doesn't have a public history of falling.• During an appearance on ""The Daily Show,"" Tom Cruise said he's already making plans for a sixth ""Mission: Impossible"" film. We think it's a great idea, but only if he renames his franchise first..

But unlike the many Tim Burton films that required him to wear the same, it looks as if Depp's funny wig and fake accent might actually earn him an Oscar this time. • HBO has announced plans to air two specials about Irish rock band U2 in November: one a documentary about their current iNNOCENCE + eXPERIENCE tour, and the other a concert film from that same tour. In other words, HBO viewers will need to fast-forward through both to hear something they recognize instead of new songs from U2's ""Songs of Innocence.""• On Thursday, Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Chrissy Teigen shared a short Instagram video in which she's balancing a plate of chicken wings on her butt, just out of husband John Legend's reach (below). But don't feel bad for John; we're guessing his belly is already full of the jalapeno poppers Chrissy served off her boobs a bit earlier.• And finally, the International Olympic Committee has chosen Beijing as the host of its 2022 Winter Games, making it the first city to host both the Summer (2008) and Winter Olympics.

(AP Photo/Eduardo Verdugo)MEXICO CITY (AP) – It's a tale of love, betrayal and history's most famous murder by ice pick.The plot to assassinate Leon Trotsky, the Soviet revolutionary-turned-exiled dissident, in Mexico City in 1940, is at the heart of ""El Elegido"" (""The Chosen""), an upcoming movie that's set to wrap shooting in this capital in the coming days.Told from the perspective of Ramon Mercader, the Spaniard who wielded the murder weapon, it recounts how the young communist recruited and trained by the Soviet secret service seduced an American woman who was close to Trotsky to get to his target.""It's a very juicy story because it's the consummation of a great treachery. ... He betrays someone who has delivered her body and soul to him,"" director Antonio Chavarrias told The Associated Press during a visit to the set. ""That's really suggestive. It adds complexity to the plot.""""El Elegido"" stars Mexican actor Alfonso Herrera (""The Perfect Dictatorship"") as Mercader; British stage veteran Henry Goodman as Trotsky; and Hannah Murray, best known for portraying the single-mom wildling Gilly in ""Game of Thrones,"" as Sylvia Ageloff, the dupe who fell in love with the Spanish assassin.After founding the Red Army and serving as the equivalent of Soviet defense minister, Trotsky became a political pariah and was expelled from the country in 1929.A death sentence from Josef Stalin hanging over his head, Trotsky traveled to Turkey, France and Norway before Mexico agreed to take him in 1937. He settled in the colonial-bohemian Mexico City neighborhood of Coyoacan, which was home to famed artists Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo — the latter of whom had an affair with Trotsky.Neither Rivera nor Kahlo appear in the movie, but some scenes were filmed in the Coyoacan home where Trotsky lived and where Mercader sank the pick, a mountaineering tool also called an ice axe, into Trotsky's head. The house has been preserved as a museum.""I think (the assassination) wasn't the fault of the Mexican police, because Trotsky even had his own bodyguards,"" said Emilio Echevarria, who plays the Mexican colonel in charge of Trotsky's guard. ""What happened was an intrigue in which the killer took advantage of a woman by seducing her.""Other scenes were shot in the Journalists' Club in the city's historic core. On a recent day, the elegant space with vaulted ceilings, columns and marble floors had been transformed with antique furniture into the setting for Mercader's interrogation following the assassination.""Who are you?"" the killer's inquisitors demanded.""I'm Jacques Mornard, a Belgian citizen,"" he replied.""That's a lie,"" a detective snapped, dealing him a smack to the head.Filming moves next to Barcelona, where the crew will spend two more weeks shooting scenes set in Spain, France and New York.Budgeted at $7.8 million and scheduled to premiere in 2016, it is the first movie about Trotsky and Mercader to be shot in Mexico and Spain.Chavarrias, the director, called Mercader's years-long effort to kill Trotsky ""a fascinating tale.""""It has global significance,"" he said. ""And there's also a very powerful human story behind it, because it's easy to fall in love.""Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"

          MEXICO CITY (AP) – The producer of the new James Bond thriller ""Spectre"" denies that the script was changed to get incentives in Mexico.Earlier, the website Tax Analysts said leaked emails indicated that Mexico made suggestions on the nationality of an actress and the villain, the villain's intended victim and some film shots. Implicitly, Mexico's incentives for the film were at stake, it said.Producer Michael G. Wilson said Wednesday: ""There is nothing in the script that we hadn't had before. The villain was always an Italian ... we already shot that in Rome.""Asked about Mexico's purported insistence on a Mexican actress in a role known as ""Estrella,"" Wilson said, ""We always had a Mexican actress playing this part."" The film has cast Mexican actress Stephanie Sigman in the role.Officials in Mexico City have declined to comment on possible incentives offered on the movie, which is scheduled to begin its Mexico filming Thursday.Relying on emails leaked as part of the recent hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Tax Analysts said that the target of the villain ""Sciarra"" should be an international leader rather than Mexico City's mayor and that a ""special police force"" should appear in the film instead of Mexican police.Wilson confirmed there are incentives.""Everywhere we go we have incentives,"" he said at a news conference. ""Sometimes they're taxes; sometimes they're other kind of incentives. You can get cooperation, you can get things you would usually pay for for free and all that.""But it wasn't just incentives. Wilson confirmed that Mexico's ""Day of the Dead"" traditions will be seen in the film, or at least a Bond version — ""where everything is sort of magnified.""Mexicans remember departed relatives and friends on the Day of the Dead at the beginning of November with orange flowers, candy skulls and other death-related decorations.""The writers thought the day of the death would be an excellent background in the opening sequence, very colorful, very mysterious,"" Wilson said.

          Mexican officials wanted to attract the new Bond film’s production team to the country and were willing to pay for it. According to reports, the country offered Sony Pictures and MGM Studios $14 million in tax incentives and rebates for a few minutes of screen time.Moreover, the Washington Post reported that officials demanded changes to the script for a more polished image of Mexico. The original script reportedly included an attempt to kill the Mexico City mayor, but officials preferred the attempt to be against an “international leader” with Mexican police stepping in instead of a “special police force.”In addition to the script changes, Mexican officials also wanted a known Mexican actress to play a Bond girl.Earlier this month, the studios announced Mexican actress Stephanie Sigman, 28, would play the film’s third Bond girl named Estrella.Historical parts of Mexico City’s downtown district will be closed off this week, as a production team takes over for the new Bond thriller, called “Spectre.”The city of 8 million people is known for its heavy traffic.Officials say the first street closings will start Thursday and shutdowns will continue at various locations through April 1. Affected areas include streets with buildings dating back to the 17th century and the city's vast central plaza, the Zocalo.Production staffers have apparently already prepared some spots downtown, including one street crowded with traditional ""Day of the Dead"" decorations.The Sam Mendes-directed movie starring Daniel Craig is also scheduled to film in London, Italy, Morocco, and Austria.Based on reporting by the Associated Press.Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"
40,"The script for the new James Bond thriller “Spectre” was modified to portray Mexico in a more favorable way on the silver screen to audiences worldwide in exchange for $14 million worth of incentives offered by Mexican government officials.The claim was first reported by the website Tax Analysts, who said they’ve sifted through internal Sony Pictures Entertainment emails leaked during the recent hacking of the company by an organization affiliated with the North Korean government.According to the report, Sony Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. (MGM) were so desperate to cut the costs of making “Spectre,” which faced a $250 million price-tag, they modified the script and its characters in exchange for a $14 million rebate. 007 Box Office SuccessSkyfallRelease Date---------------------November 9, 2012

Worldwide Gross--------------------$599 million[Source: Box Office Mojo]As requested by Mexican government officials, Bond producers agreed to cast a “known Mexican actress,” Stephanie Sigman, to play star bond-woman Estrella opposite Daniel Craig as Bond. Producers agreed to the stipulation that the film’s villain Sciarra “cannot be Mexican,” a Mexican governor who is the target of an assassination needed to be replaced with an international leader instead, and a scene showing Mexican police had to be replaced with a more ambiguous “special police force.” According to Tax Analysts, Bond producers altered the first four minutes or so of the new bond flick. Instead of beginning with a cage match in an unknown location, the film will now begin in Mexico during a “Day of the Dead” celebration. Bond producers and studio executives agreed to include more flattering aerial shots of “modern Mexico City buildings,” in the opening, which will now feature Bond alongside a new Bond woman flying a stolen helicopter.  According to emails, Sony and MGM believed they could get an extra $6 million from Mexico for showing the skyline favorably.The producer for “Spectre” denied that the script was altered to get cost-cutting incentives in Mexico.“""There is nothing in the script that we hadn't had before,” producer Michael G. Wilson told the Associated Press Wednesday. “The villain was always an Italian ... we already shot that in Rome."" When asked about a Mexican actress playing the “Estrella,” role Wilson said, ""We always had a Mexican actress playing this part.""Wilson conceded that countries offer incentives to studios in the form of tax breaks, free services, and cooperation, but still insisted that even the opening scene showcasing Mexico’s “Day of the Dead” traditions was done for artistic reasons.""The writers thought the Day of the Dead would be an excellent background in the opening sequence, very colorful, very mysterious,"" Wilson said. ""You can only do that in Mexico. There is no other place that offers that but Mexico.""Still, Tax Analysts, said the changes go further by allowing Mexican authorities to make such specific script changes.Some, such as Forbes Magazine, call the incentives “business as usual,” saying it would be “financially irresponsible” if the producers didn’t make a few “cosmetic changes” for up to $20 million in savings.“This is absolutely no different than Michael Bay making the American military look good in order to get authentic props and vehicles for a Transformers sequel. This is little different than the makers of Iron Man 3 shooting specific scenes with Chinese actors specifically to theoretically increase the film’s box office muscle in China,” the magazine said.Meanwhile, the buzz over the new Bond thriller continues in the streets of Mexico City. Officials have already begun to close some parts of the historic downtown district to allow for filming beginning Thursday. The production crew and movie actors will be shutting down streets throughout the city of 8 million people through April 1st.The 24th chapter of the Bond series is set to be released in theatres November 6 this year.Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"

          (2015 Getty Images)There will be no Miss Mexico at the next Miss Universe pageant.Former Miss Universe Lupita Jones, who is in charge of Mexico’s pageant selection, confirmed the news via Twitter on Monday after Mexican media giant Televisa announced it would no longer broadcast the annual pageant or engage any other project with Donald Trump.“As a Mexican, I feel very offended and indignant like everyone else, as Miss Universe I think Donald Trump is doing great harm to the organization,” she tweeted in Spanish. “Miss Universe is a contest with a great history in the world, which has been characterized by convening countries to participate in an event where friendship and unity is prominent, breaking down cultural barriers.”She continued: “It’s a shame that because of his racist comments we lose what the competition has promoted and represented for so many years in an atmosphere of harmony and peace among nations; therefore, and in accordance to the statement by Televisa, we will not participate in Miss Universe.”Televisa and Jones organize the pageant, Nuestra Belleza Mexico, that selects the Mexican candidate for the contest.In a statement Monday night, Televisa said its decision comes in the wake of ""disrespectful"" remarks by Trump that the company says offended the entire Mexican population. The spokesperson said the media company “strongly rejects all forms of discrimination, racism and xenophobia.""Televisa’s decision is the most recent of a growing list of networks and celebrities pulling their support from Trump and his Miss Universe Organization after his remarks earlier this month.On Monday, NBC Universal also announced it would end its relationship with the business mogul.“At NBC, respect and dignity for all people are cornerstones of our values. Due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship with Mr. Trump,” the network said in a statement released Monday.This followed an announcement by Spanish-language network Univision that it would not broadcast the Miss USA pageant on July 12 and severed its ties with the Miss Universe Organization. Actress Roselyn Sanchez cancelled her appearance as co-host of Miss USA and and singer J Balvin pulled out as a performer.While Trump did not respond immediately to the decision by Televisa. He has said that he was considering suing NBC for violating its contract.""If NBC is so weak and so foolish to not understand the serious illegal immigration problem in the United States, coupled with the horrendous and unfair trade deals we are making with Mexico, then their contract violating closure of Miss Universe/Miss USA will be determined in court,” he said in a statement early Monday. Trump has also said it would sue Univision for breach of contract and defamation.As for the Miss Universe Organization, they issued a statement stating they were ""disheartened"" by the recent events.""We are disheartened by recent events but the show will go on,"" the organization wrote in an Instragram post. ""The Miss Universe Organization is built on a foundation of inclusion and continues to be a celebration of diversity and of all cultures. This year's Miss USA contestants represent many different ethnic backgrounds, including six Latinas (four of whom are of Mexican descent.)""It continued: ""Annually, nearly ten thousand young women all around the world participate in Miss Universe pageant events. We continue to welcome those from all backgrounds to enter our system. Our franchisees work tirelessly every day to empower young women to be confident and to be their personal best while raising awareness and millions of dollars for philanthropic endeavors.""""While world politics and other influences will undoubtedly play a role, the pageant will always seek to transcend controversy. It is unfortunate that recent events beyond our control have only served to negatively impact the women who participate in the pageant, our state directors, our sponsors and our fans. We want our supporters to know we remain committed to them and we will be conducting the pageant, regardless of the current situation. We are moving forward, full-steam ahead as planned for the next two weeks, culminating in the crowning of a new Miss USA on July 12th.""According to Reuters, Ora TV, a Television company co-founded by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim and TV personality Larry King, also canceled a program it was working with some of Trump's companies.During his presidential kickoff speech, Trump said Mexican immigrants are ""bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists and some, I assume, are good people."" He advocated building a wall along the United States' southern border.Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"

Due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship with Mr. Trump,” the network said in a statement released Monday.This means that the annual Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants, which are part of a venture between NBC and Trump, will not air on NBC. Trump will not be participating in “The Apprentice” as he had already indicated.NBC said “Celebrity Apprentice” will continue without the mogul.Speaking to reporters in Chicago on Monday, Trump said he'll consider suing NBC after its announcement and would not be apologizing for his claims that some Mexican immigrants bring drugs and crime into the country.""They did not want me to run. They wanted me to do 'The Apprentice'. And now with my statements on immigration which happen to be correct, they are going to take a different stance and that’s OK. Whatever they want to do is OK with me,"" Trump said. ""As far as ending the relationship, I have to do that because my view on immigration is much different than the people at NBC.""Trump then issued a statement saying he stands by his statements regarding immigration and called NBC ""weak"" for being politically correct and ""that is why our country is in serious trouble.”""We must have strong borders and not let illegal immigrants enter the United States. As has been stated continuously in the press, people are pouring across our borders unabated. Public reports routinely state great amounts of crime are being committed by illegal immigrants.

Furthermore, they will stand behind lying Brian Williams, but won’t stand behind people that tell it like it is, as unpleasant as that may be.”The move by NBC comes after a petition asking the network to fire Trump collected more than 200,000 signatures.Posted on the Change.org website, the petition called out NBC for choosing business over ""ethics, principles and values"" in the wake of Trump's recent statements when declaring his candidacy for president. Among his remarks, the GOP hopeful portrayed immigrants from Mexico as ""bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.""In his presidential announcement earlier this month, Trump said: ""Nobody can build a fence like me. I would build a wall like nobody can build a wall. And nobody comes in illegally anymore … I build great buildings all over the world. I would have Mexico pay for it. Believe me. They will pay for it because they have really ripped this country off.”Last week, Univision announced it was canceling its coverage of the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants because of Trump’s comments.“At Univision, we see first-hand the work ethic, love for family, strong religious values and the important role Mexican immigrants and Mexican-Americans have had and will continue to have in building the future of our country,” Univision said in a statement last week. “We will not be airing the Miss USA pageant on July 12th or working on any other projects tied to the Trump Organization.”Trump retaliated by saying he would sue the network for “hundreds of millions of dollars” for severing ties with him and the Miss Universe pageant organization.The 69-year-old Republican presidential hopeful also banned Univision officers and representatives from using the golf courses and facilities at Trump National Doral in South Florida.Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"

(AP2011)The intake of sugary drinks in Mexico went down by 7.6 percent in the two years after a tax on sugar-sweetened sodas was implemented on Jan. 1, 2014, a study shows.Purchases of taxed beverages decreased 5.5 percent in 2014 and 9.7 percent in 2015, yielding an average reduction of 7.6 percent over the study period. The tax is just 1 peso ($0.050) per 35 fl. oz., yet was is enough to create a huge impact among low-income households.COCA-COLA APOLOGIZES FOR ‘INSENSITIVE’ AD FEATURING INDIGENOUS MEXICANSIn the first year, 2014, sugary-drink purchases decreased 5.5 percent and another was added the next year, bringing it to an impressive 9.7 percent.Untaxed beverages like diet sodas, juices and bottled increased 2.1 percent during the study period, the study found.The study, conducted by researchers from the University of North Carolina and the Mexican National Institute of Public Health, seeks to encourage other countries to follow suit.“Findings from Mexico may encourage other countries to use fiscal policies to reduce consumption of unhealthy beverages along with other interventions to reduce the burden of chronic disease,” the authors of the study wrote.THE WEEK IN PICTURESMexico is among the fattest countries in the world. Just under one-third of adults are obese, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. Seven out of 10 Mexicans are overweight and the country has surpassed the U.S. in obesity rates, mostly due to a diet of fatty foods and sugary sodas, according to a United Nations report.“It will be important for us to continue to monitor this tax and see how this actually will affect overall diets, diabetes prevalence and other biological markers of the many non-communicable diseases linked with excessive sugary beverage consumption,” said Barry Popkin, one of the authors, to the Guardian.Seven U.S. cities, including San Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia, have per-ounce taxes on sugary drinks.Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said this week the city's soda tax raised $5.7 million in January, more than double what city officials had projected.Kenney's announcement Thursday comes a day after some supermarkets and beverage distributors say they're gearing up for layoffs after seeing beverage sales fall by 30 percent to 50 percent — worse than the city predicted.The AP contributed to this report."

(My Fox Tampa Bay)An Arizona teen has died after suffering an apparent heart attack while vacationing in Mexico – and her parents say energy drinks are to blame.Sixteen-year-old Lanna Hamann was vacationing in Rocky Point, Mexico with family and friends on Saturday, when she said she didn’t feel well and was having problems breathing. She went to a local clinic, but they were unable to help and she later died of cardiac arrest.According to Lanna’s friends, she had consumed several energy drinks that day while on the beach.  A family friend told AZFamily.com that an autopsy performed in Mexico confirmed that energy drinks were partially to blame for Lanna’s heart giving out.Dr. Jack Wolfson, a cardiologist at Wolfson Integrative Cardiology in Phoenix, Ariz., said the high levels of caffeine and sugar in energy drinks may have contributed to the cardiac arrest.""There is medical evidence that these things do harm; they can cause changes in the heart rhythm, and impact blood pressure,"" Wolfson said. “""These drinks should be regulated as alcohol is, no one under the age of 21 should be allowed to have these drinks.”Friends and family of Lanna describe her as healthy and athletic, making her death very shocking.“It kills us. We love Lanna. She's the greatest girl; all-time best,” said Hayden Birt, Lanna’s childhood friend.Lanna’s family is currently trying to transport her body from Mexico to Arizona, but they have been told it will cost $13,000.  They have set up a GoFundMe account to help cover the cost.Click for more from AZFamily.com."

          LOS ANGELES (AP) – A measles outbreak that originated at Disneyland has grown to 87 cases.The California Department of Public Health said Monday most of the infections — 73— are in California. The rest are in Arizona, Utah, Washington, Colorado, Oregon, Nebraska and Mexico.Measles has been spreading since an outbreak linked to visits to California Disney parks last month. Most of those infected were not vaccinated, and health officials have urged people to get the measles shot.Measles is a contagious illness spread through the air by coughing and sneezing. It was largely eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, but it can enter the country from abroad.The U.S. experienced a record number of measles cases last year, with 644 infections reported from 27 states.More On This...Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"
55,"A sleepy border village in Mexico, just one-square mile and steps from the dusty deserts of Arizona, has slowly become one of the dental capitals of the world.Los Algodones, nicknamed Molar City, has a population of 4,000, yet has about 350 dentists, some with so many patients the line swings out the door. Block after block is lined with dental offices and wall-to-wall billboards promising to enhance a smile.The four square blocks of Los Algodones is said to be occupied by more dentists than anywhere else in the world. About 90 percent of its clientele is American.The sun-drenched city is such a dental draw because of its cut-rate prices – about $70 for a filling, $330 for a porcelain crown, less than $20 for a cleaning. That's about 70 percent less than U.S. prices -- where major dental work can run up to a thousand or several thousand dollars.But medical authorities in the U.S. warn that Los Algodones is the equivalent of dental lawlessness, with no accreditation process or licensing procedure existing in Mexico – making it a dentistry free-for-all.In the United States, dentists are required to receive a bachelor’s degree and then graduate from a four-year dental school. Then, to start practicing dentistry, they have to pass the National Board Dental Exam, and receive a license by a state board.“There is no uniform system like that in Mexico,” said Kevin Earle, executive director of the Arizona Dental Association. “They could have wide variability in the training in Mexico in comparison to the reliability of seeing a dentist here in the United States.”Earle said some dentists in Arizona, particularly those on the border, often see patients with substandard and botched work that their dentists are forced to fix. One doctor, he said, was called to the emergency room after a patient came in bleeding profusely in the mouth. The Mexican dentist, Earle said, either didn’t understand or forgot the patient was on a blood thinner called Coumadin.“There is no investigative authority to see if a dentist has complaints against them, or if lawsuits have been filed against them,” Earle said. “That whole safety net that we have here doesn’t exist in Mexico.”Yet the experience could be positive for many – but only if they do their homework, said Ron Vinluan, managing director of Dáyo Dental, a company that arranges dental procedures for U.S. clients getting work done in Mexico.“You have to know where to go,” Vinluand said. “You’ll have a great experience there, at a significantly less cost, if you do your research.”Vinluan said there are plenty of good dentists in Los Algodones. He said there are also great, top-of-the-line facilities and equipment that are on par – and sometimes better – than the ones found in the U.S.“You get the same experience than the U.S. – at the fraction of the cost,” he said. “That’s why it’s gotten so much attention.”But even he cautioned people have to be careful. He said some Mexican dentists will perform surgery even though they don’t have the training or proper equipment to do so. People, he said, should never consider price above quality when going to Los Algodones, and they should always look for reputable dentists with good pedigree and high-quality equipment.“You have to do your research,” he said. “You can’t just show up there and go to the first place you see.”You can reach Carolyn Salazar at carolyn.salazar@foxnewslatino.com Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino"

(The Guardian)If there ever was an incentive to work out, Mexico City has probably hit the nail on the head.The Mexican capital is now offering free subway or bus tickets in exchange for 10 squats. And if the train ticket is not necessary, then the 10 squats can be exchanged for a pack of condoms.The new program is part of a broader effort to battle the growing obesity problem in the country.The squats are measured by machines that, once the workout is completed, shoot out a slip redeemable for a train or bus ticket — or the condoms, Milenio newspaper reported.The program started out at 15 stations across Mexico City, with 30 machines donated by FEMSA, a Mexican multinational beverage and retail company.“The idea is that people go and get the message about being active,” Armando Ahued, health secretary for Mexico City. “We will also be offering free medical check-ups.”Mexico faces the most acute obesity crisis in the Americas, with 70 percent of adults overweight or obese, according to Mexico's National Institute for Public Health. The problem costs the Mexican economy an estimated $5.5 billion in 2008, and if the problem is not addressed, the figure is expected to hit $12.5 billion by 2017.“If they don’t start taking care of themselves, they can develop things like diabetes … we cannot accept that,” Ahued added. “It’s a problem of high priority; it’s the No. 1 health problem that affects this city and the country. The machines don’t occupy a lot of space and won’t be placed in areas that could be risky for uses.”The goal, he said, is for people to start incorporating physical activity to their daily lives.In addition to the ticket or condom exchange, health officials will be giving out 80,000 pedometers to people who use the machines.This new health campaign is part of a continuous program that has included the installation of more than 600 free outdoor gyms around the city.“We are calling for people to start moving, the best vaccine for obesity is called exercise and a lifestyle change,” Ahued said after trying out the machines.Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"

The Mexican government continues its efforts to contain the H1N1 virus or the so-called swine flu. Cases have been confirmed in 15 countries, including Mexico and the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the threat level to 'phase 5,' indicating a 'pandemic is imminent.  (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) (2009 Getty Images)Nearly three years after H1N1, so-called swine flu, first struck Mexico, the virus is making a comeback.In January, Mexico recorded 1,623 cases of the flu, including 1,456 H1N1 cases. There were 1,000 flu cases in Mexico last year, Health Secretary Salomón Chertorivski Woldenberg said earlier this week. Since the year’s start, 29 people have died of H1N1. Only 35 people died from various flu strains all last year. Yet, the number of  H1N1 cases is not unexpected. The Associated Press reported that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) “say that H1N1 cases this year are within the normal range.” Relative to 2009, when H1N1 caused worldwide panic, particularly in Mexico City where schools, museums, cinemas and restaurants were shuttered, the country is also more prepared to fight the illness, said Pablo Kuri-Morales, another official with Mexico’s Health Ministry.Guinness Records, Mexico’s Favorite Pastime“First, we know what the virus is,” he said, “second, we have the vaccine, of which 70 million doses were applied three years ago. Third, we know there’s a medicine that’s effective.”Residents here remember wearing masks and surgical gloves on public transportation, and keeping their kids home. The flu particularly hurt the economy, keeping away clients and generally slowing the capital. Employees lost work days and pay.“Yeah it was really heavy,” said Jorge Acosta, who runs a shoe repair stand near Chapultepec Park. He lost 70 to 80 percent of his usual income during the swine flu’s height. “I was working that entire time,” he added.When H1N1 deaths appeared in the news late January, Mexicans took notice. But looking back on 2009’s response, they’re less anxious.World's Largest Yoga Class“They told us it was an epidemic – that we were going to drop like flies,” said Acosta, “we believed that. Then nothing happened.”Most Mexicans remember the fear, rather than the illness. By mid-2010, the country had only reported 1,300 swine flu deaths. Many people nowadays don’t know anyone affected.Consequently, conspiracy theories have arisen. Like the one about the government inventing the swine flu.Santos Mariano Ramírez López, who works for milk company Leche Alpura, said the government used H1N1 to distract Mexicans from pursuing justice.“It’s to lie to us so we don’t continue fighting, or saying ‘what’s happening with our salaries?’ – if they’re going to raise our salaries or not,” he said. For those willing to believe officials, swine flu cases will increase in February and March. That’s the normal cycle of this flu, said Kuri-Morales.Thus far, the health and education secretaries have not recommended school closures. Free vaccines are available in the nation’s public health institutes between mid-October until late winter, said Kuri-Morales. In Mexico City, vaccination stands are set up in Metro stations.There’s also common sense protection.Epidemiologist Dr. Richard P. Wenzel, of Virginia Commonwealth University, visited Mexican swine flu patients in 2009. Hand-washing and less touching prevent infection, he said.“Stop handshaking. It’s a time-honored tradition, but it’s better to hug,"" he said. ""And Mexicans like to hug anyway,” he said.Ruth Samuelson is a freelance writer based in Mexico City.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino"

(gofundme.com)Christy and Haseeb Amireh were elated to receive their first child, a baby boy named Grayson, on April 16 via surrogate. But now they are desperate. The Mexican state of Tabasco, where the childbirth took place, would not issue the birth certificate they need to get a passport and leave the country.For almost a month now, the three Amirehs have been bumping from hotel to hotel in the capital city of Villahermosa — some 550 miles from Mexico City. They have put their lives on hold, including their jobs, because of an unexpected change in the law involving surrogacy.“It seemed like time just keep passing, and the next day, the next day, the next day and no birth certificate and we stated panicking,” Christy told KPIX-TV in a Skype interview.Tabasco is the only state in Mexico where surrogacy is defined and legal, and it can cost a third of what it does in the U.S., according to Surrogacy Without Borders.The Amirehs had it all coming their way, witnessed their boy’s birth and have plenty of pictures documenting the joy – until the governor of Tabasco decided to put a moratorium on all birth certificates for surrogate families.“The week of the birth, or certificates for surrogacy were pulled, no rhyme or reason,” Bobby Khuller, a family friend, told the station.The San Jose, California couple has set up an account on gofundme to get all the financial help they can get to keep on paying their living expenses down there, and also lawyers.

63,"Mexico City’s Public Education Secretariat recently signed an agreement with the Federal District Wrestling Commission to promote wrestling as a way for children to lose weight.In response, I have heard both support for the measure and concern. Some question Mexico City’s decision to support wrestling - of all sports - because of its violent reputation.I, for one, applaud the move.First and foremost, physical exercise can only be beneficial for children in most cases. Mexico, as a country, has the highest childhood obesity rate in the world, so I’m all for any effort to get these kids up and moving.I would also like to say that though we typically have this image of wrestling as a violent, sometimes brutal sport, that’s simply not the case.Sure, on television you’re likely to see people getting flung against the ropes and hit over the head with chairs, but amateur wrestling conducted under proper guidelines – which is what I’m certain the schools are supporting – is a whole different story.There are no ropes or chairs or other flashy, unrealistic maneuvers performed purely for entertainment value. It’s just two kids, using learned techniques to try to pin each other down to a mat.As with any contact sport, of course, it’s important to require the use of proper safety equipment. In football, you have pads; in baseball, gloves; and in wrestling, you need to have headgear, properly fitted shoes and kneepads, among other things.But as long as kids have all the proper equipment, and the supervision of adults to make sure they are following the rules, I don’t see why wrestling should be more cause for concern than any other contact sport.From my viewpoint, the Public Education Secretariat is being responsible and proactive by promoting wrestling to fight Mexico’s obesity epidemic. Not only is it a safe, calorie-burning exercise, it is also an incredibly popular sport in Mexico and likely to appeal to all the kids who grow up watching it on television.As far as I’m concerned, the more support there is from the government in the fight against obesity, the better.Dr. Manny Alvarez is a Cuban-American OB-GYN who serves as a senior medical contributor for the Fox News Channel and senior managing health editor of FOXNews.com.

          LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) – The unknown blast came during rainy season in the desolate New Mexico desert.Most residents of the historic Hispanic village of Tularosa had no phones or radios. So when word spread that Army officials said it was just an ammunition explosion, anxious residents relaxed despite the raining ash.It wasn't until after the U.S. announced it had dropped an atomic bomb on Japan that Tularosa residents learned scientists from the then-secret city of Los Alamos successfully exploded the first atomic bomb at the nearby Trinity Site on July 16, 1945.""It was a source of pride,"" Tina Cordova, a former Tularosa resident whose father was 3 years old when the Trinity test was conducted.

It involved three research and production facilities at Los Alamos; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and Hanford, Washington.Retired physicist Duane Hughes, who gives tours at the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History in Albuquerque, said the history of the Trinity Test is important because it helped end World War II and set the stage for a Cold War arms race.""I don't know if anyone thought it was a failure,"" Hughes said. ""It really changed the history of the world.""Hughes is scheduled Thursday to give a lecture on the history of the Trinity Test at the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History.Meanwhile, writers with the WGN America show ""Manhattan"" are tackling questions about Trinity for its upcoming second season. The series follows a group of Los Alamos scientists as they face moral quandaries involving the bomb.The show doesn't seek to preach but hopes to demonstrate the project's complexities, ""Manhattan"" creator Sam Shaw said.Shaw didn't want to give away too many details of the upcoming season.

          ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) – Two pilots in a helium-filled balloon landed safely off the coast of Mexico early Saturday after an audacious, nearly 7,000-mile-long trip across the Pacific Ocean that shattered two long-standing records for ballooning.The pilots landed 4 miles offshore in Baja California about 300 miles north of the popular beach destination of Cabo San Lucas. The pilots came in low and dropped thick trailing ropes into the ocean to help slow the balloon before setting down in a controlled water landing.Mission control in Albuquerque was packed with balloon team members and the pilots' families as it descended, with all eyes focused on a giant screen showing a map of the coast and the balloon's location.They exchanged hugs and smiled with relief after it touched down. But it wasn't until they received word that the pilots were safe and aboard a fishing boat headed to the shore that cheers erupted and the cork was popped on a bottle of champagne.""We're really pleased with the distance numbers we have here and very pleased with the duration numbers,"" said Steve Shope, mission control director.

They also easily exceeded the distance record of 5,209 miles set by the Double Eagle V team during the first trans-Pacific flight in 1981.Bradley and his family have been planning for the record-breaking attempt for 15 years, spending countless hours thinking about every aspect of the journey.""For Troy, it's a personal thing to do something better than anyone else in the world has done it before and to push himself,"" said his wife, Tami Bradley, who is a balloon pilot herself.She said her husband's heroes include early balloonists such as Abruzzo and Anderson.""For Troy, it's also his way of paying homage to those who came before him by attempting to go after their records,"" she said.The pilots were said to be in good spirits at various times during the trip, but it was a grueling ordeal. The balloon's capsule is about the size of a large tent — 7 feet long, 5 feet wide and 5 feet tall. At times, they flew at an altitude of more than 15,000 feet, requiring them to wear oxygen masks and bundle up against the 50-degree temperature inside the capsule. They had sleeping bags, a small onboard heater and a simple toilet.The original route took the pilots on a path from Japan, across the Pacific Ocean and toward the Pacific Northwest before they encountered shifting weather patterns. They then made a sweeping right turn and headed south along the California coast for the Mexico landing.By Saturday morning, the Two Eagles team had smashed the records, having traveled 6,646 miles over six days, 16 hours and 37 minutes.""The technology has improved so much in the last couple of years. I don't think there's going to be any question about the records,"" said Katie Griggs, a regional director with the nonprofit Balloon Federation of America.The balloon is outfitted with an array of monitors and other instruments that are tracking its course and compiling the data, using technology that didn't exist in decades past, leaving some claims unproven.The journey has been tough on the pilots, who have been on oxygen for days; high altitude can take a physical toll.

          Baja peninsula offers an unspoiled landscape, and flora Dr. Seuss might have created
        The stark beauty and solitude encountered are a far cry from the fancy restaurants, pools with swim-up bars, fishing, snorkeling and sunbathing popular on the southern end of the Sea of Cortez, the long slip of water sandwiched between the Baja Peninsula and Mexico's mainland.GUERRERO NEGRO, Mexico (AP) – Far from the sprawling, all-inclusive resorts of Mexico's Los Cabos is a part of the Baja California peninsula that few tourists ever see, but should.In one of Mexico's largest federally protected conservation areas for flora and fauna, the landscape is filled with desert plants that look like they were drawn by Dr. Seuss: candle-like boojum trees and distinctively sculptural elephant trees, towering cardon cacti and other types of succulents.Sitting in the middle of the peninsula, this little-known spot is the Valle de los Cirios, or Valley of the Boojums. The plants it is named for were dubbed cirios — or candles — in Spanish, evidently because of their resemblance to tapered church candles used at the missions nearby. Southwestern naturalist Godfrey Sykes later christened that same tree the ""boojum,"" for an imaginary animal character in Lewis Carroll's nonsense poem ""The Hunting of the Snark.""Birds like pelicans and ospreys abound and peninsular pronghorns, once hunted to near extinction, roam the desert landscape. Under a Mexican government program, the hoofed animals are now making a comeback from their once critically endangered status. Among the oldest known mammals in the Americas, the pronghorns are known locally as ""ghosts of the desert"" because their golden brown or tan color and white markings helps camouflage them.Nearby, visitors can see ancient cave paintings depicting deer, whales and humans with six fingers.More On This...Mexico’s oil industry under siege from drug cartelsLos Cabos, Mexico, five months after Hurricane OdileThe stark beauty and solitude encountered are a far cry from the fancy restaurants, pools with swim-up bars, fishing, snorkeling and sunbathing popular on the southern end of the Sea of Cortez, the long slip of water sandwiched between the Baja Peninsula and Mexico's mainland. The peninsula was once eloquently described in a travel journal by American writer John Steinbeck; its stunning coral reefs were praised by ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau.A short way to the south, magnificent gray whales arrive every year off the Pacific coast town of Guerrero Negro, following one of the world's longest migration routes. They mate and calve in the lagoons nearby.Mexico's government says there were more than 2,600 whales in the lagoons at the end of February, including adults and calves — among the highest numbers in 19 years and 10 percent more than last season. It estimates whale-watching could continue through the end of April before the sea mammals head back to Alaska.Guerrero Negro has a long whaling history and was named for the whaling ship Black Warrior that partially sank in the area in 1858.Also located here is the largest salt-making facility on the planet. The salt is extracted from ocean water by evaporation, taking advantage of the region's low yearly rainfall, its large areas of flatlands and high solar radiation.If you go:Valley of the Boojums is in the middle of the 775-mile Baja California peninsula and can be reached by car. Vehicles can be rented either in Tijuana near the U.S.-Mexico border in the north or in the resorts of La Paz or Los Cabos in the south.Guerrero Negro can be reached by car and has a small airport with regional service. Visiting the lagoons where you can watch whales is possible only through authorized tour operators in Guerrero Negro.

          Budget Travel: Ixtapa, Mexico
        Ixtapa may not be on your radar when it comes to taking a Mexican vacation since it’s a lot smaller than the more well-known resort getaways. But it's a more authentic travel experience.Ixtapa may not be on your radar when it comes to taking a Mexican vacation, since it’s a lot smaller than the more well-known resort getaways of Cancun, Acapulco, and Puerto Vallarta. But smaller translates to better if you’re looking for a more authentic travel experience.Situated on the Pacific coast, Ixtapa offers more of a resort feel while its sister city of Zihuatanejo, a laid-back fishing village, is just ten minutes away. Unlike other popular Mexican tourist destinations where souvenirs and “local handicrafts” are actually made in China, the ceramics, paintings, and colorful tapestries on display in the Mercado de Artesanias in Ixtapa and the Mercado Central in Zihuatanejo, as well as small specialty shops, are made by hand by local villagers.Traveling the Mayan RivieraBesides being a low-key place to spend your vacation, Ixtapa is one of the best places in the world for saltwater sportfishing. Scuba divers and snorkelers also love the region for the diversity of underwater attractions, from easily-accessible coral reefs and turtles to sunken ships.  But if a beach is more your speed, Playa la Ropa is one of the most beautiful beaches on the Mexican Pacific coast, and it’s about as authentic as you get. At one of several open-air restaurants right on the beach, you’ll dine on freshly-caught grilled fish served up on paper plates while your feet dig into the sand.Eco-Friendly Travel in Latin AmericaAnd don’t miss El Refugio de Potosi elrefugiodepotosi.org, a center for wildlife conservation where you can visit with a variety of owls, iguanas, and other critters.While Ixtapa will never grow to be as large as Cancun or Puerto Vallarta, it’s safe to say that this fact suits both locals and visitors-in-the-know just fine.Lisa Rogak is a freelance writer and New York Times Bestselling author.

""The weather is same. The flora, the fauna, is the same as in Sahara Desert, so it's perfect weather for them.""A couple gazes at the distant horizon, a yellow and orange sunset glowing, while they sit atop a camel on a pristine beach in a photo on the Cabo Adventures website.

71,"TOLUCA, MEXICO – Death and sugar naturally intertwine for Norma Lara Hernández.Her mother made candy for the Day of the Dead, Mexico’s holiday for remembering deceased family members, and also adored sweets – eventually, too passionately.“She began to get sick she loved them so much,” says Hernández about her mother’s diabetes and health issues. Nevertheless, her mother delighted in her work, which supported eight children. “She was exquisitely sweet, as a person and in what she ate.”With that legacy in mind, Hernández carries on the family culinary tradition today at the Feria del Alfeñique, a nearly month-long event offering Day of the Dead specialties. She sells treats like tiny sandwiches and pastries made of pumpkin seed paste and of course, calaveras, skulls traditionally composed of hardened, molded sugar or amaranth.She was exquisitely sweet, as a person and in what she ate.— Norma Lara Hernández, Day of the Dead sweets-maker on her mother.The Feria takes place in Toluca, a medium-sized city near the capital. There are 84 stands, many of which offer figures of lambs, rabbits and fish made from the fair's namesake product, “alfeñique,” a white mixture of sugar and almond oil. In 1630, local man Francisco de la Rosa began preparing alfeñique treats in the city, and his influence has trickled down through the generations, according to fair coordinators. For the last 60 years, candy-makers have lined up their products in Los Portales, a historic yellow building in the heart of the city.Most vendors recall coming here as children, when their parents manned the stands.  But the array of treats has evolved since grandma and grandpa’s era, says Armando Ferreyra, a candy-maker.“This is modernity,” he says, pointing to a panoply of chocolate items, “It’s how we keep selling.”Although the fair didn’t begin until early October, Ferreyra says he finishes his earliest batches of treats in April or May normally. He first makes tamarind, coco and chocolate calaveras, then stores them in “a place that’s very dry” until fall.Many sellers insist they personally produce everything in their stalls.“I didn’t make the plastic tray,” says vendor Julio Gomez Gúia, pointing to what he gives to customers while they’re plucking their purchases. But another seller mentioned that merchants exchange goods to broaden their selections – which seems more likely.Similar to many of Mexico’s culinary traditions, the Day of the Dead treats reflect a hybrid of Pre-Hispanic and Hispanic holidays and customs. Before the Spaniards arrived, indigenous people created figures using beans, amaranth and honey for their religious ceremonies.When the Catholic Church established itself in Mexico, it declared November 1 and 2, All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day respectively, and those holidays blended with the pre-existing rituals honoring Mictecacihuatl, a goddess of death.After selecting their calaveras, the customers often ask the vendors to write their deceased loved ones’ names on the heads. During Day of the Dead, people place these skulls and other favorite snacks and dishes on altars dedicated to these family members.Many people eat the treats after the holiday is over. But in Hernández’s case, she packs up most of them. Her mother liked so many sweets, it seems wasteful to display all new items annually.“We eat the fruit,” she says.Ruth Samuelson is a freelance writer living in Mexico City.

          Mexico City Finds That Tourists Are Attracted to Its Seedy Spots
        Call it grit tourism. Visitors are looking beyond the elegant plazas to the infamous drug dens and bordellos of Mexico City. Read the full story here.Mexico City’s Centro Histórico lands on every traveler’s checklist. They come for the Metropolitan Cathedral, the huge Zócalo plaza and murals by Diego Rivera.Then they usually head south to Frida Kahlo’s house.But Centro’s tough barrios are finally attracting some attention as well. Call it gritty tourism – there are guided trips to cantinas and markets famous for prostitution and drug dens. Nighttime groups stroll areas that many Mexicans, fearing muggings, still wouldn’t enter past sundown.There’s even a guided visit of the area’s pornographic theaters.""It’s a tour above all historic, but also anthropological,"" said David García, whose company runs the tour, ""the people that go to these places, they have a series of rituals inside.""Mexico is Out to Set the Record on Breaking World RecordsGarcía, whose company is called Rec (Recorridos Culturales), gives tours through La Merced, a neighborhood where prostitutes line the sidewalk in broad daylight. The area is also famous for commercial corridors like ""Beauty Street,"" filled with stands offering manicures and fake highlights.While García’s routes can titillate, he’s mostly interested in the Centro’s history and gives less scandalous tours as well.Named a UNESCO World Heritage Center in 1987, the Centro sits on Tenochtitlán, the old Aztec capital.  It’s where Hernán Cortés toppled the ruler Cuauhtémoc, creating the basis for modern Mexico.For years, Centro was in decline, due in part to a huge 1985 earthquake. But it recently began repopulating. The city has also pedestrianized various streets, creating new shopping and nightlife zones. Meanwhile, a foundation backed by Mexican Billionaire Carlos Slim has fixed-up building facades.And many Mexicans, as well as foreigners, are taking advantage.""There’s an intense reunion of the people of Mexico City and the country with the Centro Histórico,"" said Inti Muñoz, director of the Mexico City Centro Histórico Trust.Last year, Muñoz’s organization released ""The New Guide of Mexico’s Centro Histórico,"" which intermingles images of hipster bars, mariachis, remodeled plazas and neighborhood characters, like the female luchadora ""Heart of Fire.""Fashion Scene Booms in Hipster TijuanaJust north of Centro Historico’s core sits Tepito, the city’s most notorious neighborhood. Tepito’s known for sales of stolen electronics, drugs and other illegal goods.""They’ll rape you, they’ll rob you,"" said local Lourdes Ruíz about the area’s sometimes far-fetched reputation.But it also has its own distinct culture. Ruiz is the champion of ""albures,"" statements with double meaning, usually with sexual undertones, that is a popular pastime in the area. Countless Mexican and foreign media, including the BBC, have profiled her.Alfonso Hernández, a neighborhood historian, occasionally runs tours here from his office, the Center for Tepito Studies. Upon request, he guides groups around the neighborhood according to their interests: the informal economy, Tepiteño food and historical sites.""Tepito is one of the epicenters of this chaotic city, but Tepito is not a mess like Michoacán, other places, Ciudad Juárez,"" he said.Tepito inspires many myths. It’s said everyone gets robbed (not so, said Hernández). Others believe the police don’t operate here. (They’re here, but have no real power, said Hernández).Nude Feud Divides Mexicana Flight Attendants Turned Calendar GirlsForeigners, yes, need to be careful. But as long as they avoid certain streets, they should be fine, he said.Hernández recently toured a large group from a Swiss urban research organization. They’d spoken to other officials, who recommended they check out the neighborhood.""Someone said to them, 'This is pure fantasy,'"" he said.

          World’s Largest Yoga Class?
        Mexico City's Zócalo, one of the largest public squares in the world, was the setting for the biggest yoga class on record.The Ahhmmms were defeaning.More than 12,000 people took to Mexico City’s Zócalo, the huge central square usually used for political protests and national celebrations, on Sunday.The non-profit organization Naam Yoga claims that is was the largest yoga class known to man.The throng of yoga enthusiasts was led by Naam Yoga founder Dr. Joseph Michael Levry and engaged in the popular Naam Yoga prayer, a mantra that consists of the prayer of love, peace and light.“This truly was an explosion of joy and happiness,” said Rebeca Torres, founder and president of Naam Mexico. “Many of us were touched and transformed.”Torres says Naam Yoga is perhaps what the Mexican government is lacking to make things better politically.“Vibrating Naam in love, peace and light can change the destiny of our country,” Torres said.The practice of Yoga has made increasing inroads into Mexican society --sometimes in the most unexpected places. A yoga program in Mexican prisons is helping juvenile inmates break the cycle of violence and addiction.Yoga instructor Ann Moxey created the Parinaama yoga program for inmates held in the Arlacholoaya prison in Cuernavaca, Morelos, a town located south of Mexico City. The program is also offered in multiple juvenile jails and one adult prison.Moxey  is hopeful about the healing possibilities through Yoga, even when dealing with kids who have been affected by, and succumbed to, violence: “If you train them and if you give them the tools, and you give them jobs in which they can give back to society, you actually close the energetic circle and what used to be the problem is now the solution.”Levry too believes that yoga can change the world for the better.“This prescriptive form of yoga contains tools to directly benefit every biological system while being mentally and spiritually uplifting,” Levry said.You can reach Alexandra Gratereaux at: Alexandra.Gratereaux@foxnewslatino.com or via Twitter: @GalexLatinoFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino"

          (2006 Getty Images)When gunshots awoke Juan Carlos Fajardo at 3 a.m., the police arrived at his gate in five minutes flat—a major improvement, he said, from the days when the cops would take too long or never show.“Before, you’d call and they wouldn’t come, and now they come right away,” said Fajardo, who recently placed a sticker on his fridge with the numbers of the officers charged with guarding his neighborhood, Militar Marte.Mexico City’s police are working overtime to change their image with a public that has long doubted, disrespected and even reviled law enforcement. Police in the country’s capital city have reorganized to be more responsive and have instituted a new program requiring cops to get to know the neighbors.Police sectors, previously divided into 10-square-mile chunks, have been redrawn this year into one-square-mile areas or smaller. There are now 918 new quadrants, and officers in charge in each of three daily shifts are knocking on doors to introduce themselves. They are handing out flyers and stickers with their photos and cell phone numbers.Officer Pedro Curiel is in charge of a quadrant that includes Mexico City’s Zona Rosa, a popular spot for dance clubs, sex shops and some of the city’s seedier nightlife. A Nextel cell phone is tucked into a compartment in his vest, and people have been calling.“In my zone, now the people know me,” he said. “Now they have more confidence in us and us in them.”Since the city’s quadrants were redrawn in April and police began officially meeting residents in June, there are marked improvements in response times and community relations, say police. They are catching more suspects and crime is down.The incidence of “high-impact crimes”—which include armed robbery, assault, auto theft and other violent crime—has fallen 12.5 percent from 2010, according to Pedro Ibarra Díaz Trujillo, who heads up analysis and control in police operations. And whereas police used to apprehend a suspect in fewer than 8 percent of cases, they are now catching suspects in 20 percent of cases. Ibarra attributes both improvements to the new “Quadrant System,” as it is called here.An Image ProblemBut some say the police’s tarnished image in Mexico City won’t be so easily polished.Two officers stopped by the Estetica Roma barbershop about two weeks ago and introduced themselves to barber Roberto Cuatepitzi. They let him know they were “at his service,” and he saved their phone numbers in a little book on the countertop littered with combs and scissors.Still, Cuatepitzi says his still has “many doubts” about the police, “especially when they are looking for a way to detain and extort you,” he said. “It’s very annoying.”In the past three years, 6,500 city cops have been fired for failing anti-corruption tests.The “Quadrant Systems” program, as it has been dubbed by police, cost 4.5 million pesos to implement, or about $350,000, according to Ibarra. That price tag included the distribution of cell phones to the officers in charge of each quadrant (outgoing calls are limited and records are kept to prevent misuse) and a computer system that lets headquarters monitor officers’ movements around the city, as well as additional training to hone officers’ ability to interact with residents—since most of the 19,000 police involved in the new system were accustomed to simply patrolling.Gustavo Fondevila, an expert in public security with Mexico City’s CIDE research institute, notes that past attempts to improve the police image—including the creation of a special “citizens protection unit”—have generated little more than a temporary bump in confidence.“It helped them improve their image, which soon after hit the floor again,” he said in an emailed response to questions. “People are in such need of confidence that they’ll accept anything, even though it rapidly loses its effect.”Other problems persist: police officers’ general lack of education and abysmal salaries, among them, residents say. A Mexico City cop earns an average of 8,000 pesos monthly, or about $600.Fajardo said he has “had good and bad experiences” with the police but notes that pervasive impunity in Mexico makes trusting law enforcement difficult.“If you go to the U.S., police are respected,” he said. “But we Mexicans have a certain impunity. It’s very sad that we don’t have a culture of mutual respect.”Lauren Villagran is a freelance journalist in Mexico City. Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino"

The seaweed invasion, which appears to have hit most of the Caribbean this year, is generally considered a nuisance and has prompted some hotel cancellations from tourists but scientists consider washed-up seaweed an important part of the coastal eco-system and plays a role in beach nourishment although some scientists have also associated the large quantities of seaweed this year in the Caribbean region with higher than normal temperatures and low winds, both of which influence ocean currents, and they draw links to global climate change.

Everyone who comes here has come to take part.”Initially participants hoped to break the U.S. record for more number of people in one selfie – which stands at 2,997 people. But the Guinness official said they were not properly set up to break that record.“I’m not judging that event,” Guinness World Record judge Alexander Angert said, according to Fusion. “That’s not a record that we’re measuring.”More On This...A look at the horses and jockeys that have won the Triple CrownEast meets West, fashionably, at NYC’s Met GalaBest pix of the weekSo they improvised, Rodriguez said, and attempted to instead break the record for most consecutive selfies taken in one place.“(I came) because I think it’s something fun, I don’t know, it’s like an expression,” said participant Michelle Roque. “Coming out to take photos, a community photo, and coming out smiling, happy.”The unofficial tally of 756 selfies captured in sequence is pending Guinness approval, but seems to shatter the the previous record of 531 selfies.Mexico has a long history of seeking to break world records, including the world’s largest meatball, the most people kissing simultaneously (39,897 people on Valentine’s Day 2009), and the largest display of public nudeness.Other world records include most “Thriller” dancers honoring the late Michael Jackson with 13,597 people dancing to the hit song, world’s largest tamale and largest taco line.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"

          (2013 Getty Images)The woman in charge of the organization that chooses Miss Mexico said she is considering pulling the country from the Miss Universe pageant because of Donald Trump's controversial comments last week.Former Miss Universe Lupita Jones, who became the first Mexican to win the crown in 1991, said on Twitter that she is concerned about her country’s participation in the annual competition after the presidential candidate said during his campaign launch that Mexico doesn't send its best to the U.S., instead the country sends drugs, crime and rapists. Jones is national director of Nuestra Belleza Mexico, which chooses its country's Miss Universe representative.“Following the first statements made by Donald Trump, where he openly showed his enmity with Mexico… I got in touch with the organization’s president Paula Shugart to find out their position on Mexico’s representative,” Jones wrote in Spanish.Jones has not said if Wendy Esparza, the 23-year-old journalist set to represent Mexico later this year, will be removed from the competition, but she would seriously considering doing so if she feels the beauty queen will be denigrated during the competition.“In the moment that I feel that our representative’s integrity and dignity is at risk, I will consider Wendy’s participation in Miss Universe,” she wrote on Twitter.Trump, who made several references to his wealth during his kick off speech, said Mexico was “killing” the economy of the U.S.""Nobody can build a fence like me. I would build a wall like nobody can build a wall. And nobody comes in illegally anymore…I build great buildings all over the world. I would have Mexico pay for it. Believe me,” he said. “They will pay for it because they have really ripped this country off.”Ximena Navarrete, a Mexican who was Miss Universe 2010, said she believes Trump made the comments about Mexico because of a spat he had with a Mexican businessman.“I am not going to say bad things about someone who has treated me well. I understand that he has a situation with someone from a long time ago, some debt, someone who owes him money since 2007,” she told TVyNovelas. “I think that is the root of his anger but I also stand up for Mexicans.”She said while she respects Trump, she also understands why so many Mexicans are angry over his comments.“I am one, I’m a punctual, honest, and hardworking woman,” she told the Mexican magazine. “I understand both parts here, and I’m always going to defend that, the Mexican people.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"

          (Getty)MEXICO CITY (AP) – Mexico has become the first developing nation to submit pollutant reduction goals for next fall's Paris climate change talks, pledging Friday to cut greenhouse gas and short-lived climate pollutants 25 percent by 2030.Short-lived pollutants include ""black carbon,"" essentially soot produced by burning wood, dung, coal and some diesel fuel, which Mexico plans to cut by half. Soot reductions would account for 3 percent of the overall 2030 target, while greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane would be cut 22 percent from 2103 levels.Mexico's Environment Department said the country's total greenhouse emissions would peak and stop growing in absolute terms by 2026.Activists and the U.S. government praised Mexico's announcement.""While the devil is in the details, Mexico's plan to peak its emissions by 2026 is particularly encouraging and should inspire others to follow a similar course,"" wrote Jennifer Morgan, global director of the World Resources Institute's climate program.More On This...Science And Politics Get Worrisome Balance In UN Climate ReportKerry to attend U.N. climate talks in Peru as U.S. insists it’s reducing emissionsBrazil says it won’t sign global forest initiative, centerpiece of U.N. climate summitLatinos Overwhelmingly Oppose Keystone XL Pipeline, Group ClaimsUN climate talks in Peru deadlocked as wealthy nations resist scope of demandsBest pix of the weekMexico acknowledged its pledge is ""highly ambitious,"" like a promise to eliminate deforestation completely by 2030. Between 2005 and 2010, Mexico lost about 155,000 hectares (383,000 acres) of vegetation cover each year to deforestation.Mexico also said its pledge for decreases could rise to as much as 40 percent of current emissions if broader international agreements are reached at the Nov. 30-Dec. 11 climate conference in Paris or subsequent rounds of talks.Mexico said any additional emission cuts would be ""subject to a global agreement addressing important topics including international carbon price, carbon border adjustments, technical cooperation, access to low cost financial resources and technology transfer.""Carbon price involves making polluters pay for their emissions and border adjustments are meant to ensure those carbon taxes are spread fairly. Developing countries like Mexico have also called for mitigation of climate change effects and low-cost financing and technology to help bring emissions down.Mexican Foreign Relations Secretary Jose Antonio Meade said, ""This announcement makes Mexico the first emerging market and the first developing country to make a tentative pledge to the Paris Accord.""The White House said in a statement that Mexico and the United States will launch a ""high-level bilateral clean energy and climate change policy task force"" this spring. The joint U.S.-Mexico effort will focus on ""clean energy, grid modernizations, appliance standards and energy efficiency"" as well as more fuel-efficient vehicle fleets.Mexico must cut emissions even as its economy and population are growing. The goal of a 25 percent reduction in absolute terms means a 40 percent reduction of emissions relative to its projected GDP in 2030.Mexico, which represents only 1.4 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions, is among the more vulnerable nations if nothing is done, the government said.""In the last 50 years, Mexico has experienced changes in temperature and mean precipitation,"" its pledge presentation said. ""At the same time, Mexico has suffered an increased number of extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones, floods and droughts that have led to the loss of human lives as well as high social and economic costs.""Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"
80,"MEXICO CITY (AP) – Mexican authorities will use satellite tracking, drones, three naval bases and a fleet of small patrol boats to enforce a new gillnet fishing ban in the upper Sea of Cortes in a bid to save the critically endangered vaquita marina, the world's smallest porpoise.Environment Department official Rafael Pacchiano said Friday that the $37 million plan will go into effect later in March and will last at least two years, after which it will be evaluated.The plan would compensate fishermen for stopping the use of gillnets, which often sweep up the tiny porpoises along with their catch.In a statement, the World Wildlife Fund praised the measures, saying they were the most serious steps taken in the last two decades to protect the vaquita.But the group said the ban must be well enforced and fisherman must be trained in the use of alternate nets that won't trap the vaquitas. Some fishermen will be recruited to help enforcement efforts under the plan.More On This...Mexico City demonstrators call for justice for missing students, Pres. Peña Nieto’s resignationMexico outraged over 43 missing students, thousands take to the streets in national strikeThere are fewer than 100 of the elusive porpoises left in the Sea of Cortez, also known as the Gulf of California, the only place on Earth where they are found.The vaquita is threatened by gillnet fishing for totoaba, a huge, heavy fish whose swim bladder is prized by chefs in China.There is already a protected reserve area around the mouth of the Colorado River delta, but the new proposal would greatly increase the no net-fishing area southward to encompass almost all of Baja California state's coast on the gulf.Experts agree that capturing vaquitas to breed them in captivity isn't an option because it would not be feasible to capture or hold a sufficient number of them to develop a captive breeding program. Furthermore, with so few vaquitas spread over such a wide area, chasing down and catching them would risk killing off the few remaining individuals.Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"
81,"Inside the entrance to the Jardines de Humaya Cemetery in the Mexican city of Culiacán are rows of bland, unadorned slabs that serve as the gravestones of the city's poor. Continue walking deeper into the graveyard and these rows give way to hulking two story behemoths that look more like modern condominiums than they do places to bury the dead.These are the narco-mausoleums, the final resting places for some of Mexico's most notorious drug traffickers, and they come replete with air conditioning, wireless Internet, state-of-the art sound systems and some with bedrooms for visiting family members.""Most of these tombs are nicer than my [expletive] house,"" a Culiacán taxi driver told a reporter for Fusion when visiting the cemetery.Across Mexico, which has been looked in a vicious and seemingly never-ending drug war that has claimed the lives of more than 100,000 people, these massive over-the-top mausoleums are being built to hold their over-the-top owners when they eventually met their untimely demise.Arturo Beltrán Leyva, the eponymous former head of the Beltrán Leyva cartel, is buried in a $650,000 mausoleum in Jardines de Humaya that looks like it could stand in for a castle on ""Game of Thrones."" Turrets and massive crosses adorned the brilliant, white exterior while the interior features WiFi, satellite television, 24-hour-a-day air conditioning, two bedrooms, a kitchen and a burglar alarm.Known as the ""boss of bosses,"" Beltrán Leyva was killed in 2009 during a raid by 200 Mexican troops with two tanks and two military helicopters. During his funeral his henchmen learned the name of one of the soldiers who participated in the raid and went on to murder his entire family in an act of revenge.Beltrán Leyva's dead body may have some pretty swanky digs in which to rest, but his mausoleum pales in comparison to Arturo Guzmán Loera's massive grave.The brother of Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán, once the richest and most powerful drug trafficker in the world, Arturo was stabbed to death by his lawyer's bodyguard after he was accused of snitching to the cops.Snitch or not, when you're the brother of the most powerful drug boss in the world you aren't going to have your dead body just dumped in a ditch. Instead Chapo shelled out a reported $1.2 million to build his brother's final resting site.Resembling an entire suburban street, Guzmán's burial complex features five separate buildings, one for each of the Guzmán brothers (Chapo is the only one still alive). All five of the buildings have air conditioning, 24-hour surveillance, two stories and en-suite bedrooms for family members.While one would think that at least in death these drug traffickers could escape the violence and revenge that plagues the life they choose, that is sadly not the case. In 2010, a human head was put on the grave of one notorious drug trafficker, while the rest of the body was found discarded next to another drug lord's tomb.Despite the posh digs, life after death for Mexican drug lords seems to be less ""rest in peace"" than ""rest in pieces.""Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"

(David Tuggy/Wikicommons)MEXICO CITY (AP) – An effort was planned for Thursday to recover a body found buried in snow and ice high on Mexico's tallest peak, officials said.The expedition would begin before dawn, according to the Puebla state press office. Climbers found the body Sunday at an elevation of about 17,400 feet on the north face of the Pico de Orizaba volcano.Investigators requested the help of climbers to recover the body.Hilario Aguilar, president of the Mexican Alpine Club in Chalchicomula de Sesma, confirmed the discovery and said Wednesday that the body appeared to be mummified. Aguilar said it could be that of a mountain climber but he did not know of any climbers unaccounted for in the past 50 years.Judicial authorities said they would be responsible for determining the age and identity, but tests cannot be conducted on the mountain.There have been several instances of bodies turning up in glaciers decades after a person disappeared. Freezing or desiccation sometimes preserves bodies in a state similar to mummification.The volcano on the border of Puebla and Veracruz states in south-central Mexico stands at an elevation of 18,406 feet according to Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography.Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"

          A small-town festival queen had her crown and scepter taken away from her. Again.Angelina Vigil was dethroned as La Reina de la Fiesta (“Queen of the Festival”) in Española because of an online post in which she came down hard on the town of 10,000 people in northern New Mexico.Vigil’s problems began last week, when her mother’s house was broken into and the crown and scepter that have been used by La Reina since 1969 were stolen out of her bedroom.Although the items were recovered in a couple of days, the 24-year-old took to Facebook to complain, beginning her post, “I seriously hate coming to this effin’ town.” (The post has since been deleted.)Vigil went on to detail the robbery, how the burglars left every drawer and cabinet open and dumped clothing on the floor before taking off with flat-screen TVs and other electronics as well as the crown and scepter.More On This...Best pix of the weekMiss Universe crown goes to ColombiaMiss Universe 2015: Meet the Latinas vying for the crownAZ man in sanctuary gets stay of deportation, can spend Father’s Day with his kidsEvangelical Latinos display their growing power at D.C. prayer breakfast“My guess as to why this happened is because I was crowned and I represent the valley,” Vigil later told the Santa Fe New Mexican.The community, which was focused on finding the items, suddenly turned on the queen and the Fiesta Council took action.“The Executive Council of the Fiesta Council has motioned to dismiss the 2015 La Reina de Española, Angelina Vigil,” the Española Valley Fiesta council posted on its Facebook page on Saturday, 20 minutes before midnight. “There will be no Reina for this year.”Vigil, however, said the post was blown out of context.“I meant [to say] I hate what goes on here,” she said, “not that I hate all the people in Española.”At a Fiesta Council meeting on Friday night, according to the Albuquerque Journal, Vigil gave a tear-filled apology for the post, saying, “What was said was out of feelings of hurt by the actions of a few people.”“This however doesn’t define me,” she wrote a couple of days later on Facebook, “[nor defines] the heart I have for my loved ones and the people where I’m from.”The Española Valley Fiesta, a tradition that began in 1933 as a way of commemorating the arrival in the region of the Spanish conquistador Juan de Oñate, will be held July 9 to 12 this year.

Sanchez.The civil rights advocate was born in Albuquerque in 1906 and worked as a teacher before becoming one of the nation's most influential Latino scholars. His 1940 classic ""Forgotten People"" was one of the first studies to document how Hispanics were losing land and influence to poverty.A political fight later forced him out of New Mexico.

86,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP)  – A noted Mexican-American scholar and civil rights advocate whose name graces educational institutions in Texas and California but is virtually unknown in his hometown of Albuquerque is on track to receive the honor from a New Mexico school.An Albuquerque Public Schools committee voted Wednesday to name a new kindergarten through eighth-grade school for George I. Sanchez, a key figure in the struggle to end segregation of black and Mexican-American students during the 1950s.""I'm so excited that he's finally going to get to come back home,"" said Cindy Kennedy, 51, a Santa Fe teacher and a granddaughter of Sanchez, who died in 1972. ""This has been a long time coming.""District officials said Sanchez's name beat out Albert Einstein and City View as the title for the new school on ballots sent to families living in the school's attendance area. The school will be located in the largely immigrant and Mexican-American southwest area of the city.Born in Albuquerque in 1906, the son of an Arizona miner worked his way out of poverty as a rural public-school teacher in New Mexico to become one of the most influential Latino scholars and education activists in the nation. Sanchez developed his theories on school inequalities using New Mexico's Hispanic and Navajo populations as examples.More On This...He argued that bilingual students faced discrimination by school systems that used only English and testified in landmark court cases about the negative effects of segregation and IQ testing on Hispanic, American Indian and black children.His 1940 classic ""Forgotten People"" was one of the first studies to document how Hispanics were losing land and influence to poverty and white encroachment.The book drew attention from the University of Texas, which eventually offered Sanchez a job. There, he wrote other books, became a national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens and corresponded with Thurgood Marshall on desegregation strategy.A dozen or so schools in Texas and California are named after Sanchez, but there are none in New Mexico, the state with the largest percentage of Hispanics in the nation and one that celebrates its Hispanic past.He is not listed among the state's notable figures in New Mexico Centennial guidebooks.After a 2012 Associated Press story on Sanchez and how he was an unknown figure in New Mexico, a group of current and retired educators began pushing for more recognition of Sanchez.The New Mexico Association for Bilingual Education, for example, honored Sanchez in 2013 with an award recognizing a New Mexican who has made a significant contribution to bilingual education.But the group failed to persuade the Santa Fe school board to name a new school after Sanchez.The Albuquerque school is believed to the first named after Sanchez in New Mexico. The full Albuquerque school board next needs to approve the proposal in a vote that could come as early as next week.Carlos Blanton, author of ""George I. Sanchez: The Long Fight for Mexican American Integration"" and a history professor at Texas A&M University, said naming a school after Sanchez will go a long way in securing his legacy in New Mexico.""School names are enduring,"" Blanton said. ""So it's really heartwarming that George I. Sanchez is going to be remembered in Albuquerque after all these years.""Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"
87,"Even before the High Line opened in 2009, it inspired copycats. Groups in Chicago, Philadelphia and other cities dreamed of their own versions of Manhattan’s elevated garden walkway – and now Mexico City has its own project off and running.The capital plans to build a broad, blooming path across two major urban arteries.“The High Line in New York seemed to me a fresh breath of air, completely,” says Daniel Escotto Sánchez, the general coordinator for the city’s Public Space Authority, reflecting on his visit there. “Mexico City just needs – within so many streets, so many avenues – respite like this.”The bridge will link a metro station to Chapultepec Forest, the city’s most prominent and expansive park, complete with a castle, numerous museums and several lakes. The path leads into a section with picnic areas, known for kids’ parties and family get-togethers. Aesthetically, the visions bear obvious resemblance. A recent Mexico City rendering shows people strolling along a gray path adorned with tall green and yellow grasses that protrude out, almost wildly, from the sides. Escotto Sánchez says New York's High Line got his wheels turning when he first strolled through it the year it opened. (He’d actually heard of it beforehand, through a friend who works for James Corner Field Operations, the project’s lead design studio.)There are obvious differences between his vision and its predecessor, Escotto Sánchez says – first and foremost that he’s not redeveloping an existing structure. The High Line was a train track, and plans in other cities call for re-imagining former freight lines.Escotto Sánchez sees his bridge as an “arm of the forest,” which he hopes to landscape with plants already found in Chapultepec. RiForest to the ght now, Metro users must traverse a combination of steep steps, busy roads and generally not-family-friendly passageways to enter the park.“They confront many obstacles,” says Escotto Sánchez. “[They come] with tricycles, with water for picnics, with food, with grandma, with children – with everything.”The bridge will eventually pass under a new, elevated highway, yet to be completed at this point. OHL México, a transportation construction company building that road, will finance the garden walkway as part of its contract for that project, according to Escotto Sánchez. He says the project will cost roughly $4.3 million. He estimates it will take four months to build and hopes to begin construction around this coming December or January.Beyond building from scratch, Escotto Sánchez’s plan stands out in another way: his public office is the driving force behind the project, whereas citizens' groups have spurred efforts in places like New York City, Chicago and Philadelphia.By creating a walkway above and below roads, Escotto Sánchez says he’s reminding the city that pedestrians also deserve respect and resources.“What we don’t want is that they have to go up stairs,” he says. “What we want is a message that says the walker has the same dignity as the vehicle.”Ruth Samuelson is a freelance writer living in Mexico City.

          MEXICO CITY (AP) – The number of Monarch butterflies that reached wintering grounds in Mexico has rebounded 69 percent from last year's lowest-on-record levels, but their numbers remain very low, according to the World Wildlife Fund.Last year, the Monarchs covered only 1.65 acres (0.67 hectares), the smallest area since record-keeping began in 1993.This year, the butterflies rebounded, to cover 2.79 acres (1.13 hectares), according to a formal census by Mexican environmental authorities and scientists released Tuesday.The orange-and-black butterflies are suffering from loss of milkweed habitat in the United States, illegal logging in Mexico and climate change. Each year, the butterflies make a migration from Canada to Mexico and find the same pine and fir forests to spend the winter, even though no butterfly lives to make the round trip.""Of course it is good news that the forest area occupied by Monarchs this season increased,"" said Omar Vidal, head of the World Wildlife Fund in Mexico. ""But let*s be crystal clear, 1.13 hectares is very, very low, and it is still the second-smallest forest surface occupied by this butterfly in 22 years of monitoring.""More On This...Blizzard, really?: Winter storm not as bad as expectedStunning Monarch Butterfly Sanctuary in MexicoAt their peak in 1996, the Monarchs covered more than 44.5 acres (18 hectares) in the mountains west of Mexico City.Lincoln Brower, a leading entomologist at Sweet Briar College in Virginia, has said that with anything below 2 hectares (4.1 acres), ""they will remain in the danger category and I will continue to be concerned. "" A population covering 4 or 5 hectares (9 to 12 acres) would be a sign of significant recovery, he added.The butterfly population has plummeted before, and then partially recovered.In 2001, driving rain and bitter cold killed millions, leading scientists to speculate that migrating populations would be seriously depleted in 2002. To their surprise, twice as many returned as some had predicted.In 2004, unfavorable weather, pollution and deforestation caused a drastic decline in the population, but the next year, the butterflies bounced back.But the overall tendency since 1993 points to a steep, progressive decline. Each time the Monarchs rebound, they do so at lower levels. The species is found in many countries and is not in danger of extinction, but experts fear the migration could be disrupted if very few butterflies make the trip.The temperate climate of the mountains west of Mexico City normally creates an ideal setting for the Monarchs. Every fall, tens of millions of the delicate creatures fly thousands of miles to their ancestral breeding grounds, creating clouds of butterflies. They clump together on trees, forming chandelier shapes of orange and black.The migration is an inherited trait: No butterfly lives to make the full round trip, and it is unclear how they find the route back to the same patch of forest each year. Some scientists suggest the butterflies may release chemicals marking the migratory path and fear that if their numbers fall too low, the chemical traces will not be strong enough for others to follow.Extreme cold and drought also hurt butterfly populations, and in Mexico, illegal logging can punch holes in the forest canopy that shelters them, creating a situation in which cold rainfall could kill millions.Vidal said Mexico has been able to essentially stop illegal logging in the Monarch protected reserve, but he said habitat loss in the United States remains a huge problem. Milkweed, the butterflies' main source of food has been crowded out by pesticide-resistant crops.""The question we should all be asking now"" is whether the U.S. can halt the loss of milkweed habitat, he said.Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"
89,"As millions of Americans head to Cinco de Mayo parties throughout the United States this weekend, the Fifth of May barely registers south of the border and it remains something of a mystery how the anniversary of an 1862 battle in Mexico turned into a celebration of all things Latino in the U.S.The battle marked a turning point in Mexico’s fight against French forces who invaded the country after President Benito Juarez suspended interest payments to foreign creditors, chiefly France and Britain. The battle, in the state of Puebla, paved the way to the withdrawal of French forces four years later. Emperor Maximilian, installed by the French as the leader of the “Second Mexican Empire,” was executed in 1867.“In the States, people think it’s a big celebration — down here, and it’s not.”— Grant Cogswell, an American expatriate in MexicoLittle or any of this is reflected in the Cinco de Mayo parties in the United States. For college students in particular, the day often features large quantities of beer, tequila and sombreros.In Mexico, it is commemorated every year with a military parade in the colonial city of Puebla, 70 miles southeast of Mexico City. This weekend, President Enrique Peña Nieto will preside over celebrations involving 13,000 troops, battle re-enactors, local residents and an Air Force flyover.Elsewhere in the country, it is barely noticed.“We don’t really celebrate here, except for people from Puebla,” said retiree Alejandro Lopez. “I, for one, will be taking my dog for a walk. That’s it.”Luis Garavito, who works at a popular Irish pub, said Cinco de Mayo was just like any other holiday – people enjoying a day off.But for some residents here, the different ways the date is marked south and north of the border show how little Americans know about their southern neighbor.“In the States, people think it’s a big celebration — down here, and it’s not,” said Grant Cogswell, an American expatriate who owns a book store in the capital’s fashionable Condesa neighborhood.“In the States, Cinco de Mayo is a bar and restaurant promotion thing. Lots of guacamole and drinks.”And rarely a mention of a historic battle in Mexico. Celebrations on the National Mall in Washington this weekend, for example, are being promoted as “an event with food from Latin America, dancers, children’s art, crafts and more.”Eric Rojo, a dual U.S.-Mexican citizen who was involved in organizing last year’s celebrations to mark the 150th anniversary of the Puebla battle, said it would take a long time for Cinco de Mayo to be recognized in the United States for what it signifies.“It’s not a Latino holiday. It’s not a Hispanic holiday. It’s a Mexican holiday,” he said with an irritated tone. But he’s optimistic that, little by little, more people will actually one day celebrate history and not just margaritas.Cogswell agrees, noting that social media is helping to get the picture right.“Every year on Facebook, millions of people learn about what Cinco de Mayo really is. Hopefully, in 25 years everyone will know it.”Meanwhile, most Americans still equate Cinco de Mayo to their Fourth of July. But the country’s actual independence day, the leading national holiday, is September 16, a date that marks the beginning of Mexico’s War of Independence against Spanish colonial rule in 1810. The country became independent in 1821.Exactly how and when Cinco de Mayo turned into a big event in the U.S. is something of a puzzle.“Cinco de Mayo was created in the U.S. for the U.S.,” Latin American experts Julie Barlow and Jean-Benoit Nadeau wrote in an essay in the Wall Street Journal today.“No one knows exactly why Hispanics in California began celebrating Cinco de Mayo at the end of the 1860s…What we do know is that in the 1970s cultural organizers in San Francisco selected Cinco de Mayo from among a slate of holidays,” they wrote.For Jose Ortiz, a Puebla-based anthropologist for Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History, a detailed understanding of history is not a matter of overriding importance.“Like all things, the meaning of the holiday becomes transformed over time and now it is taken as a symbol of Latin culture in general,” he said.""There will always be a minority who is well informed, and a majority that uses it to suit their purposes,"" Ortiz added. “It's important that people celebrate, even without a real understanding of Cinco de Mayo's historical context."""

          Tourists walk past large quantities of seaweed piling up on the beach in the Mexican resort city of Cancún, Mexico, Wednesday, July 15, 2015. The seaweed invasion, which appears to have hit most of the Caribbean this year, is generally considered a nuisance and has prompted some hotel cancellations from tourists but scientists consider washed-up seaweed an important part of the coastal eco-system and plays a role in beach nourishment although some scientists have also associated the large quantities of seaweed this year in the Caribbean region with higher than normal temperatures and low winds, both of which influence ocean currents, and they draw links to global climate change.

          MEXICO CITY (AP) – Authorities on Mexico's Caribbean coast said Monday they are redoubling efforts to remove tons of sargassum seaweed that has been washing ashore in recent weeks.The state government of Quintana Roo, where the resort of Cancún is located, said there have been no reports of tourists cancelling visits because of the problem.Gov. Roberto Borge said the seaweed removal efforts will focus on much of the coast, from Holbox in the north down past Tulum to the south.Photos issued by the Cancún city government show piles of brown seaweed on some normally pristine white beaches. By last week, the city said it had raked or shoveled up 500 cubic meters of sargassum.Borge said the cause of the invasion is still unknown, though it could be due to high levels of nutrients in ocean water or changes in ocean temperatures, currents or wind patterns.More On This...Best pix of the weekJobless Mexicana Flight Attendants Pose for CalendarMexicana Flight Attendants Turned Calendar Girls Feud after SuccessAuthorities have to be careful, because there are two groups of visitors they don't want to disturb with overly aggressive removal efforts: nesting sea turtles that return to the Caribbean beaches to lay their eggs, and tourists.Borge said the effort would take care not to cause erosion on the beaches, which has been a problem in Cancún in the past.The government announced the formation of a task force of naval and environmental authorities to study the problem. Authorities are also researching ways to use or dispose of the seaweed mounds.Sargassum is an algae that grows in the Sargasso Sea, a large body of warm water in the mid-Atlantic.Officials in the Caribbean island of Barbados have also struggled with seaweed washing ashore, and large piles of sargassum washed up on the shore in Galveston, Texas, in 2014 after drifting into the Gulf of Mexico.Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"

          Spring Break in Cancun
        Even with the negative publicity Mexico is getting because of cartel killings, Cancun is still the spring break Mecca for thousands of Americans. Gorgeous, bikini-clad Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders hitting the sunny beaches of Puerto Vallarta is Mexico’s latest chest-thumping tourism moment.Stung by bad press over its cartel violence, and a travel warning issued by the US State Department, Mexico is trumpeting the number of spring breakers it received this year. The number rose 7.2 percent despite the travel warning.Mexico's Tourism Department notes with some satisfaction that tourists arriving during March included some highly regarded Texans, including the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders. They agency says they did a calendar shoot on Mexico's Caribbean coast.A Tuesday announcement from the department says 77,000 young tourists visited Mexico on spring break trips between March 5 and 30.In early March, the Texas Department of Public Safety advised students on spring break to avoid Mexico, citing violence.Overall, the number of U.S. tourists visiting Mexico in March totaled 382,376, young and old. That is a 7.3 percent increase from 2011.While American tourism to Mexico slipped 3 percent last year, the country remains by far the biggest tourist destination for Americans, with about 20 million U.S. visitors a year, according to annual survey of bookings by the largest travel agencies. It's as if the entire populations of New York City, Los Angeles, Houston, Philadelphia and Phoenix all went to Mexico for vacation each year.And for those Americans who do stay away, it appears that it's also finances, not just violence, that's to blame. The U.S. Department of Commerce reports that the economic recession forced 4 percent fewer Americans to travel abroad in 2011 compared with 2010.While some can't afford the trip, others do stay home out of fear.The U.S. State Department warns of ""gun battles in broad daylight"" as Mexican drug dealers fight to control the lucrative trade in marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine that reaps an estimated $25 billion in U.S. sales each year.Mexican officials say 47,515 people were killed in narcotics-related violence in Mexico between Dec. 1, 2006, and Sept. 30, 2011. Most were people involved in the drug trade, but the number of U.S. citizens murdered in Mexico increased from 35 in 2007 to 120 in 2011.Certain areas are more dangerous than others, the State Department says. Tourists are advised to stay near resorts and not to travel at night in the resorts of Acapulco and Mazatlán, for example. And in February, 22 Carnival Cruise Lines passengers were robbed at gunpoint during a shore excursion near the Mexico seaside resort of Puerto Vallarta.Cancún, however, has remained relatively unscathed. And millions of Americans still come, especially during spring break, when the town becomes a weeks-long party.Mexican and U.S. law enforcement officials say the region is relatively free of violence because trafficking in the area is controlled almost exclusively by just one cartel, the Zetas, a brutal and high-tech gang founded by rogue Mexican Army special forces who deserted their units and entered the drug trade. In contrast to many other areas of Mexico, the Zetas are virtually uncontested in Cancún, Latin America security analyst Samuel Logan says.""The area is safe because Los Zetas control the area and are too dug in for their rivals to fight them for it,"" he said in an email.Logan said the cartel maintains control over the region by shaking down business owners, forcing them to pay for ""protection"" or risk attacks. He said the cartel likely has far more weapons and power than local law enforcement, and that they're likely paying off politicians and police.""Extortion is the name of the game,"" said security consultant Walter McKay in Mexico City.Based on reporting by The Associated Press.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino"

          (2013 Getty Images)VATICAN CITY (AP)  – Pope Francis' casual speaking style has gotten him into diplomatic trouble.The Vatican said Wednesday it had sent a note to Mexico's ambassador insisting that Francis ""absolutely did not intend to hurt the feelings of the Mexican people"" by referring to the ""Mexicanization"" of his native Argentina from drug trafficking.Francis made the reference in an email to an Argentine friend involved in combating the drug trade, who then made it public. Mexico formally complained to the Vatican.In a statement Wednesday, the Vatican said the Pope's words were contained in a personal email and that he had merely repeated a phrase that his friend had used. It said Francis in no way wanted to detract from Mexico's efforts to combat drug trafficking.""The Holy See feels that the term 'Mexicanization' in no way should (be thought to) have a stigmatizing intent toward the people of Mexico and even less so should it be considered a political opinion to the detriment of a nation that is continuing to make a serious effort to eradicate violence and the social causes that give rise to it,"" said the Mexican Embassy to the Holy See.The Mexican Embassy to the Vatican on Tuesday sent a communique to the media after Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi sent a letter with these observations to Mexico's envoy to the Holy See, Mariano Palacios Alcocer.In the missive, according to the Mexican Embassy, ""the Holy See acknowledged the excellent ... relations with Mexico"" and confirmed that Pope Francis ""at no time intended to injure the feelings of the Mexican people or the efforts of the country's government.""The remarks of the Holy See come one day after the pontiff expressed his concern over the advance of drug trafficking in his native Argentina in a private letter directed to Buenos Aires lawmaker Gustavo Vera in which he asked that ""the Mexicanization (of Argentina) be avoided.""Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"

          Monterrey, once Mexico's shining economic star, has seen its reputation diminish as extortion, violence and other incidents involving drug cartels have increased.
          (Flickr/gen gibler)Fifteen years ago, Monterrey was Mexico’s boomtown.As the country’s economy started booming, companies flocked there to expand. And thanks to the prestigious Tecnológico de Monterrey, the city had graduates to fill new corporate jobs. Monterrey was considered the country’s business capital – Mexico’s Säo Paolo – and residents considered their metropolis superior, especially when compared to old-fashioned and unsafe Mexico City.But today, Monterrey’s gloating has stopped.With the drug war ravaging northern Mexico, the city’s reputation is slipping as Mexico City’s prospects rise. With violence still surging – bodies have been dumped in the middle of the streets, beheadings are almost common – could Monterrey permanently lose its hard-won prominence?That question today haunts regios, the name for Monterrey’s locals.“What worries me,” says Dr. Jorge Garza Rodríguez, an economics professor at the University of Monterrey “…is young professionals leaving Monterrey because of this crime problem.”Garza Rodríguez says that he suspects young college and masters graduates are starting their careers in other cities, like Mexico City or Merida.“Instead of planning to develop their careers here, they move,” he says.The capital’s Secretary of Economic Development, Laura Velázquez Alzúa, reported earlier this fall that 1,600 businesses from northern Mexico had migrated to Mexico City, due to security concerns, in the last two years.The Federal District also claimed the top spot in a survey on states’ economic competitiveness, released by the Tecnológico de Monterrey last year. Nuevo Leon, Monterrey’s home state, came in second following behind the capital in areas such as government efficiency, infrastructure, business efficiency and global competitiveness.Another Tecnológico de Monterrey study lists the Federal District as the place with the most developed “knowledge economy.” The publication examined aspects such as investment in science and technology; where science and technology workers live; and where patents are solicited.While Garza Rodríguez knows that many people have already left Monterrey, he believes that more companies are contemplating moving, watching to see if the violence worsens or subsides.“If things get as bad as they used to be in Colombia, I will get worried about companies not only not being established here, but leaving,” he says.Of course, people flee in various directions. Aside from migration in Mexico, the United States is also attracting Monterrey residents.  San Antonio and Houston have witnessed new affluent Mexican communities crop up since the drug war began.  Mexicans are able to get visas with a business investment of $500,000 to $1 million, depending on the area, in the United States.So while Mexico City is getting stronger – thanks in part to northern businesses’ migration – its business rival is losing economic resources to various places.Though not immune to drug crime, the capital has avoided Monterrey’s main problems: various high-profile killings; narcobloqueos, traffic blockades orchestrated by cartel members; and anything comparable to the city’s Casino Royale fire, which killed more than 50 people. The Zetas cartel allegedly started the conflagration.One of the principal challenges facing northern companies today is extortion. Thugs reportedly attacked the Casino Royale because its owner refused to make a payoff.Since late summer, various decapitations – allegedly by the criminal group, La Mano con Ojos – have also been reported in the Mexico City area. Drug dealing is common in the region, as is money laundering, according to authorities.“It’s true that today the Federal District (Mexico City) is one of the most secure areas in the country,” said Fernando Oscar García Chávez, president of business organization COPARMEX’s Mexico City group, during a recent speech. Nevertheless, he added, “one shouldn’t let down his guard, nor think that the crimes and grave situations being confronted in other states couldn’t arrive, one day, at our door.”Magazine M Semanal recently analyzed Mexico City’s mostly quiet cartel presence, writing that groups’ violence and financial activities were hard to analyze simply because of the region’s immensity. Moreover, large numbers of federal troops, federal police and private security forces fortify the capital, perhaps dissuading criminals from more public violence.The economic uptick in Mexico City is obvious, says Jack Fraind, president of Mexico City-based Express Relocation, which helps people resettle in various cities around the country.In the last 10 years, he’s seen a significant increase in the number of people moving to the capital, where many insurance and food companies have recently opened offices. He still sees clients arriving in Monterrey and other places up north, but they’re much more concerned about security and finding safe places to live.Offered a job in Toluca or Ciudad Juarez, it seems likely a client would opt for Toluca, says Fraind.“D.F. has heavily increased the volume of not just foreigners, but locals that decided to establish themselves here,” he says.Ruth Samuelson is a freelance journalist based in Mexico City.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino"

          (2013 Getty Images)When the Mexican Congress passed legislation last December to ban the use of animals in circuses across the country, it was meant as a humane response to widespread reports of animal mistreatment. But now the government and the country’s zoos are dealing with the consequences of that decision: What to do with all those circus animals?The law does not take effect until June 8, but many circuses have already shut down, and their owners say they are worried about the fate of some 2,000 tigers, elephants, giraffes, zebras and other exotic beasts who are now out of work and too expensive to keep.""We are waiting for a response from the government about what will happen to our animals,"" Armando Cedeño, president of the national association of circus owners and performers, told Reuters. He added that there are approximately 4,000 circus animals in the country – double government figures.The nationwide ban on circus animals, which came after Mexico City and six states in the country passed similar bans, stipulates that such animals should remain in their natural habitats. The law set fines for violations and required circuses to submit lists of the wildlife they possessed, which would then be made available to zoos interested in taking the animals.The problem is that finding a natural habitat – or even a relatively suitable one – is a difficult task. Even with some privately-owned zoos offering to help the government, Mexico City's director of zoos and wildlife, Juan Arturo Rivera, said it was ""not feasible"" for so many new animals that were raised in such a different environment to be incorporated into zoos and have them maintain decent living conditions for the animals.The animals' living conditions are generally terrible right now as circus owners, zoos and the government figure out what to do with the creatures. Several circus owners who have properties near Mexico City are housing their jaguars, zebras, horses and camels in cages next to trailers filled with circus equipment.One animal tamer, 45-year-old Bruno Raffo, told Reuters that he is sticking around to tend to the 13 tigers that were under his care. It costs around $194 a day to feed them, not including his own salary and the veterinary bills from periodic check-ups.""I'm going to stay here with the animals to see what can be done,"" Raffo said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"

        Image 2 of 2SANTA FE, N.M. – Those classic cars called lowriders are the focus of a summer celebration in Santa Fe.The spotlight on lowrider culture includes exhibitions at the New Mexico History Museum and the New Mexico Museum of Art.The low-to-the ground cars are decked out with hydraulics, chrome and candy-colored paint jobs. The celebration kicked off Sunday when more than 100 lowriders cruised into one of the state's most historic plazas in the heart of Santa Fe.Lowriders have become fixtures across the Southwest. There are some similarities with the cars that cruise the streets in California and Texas, but there are also differences with the culture that has been thriving for decades in New Mexico. The cars have become rolling works of art and symbols of Hispanic cultural identity.""The New Mexico style is a little more focused on family, faith and place,"" said Kate Ware, a curator at the New Mexico Museum of Art. Ware spent more than a year helping to pull together a collection of photographs, sculptures, paintings and videos highlighting the lowrider lifestyle and its connection with religion and community.Of the more than 50 works in the ""Con Carino"" exhibit at the art museum, some date back to the 1970s. The show will run through Oct. 9.At the history museum across the street, there are lowriders, hubcaps, a chromed-out Chevy small block engine and dozens of photographs that capture the essence of lowriding. In one corner is a scale that's used to gauge how high a car can hop, the term used to describe the front end bouncing off the ground, triggered by a custom hydraulic lift system.""Lowriders, Hoppers, and Hot Rods: Car Culture of Northern New Mexico"" will be on display at the history museum through March 5, 2017.Daniel Kosharek, the photo curator at the history museum, said there are people who use cars just for transportation and then there are those who use the cars for self-expression.""Two types of people, two world views,"" he said. ""This exhibit is about the latter — people who express themselves through pride in their ride.""Lowriders can come in any flavor, from the classic bombs made between 1930 and 1955 to hoppers that are outfitted with suspension systems that have evolved into high-tech rigs from the earliest days when sand bags were used to weigh down a car to get it closer to the ground.Steven ""Sparky"" Gomez has tens of thousands of dollars invested in his Packard. He's been offered double its worth but there's no way he's selling it. For Gomez, lowriding is a family tradition started by his father back in the 1940s.""You get a car that somebody else discarded and as you see, you turn it into a piece of art and it's better than drugs and alcohol. There's no limit,"" he said. ""And then you feel like a movie star when you're in it because everybody's waving at you.""At the celebration kick-off, cars circled the plaza, some flipped their switches, boosting one wheel off the ground while the rear of the car squatted and twisted. The front ends of others jumped up and down as the driver and passengers bounced around inside and the car crept forward with each hit.The spokes spun slowly, the slower the better as the crowd soaked in all the chrome and glistening metal-flake paint.""Bajito y suavecito."" Translation: low and slow.""These are folks who really put their heart and soul into these cars and it's a family treasure,"" Ware said. ""The whole family is involved in the making and the financing and then of course there's this whole brotherhood, this team of people who help put the car together.""In the 1980s, the northern New Mexico community of Espanola proclaimed itself the Lowrider Capitol of the World, but the history of lowriders stretches back at least to World War II. El Paso, Texas, and Los Angeles like to take credit for birthing lowriders as a Latino response to Anglo hot rod culture.As the style progressed, some car customizers began building their suspensions with hydraulic lifters originally designed to raise and lower plane flaps. Air bags came later and smoothed out the ride.The exhibits touch on history but they also seek to elevate lowrider culture beyond the usual stigmas and stereotypes to celebrate the craftsmanship and commitment that come with building and maintaining a lowrider.After the hopping settled down Sunday, Gomez surveyed the crowd.""You see the smiles on people's faces. It kills all the stereotypes,"" he said. ""We're not drug dealers. We're not gang members. With our appearance, people assume stuff but once they get to talk to us and find out the real history behind lowriding, they find out it's just a beautiful culture."""

          A promotional image from MAC's collaborative cosmetics line with design duo Rodarte. The cosmetics giant was forced to issue an apology for what some deemed offensive product titles.
          (Courtesy of MAC)LOS ANGELES – World-renowned cosmetics brand MAC recently announced the September launch of a new collection in collaboration with high-profile fashion brand Rodarte, inspired by the colors and culture of Mexico.  The new line features various products including a pink blush named ""Quinceañera,"" and a sheer white lipstick called ""Ghost Town."" But it’s the frosty pink nail polish entitled ""Juarez"" that’s causing all the controversy.“Naming a shade of nail polish ‘Juarez,’ after an impoverished Mexican factory town that is notorious for the rape and murder of countless girls and women is insensitive and tasteless,” Amelia Parry, the editor-in-chief of the premier women's relationship site TheFrisky.com told Pop Tarts. “Naming a secondary nail polish shade ""Factory"" further indicates the brand's cluelessness, as most of the women and girls who have been murdered in Juarez disappeared on their way to or from work at the town's factories. As Frisky blogger Jessica Wakeman said in a post on the subject, ""I'm not going to go name my Sudan-inspired nail polish 'Darfur,’ which I think is a pretty apt comparison.”MAC has since apologized for the product titles, and is now working to do all it can to win back offended consumers.“We understand that product names in the MAC Rodarte collection have offended some of our consumers and fans.  This was never our intent and we are very sorry,” a representative for the collection said to Pop Tarts in a statement. “MAC will give a portion of the proceeds from the MAC Rodarte collection to help those in need in Juarez. We are diligently investigating the best way to do this.  Please be assured that we will keep you posted on the details regarding our efforts.”And in light of MAC’s apology, Parry said there was no need to boycott the brand.“Had they ignored the complaints and not decided to donate some of the proceeds, well, then maybe I would have chucked my MAC eye shadows,” she added. “But the fact is, out of all the many cosmetic brands out there, MAC has always impressed with their dedication to raising awareness about important issues, so while this was a stumble for them, their quick and thoughtful response to the outcry is further proof that they're a stand-up company worth supporting.”"

          FILE - In this Sept. 11, 2001 file photo, the twin towers of the World Trade Center burn after hijacked planes crashed into them in New York. As the post-Sept. 11 decade ends, some foreign families of the victims are eager to move past the tragedy. But though the pain transcended borders, foreign families have battled to cope with their loss from afar.
          (AP2001)A new telenovela “The Eighth Commandment” takes a closer look at what happened post Sept. 11 both in Mexico and the United States.The story highlights the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, when Isabel Sanmillán  takes part in a meeting in one of the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Thousands of miles away in Mexico, her family watches on television as the plane crashes. They fear their loved one has perished in New York.A decade later, Sanmillán finds herself back in Mexico, thanks to the efforts of her daughter Camila in finding her. The woman doesn't remember who she once was, a photographer and the founder of a newspaper. Her employees have a hard time, as well, believing that this woman who has unexpectedly returned owns their company.Sanmillán's story sounds like a miracle found in the rubble of the towers, but it's unfolding on millions of Mexican TV screens this summer in the soap opera ""The Eighth Commandment,"" which traces the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.While Americans prepare to mark the 10th anniversary of the event, many Mexicans are remembering it through the twists and turns of this soap opera. The six-month-long series, in fact, takes on the subject with more candor than most U.S. productions have dared to adopt so far.That includes scenes set inside the towers during the attacks and portraits of individuals who perished.Producer Epigmenio Ibarra said he aimed to tell intimate stories within the epic frame. The series doesn't yet have an air date in the U.S.Ibarra and co-writer Laura Sosa also deal with other themes currently in the news, such as Mexican government corruption, violence against journalists and the country's out-of-control drug violence.""It was a landmark that was not only powerfully symbolic, but so big, so extremely terrible that it let us insert a story of human drama that was truthful ... that gave us a theme we wanted to talk about: the perspective of the victims,"" Ibarra said.He said his idea gained extra inspiration after the May killing of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. One of the first scenes in the series, in fact, shows the Sanmillán's family's response to the terrorist leader's death.Actress Sara Maldonado, who broke from her usual good-girl roles to play daughter Camila, said the specter of the event haunted the set even a decade later.""It's already the 10th anniversary, but it's super-present,"" Maldonado said during a break in shooting. ""Each time we did scenes about the subject, I got goose bumps.""At a recent rehearsal in a studio outside Mexico City, Isabel Sanmillán, played by actress Leticia Huijara, visits the offices of her newspaper and is shocked to find a photo of herself in a makeshift memorial, in which she appears as a kind of martyr to journalism.Huijara holds in her hands a U.S. flag with the word ""honor"" and her name as well as the names of the attack's victims printed on it.""I think that what the Americans didn't have was a mourning process like this,"" Huijara said on the set. ""They have to create some space exactly to show how things were, so that this mourning and healing come.""""The Eighth Commandment,"" which began airing in Mexico on Aug. 8, follows Isabel Sanmillán to New York before the attacks to pitch photos she took of a meeting between a top official of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, a representative of the Mexican government and a drug trafficker.The show then follows her family's struggles to deal with first her death and then her surprise return, after Camila finds her mother in New York while working on a story about undocumented immigrants who rescued people from the towers.The show links the commandment mentioned in the title, which preaches ""Thou shall not bear false witness against your neighbor"" in the Catholic ordering of the list, to a journalist's duty to tell the truth. That's something both mother and daughter pay high prices for doing, in exposing actions by the U.S. and Mexican governments as well as by drug traffickers.That provocative mix of elements fits Ibarra's reputation for having pushed the popular telenovela form during his 15-year-long career. Ibarra also draws from his journalism background and still writes a news column in the Mexican daily Milenio.Through his production company, Argos Communications, in 1996, Ibarra produced ""Nothing Personal,"" which was the first Mexican telenovela set in the world of politics and drug trafficking. Later, he cast a woman as an antihero in the soap opera ""The Gaze of a Woman,"" adding a novel grittiness to the otherwise rosy genre.Ibarra went on to win three International Emmy nominations with the HBO Latin American production ""Capadocia,"" which takes places in a corrupt women's prison.He knew he was breaking new ground by taking on the Sept. 11 attacks, which Hollywood has so far approached cautiously. Right after the event, images of the imposing skyscrapers were even scrubbed from already filmed scenes in several movies.""There's a resistance in American television that I think it's time to break,"" Ibarra said. ""Ten years let us bring up the subject.""U.S. media expert Shari Anne Brill, who writes the blog The Brill Beat, said the decade since the attacks has cleared the way for dramas such as ""The Eighth Commandment.""""You can't have something started while it's happening,"" Brill said. ""You couldn't have done this show in 2002. People would have been raw. I think marking the 10th anniversary is a really good moment to start to do this show, because 10 years have gone by, people have healed.""Hollywood's hesitancy will end in the weeks leading up to the attack's 10-year anniversary, as Sept. 11-themed dramas and documentaries flood TV screens in the United States. Ibarra, for one, didn't hold back in ""The Eighth Commandment.""In one of the first episodes, Isabel Sanmillán's son is bullied by a schoolmate who says his mom died from an ""overdose of concrete."" The show also recreates terrifying moments inside the towers' stairwells during the buildings' collapse.Sanmillán herself is rescued on the tower stairs by an undocumented Mexican immigrant. Later, she calls her husband with her face still bloodied.""We are dealing with it without self-censorship,"" said Huijara, a past winner of Mexico's equivalent of an Academy Award. ""For (Americans), it continues being a subject, in some ways, taboo.""To be sure, Ibarra enjoyed the creative freedom that comes with dramatizing another country's disaster. But exploring the subject also became a ""powerful trigger"" that ""allowed the linking of tragedies"" such as those that have plagued Mexico, Ibarra said.In its similarly blunt way, Ibarra describes drug-war events and figures such as wanted cartel leader Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán and the activist and poet Javier Sicilia, whose son was killed in March by drug gang members.Brill said the show's depiction of the Sept. 11 attacks and other themes could wake up audiences not just to past horrors but those still under way.""People wander around watching these silly reality shows and get caught up in these stupid things,"" Brill said. ""But they need to wake up and realize that there's some really scary things going on.""Based on reporting by the Associated PressFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino"

          FILE - This file image released by AMC shows Bryan Cranston as Walter White, left, and Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman in a scene from the season 5 premiere of  ""Breaking Bad.""
          (AP2012)LOS ANGELES – New Mexico owes Walter White big time.The popular AMC series “Breaking Bad,” set in Albuquerque and currently airing its final season, has played a prominent role in putting its home state on the map when it comes to big Hollywood productions.In April, Governor Susana Martinez signed new state legislation – referred to as “The Breaking Bad Law"" -- that increased the state’s rebate for series television production to 30 percent of a producer’s qualified outlay. Feature films are also eligible for a 30 percent rebate on resident labor if they use a qualified production facility, and 25 percent off their other expenses.So far, its working. The New Mexico Film Office recently announced that a six-episode docudrama “Gunslingers,” centered on famous outlaws and lawmen of the Old West, would film in Santa Fe through September, employing 60 New Mexico crew members and 300 local actors and extras. ABQ Studios, the home of “Breaking Bad,” also revealed that two major network television series – “The Night Shift” for NBC and “Killer Women” for ABC – are underway.“We anticipate greater interest from both television shows and movie productions due to the new law,” Dayna Gardner, Director of Communications in the Office of the Mayor, City of Albuquerque, told FOX411’s Pop Tarts column. “The industry provides jobs for our citizens that are high-paying and creative. Local companies also benefit from having a production here, like lumber companies, hotels and restaurants, travel agencies, sign companies… in fact, almost all local businesses profit in some way. When ‘Breaking Bad’ was filming, the direct spend per episode shot over eight days, was approximately a million dollars to the city.”More On This...Older actors who played teensOur favorite game show hostsRock star scandals!Country star scandals!Ireland Baldwin: Modeling is hard!New info on Johnny Cash will ‘shock and surprise,’ documentary director saysCancer shmancer: Valerie Harper bravely leads new cast of ‘Dancing With the Stars’NYC cancels last day of music festival after deathsCorey Feldman slammed for calling criticism of lingerie birthday party ‘bullying’Even before New Mexico announced these fresh incentives, the state was already an emerging Hollywood hotspot. Big movies like Jennifer Aniston’s “We’re the Millers,” Johnny Depp’s “The Lone Ranger,” Denzel Washington’s “2 Guns” and Marvel’s “The Avengers” filmed in Albuquerque, and, at least in some of those cases, pumped millions into the state economy. For example, while New Mexico paid nearly $23 million in tax credits to the producers of “The Avengers,"" it benefited from over $90 million in production spending.“The often overlooked benefit isn’t just the employment of residents,” noted J. David Williams, the President and CEO of prominent Film Finance and Marketing company FilmCrest.  “It’s the actual making of careers for those residents.”But New Mexico isn’t the only state luring the entertainment community.“New Mexico was one of the first to offer generous incentives, but so many states have since jumped on the bandwagon. 42 states now offer incentives,” explained Ted Johnson, Deputy Editor of Variety. “It is competitive between these states, and one of the criticisms in California is that there hasn’t been a coordinated effort to make sure these productions happen here. It’s a no-brainer; (filmmakers) can’t go to their bosses and say ‘we have to shoot in L.A. because we love it here.’ It starts with the budgeting.”Dana Arnold, President and CEO of Pacifica Ventures in New Mexico, stressed that there are “so many factors that weigh on how a production selects where to shoot,” but boosters say New Mexico has a lot to offer.“310 days of sunshine, and close proximity to Los Angeles gives us an edge over other states that also offer film incentives,” boasted Albuquerque Mayor Richard Berry. “We have a plethora of location looks – from big city to small town; from desert on the edge of town to Ponderosa pines and a 10,600 foot mountain to the East.”However, there has been a growing push directed from studios, filmmakers and local officials to bring Hollywood back to Hollywood. Since 2009, as put into place by former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and signed by reigning Gov. Jerry Brown, California has enhanced its own incentive program – offering $100 million a year and an up to a 25 percent tax credit for filming, perks that can be accessed through a lottery.“The program has been successful from the standpoint that many more people have applied to get that incentive than the money that is available. But a lot of producers hate this lottery system,” Johnson said. “How can they plan their production when they don’t know if they’ll get the incentive?”And given that Disney’s plans to expand its Santa Clarita lot were approved last week, with Paramount and Universal rumored to follow suit, we’re told more pressure will be placed on Sacramento officials to do more in support of filming in the Golden State.But not everyone supports tax breaks for Hollywood honchos.""The rest of the state is in dire need of a tax break,” added political and entertainment PR expert, Angie Meyer-Olszewski. “California has several other financial issues to sort out before giving money to Hollywood.”"

          Olivia Newton-John’s former boyfriend, who disappeared 11 years ago, has been found secretly living in Mexico with a new lover, according to fresh reports.Woman’s Day claims Patrick McDermott, who dated the Australian star for nine years, has been found alive and well after vanishing on a fishing trip more than a decade ago. The magazine claims that fresh evidence confirms previous reports that McDermott is living in Mexico, having settled down with a European girlfriend. Investigator John Nazarian told the publication: “It’s rumored he was with a German national. I spoke to people there. The girl he was travelling with was described as having a German accent.” Although speculative theories at the time ranged from self-harm to accidental death, Mr. Nazarian described them as “preposterous.” “To come up with the conclusion that he fell off the boat, and allegedly no-one saw him fall off the boat, is the most preposterous thing I’ve ever heard in my life,” he said. McDermott was 48 at the time he went missing from the fishing boat Freedom, which had set off from San Pedro Marina for a fishing trip on June 30th, 2005. None of the 22 passengers saw McDermott go overboard, and he was not reported missing until a week later when Ms Newton-John contacted authorities after he failed to show up for a family gathering. The star had been in the middle of a promotional tour in Australia when McDermott vanished. U.S. investigators launched an exhaustive search for the cameraman, but two months later revealed McDermott had faked his own death and was living in Mexico. Officials also revealed that McDermott disappeared shortly after filing for bankruptcy, having unpaid debts totalling more than $30,000 at the time, including $8000 in child support owed to his ex-wife Yvette Nipar for their son, Chance. The investigators also discovered Korean-born McDermott secured a second passport in his birth name Patrick Kim and withdrew life savings from two bank accounts just before he disappeared. An investigation by private investigator Philip Klein - who wrote a book about the case - ended in 2009 when he received a letter faxed on McDermott’s behalf. It reportedly said: “Pat has asked that I portray to you his innocence. Pat has committed no crime. Pat simply wishes to be left alone. “Let him live his life in peace and harmony. He is safe and has started anew again in a new place both physically and mentally. Stop this search immediately.” Mr Klein was working on behalf of ""Dateline."" “His lawyer called from Mexico City and said that Patrick didn’t want to be bothered. He hadn’t faked anything. He just wanted to get away from the drama,” he said.This article originally appeared on News.com.au"

You would have been a hero,” Wallace said.MSNBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.TRUMP BLASTS ERIC HOLDER OVER 'KICK 'EM' COMMENT: 'DISGUSTING STATEMENT'Bush, whose wife is from Mexico, was initially considered a favorite for the Republican nomination but suspended his campaign after a poor showing in early caucuses and primaries. Trump, who mocked Bush throughout the process, obviously went on shock Hillary Clinton on Election Day.The president’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., took to Twitter to with his thoughts on Wallace’s comment.“Is anyone shocked that the left wants people to resort to violence?” Trump Jr. wrote, captioning video of the MSNBC host calling for violence against his father.Daily Wire reporter Ryan Saavedra – who captured Wallace’s call for violence – pointed out that the MSNBC host once proclaimed she wanted to ""wring"" the ""neck"" of White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders. Prominent Democrats have frequently been making headlines with rhetoric that seems to encourage violence against political opponents, highlighted by recent comments by Obama-era Attorney General Eric Holder.""It is time for us, as Democrats, to be as tough as they are, to be as dedicated as they are, to be as committed as they are,"" Holder said over the weekend. ""Michelle always says -- I love her; she and my wife are like, really tight, which always scares me and Barack -- but Michelle always says, 'When they go low, we go high.' No. When they go low, we kick 'em.""The ex-AG later tweeted that he was not ""advocating violence"" but merely saying Democrats need to be ""tough.""While Holder is a prominent Democrat, MSNBC’s Wallace served as White House Communications Director to President George W. Bush. She also worked on the 2008 presidential campaign of John McCain.Wallace once referred to herself as a “non-practicing Republican” and said earlier this year that she feels the GOP is currently “unrecognizable.”Fox News’ Andrew O’Reilly contributed to this report."
