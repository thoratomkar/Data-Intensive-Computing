Email  Bio  Follow         Writer/critic   January 10    Amid the shutdown showdown over border security, just what kind of barrier is at stake seems to be in flux. Early this week, President Trump let it be known that the designs for his U.S.-Mexico border wall had changed, tweeting: “We are now planning a Steel Barrier rather than concrete. It is both stronger & less obtrusive.” Whether you think a border barrier is best made of concrete or bricks, steel slats or Legos, the wall has become an all-purpose metaphor for the state of the nation and its leadership. So just how are editorial cartoonists putting the wall to work as a loaded image? Joep Bertrams of the Netherlands, for one, paints Trump as a victim of his own policy.

1,"     White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is seen during a press briefing at the White House on Jan. 11. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)           By  Erik Wemple          Erik Wemple Media critic with a focus on the ups and downs and downs of the cable-news industry.   Email  Bio  Follow         Media critic  January 15, 2018    In a memorable Politico Magazine piece in 2016, former tabloid journalist Susan Mulcahy poked at the dishonesty behind President Trump’s demonization of the media. “Today, Trump calls reporters ‘disgusting,’ ” wrote Mulcahy. “That’s the biggest lie of all. I’d argue that his longest and most intimate relationship is with the media, who offer so many opportunities for him to gaze at the person he loves most.” Such adoration pours out of a transcript published by the Wall Street Journal of an interview between the president and several reporters at the financial newspaper. At one point in the proceedings, Trump pronounced himself pleased with one of the newspaper’s stories: “A lot of tremendous things are happening in the United States, including the fact that you can now live without being strangled by regulation. You people actually wrote one of the best stories that I’ve ever seen on regulation; you said more than any president in history,” said Trump. “That was the full pager.” After a rep of the Journal responded in the affirmative, Trump continued, “I mean I actually read it because I’ve never seen a full page — it’s actually a full page article.” Again, a Journal interviewer responded in the affirmative, and again Trump marveled at the layout: “But, it was a full pager and essentially said there’s never been a president that’s been anywhere close on regulation.” That part of the interview transcript isn’t in doubt; another part is, big-time. In a part of the dialogue relating to foreign policy, the Journal quotes the president as follows:  With that being said, President Xi has been extremely generous with what he’s said, I like him a lot. I have a great relationship with him, as you know I have a great relationship with Prime Minister Abe of Japan and I probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un of North Korea. I have relationships with people, I think you people are surprised.  Bolding added to highlight the words that have fueled a several-days-long controversy. The way White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tells it, the White House objected to this transcription as early as Friday, insisting that the president used a different formulation: “I’d probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.” Here’s Sanders on Twitter:   pic.twitter.com/u9MHhxkOt0— Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) January 13, 2018     Here is the official audio showing WSJ misquoting @POTUS pic.twitter.com/wVwoafYkHg— Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) January 14, 2018     We first contacted the WSJ Friday morning and asked for a correction. They repeatedly refused to issue one despite clear audio evidence they'd misquoted POTUS. https://t.co/yauftW3qDQ— Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) January 14, 2018   Trump, too:   The Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them “I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un” (of N. Korea). Obviously I didn’t say that. I said “I’d have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un,” a big difference. Fortunately we now record conversations with reporters...— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2018   The Journal posted a reply to the White House request:   We have reviewed the audio from our interview with President Trump, as well as the transcript provided by an external service, and stand by what we reported. Here is audio of the portion the White House disputes. https://t.co/eWcmiHrXJg pic.twitter.com/bx9fGFWaPw— The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) January 14, 2018   Journalist Yashar Ali came down in favor of “I’d”:   Former oppo researcher in me has been obsessing over this so I reduced the background noise and slowed his voice down to 40 percent and he says “I’d”— Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) January 14, 2018   The Erik Wemple Blog has listened to the dueling audiotapes. There’ll be no verdict coming from these parts on whether Trump uttered a contraction or merely a pronoun. What is remarkable about the episode, however, is how quickly Team Trump goes from loving the Wall Street Journal and its regulatory coverage to denouncing it as fake news — over a split second of an interview with an ambiguous transcription. A lack of self-awareness has to kick off any explanation of the contretemps: Trump speaks in ways that discombobulate anyone seeking to write down his words. “Trump is a very sloppy speaker,” said transcription expert Elizabeth Pennell to CNBC during the 2016 presidential election. “He is very hard to transcribe and because what he says can be such a bombshell and so badly parsed by the consuming public and the media, you just got to take so much more care. Because everybody out there is literally hanging on every word he says in a way I have never seen happen before in a race.” Look again at the way Trump set up this sequence, according to the Journal.  With that being said, President Xi has been extremely generous with what he’s said, I like him a lot (1). I have a great relationship with him (2), as you know I have a great relationship with Prime Minister Abe of Japan (3) and I probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un of North Korea (4). I have relationships with people (5), I think you people are surprised.  Take a look: There are five statements highlighted above, four of which aren’t in dispute. Those four — 1, 2, 3 and 5 — are all in the present tense, indicative mood — meaning that they are statements of fact or belief. Perhaps because Trump was stringing together several such sentences, the Journal defaulted to a present-indicative transcription of the disputed sentence, No. 4. A quick listen to the audiotape, too, appears to confirm as much. What Trump claims, however, is that he changed up the mood of his verb in the disputed sentence, from “I probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un of North Korea” to “I’d probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.” That’s a significant change, one involving the conditional mood, which is a way of expressing a thought that is dependent on some other outcome. Which is to say, it’s a way of stating a fantasy. I would be very happy if Trump were to stop attacking the “fake news” media. What’s so strange about Trump’s diction here is that he decided to use a contraction: “I’d probably” instead of “I would probably.” It’s an odd way of proceeding because Trump was presumably trying to stress that he would have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un of North Korea if such-and-such circumstances emerged. Yet in this passage, Trump doesn’t specify the conditions under which he would have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un of North Korea. So: Even if the White House is right about the transcript, the president still makes no sense.   Once again, it doesn’t matter. Either statement is ridiculous. https://t.co/ICD5hbnMNp— Josh Rogin (@joshrogin) January 14, 2018   One moment, the Wall Street Journal is a glorious publication that runs “full pagers” on deregulation; the next moment, it’s a purveyor of “fake news” because of a transcription squabble. In a speech he’s drafting on Trump’s approach to the media, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) has written, “I dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of ‘fake news’ are dubious, at best.”   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,"     Wait, you actually BOUGHT that populist flim flam I peddled during the campaign??? (Win McNamee/Getty Images)           By  Greg Sargent          Greg Sargent Opinion writer covering national politics  Email  Bio  Follow         Opinion writer  February 3, 2017    THE MORNING PLUM: President Trump’s war on financial elites and his draining of the swamp will gain a burst of new momentum Friday, as Trump is set to launch his first major steps toward deregulating Wall Street. The Post reports:  President Trump plans to order a rollback Friday of regulations governing the financial services industry and Wall Street under the Dodd-Frank law and beyond, a White House source confirmed. Gary Cohn, White House Economic Council director, told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published last night that the administration would also move against a regulation designed to force retirement advisers to work in the best interest of their clients, the “fiduciary rule,” set to take effect in April and designed to eliminate conflicts-of-interests among professionals dealing with those enrolled in qualified retirement plans and IRAs. … The move, set for announcement at a White House meeting with business leaders, would be in line with Trump’s campaign pledge to “dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation.”  [Did you attend a protest? Tell us what you plan to do next.] Shockingly, the Trump White House’s version of getting tough on Wall Street is to deregulate it. As The Post’s account notes, Trump will try to gut Dodd-Frank by dismantling or modifying regulations where possible through executive action. Trump may also “tame” Dodd-Frank’s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by replacing its current head — Richard Cordray — with someone who is less aggressive about “cracking down on big banks and corporations accused of misleading consumers.”         window.havePowaBoot=true;  All of this sets the stage for a broader legislative push by Republicans and Trump to roll back Dodd-Frank. Populist! Take that, elites! But this also gives Democrats an opportunity: It presents a new and very specific way for them to press the case against Trump for more transparency around his own holdings and the unprecedented welter of conflicts-of-interest — and possibilities for corruption — they may be creating. (Trump transferred control of his holdings to his two sons, but he retained ownership, meaning he did nothing meaningful to eliminate such conflicts.) Here’s how. As ethics watchdogs have pointed out, the congressional GOP leadership’s total abdication of any meaningful oversight role on Trump means individual members of Congress — Democrats, or the occasional principled Republican who does want to exercise oversight — need to try to mount a stand where possible. They can do this by seizing on individual initiatives to demand transparency into how Trump’s holdings might be impacted by those initiatives — by calling for the release of his tax returns or demanding an accounting of those holdings. Wall Street deregulation — whether via Trump executive actions right now or via the GOP legislation to come — provides a good hook to do this, ethics experts told me Friday. Norm Eisen, the chief ethics officer in the Obama White House, noted that one potential area for demanding transparency might be “his debt to the banks he proposes to help.” Eisen added: “This effort to let big banks run wild was to be expected, given Mr. Trump’s own unresolved conflicts.” [It’s about time someone attacked Australia. Thank you, President Trump.] Richard Painter, the chief ethics watchdog for President George W. Bush, noted that Friday’s news provides a hook to demand more disclosure from Trump about “the debt he or the corporations he controls have at the corporate level,” much of which is “not disclosed in financial disclosure reports.” “He’s deregulating banks,” he told me. “We’re entitled to know about his relationship with banks — the very industry he’s deregulating.” Painter added that these relationships might shed light on how Trump’s real estate holdings might be affected by such deregulation. “The deregulation of financial services will lead to more bank loans for real estate, driving up real estate prices,” Painter said. “Deregulation is likely to lead to a bubble in the real estate market, as it has in the past. That ups the value of his real estate holdings, which the Trump organization could then sell at the top of the market.” Now, to be clear, the point here is not that Trump’s deregulatory initiatives should be judged as policy based on how they affect his holdings. They should be judged on their own merits, and I suspect that serious analysis of them will ultimately conclude that they put consumers at greater risk and make another financial crash more likely. Rather, the point is that the public has the right to know how the president’s holdings might be affected by his policies irrespective of the merits or demerits of those policies — because this goes to the question of whose interests Trump is really looking out for. Even if you believe Trump when he says he’ll only look out for the people’s interests, Americans still have the right to know whether his holdings are being affected, and how, in order to judge his motives for themselves. Of course, Trump will probably ignore any such calls for transparency, and congressional Republicans probably won’t care in the least, because Trump is likely to deliver on the huge tax cuts and deregulation they want. But the unique challenges of this moment require Democrats — and the occasional principled Republican — to find new and innovative ways of waging guerrilla ethics warfare designed to chip away at the opacity of Trump’s holdings, and the protective wall congressional GOP leaders have built around them, by drawing more and more public attention to this cozy little arrangement. Friday’s news is one place to start. ******************************************************************* * EUROPEAN LEADERS INCREASINGLY WORRIED ABOUT TRUMP: The New York Times surveys the view from Europe, where there is mounting anxiety over Trump’s America-first-ism and seeming contempt for international institutions:  Hopes among European leaders that Mr. Trump’s bombastic tone as a candidate would somehow smooth into a more temperate one as commander in chief are dissipating, replaced by a mounting sense of anxiety and puzzlement. … Some European leaders are urging their counterparts to recognize that Mr. Trump may represent a truly dire challenge, one that threatens to upend not only the 70-year European project of integration and security, but just about everything they stand for, including liberal democracy itself.  Of course, this can always easily be justified by saying that 1) America will “no longer be taken advantage of”; and 2) Trump is being “unpredictable” and “disruptive.” * REPUBLICANS STRUGGLE WITH OBAMACARE TALKING POINTS: The Post reports that some Republicans are increasingly inclined to say that they are going to “repair” Obamacare rather than “repeal and replace” it. And there’s yet a third option:  Rep. Greg Walden, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and a key architect of GOP health-care plans, has favored yet another R-word in recent days: “rebuild.”  Bottom line: Republicans cannot create a replacement that will make both the broader public (who wants to keep major elements of the law) and conservatives (who want to obliterate it entirely) happy at the same time. * TRUMP APPROVAL RATING AT RECORD LOW: A new CBS News poll finds that only 40 percent of Americans approve of Trump’s performance as president so far, versus 48 percent who disapprove. CBS notes that this is “the lowest of any president just after his first inauguration since the Gallup Poll began taking those measures in 1953.” But Steve Bannon tells us there is a “vast and overwhelming majority of Americans” that is silently rooting for Trumpism to succeed. * PUBLIC OPPOSES TRUMP IMMIGRATION MOVES: The new CBS News poll also finds that 51 percent oppose Trump’s executive order temporarily banning entry by migrants from seven majority-Muslim countries, versus only 45 percent who approve. Those numbers are identical (51 disapprove; 45 approve) on Trump’s temporary ban on refugees, too. And this is a great little nugget: Only 36 percent agree that the ban on entry from majority-Muslim countries will make the U.S. safer from terrorism. * TRUMP MAY NOT DELIVER ON BIG PROMISE TO RELIGIOUS RIGHT: Trump has been telling the religious right that he’ll “destroy” the Johnson Amendment, which prevents tax-exempt entities such as churches from engaging in politics. But McClatchy raises a good point: It’s highly probable that the votes will not be there in the Senate to overcome a Democratic filibuster. Still, he’s delivering them the Supreme Court justice that they wanted, so that should do it — for awhile, at least. * TRUMP IS ODDLY QUIET ABOUT MOSQUE ATTACK: Adam Taylor points out that Trump has tweeted constantly about terrorist attacks all over the world for years, but has said little to nothing about the attack that killed six in a Quebec City mosque:  On Trump’s famed social media accounts … the attack in Quebec City does not appear to have been mentioned at all…Trump…often quickly and clearly responded to terror attacks on foreign soil. … In almost every case, Trump was responding to an attack claimed by a militant Islamist group. … The attack in Quebec City does not appear to have been carried out by a Muslim or inspired by Islamic extremist ideology. In this case, the victims were Muslims.  Gosh, what could explain this? * AND CONWAY INVENTS TERRORIST ATTACK TO JUSTIFY ‘MUSLIM BAN’: On MSNBC last night, Kellyanne Conway claimed that the Obama administration banned Iraqi refugees in 2011 and after there was a “massacre” in Bowling Green, Ky. Zack Beauchamp sets the record straight, pointing out that, no, Obama did not ban refugees, and no, there was never a terrorist attack in Bowling Green. Other than that, though, Conway’s “alternative facts” are right on the money.   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The $1 trillion funding agreement, which will fund three-quarters of the federal government, passed on a 296-to-121 vote: 147 Republicans and 149 Democrats voted “yes,” while 86 Republicans and 35 Democrats opposed the measure.  The Senate is expected to approve the measure, although the timing of the upper chamber vote remains unclear as leaders continue heated negotiations on a deal to extend the payroll tax cut and other key provisions that expire at the end of the month. Passage of the bill appeared to be a sure thing earlier this week, as congressional leaders of both parties had focused their energies on debating not the funding measure but rather the payroll tax cut and the Keystone pipeline. The House earlier this month passed a proposal that would couple an extension of the payroll tax cut and other provisions with a measure that would force a decision on the pipeline, a move Democrats and the White House have rejected. But both the funding plan and the payroll tax debate became intertwined after Democrats withheld their support for the former until leaders reached a deal on the latter. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) are now leading those negotiations, which are increasingly focused on whether the Keystone pipeline provision will be included in a final payroll tax deal. Congress faces a Dec. 31 deadline to approve an extension of the payroll tax holiday and other provisions. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said after Friday’s funding vote that the House would not meet over the weekend and that what date the chamber returns next week depends on the progress of the payroll tax negotiations taking place in the Senate. “As all of my colleagues are painfully aware, the Senate has the ability to move both as quickly and as slowly as it wants, so, it is difficult to predict if or when we may need to return,” he said to laughter and applause from lawmakers. “My best guess is that the earliest we would return is this Monday, Dec. 19. But I can assure my colleagues that we will provide at least 24 hours’ notice prior to scheduling any further votes in the House this year.” House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (Md.), Cantor’s Democratic counterpart, then took to the floor. “Just to clarify, it is my understanding, therefore, that we do intend before we leave for the year to address the House-passed bill or a Senate version thereof,” he said. Cantor responded: “As I indicated earlier, it is all pending the Senate’s action. And as I indicated, no one really knows how quickly or slowly that will occur or if it will occur.”  This story has been updated.    ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to that, it says that if all else fails, and the Senate brings about a shutdown, then members should not get their pay.” Asked about Republicans’ “law of the land” claim, Jon Summers, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), noted that the measure would have to pass the Senate and be signed by the president in order to become law -- something that’s not likely to happen. “Maybe while our office negotiates with Speaker [John] Boehner’s office, the rest of the people who aren’t in the room could focus on passing bills to create jobs and help struggling families, rather than focusing on a bill that, among other things, kills 700,000 jobs,” Summers said. The House leaders’ gesture comes even as they are reaching out to moderate Democrats on financial issues, in part in an effort to avoid a shutdown. As the Washington Post’s Paul Kane reported Wednesday, the deal would involve more than $30 billion in cuts for the rest of this fiscal year, less than half the amount initially demanded by conservative freshmen Republicans, many elected with tea party support.   The Senate has already rejected H.R. 1, the House-passed bill that would cut $61 billion from current spending levels; it received only 44 votes earlier this month. President Obama has also stated that he would veto the measure were it to reach his desk. Asked about how a measure facing such Democratic opposition -- and having passed only one chamber — could be deemed the “law of the land,” Cantor responded: “We are trying to say this: We have not had any indication that the Senate is interested in changing the status quo. We’re about trying to cut spending here. We’re about trying to demonstrate to the American people again and again the Republican House has said, look, come work with us. Cut spending. Again, there’s two options here. Either you’re going to keep spending the way you are and you’ve got to raise taxes, so if that’s the case, show us your tax-increase plan. If not, join us in cutting spending.” Senate Democrats countered Wednesday by noting that the amount of cuts they have offered is roughly the same as the amount that House Republican leaders had sought earlier this year, before conservatives in the party pushed the number higher. “Now that Democrats have offered Republicans a deal at roughly the same levels that they endorsed last month, will Republicans take yes for an answer?” Senate Democrats asked in a news release. “Or will they bow to Tea Party demands again?” The GOP measure would be a symbolic means for House Republicans to demonstrate that they have passed a bill while the Senate hasn’t. (Worth noting is the fact that in earlier budget talks, all sides had agreed that the Senate would vote on both H.R. 1 and a Senate Democratic plan – knowing that both would fail – in order to give party leaders leverage to go back to their caucuses and push for a compromise measure.) A summary of the new House Republican measure issued Wednesday morning states that: 1) The bill provides that if the Senate fails to pass a measure before April 6, 2011 providing for the appropriations of the departments and agencies of the Government for the remainder of fiscal year 2011, H.R. 1 (as passed by the House on Feb. 19, 2011) becomes law.  2) It also provides that, in the event of a government shutdown in excess of 24 hours or the limitation on the debt of the United States being reached, no salary payments will be disbursed to members of Congress or the president for days on which that condition persists. On the second point, the Senate passed a resolution earlier this month that would have the same effect. Last month, Rep. James Moran (D-Va.) sponsored the House version of the bill, dubbed the “Government Shutdown Fairness Act.” The measure had 17 co-sponsors as of Wednesday, including 16 Democrats and one Republican.

I did not want anyone to leave work today without telling you how proud the Commission is of the work you do every day to protect America's consumers. The FTC is a small agency, but your work makes us mighty. We hope that any shutdown will be short-lived and will not impose hardship on any of our employees or their families -- and that we will all be back at work, helping consumers and promoting competition, very, very soon. Thank you for your hard work, dedication and service.      Back to top           THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD  The Federal Reserve funds iself with its own earning and will remain open.     Back to top           THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY  The Environmental Protection Agency has released a detailed document regarding its plans in the event of a government shutdown.  The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) released a statement outlinining that, if a shutdown were to occur, “about nine out of every 10 U.S. EPA employees will be furloughed.” The statement goes on to say that “of the 17,721 full- and part-time employees, the agency estimates that 804 woudl be considered essential because they fall under emergency exceptions that allow for employees to carry out activities like protecting life and property.” Meanwhile, according to AFGE, another 856 would be deemed “exempted” because their programs are funded by unexpired appropriations.      Back to top           THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION  The Federal Communications Commission released a detailed document outlining plans in the event of a government shutdown.     Back to top           THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES  The Department of Health & Human Services has released two documents detailing plans in the event of a government shutdown. The first document details the department’s plans, while the second provides staffing details.     Back to top           THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION  The Department of Transportation has released a detailed document detailing plans in the event of a government shutdown. Details include essential and non-essential personnel for the Federal Highway Administration, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, Federal Aviation Administration and Federal Transit Administration among others.     Back to top           THE SUPREME COURT  The Supreme Court released a short statement regarding preparations in the event of a government shutdown: In the event of a lapse of appropriations, the court will continue to conduct its normal operations through the week of April 11,"" the statement said. ""The court building will be open to the public during its usual hours. The justices are not scheduled to meet in public next week, however a private conference is scheduled for April 15 and orgal arguemtns are scheduled to resume on April 18. The Supreme Court remained open during the shutdowns of 1995 and 1996.     Back to top           THE POSTAL REGULATORY COMMISSION  Not to be confused with the United Postal Service (which is self-funded and will remain operational during a government shutdown), the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the Postal Service, has released a detailed document outlining the commission’s plans in the event of a government shutdown.     Back to top           THE OFFICE MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET  The Office of Management and Budget has released a detailed document outlining a shutdown plan.     Back to top           THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR  The Department of labor has released a detailed document detailing the agency’s shutdown plans. The document breaks down on a department-by-department basis employees who will be deemed “essential” and those who will not.     Back to top           THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE  The National Weather Service Employees Organization released the following statement: Government offices are bracing for a possible shutdown on April 9 due to a budget impasse in Congress. All National Weather Service forecasts, watches and warnings will continue on a 24 hours a day - 7 days a week basis while the financial matters of the FY11 budget are resolved. While many employees of the National Weather Service are considered “essential” and will report to work, a large number of their co-workers who are not under the “essential employee” status will be furloughed. These employees have positions that are integral to the weather service’s mission of saving lives. Employees of the National Weather Service are prepared to go to work – with no guarantee of payment. Paychecks will be delayed for essential employees, if they receive one at all. For those employees considered non-essential, there will be no work and presumably no paycheck. “Dedication – it takes only one word to describe the National Weather Service,” said Dan Sobien, President of the National Weather Service Employees Organization. “The men and women of the National Weather Service went into this field for the mission of saving lives and property. To carry out this mission, we need all of the employees of the National Weather Service. Each position is essential.” “We regularly endure great hardships, knowing our careers will not lead to great wealth, but out of a love for the service to others. That’s what we’re here to do and that’s what we’ll do whether there’s a government shutdown or not.”      Back to top           FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION  According to an agency official, the FAA will retain all employees necessary to keep the national airspace system operating safely. However, non-critical safety functions would be suspended including aircraft certification, the development, testing and evaluation of NextGen technologies and most budget and administrative activities.  The Federal Highway Administration and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration will be unaffected because both are funded by resources from the highway trust fund.  Federal Railroad Administration employees performing safety activities would continue working, but all federal high-speed rail work as well as policy and development work will be suspended.  This includes capital and debt service grant payments to Amtrak.   The official went on to say, ""We still believe there is an opportunity to avoid a government shutdown but are working to ensure that we are prepared for all possible scenarios.""      Back to top           U.S. PATENT OFFICE  The U.S. Patent Office will remain open during a government shutdown. The agency released the following statement:  ...in the event of a government shutdown on April 9, 2011, the United States Patent and Trademark Office will remain open and continue to operate as usual, for a fixed period, with all USPTO staff continuing to work and being paid. Because the USPTO maintains sufficient funding not linked to the current fiscal year, the USPTO can and will stay open for business. We have enough available reserves to remain in operation for six business days and intend to do so. During that time we will continue to process the patent and trademark applications that drive our country’s innovative economy. Should a shutdown continue longer than the six-day period, a small staff will continue to work to accept new applications and maintain IT infrastructure, among other functions.     Back to top           U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE  The following is a statement from Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn III to the DOD workforce regarding plans in the event of a shutdown. The department remains hopeful that a government shutdown will be averted. The President has made it clear that he does not want a government shutdown, and the administration is working to find a solution with which all sides can agree. However, prudent management requires that we plan for an orderly shutdown should Congress be unable to pass a funding bill before our current funding expires on April 8.  The President and the secretary know that the uncertainty of the current situation puts federal employees in a difficult position, and are very much aware that a shutdown would impose hardships on our military and civilian personnel as well as our military families. As we approach the expiration of the current continuing resolution, we will provide you with updated information as soon as it becomes available. For now, I want to provide you with information on how the potential shutdown - should it occur - will impact our military and civilian personnel.   Department of Defense (DoD) Operations During a Shutdown  Operations and activities that are essential to safety, protection of human life, and protection of our national security, are ‘excepted’ from shutting down. The DoD will continue to conduct activities in support of our national security, including operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Japan; Libya-related support operations; and other operations and activities essential to the security of our nation. The department must also continue to provide for the safety of human life and protection of property.  Other excepted activities will include inpatient and essential outpatient care in DoD medical treatment facilities; emergency dental care; non-appropriated funds activities such as mess halls and child care activities; certain legal activities to support ongoing litigation and legal assistance for deployed DoD personnel; contracting and logistics operations that are in support of excepted activities; certain education and training activities to include the DoD education activity schools; and financial management activities necessary to ensure the control and accountability of funds.  In the absence of appropriations, non-excepted activities that have not already been fully funded will need to be shut down in an orderly fashion. In accordance with existing laws and regulations, I will issue more detailed guidance to the department regarding specific activities that are considered excepted or non-excepted. However, the secretary and I understand that the military departments and defense agencies and individual commanders must tailor this guidance to many different situations around the world. Therefore, should there be a government shutdown, DoD personnel will be informed through their chain of command about how a shutdown may affect them personally.   Duty Status  Military personnel are not subject to furlough and will report for duty as normal during the shutdown. Reserve component personnel should refer to the DoD Contingency Guidance document and to their chain of command for more specific information.  Civilian personnel deemed to be performing excepted activities will continue to work during the period of a shutdown.  If there is a government shutdown beginning on Saturday, April 9, all DoD personnel should still report to work on their next scheduled duty day, beginning at their normal duty hours to receive additional instructions.  Civilians will be briefed by their supervisors by Friday, April 8, as to whether their work and responsibilities fall into excepted or non-excepted status, as defined by applicable laws and regulations. Excepted status categories are outlined in the DoD Contingency Guidance document, which is being distributed through the chain of command. If their work and responsibilities are non-excepted, or if they are not needed to carry out excepted work and responsibilities, employees will be furloughed in a non-pay status. Furloughed employees may not telework or volunteer to work.  Generally, contractors performing work on contracts funded prior to a shutdown, whether supporting excepted activities or not, may continue working and will be paid out of the obligated funds, subject to further direction from the contracting officer. New contracts, or increases in funding of existing contracts, needed to support excepted activities may be entered into during the period of a shutdown, but payments under such contracts cannot be made until Congress provides additional funding. Contract personnel should also report to work on Monday, April 11, to be briefed on their status.   Military, Civilian, and Retiree Pay  If the government shuts down due to the absence of funding, the DoD will have no funds to pay military members or civilian employees for the days during which the government is shut down. However, both military and civilian personnel will receive pay for the period worked prior to the shutdown. Military personnel, and civilians occupying excepted status positions and required to work, are entitled to be paid for work performed during the shutdown, and will be paid retroactively once the department receives additional funding. Congress would have to provide authority in order for the department to retroactively pay non-excepted employees for the furloughed period.  Military retirees and annuitants are not paid from annually appropriated funds, and therefore their benefits should continue without interruption.   Additional Resources  The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has created a document to address some of the questions that I know must be on your mind. The document can be accessed at http://www.opm.gov/furlough2011 . OPM will provide additional pertinent information for federal employees as the week progresses.  The department’s leadership will do our very best to provide clear information about the status of events as the week progresses. Additional information regarding military and DoD civilian pay, leave, and other DoD policies applicable to a potential shutdown will be posted on the department’s main website as soon as it becomes available.  Thanks to the hard work and dedication of all of you, the Department of Defense provides critical services to the American public. Your contributions touch people’s lives in so many significant ways, and I want you to know how deeply I appreciate your dedication and your expertise. Our decisions concerning which functions are excepted or not excepted are based on government-wide legal, regulatory, and policy guidance as well as our best judgment on how to reconcile our national security requirements with the limitations imposed by a government shutdown. The fact that certain functions are not excepted or that certain personnel may be subject to furlough should not be taken as a statement that the secretary or I or the department do not value those functions or employees. Thank you for your continued service to the department and the nation.”      Back to top           U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE  We received the following information from an agency official familiar with the agency’s plans:  We still believe there is an opportunity to avoid a government shutdown but are working to ensure that we are prepared for all possible scenarios.  Agency operational plans are still being finalized, but in the event of a government shutdown most USDA activities would be shut down or significantly reduced and most USDA employees would be furloughed.  However, certain USDA activities would continue because they are related to law enforcement, the protection of life and property, or are financed through available funding (such as through user fees).  These include: ·         Meat, poultry and egg inspection services ·         Grain and other commodity inspection, weighing and grading services funded by user fees ·         Inspections for import and export activities to prevent the introduction and dissemination of pests into and out of the U.S. ·         Forest Service law enforcement and fire suppression efforts.  ·         In addition, funds have been made available to continue the Women, Infants and Children and Child Nutrition programs through June, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program has sufficient funding to allow benefits to continue through May. Most other USDA activities would not be continued during a government shutdown.  These activities include: ·         Farm loans and other farm payments ·         Provision of conservation technical and financial assistance ·         Provision of new rural development loans and grants for housing, community facilities, utilities and businesses ·         Agricultural export credit and other agricultural trade development and monitoring activities ·         National Forest System recreation sites across the U.S. which require a Forest Service employee to stay open would be closed to the public. ·         Market news reports, NASS statistics, and other agricultural economic and statistical reports and projections would be discontinued ·         Investigation of packers and stockyards related to fraudulent and anti-competitive activities ·         Assistance for the control of most plant and animal pests and diseases would be discontinued ·         Research facilities would be closed except for the care of animals and plants ·         Most departmental management, administrative and oversight functions, including civil rights, human resources, financial management, audit, legal and information technology activities would be discontinued or severely curtailed.     Back to top            U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT  Overseas, the overwhelming majority of U.S. diplomats are considered essential personnel and are expected to remain at their posts, according to officials familiar with the plans. Exceptions include lower-ranking administrative embassy staff members, many of whom are not American. Many U.S. Agency for International Development operations are expected to continue as normal, because the agency relies on many contractors.      Back to top           FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION  The FHA is expected to stay open through a shutdown.

Back to top           THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION  At the Education Department, 4,150 out of 4,465 full- and part-time employees would be furloughed under a shutdown, according to an agency contingency plan.     Back to top           U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT Updated: 8:53 a.m. ET 4/8/2011   We have recevied the following message from USAID Administrator Raj Shah regarding thea agency’s plan in the event of a government shutdown:  E X E C U T I V E   M E S S A G E Subject: Memorandum for All Employees Throughout the discussions about funding for the rest of the fiscal year, the President has made it clear that he does not want a government shutdown, and the Administration is working day and night to find a solution with which all sides can agree. Given the realities of the calendar, however, prudent management requires that we plan for an orderly shutdown should Congress be unable to pass a funding bill. The President and I know that the uncertainty of the current situation puts Federal employees in a difficult position, and are very much aware that a shutdown would impose hardships on many employees as well as the groups and individuals USAID serves.  As we approach the expiration of the current CR, we will provide you with updated information as soon as it becomes available.  For now, I want to provide you with information on how the potential shutdown -- should it occur -- will impact Federal employees. As soon as funding lapses, Federal departments and agencies will not be permitted to incur further financial obligations performing activities funded by annual appropriations, except those related to the orderly suspension of operations or performance of excepted activities. This means that some employees will be furloughed and unable to work.  Our contingency planning for the potential funding lapse includes determining which agency functions are excepted from a furlough.  Should it become necessary to implement our contingency plans, you will receive formal notice from your manager no later than Friday April 8th regarding the designation of your position and furlough status. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has created a document toaddress some of the questions that I know must be on your mind.  The document can be accessed at www.opm.gov/furlough2011. OPM will provide additional pertinent information for federal employees as the week progresses.  And we will do our very best to provide clear information about the status of events as the week progresses.  We have established an e-mail box for questions that are not addressed on the OPM website noted above.  Thanks to the hard work and dedication of all of you, USAID is delivering results around the world, and, ultimately, to the American public.  Your contributions touch people's lives in so many significant ways, and I want you to know how deeply I appreciate your dedication and your expertise.  Thank you for your continued service to USAID and the Nation Sincerely, Raj Shah Administrator We also received this statement from Chief Operating Officer Sean Carroll:  Should a shutdown occur, USAID’s development work with and on behalf of partners around the world would be significantly curtailed. In the interests of national security and humanitarian response, we will continue much of our work in countries such as Afghanistan, Egypt, Haiti, Iraq, Japan, Libya, Pakistan, and Sudan. But, with less than 20% of our permanent staff on duty at Agency headquarters, and with less-than full staff contingents in our missions abroad, development and our partners would suffer. US Citizens and partners would not be able to access our development library and resources; our efforts to help US small and disadvantaged businesses participate in development work would be temporarily halted; and many USAID-sponsored and international partner activities on critical development issues would be cancelled. We hope that a government shutdown will be averted. And, if not averted, that it is short-lived, so that all of our dedicated staff can continue working on all the development fronts – global health, food security, democracy and governance, inclusive economic growth, education, climate change mitigation and others – that are in our national security interests.     Back to top           THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT  Employees would have to report for work as scheduled, because that agency maintains enough funding not linked to the fiscal calendar to continue operating for at least a few days.     Back to top           THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS  We received the following from a department official familiar with the agency’s plans: The Administration has expressed that we still believe there is an opportunity to avoid a government shutdown, but are working to ensure that we are prepared for all possible scenarios. Agency operational plans are still being finalized, but our current understanding is the following: *       Thanks to advance appropriations (a two-year budget cycle), VA will continue to provide 100 percent of our health care services to enrolled Veterans through VA medical facilities across the country. Veterans' medical appointments will not be canceled or delayed in the event of a partial government-wide shut down. *       Advance appropriations, received from Congress, accounts for more than 80% of the VA's discretionary appropriations. *       While there will be a reduction in benefits staffing, VA has taken measures to ensure, in the short-term, that Veterans currently receiving VA benefits will continue to receive those payments on a timely basis and without interruption.  *       VA will also continue to provide final resting places at our national cemeteries in the event of a partial government-wide shutdown.  Some cemeteries may operate on a modified schedule.   *       Some VA services that may be suspended in the event of a partial government-wide shut down involve answering consumer inquiries by e-mail, telephone or mail, routine recruiting, hiring and training, and fraud investigations. *       VA will provide a Veterans Field Guide with a more detailed analysis of the impact on benefits and services when and if a shut down occurs.    *       In the event of a shut down, we will ask Veterans to keep monitoring VA's web site for additional information, including frequently asked questions and correspondence from the leadership team.       Back to top           THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES  In the event of a shutdown, only security and minimal support staff would be allowed to work. Some activities related to the Archives' work with the presidential libraries would also be disrupted.     Back to top           THE GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE  If the government were to shut down, a skeleton staff is expected to stay on to print copies of the Congressional Record and other White House documents.     Back to top           THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE  If the government were to shut down, less than 1 percent of employees would be allowed to work at the start.     Back to top           THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS SAFETY COMMISSION  The following is a letter from CPSC Commissioner Inez Tenenbaum to employees: Throughout the discussions about funding for the rest of the fiscal year, the President has made it clear that he does not want a government shutdown, and the Administration is willing and ready to work day and night to find a solution with which all sides can agree. Given the realities of the calendar, however, prudent management requires that we plan for an orderly shutdown should Congress be unable to pass a funding bill.  I understand that the uncertainty of the current situation puts true public servants like you in a very difficult position, and I am very much aware that a shutdown would impose hardships on many of you, as well as the consumers whom we serve. As we approach the expiration of the current CR, senior management will provide you with updated information as soon as it becomes available. For now, I want to provide you with information on how the potential shutdown-should it occur-will impact all of you. As soon as funding lapses, federal departments and agencies will not be permitted to incur further financial obligations performing activities funded by annual appropriations, except those related to the orderly suspension of operations or performance of excepted activities. This unfortunately means that many of you would be furloughed and unable to work.

I did not want anyone to leave work today without telling you how proud the Commission is of the work you do every day to protect America's consumers. The FTC is a small agency, but your work makes us mighty. We hope that any shutdown will be short-lived and will not impose hardship on any of our employees or their families -- and that we will all be back at work, helping consumers and promoting competition, very, very soon. Thank you for your hard work, dedication and service.      Back to top           THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD  The Federal Reserve funds iself with its own earning and will remain open.     Back to top           THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY  The Environmental Protection Agency has released a detailed document regarding its plans in the event of a government shutdown.  The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) released a statement outlinining that, if a shutdown were to occur, “about nine out of every 10 U.S. EPA employees will be furloughed.” The statement goes on to say that “of the 17,721 full- and part-time employees, the agency estimates that 804 woudl be considered essential because they fall under emergency exceptions that allow for employees to carry out activities like protecting life and property.” Meanwhile, according to AFGE, another 856 would be deemed “exempted” because their programs are funded by unexpired appropriations.      Back to top           THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION  The Federal Communications Commission released a detailed document outlining plans in the event of a government shutdown.     Back to top           THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES  The Department of Health & Human Services has released two documents detailing plans in the event of a government shutdown. The first document details the department’s plans, while the second provides staffing details.

Details include essential and non-essential personnel for the Federal Highway Administration, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, Federal Aviation Administration and Federal Transit Administration among others.     Back to top           THE SUPREME COURT  The Supreme Court released a short statement regarding preparations in the event of a government shutdown: In the event of a lapse of appropriations, the court will continue to conduct its normal operations through the week of April 11,"" the statement said. ""The court building will be open to the public during its usual hours. The justices are not scheduled to meet in public next week, however a private conference is scheduled for April 15 and orgal arguemtns are scheduled to resume on April 18. The Supreme Court remained open during the shutdowns of 1995 and 1996.     Back to top           THE POSTAL REGULATORY COMMISSION  Not to be confused with the United Postal Service (which is self-funded and will remain operational during a government shutdown), the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the Postal Service, has released a detailed document outlining the commission’s plans in the event of a government shutdown.     Back to top           THE OFFICE MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET  The Office of Management and Budget has released a detailed document outlining a shutdown plan.     Back to top           THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR  The Department of labor has released a detailed document detailing the agency’s shutdown plans. The document breaks down on a department-by-department basis employees who will be deemed “essential” and those who will not.     Back to top           THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE  The National Weather Service Employees Organization released the following statement: Government offices are bracing for a possible shutdown on April 9 due to a budget impasse in Congress. All National Weather Service forecasts, watches and warnings will continue on a 24 hours a day - 7 days a week basis while the financial matters of the FY11 budget are resolved. While many employees of the National Weather Service are considered “essential” and will report to work, a large number of their co-workers who are not under the “essential employee” status will be furloughed. These employees have positions that are integral to the weather service’s mission of saving lives. Employees of the National Weather Service are prepared to go to work – with no guarantee of payment. Paychecks will be delayed for essential employees, if they receive one at all. For those employees considered non-essential, there will be no work and presumably no paycheck. “Dedication – it takes only one word to describe the National Weather Service,” said Dan Sobien, President of the National Weather Service Employees Organization. “The men and women of the National Weather Service went into this field for the mission of saving lives and property. To carry out this mission, we need all of the employees of the National Weather Service. Each position is essential.” “We regularly endure great hardships, knowing our careers will not lead to great wealth, but out of a love for the service to others. That’s what we’re here to do and that’s what we’ll do whether there’s a government shutdown or not.”      Back to top           FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION  According to an agency official, the FAA will retain all employees necessary to keep the national airspace system operating safely. However, non-critical safety functions would be suspended including aircraft certification, the development, testing and evaluation of NextGen technologies and most budget and administrative activities.  The Federal Highway Administration and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration will be unaffected because both are funded by resources from the highway trust fund.  Federal Railroad Administration employees performing safety activities would continue working, but all federal high-speed rail work as well as policy and development work will be suspended.  This includes capital and debt service grant payments to Amtrak.   The official went on to say, ""We still believe there is an opportunity to avoid a government shutdown but are working to ensure that we are prepared for all possible scenarios.""      Back to top           U.S. PATENT OFFICE  The U.S. Patent Office will remain open during a government shutdown. The agency released the following statement:  ...in the event of a government shutdown on April 9, 2011, the United States Patent and Trademark Office will remain open and continue to operate as usual, for a fixed period, with all USPTO staff continuing to work and being paid. Because the USPTO maintains sufficient funding not linked to the current fiscal year, the USPTO can and will stay open for business. We have enough available reserves to remain in operation for six business days and intend to do so. During that time we will continue to process the patent and trademark applications that drive our country’s innovative economy. Should a shutdown continue longer than the six-day period, a small staff will continue to work to accept new applications and maintain IT infrastructure, among other functions.     Back to top           U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE  The following is a statement from Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn III to the DOD workforce regarding plans in the event of a shutdown. The department remains hopeful that a government shutdown will be averted. The President has made it clear that he does not want a government shutdown, and the administration is working to find a solution with which all sides can agree. However, prudent management requires that we plan for an orderly shutdown should Congress be unable to pass a funding bill before our current funding expires on April 8.  The President and the secretary know that the uncertainty of the current situation puts federal employees in a difficult position, and are very much aware that a shutdown would impose hardships on our military and civilian personnel as well as our military families. As we approach the expiration of the current continuing resolution, we will provide you with updated information as soon as it becomes available. For now, I want to provide you with information on how the potential shutdown - should it occur - will impact our military and civilian personnel.   Department of Defense (DoD) Operations During a Shutdown  Operations and activities that are essential to safety, protection of human life, and protection of our national security, are ‘excepted’ from shutting down. The DoD will continue to conduct activities in support of our national security, including operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Japan; Libya-related support operations; and other operations and activities essential to the security of our nation. The department must also continue to provide for the safety of human life and protection of property.  Other excepted activities will include inpatient and essential outpatient care in DoD medical treatment facilities; emergency dental care; non-appropriated funds activities such as mess halls and child care activities; certain legal activities to support ongoing litigation and legal assistance for deployed DoD personnel; contracting and logistics operations that are in support of excepted activities; certain education and training activities to include the DoD education activity schools; and financial management activities necessary to ensure the control and accountability of funds.  In the absence of appropriations, non-excepted activities that have not already been fully funded will need to be shut down in an orderly fashion. In accordance with existing laws and regulations, I will issue more detailed guidance to the department regarding specific activities that are considered excepted or non-excepted. However, the secretary and I understand that the military departments and defense agencies and individual commanders must tailor this guidance to many different situations around the world. Therefore, should there be a government shutdown, DoD personnel will be informed through their chain of command about how a shutdown may affect them personally.   Duty Status  Military personnel are not subject to furlough and will report for duty as normal during the shutdown. Reserve component personnel should refer to the DoD Contingency Guidance document and to their chain of command for more specific information.  Civilian personnel deemed to be performing excepted activities will continue to work during the period of a shutdown.  If there is a government shutdown beginning on Saturday, April 9, all DoD personnel should still report to work on their next scheduled duty day, beginning at their normal duty hours to receive additional instructions.  Civilians will be briefed by their supervisors by Friday, April 8, as to whether their work and responsibilities fall into excepted or non-excepted status, as defined by applicable laws and regulations. Excepted status categories are outlined in the DoD Contingency Guidance document, which is being distributed through the chain of command. If their work and responsibilities are non-excepted, or if they are not needed to carry out excepted work and responsibilities, employees will be furloughed in a non-pay status. Furloughed employees may not telework or volunteer to work.  Generally, contractors performing work on contracts funded prior to a shutdown, whether supporting excepted activities or not, may continue working and will be paid out of the obligated funds, subject to further direction from the contracting officer. New contracts, or increases in funding of existing contracts, needed to support excepted activities may be entered into during the period of a shutdown, but payments under such contracts cannot be made until Congress provides additional funding. Contract personnel should also report to work on Monday, April 11, to be briefed on their status.   Military, Civilian, and Retiree Pay  If the government shuts down due to the absence of funding, the DoD will have no funds to pay military members or civilian employees for the days during which the government is shut down. However, both military and civilian personnel will receive pay for the period worked prior to the shutdown. Military personnel, and civilians occupying excepted status positions and required to work, are entitled to be paid for work performed during the shutdown, and will be paid retroactively once the department receives additional funding. Congress would have to provide authority in order for the department to retroactively pay non-excepted employees for the furloughed period.  Military retirees and annuitants are not paid from annually appropriated funds, and therefore their benefits should continue without interruption.   Additional Resources  The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has created a document to address some of the questions that I know must be on your mind. The document can be accessed at http://www.opm.gov/furlough2011 . OPM will provide additional pertinent information for federal employees as the week progresses.  The department’s leadership will do our very best to provide clear information about the status of events as the week progresses. Additional information regarding military and DoD civilian pay, leave, and other DoD policies applicable to a potential shutdown will be posted on the department’s main website as soon as it becomes available.  Thanks to the hard work and dedication of all of you, the Department of Defense provides critical services to the American public. Your contributions touch people’s lives in so many significant ways, and I want you to know how deeply I appreciate your dedication and your expertise. Our decisions concerning which functions are excepted or not excepted are based on government-wide legal, regulatory, and policy guidance as well as our best judgment on how to reconcile our national security requirements with the limitations imposed by a government shutdown. The fact that certain functions are not excepted or that certain personnel may be subject to furlough should not be taken as a statement that the secretary or I or the department do not value those functions or employees. Thank you for your continued service to the department and the nation.”      Back to top           U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE  We received the following information from an agency official familiar with the agency’s plans:  We still believe there is an opportunity to avoid a government shutdown but are working to ensure that we are prepared for all possible scenarios.  Agency operational plans are still being finalized, but in the event of a government shutdown most USDA activities would be shut down or significantly reduced and most USDA employees would be furloughed.  However, certain USDA activities would continue because they are related to law enforcement, the protection of life and property, or are financed through available funding (such as through user fees).  These include: ·         Meat, poultry and egg inspection services ·         Grain and other commodity inspection, weighing and grading services funded by user fees ·         Inspections for import and export activities to prevent the introduction and dissemination of pests into and out of the U.S. ·         Forest Service law enforcement and fire suppression efforts.  ·         In addition, funds have been made available to continue the Women, Infants and Children and Child Nutrition programs through June, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program has sufficient funding to allow benefits to continue through May. Most other USDA activities would not be continued during a government shutdown.  These activities include: ·         Farm loans and other farm payments ·         Provision of conservation technical and financial assistance ·         Provision of new rural development loans and grants for housing, community facilities, utilities and businesses ·         Agricultural export credit and other agricultural trade development and monitoring activities ·         National Forest System recreation sites across the U.S. which require a Forest Service employee to stay open would be closed to the public. ·         Market news reports, NASS statistics, and other agricultural economic and statistical reports and projections would be discontinued ·         Investigation of packers and stockyards related to fraudulent and anti-competitive activities ·         Assistance for the control of most plant and animal pests and diseases would be discontinued ·         Research facilities would be closed except for the care of animals and plants ·         Most departmental management, administrative and oversight functions, including civil rights, human resources, financial management, audit, legal and information technology activities would be discontinued or severely curtailed.     Back to top            U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT  Overseas, the overwhelming majority of U.S. diplomats are considered essential personnel and are expected to remain at their posts, according to officials familiar with the plans. Exceptions include lower-ranking administrative embassy staff members, many of whom are not American. Many U.S. Agency for International Development operations are expected to continue as normal, because the agency relies on many contractors.      Back to top           FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION  The FHA is expected to stay open through a shutdown.

Back to top           THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION  At the Education Department, 4,150 out of 4,465 full- and part-time employees would be furloughed under a shutdown, according to an agency contingency plan.     Back to top           U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT Updated: 8:53 a.m. ET 4/8/2011   We have recevied the following message from USAID Administrator Raj Shah regarding thea agency’s plan in the event of a government shutdown:  E X E C U T I V E   M E S S A G E Subject: Memorandum for All Employees Throughout the discussions about funding for the rest of the fiscal year, the President has made it clear that he does not want a government shutdown, and the Administration is working day and night to find a solution with which all sides can agree. Given the realities of the calendar, however, prudent management requires that we plan for an orderly shutdown should Congress be unable to pass a funding bill. The President and I know that the uncertainty of the current situation puts Federal employees in a difficult position, and are very much aware that a shutdown would impose hardships on many employees as well as the groups and individuals USAID serves.  As we approach the expiration of the current CR, we will provide you with updated information as soon as it becomes available.  For now, I want to provide you with information on how the potential shutdown -- should it occur -- will impact Federal employees. As soon as funding lapses, Federal departments and agencies will not be permitted to incur further financial obligations performing activities funded by annual appropriations, except those related to the orderly suspension of operations or performance of excepted activities. This means that some employees will be furloughed and unable to work.  Our contingency planning for the potential funding lapse includes determining which agency functions are excepted from a furlough.  Should it become necessary to implement our contingency plans, you will receive formal notice from your manager no later than Friday April 8th regarding the designation of your position and furlough status. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has created a document toaddress some of the questions that I know must be on your mind.  The document can be accessed at www.opm.gov/furlough2011. OPM will provide additional pertinent information for federal employees as the week progresses.  And we will do our very best to provide clear information about the status of events as the week progresses.  We have established an e-mail box for questions that are not addressed on the OPM website noted above.  Thanks to the hard work and dedication of all of you, USAID is delivering results around the world, and, ultimately, to the American public.  Your contributions touch people's lives in so many significant ways, and I want you to know how deeply I appreciate your dedication and your expertise.  Thank you for your continued service to USAID and the Nation Sincerely, Raj Shah Administrator We also received this statement from Chief Operating Officer Sean Carroll:  Should a shutdown occur, USAID’s development work with and on behalf of partners around the world would be significantly curtailed. In the interests of national security and humanitarian response, we will continue much of our work in countries such as Afghanistan, Egypt, Haiti, Iraq, Japan, Libya, Pakistan, and Sudan. But, with less than 20% of our permanent staff on duty at Agency headquarters, and with less-than full staff contingents in our missions abroad, development and our partners would suffer. US Citizens and partners would not be able to access our development library and resources; our efforts to help US small and disadvantaged businesses participate in development work would be temporarily halted; and many USAID-sponsored and international partner activities on critical development issues would be cancelled. We hope that a government shutdown will be averted. And, if not averted, that it is short-lived, so that all of our dedicated staff can continue working on all the development fronts – global health, food security, democracy and governance, inclusive economic growth, education, climate change mitigation and others – that are in our national security interests.     Back to top           THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT  Employees would have to report for work as scheduled, because that agency maintains enough funding not linked to the fiscal calendar to continue operating for at least a few days.     Back to top           THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS  We received the following from a department official familiar with the agency’s plans: The Administration has expressed that we still believe there is an opportunity to avoid a government shutdown, but are working to ensure that we are prepared for all possible scenarios. Agency operational plans are still being finalized, but our current understanding is the following: *       Thanks to advance appropriations (a two-year budget cycle), VA will continue to provide 100 percent of our health care services to enrolled Veterans through VA medical facilities across the country. Veterans' medical appointments will not be canceled or delayed in the event of a partial government-wide shut down. *       Advance appropriations, received from Congress, accounts for more than 80% of the VA's discretionary appropriations. *       While there will be a reduction in benefits staffing, VA has taken measures to ensure, in the short-term, that Veterans currently receiving VA benefits will continue to receive those payments on a timely basis and without interruption.  *       VA will also continue to provide final resting places at our national cemeteries in the event of a partial government-wide shutdown.  Some cemeteries may operate on a modified schedule.   *       Some VA services that may be suspended in the event of a partial government-wide shut down involve answering consumer inquiries by e-mail, telephone or mail, routine recruiting, hiring and training, and fraud investigations. *       VA will provide a Veterans Field Guide with a more detailed analysis of the impact on benefits and services when and if a shut down occurs.    *       In the event of a shut down, we will ask Veterans to keep monitoring VA's web site for additional information, including frequently asked questions and correspondence from the leadership team.       Back to top           THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES  In the event of a shutdown, only security and minimal support staff would be allowed to work.

With Congress facing a midnight Friday deadline to either pass a short-term or final measure to fund government operations for the remainder of the fiscal year, Cabinet secretaries and agency heads planned to send an e-mail message to workers by close of business Wednesday informing them that a shutdown could occur, according to multiple administration officials familiar with the plans. A shutdown would not apply to a wide swath of agencies and departments that already have full-year funding in place thanks to a partial spending bill that passed in November, including the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, House and Urban Development, Justice, State, and Transportation, NASA, and other smaller agencies covered by separate appropriations measures. In a statement, Office of Management and Budget spokesman Kenneth Baer said Wednesday that “There is no reason for the government to shut down.”Congress could act quickly to pass a short- or long-term spending measure, Baer said, as they have seven times already this year.     View Photo Gallery: A look at some of the defining moments of 2011.   “We do need to be prepared for any contingency,” Baer said, which is why agencies were informing workers by e-mail.  In one example of the messages sent to federal workers Wednesday, the Interior Department told staffers that should a funding lapse occur, “Bargaining unit employees who are not engaged in one of the excepted functions will be placed in a furlough status,” the message said. Decisions on which “essential” workers and functions would continue during a shutdown would be made before it begins, officials said, but official guidance on contingency operations generally requires anyone working on issues related to public health and safety to keep working. Congress has passed two short-term spending measures to keep the government running since the fiscal year began Oct. 1. Lawmakers were expected this week to release a long-term spending measure to keep the government functional through September, but have yet to do so. Republicans insisted Tuesday they had a tentative deal with Democrats on the Appropriations Committee to fund the government through next September.  Republican leaders charged Tuesday that the White House and Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) have instructed lawmakers who brokered the pact to withhold their final signatures from a report that would send the deal for a vote until votes are held on an extension of the payroll tax. Federal agencies issued similar warnings to workers in early April as Congress and the White House faced a similar funding impasse. Those warnings came only after days of uncertainty and complaints from federal workers and their union leaders that the administration was keeping them in the dark about potential contingency plans. Many employees also complained that they did not receive formal communications regarding contingency plans in a timely manner. William R. Dougan, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, said a shutdown “would be devastating for federal workers at agencies where funding has not yet been approved by Congress.” “Federal workers shouldn’t have to spend the holidays worrying about how to make their next mortgage payment simply because Congress can’t get its act together,” Dougan said in a statement. “Federal employees, and indeed all Americans, deserve better from their government.”   Follow Ed O’Keefe on Twitter: @edatpost   More on FedPage and PostPolitics   Obama’s five paths to re-election   Gingrich: the GOP’s bomb-thrower   Perry kicks off Iowa bus tour   Gingrich aide out over Mormon comments    ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,"      By  Ed O'Keefe          Ed O'Keefe Reporter focused on Congress, national politics and the federal government  Bio  Follow         April 5, 2011      The look on this scuplture outside the U.S. Capitol says it all. (RON EDMONDS / AP)  In instructions updated and issued Tuesday evening, the Office of Personnel Management issued updated guidance on how a shutdown of even one day would impact each worker’s bottom line. You can read the full guidance here, but The Federal Eye read it and summarizes below:   Question: What is a furlough?  Answer: According to OPM’s official guidance, “A furlough is the placing of an employee in a temporary nonduty, nonpay status because of lack of work or funds, or other nondisciplinary reasons.”  Q: What is a shutdown furlough and why is one necessary?   A “shutdown furlough” occurs if federal funding runs out. It’s necessary for agencies that no longer have the funds necessary to keep working.   Q: Who’s an “essential” worker? (NOTE: OPM labels employees who work during a shutdown as “excepted employees”):  It’s people working or may continue to do so by law. “Essential/Excepted” employees include people: (1) performing emergency work involving the safety of human life or the protection of property, (2) performing minimal activities as necessary to execute an orderly suspension of agency operations related to non-excepted activities, or (3) performing certain other types of excepted work.  Top agency lawyers and managers are determining who’s considered “essential” and “non-essential.”  Other workers may be “excepted” from the shutdown furlough if their agency or program is covered by appropriations not impacted by the current budget impasse. (Best examples of that are the Federal Highway Administration, which is funded by the federal highway trust fund. The Veterans Health Administration is also handled on a two-year budget cycle.)  Q: How will employees be notified whether they have been designated to be handling ""excepted"" or ""non-excepted"" functions?  Answer: Each Agency will communicate with its employees whether they’re “essential” or “non-essential.”  Q: Are all employees who qualify as ""emergency employees"" for the purpose of weather emergencies considered “essential” during a shutdown?   A: Not necessarily. Emergency employees for weather purposes aren’t automatically deemed “essential” during shutdowns — each agency must determine which employees are excepted employees.   Q: May employees volunteer to do their job without pay during a shutdown?  A: No. Unless otherwise authorized by law, an agency may not accept the voluntary services of an employee. (The Anti-Deficiency Act is the law prohibiting voluntary work.)   Q: Can workers take another job during while furloughed?   A: Even if you’re furloughed, you’re still a federal employee and Executive Branch ethics regarding outside employment still apply. Employees should review those regulations before applying elsewhere.  Q: Will I be paid if I work during a shutdown? If so, when?   A: Agencies will sort out who gets paid for time worked during a shutdown and those employees will be paid when Congress passes and the president signs a new appropriation or continuing resolution.   Q: Will furloughed/non-essential employees be paid for not working during a shutdown?   A: Congress will determine whether “non-essential” workers receive pay for the furlough period.   Q: Can non-esential workers take previously-approved paid leave during a shutdown?   A. No. All paid leave during a shutdown furlough period must be canceled because the requirement to furlough supersedes leave rights. Paid leave creates a debt to the government that isn't authorized by law.   Q: Can essential personnel take previously-approved leave or be granted new requests for paid leave during a shutdown?  A. No. Essential personnel must be either doing their job or furloughed during any absence from work during a shutdown. If an excepted employee refuses to report for work after being ordered to do so, he or she will be considered in an absence without leave (AWOL) and will be subject to any subsequent consequences.  Q: Will an employee continue to be covered under the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) program during a shutdown furlough if the agency is unable to make its premium payments on time?  A. Yes, the employee’s FEHB coverage will continue even if an agency does not make the premium payments on time.  Q: What effect will a furlough have on other benefits that are paid for through payroll deductions?  A. It varies. Best thing to do is visit http://www.opm.gov/oca/leave/HTML/LWOP_eff.asp for more information.   Q: Are employees entitled to unemployment compensation while on furlough?  A. It is possible that furloughed employees may become eligible for unemployment compensation. But state unemployment compensation requirements differ. Some require a one-week waiting period before you apply. You should contact your state government directly and visit the Labor Department’s “Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees” information page.   Read the full OPM guidance here.

21,"           By  Greg Sargent          Greg Sargent Opinion writer covering national politics  Email  Bio  Follow         Opinion writer  October 30, 2015    To read much of the coverage — including some on this blog — you’d think that the threat of a government shutdown and other mischief that might be wrought by the hard right’s shenanigans had been defused. Now that a budget deal will fund the government and raise the debt ceiling into 2017, that means no more need to worry, right? Well, unfortunately not. It turns out that there are still potential landmines with a lot of explosive power buried in the budget process that could wreak a lot of havoc. And they pose a big test for new House Speaker Paul Ryan. Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee tell me that they are worried about the possibility of major sticking points looming over so-called “policy riders,” a threat that still remains even though Congress has agreed upon new spending levels that are higher than the caps imposed by the Budget Control Act, a.k.a. the sequester. The problem is that, even though the bulk amount of spending has been agreed upon, Congress will have to pass a dozen or so individual appropriations bills that fill in the specific spending in different areas of government. Democrats note that half a dozen of these bills have already passed the House, and all 12 are public. They’ll have to be renegotiated to align with the new, higher spending levels. But the already existing bills are currently loaded with policy riders on all sorts of conservative priorities, Democrats point out. Conservatives will likely pressure GOP leaders to keep these riders in, and pressure them to make them conditional on passing these bills — creating another leverage point that the right can try to exploit, potentially leading to sticking points that threaten government shutdowns. Rep. Nita Lowey, the ranking Dem on the House Appropriations Committee, says this in an emailed statement:  “Passing this budget agreement and preventing a debt default is a positive step. But let’s be very clear – enacting an Omnibus spending bill in six weeks that includes hundreds of difficult policy and funding decisions is no simple task.  There is still a long way to go before congratulating ourselves for avoiding a shutdown.”  To get a sense of what sort of policy riders we’re talking about here, read David Dayen’s good piece explaining how serious a problem this could prove. Here’s his list of riders that are currently in appropriations bills that have already passed:  The appropriations bills on offer would cancel all federal funding for Planned Parenthood. They would prevent enforcement of a proposed Labor Department regulation to mandate investment advisers to operate in their clients’ best interest. They would cancel the Federal Communication Commission’s net neutrality rules. They would stop environmental regulations on clean water, endangered species, and air-quality standards for ozone, and block an Occupational Safety and Health Administration rule on toxic silica dust in the workplace.  They would exempt flavored cigarettes currently on the market from regulation. They would halt the Securities and Exchange Commission from completing rules requiring publicly traded companies to disclose political spending. They would block rules limiting the hours long-haul truckers can spend on the road without rest. And they would change hundreds of other rules, regulations, and funding priorities.  As Dayen explains:  These aren’t primarily funding decisions, but unrelated favors that reward conservative friends (typically businesses seeking to be unshackled from regulations) and punish enemies such as Planned Parenthood and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. They would fail as standalone legislation, but can pass when attached to the budget like barnacles to a ship.  And they are exactly the type of policies — repealing environmental and safety regulations, attacking Planned Parenthood — that conservatives deemed important enough to be worth shutting down the government for.  This all sets up a very interesting situation for incoming Speaker Ryan. He has vowed to make the House governable again, and has sought rules changes to insulate himself from blowback from House conservatives if and when he makes governing compromises that anger them. John Boehner’s shepherding through of a big budget deal did take big steps towards clearing the decks for Ryan to take over. But conservatives may regroup and mount a new round of pressure on Ryan to use these riders to fight for conservative priorities, such as defunding Planned Parenthood, rolling back or weakening Obama’s new efforts to curb carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants, and so forth. To be sure, conservatives will probably expect their leaders to cave on many of these, but it’s still an occasion for more infighting between them and GOP leaders — and more conservative anger and disappointment towards them. “This will be a huge first test for Ryan,” one senior adviser to a conservative member of Congress tells me. “Conservatives will want their leaders to make a stand on Planned Parenthood, Obama’s carbon plan, etc. But there’s nothing to give conservatives faith the leadership will do that. This will be another rough patch.” Meanwhile, liberals will likely pressure Democratic leaders not to cave, either — they will demand Senate Democrats stand firm in filibustering any appropriations bills that do include any of these riders. So, while it’s true that the threat of calamity has been dramatically reduced, we could see more games of Congressional chicken as the December 11th deadline for an agreement funding the government over the long term approaches — games that could still create a lot of noisy drama and do a fair amount of damage.         window.havePowaBoot=true;    ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"     FILE - This Wednesday, Aug. 1, 2018, file photo shows the Capitol in Washington. As a potentially catastrophic hurricane heads for the Carolinas, Congress is moving to avert a legislative disaster that could lead to a partial government shutdown just weeks before the November midterm elections. (J. Scott Applewhite, File)       By  Erica Werner          Erica Werner Congressional reporter focusing on economic policy  Email  Bio  Follow         September 13, 2018  Congressional leaders from both parties have finalized a plan to avert a government shutdown at month’s end over President Trump’s demands to fund a border wall. Instead they will aim to postpone that fight until after the November midterm elections. The bipartisan pact, announced on Thursday by Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ), reflects the desire of Republican leaders to avoid a nasty shutdown fight weeks before the midterm elections — even if it means sacrificing, at least for now, one of Trump’s most prominent policy goals. House GOP leadership aides say they believe the White House is on board with their approach, but no one can be sure what Trump ultimately will do. GOP leaders have been pushing Trump to back off rhetoric about shutting down the government, but he has vacillated, suggesting it could be good politics to force a shutdown Oct. 1 to try to get the money he wants for his wall. While the announcement Thursday reduces the odds of a shutdown, midterm politics or the Freedom Caucus, a group of very conservative members allied with Trump, could always throw a curveball. “The president will have to sign it into law or shut down the government,” Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.) said at a meeting of a House-Senate Appropriations conference committee that signed off on the deal.         window.havePowaBoot=true;  Government funding runs out on Sept 30. Congress is working to send Trump a number of must-pass spending bills for 2019 before then — including crucial measures funding the Pentagon and Health and Human Services Department. On Thursday, the House overwhelmingly passed a $147 billion three-bill package funding Veterans Affairs, military construction and numerous other programs, sending it to Trump for his signature. But with only four legislative days left in the House before the Sept. 30 deadline, the rest of the spending bills that keep the government running will likely have to wait until after the election. That includes spending for the Homeland Security Department that pays for the wall. Frelinghuysen announced those agencies will be funded on autopilot with a short-term spending bill lasting through Dec. 7. The so-called continuing resolution will be attached to a spending bill that includes huge funding increases for 2019 for the Pentagon — a major priority for Republicans and Trump — and big increases for the Health and Human Services Department, a Democratic goal. This setup is aimed at greasing passage through the House and Senate — and allowing Trump to claim a win on the military funding. Republicans insisted they still support funding the border wall as Trump wants, but that it doesn’t make sense to have a fight about it ahead of the midterm elections. The House Appropriations Committee has allocated $5 billion for the wall for 2019 — the figure Trump wants — but the Senate Appropriations Committee bill provides only $1.6 billion. Senate Democrats have shown no interest in going along with the higher number from the House, and Democrats have the ability to block spending bills which require bipartisan votes in the Senate. Trump long claimed that Mexico would pay for the wall. “It doesn’t make a lot of sense to shut down the government and we’ll fight that fight when it comes, but this isn’t the time to have it,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee. “I don’t presume to speak for the president but our leadership tells us that they’ve been in constant communication with the administration and that we’re proceeding on plan, so I assume that’s the case.” The deal could also cement another setback for deficit hawks, because it would continue the Trump-era tradition of boosting up spending levels in the hopes of receiving bipartisan support. Trump had campaigned with a promise to cut spending, but he has consistently increased in since last year. The plan to attach a continuing resolution and Health and Human Services spending to the Pentagon funding bill has angered conservatives in the House, some of whom are already announcing plans to oppose the measure. “We’re using DOD as the leverage for every other bad fiscal decision,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the Freedom Caucus. Although some conservatives, including Meadows, support the decision to delay a border wall funding fight, they are frustrated that many of their policy priorities got left out of the health, labor and education bill because they would not pass muster with Senate Democrats. These included provisions blocking funding for Planned Parenthood, for fetal tissue research and for administering the Affordable Care Act; and allowing federal funding for adoption agencies that do not want to work with same-sex couples.  But Democrats didn’t get everything they wanted either. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) saw a bipartisan provision dropped that would have required disclosure of prescription drug prices in television ads. And Democrats failed to add a provision that would have barred use of a federal school grant program to buy guns. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has said she will not stop districts if they choose to use their funding for firearms. In response, Democrats sought to clarify that such spending was not allowed, but Republicans said the provision wasn’t needed.   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,"     FILE - This Wednesday, Aug. 1, 2018, file photo shows the Capitol in Washington. As a potentially catastrophic hurricane heads for the Carolinas, Congress is moving to avert a legislative disaster that could lead to a partial government shutdown just weeks before the November midterm elections. (J. Scott Applewhite, File)       By  Erica Werner          Erica Werner Congressional reporter focusing on economic policy  Email  Bio  Follow         September 13, 2018  Congressional leaders from both parties have finalized a plan to avert a government shutdown at month’s end over President Trump’s demands to fund a border wall. Instead they will aim to postpone that fight until after the November midterm elections. The bipartisan pact, announced on Thursday by Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ), reflects the desire of Republican leaders to avoid a nasty shutdown fight weeks before the midterm elections — even if it means sacrificing, at least for now, one of Trump’s most prominent policy goals. House GOP leadership aides say they believe the White House is on board with their approach, but no one can be sure what Trump ultimately will do. GOP leaders have been pushing Trump to back off rhetoric about shutting down the government, but he has vacillated, suggesting it could be good politics to force a shutdown Oct. 1 to try to get the money he wants for his wall. While the announcement Thursday reduces the odds of a shutdown, midterm politics or the Freedom Caucus, a group of very conservative members allied with Trump, could always throw a curveball. “The president will have to sign it into law or shut down the government,” Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.) said at a meeting of a House-Senate Appropriations conference committee that signed off on the deal.         window.havePowaBoot=true;  Government funding runs out on Sept 30. Congress is working to send Trump a number of must-pass spending bills for 2019 before then — including crucial measures funding the Pentagon and Health and Human Services Department. On Thursday, the House overwhelmingly passed a $147 billion three-bill package funding Veterans Affairs, military construction and numerous other programs, sending it to Trump for his signature. But with only four legislative days left in the House before the Sept. 30 deadline, the rest of the spending bills that keep the government running will likely have to wait until after the election. That includes spending for the Homeland Security Department that pays for the wall. Frelinghuysen announced those agencies will be funded on autopilot with a short-term spending bill lasting through Dec. 7. The so-called continuing resolution will be attached to a spending bill that includes huge funding increases for 2019 for the Pentagon — a major priority for Republicans and Trump — and big increases for the Health and Human Services Department, a Democratic goal. This setup is aimed at greasing passage through the House and Senate — and allowing Trump to claim a win on the military funding. Republicans insisted they still support funding the border wall as Trump wants, but that it doesn’t make sense to have a fight about it ahead of the midterm elections.

24,"           By  Glenn Kessler          Glenn Kessler The Fact Checker  Email  Bio  Follow        November 18, 2014       U.S. President Barack Obama speaks during his news conference at the G20 Summit in Brisbane, Australia, Sunday, Nov. 16, 2014. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)  “Well, actually, my position hasn’t changed.” –President Obama, news conference at conclusion of G20 summit, Brisbane, Australia, Nov. 16, 2014 Politicians generally hate to say they have changed their minds about something. With President Obama poised to take executive action to address immigration, perhaps as early as this week, he was challenged by a reporter to explain why he believed he could take this action now, after years of saying his hands were tied. The president responded with a Pinocchio-laden straw man, saying that the questions had a distinct focus: “their interest was in me, through executive action, duplicating the legislation that was stalled in Congress.” But as we shall see, the questions actually specifically addressed the sorts of actions that he is contemplating now. There is precedence for such a shift. In 2011, the president said he could not take action to help “dreamers’—immigrants aged 30 and younger whose parents had brought them to this country when they were children– from being deported. But then in 2012, he halted deportations and allowed them to apply for temporary work permits. Univision Town Hall, March 28, 2011: ‘The executive branch’s job is to enforce and implement those laws.’       Question: Mr. President, my question will be as follows: With an executive order, could you be able to stop deportations of the students? And if that’s so, that links to another of the questions that we have received through univision.com. We have received hundreds, thousand, all related to immigration and the students. Kay Tomar  through Univision.com told us — I’m reading — “What if at least you grant temporary protective status, TPS, to undocumented students? If the answer is yes, when? And if no, why not?” Obama: Well, first of all, temporary protective status historically has been used for special circumstances where you have immigrants to this country who are fleeing persecution in their countries, or there is some emergency situation in their native land that required them to come to the United States. So it would not be appropriate to use that just for a particular group that came here primarily, for example, because they were looking for economic opportunity. With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, that’s just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed — and I know that everybody here at Bell is studying hard so you know that we’ve got three branches of government. Congress passes the law. The executive branch’s job is to enforce and implement those laws. And then the judiciary has to interpret the laws. There are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as President. Interview with Univision, Jan. 31, 2013: ‘I’m not a king’ Question: Now I know that you have reduced, this is another concern on Twitter, the number of deportations of non-criminals. However, in 2012 more than 184,000 non-criminals were deported. In the spirit of your push for immigration reform, would you consider a moratorium on deportations of non-criminals? Remember, these are your words: “This is not about policy. It’s about people.” Obama: Well, I think it is important to remind everybody that, as I said I think previously, and I’m not a king. I am the head of the executive branch of government. I’m required to follow the law. And that’s what we’ve done. But what I’ve also said is, let’s make sure that we’re applying the law in a way that takes into account people’s humanity. That’s the reason that we moved forward on deferred action. Within the confines of the law we said, we have some discretion in terms of how we apply this law. The same is true with respect to the kinds of the length of time that people have to spend outside of the country when their spouses are already here for example. So we’re making some changes there. But there are still going to be stories that are heartbreaking with respect to deportations until we get comprehensive immigration reform. That’s one of the reasons I think it’s so important for us to go ahead and get this action done. And keep in mind that if we’re able to say, at the end of this year, or maybe even before the end of the summer, that we’ve gotten comprehensive immigration reform done, then that then empowers me to deal with many of these issues in a way that I think, to allow the more specific issues that a lot of people I think would like to see resolved. Google Hangout, Feb. 14, 2013: ‘I’m not the emperor of the United States’       Question: Your administration has deported a record high number, 1.5 million, of undocumented immigrants, more than your predecessor. And I know your administration took some steps last year to protect unintended undocumented immigrants from being deported. However many people say those efforts were not enough. What I’d like to know is what you’re going to do now, and until the time that immigration reform is passed, to insure that more people aren’t being deported and families are not being broken apart. Obama: Well, look Jackie, this is something I’ve struggled with throughout my presidency. The problem is that you know I’m the president of the United States. I’m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed, and Congress right now has not changed what I consider to be a broken immigration system. And what that means is that we have certain obligations to enforce the laws that are in place, even if we think that in many cases the results may be tragic. And what we have been able to do is to make sure that we’re focusing our enforcement resources on criminals — as opposed to somebody who’s here, just trying to work and look after their families. What we have tried to do is administratively reduce the burdens and hardships on families being separated. And what we’ve done, obviously, is pass the deferred action which made sure that the dream, uh, uh dreamers, young people who were brought here and think of themselves as Americans, are American except for their papers, that they’re not deported. Having said all that, we’ve got to stretch our administrative flexibility as much as we can. And that’s why making sure we get comprehensive immigration reform done is so important. Interview with Noticias Telmundo, Sept. 17, 2013: ‘There is a path to get this done and that is through Congress.’       Question: Won’t you at least consider unilaterally freezing the deportations for parents of deferred-action kids? Obama: Here’s the problem that I have, Jose, and I have said this consistently. My job in the executive branch is to carry out the laws that are passed. Congress has said, here’s the law when it comes to those who are undocumented, and they allocate a whole bunch of money for enforcement. What I have been able to do is make a legal argument that I think is absolutely right, which is that given the resources we have, we can’t do everything that Congress has asked us to do, what we can do is then carve out the DREAM Act folks…. But if we start broadening that, then essentially, I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. So that’s not an option. I do get a little worried that advocates of immigration reform start losing heart and immediately thinking, well, somehow there’s an out here—that if Congress doesn’t act, we will just have the president sign something and that will take care of it, and we won’t have to worry about it. What I have said is that there is a path to get this done and that is through Congress.” The Pinocchio Test The president has certainly been consistent on this issue—until he saw that the path through Congress was blocked. It’s clear from the interviews that the president was not being asked about executive orders that would have provided comprehensive immigration reform, but about specific actions that ended deportations of a subset of illegal immigrants—precisely the type of action he will shortly unveil. Previously he said that was not possible, using evocative language that he is not a “king” or “the emperor.” Apparently he’s changed his mind.

27,"           By  Glenn Kessler          Glenn Kessler The Fact Checker  Email  Bio  Follow        November 18, 2014       U.S. President Barack Obama speaks during his news conference at the G20 Summit in Brisbane, Australia, Sunday, Nov. 16, 2014. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)  “Well, actually, my position hasn’t changed.” –President Obama, news conference at conclusion of G20 summit, Brisbane, Australia, Nov. 16, 2014 Politicians generally hate to say they have changed their minds about something. With President Obama poised to take executive action to address immigration, perhaps as early as this week, he was challenged by a reporter to explain why he believed he could take this action now, after years of saying his hands were tied. The president responded with a Pinocchio-laden straw man, saying that the questions had a distinct focus: “their interest was in me, through executive action, duplicating the legislation that was stalled in Congress.” But as we shall see, the questions actually specifically addressed the sorts of actions that he is contemplating now. There is precedence for such a shift. In 2011, the president said he could not take action to help “dreamers’—immigrants aged 30 and younger whose parents had brought them to this country when they were children– from being deported. But then in 2012, he halted deportations and allowed them to apply for temporary work permits. Univision Town Hall, March 28, 2011: ‘The executive branch’s job is to enforce and implement those laws.’       Question: Mr. President, my question will be as follows: With an executive order, could you be able to stop deportations of the students? And if that’s so, that links to another of the questions that we have received through univision.com. We have received hundreds, thousand, all related to immigration and the students. Kay Tomar  through Univision.com told us — I’m reading — “What if at least you grant temporary protective status, TPS, to undocumented students? If the answer is yes, when? And if no, why not?” Obama: Well, first of all, temporary protective status historically has been used for special circumstances where you have immigrants to this country who are fleeing persecution in their countries, or there is some emergency situation in their native land that required them to come to the United States. So it would not be appropriate to use that just for a particular group that came here primarily, for example, because they were looking for economic opportunity. With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, that’s just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed — and I know that everybody here at Bell is studying hard so you know that we’ve got three branches of government. Congress passes the law. The executive branch’s job is to enforce and implement those laws. And then the judiciary has to interpret the laws. There are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as President. Interview with Univision, Jan. 31, 2013: ‘I’m not a king’ Question: Now I know that you have reduced, this is another concern on Twitter, the number of deportations of non-criminals. However, in 2012 more than 184,000 non-criminals were deported. In the spirit of your push for immigration reform, would you consider a moratorium on deportations of non-criminals? Remember, these are your words: “This is not about policy. It’s about people.” Obama: Well, I think it is important to remind everybody that, as I said I think previously, and I’m not a king. I am the head of the executive branch of government. I’m required to follow the law. And that’s what we’ve done. But what I’ve also said is, let’s make sure that we’re applying the law in a way that takes into account people’s humanity. That’s the reason that we moved forward on deferred action. Within the confines of the law we said, we have some discretion in terms of how we apply this law. The same is true with respect to the kinds of the length of time that people have to spend outside of the country when their spouses are already here for example. So we’re making some changes there. But there are still going to be stories that are heartbreaking with respect to deportations until we get comprehensive immigration reform. That’s one of the reasons I think it’s so important for us to go ahead and get this action done. And keep in mind that if we’re able to say, at the end of this year, or maybe even before the end of the summer, that we’ve gotten comprehensive immigration reform done, then that then empowers me to deal with many of these issues in a way that I think, to allow the more specific issues that a lot of people I think would like to see resolved. Google Hangout, Feb. 14, 2013: ‘I’m not the emperor of the United States’       Question: Your administration has deported a record high number, 1.5 million, of undocumented immigrants, more than your predecessor. And I know your administration took some steps last year to protect unintended undocumented immigrants from being deported. However many people say those efforts were not enough. What I’d like to know is what you’re going to do now, and until the time that immigration reform is passed, to insure that more people aren’t being deported and families are not being broken apart. Obama: Well, look Jackie, this is something I’ve struggled with throughout my presidency. The problem is that you know I’m the president of the United States. I’m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed, and Congress right now has not changed what I consider to be a broken immigration system. And what that means is that we have certain obligations to enforce the laws that are in place, even if we think that in many cases the results may be tragic. And what we have been able to do is to make sure that we’re focusing our enforcement resources on criminals — as opposed to somebody who’s here, just trying to work and look after their families. What we have tried to do is administratively reduce the burdens and hardships on families being separated. And what we’ve done, obviously, is pass the deferred action which made sure that the dream, uh, uh dreamers, young people who were brought here and think of themselves as Americans, are American except for their papers, that they’re not deported. Having said all that, we’ve got to stretch our administrative flexibility as much as we can. And that’s why making sure we get comprehensive immigration reform done is so important. Interview with Noticias Telmundo, Sept. 17, 2013: ‘There is a path to get this done and that is through Congress.’       Question: Won’t you at least consider unilaterally freezing the deportations for parents of deferred-action kids? Obama: Here’s the problem that I have, Jose, and I have said this consistently. My job in the executive branch is to carry out the laws that are passed. Congress has said, here’s the law when it comes to those who are undocumented, and they allocate a whole bunch of money for enforcement. What I have been able to do is make a legal argument that I think is absolutely right, which is that given the resources we have, we can’t do everything that Congress has asked us to do, what we can do is then carve out the DREAM Act folks…. But if we start broadening that, then essentially, I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. So that’s not an option. I do get a little worried that advocates of immigration reform start losing heart and immediately thinking, well, somehow there’s an out here—that if Congress doesn’t act, we will just have the president sign something and that will take care of it, and we won’t have to worry about it. What I have said is that there is a path to get this done and that is through Congress.” The Pinocchio Test The president has certainly been consistent on this issue—until he saw that the path through Congress was blocked. It’s clear from the interviews that the president was not being asked about executive orders that would have provided comprehensive immigration reform, but about specific actions that ended deportations of a subset of illegal immigrants—precisely the type of action he will shortly unveil. Previously he said that was not possible, using evocative language that he is not a “king” or “the emperor.” Apparently he’s changed his mind.

28,"      By William Claiborne     July 8, 1978  Israeli and Syrian troops faced off across their common border yesterday in a show of strength precipitated by Syria's five-day bombardment of the Christian quarter of Beirut. Reacting to thinly veiled threats of intervention by Israeli and the rooftop level overflight of Beirut Thursday by Israeli jet fighters. Syria deployed troops along its border near the Golan Heights and put its airport and anti-aircraft units on alert, apparently anticipating air attacks either on military posts in south Lebanon or on artillery brigades surrounding Beirut's besieged Christian sector. The Israeli army reinforced its military units along the Lebanese border and moved units stationed in northern Israeli closer to Lebanon in a move reminiscent of many previous confrontations with its Arab neighbors. The United States and the Soviet Union were reported to be working behind the scenes to defuse tensions and preclude the latest Lebanese crisis from erupting into a full-scale Middle East confrontation. Israeli officials said yesterday's deployment was less a strategic maneuver than another signal to Syria that it will not tolerate a movement of Syrian peacekeeping forces farther south in Lebanon. Israeli military officials would not say how many army units are involved or where they were moved. Israeli government officials toned down noticeably their blunt threats of Thursday, apparently by way of waiting to see whether the Syrian army renews its shelling of East Beirut. Moshe Arens, head of the Israeli parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, said in Tel Aviv that ""all necessary action"" should be taken by Israeli to prevent a takeover of Lebanon by Syria and to put an end to the killing of Christians in Beirut. Arens said that if Syria, which was invited into Lebanon 2 1/2 years ago by the Lebanese government to serve as a peacekeeping force during the 1975-76 civil war, succeeds in destroying the Chirstian forces, a new frontier would be created on Israeli's border. If the Beirut situation continues to deteriorate, Arens said, it should be clear to the world - and particularly to the United States - that Israeli will ""no remain indifferent."" Aren's statement, the only public warning issued yesterday by a highlevel Israel official, was low-key compared to the threats made Thursday by several top government officials. Then, Eliahu Ben-Elissar, director general of the prime minister's office, said that if the Syrians continued the bombardment, Israel would ""consider steps to be taken in order not to let the Christians be annihilated."" It was then that seven Israeli Kfir jet fighters made two supersonic passes low over Beirut, shattering windows. During the Lebanese civil war, similar overflights were made over Beirut by the Israelis. Israeli officials said that in addition to their humanitarian concerns for the Christians - who have been allied with Israel for a long time - they were concerned that a Syrian takeover in Lebanon would change the balance of forces in the Middle East and result in an increased security threat to Israel. Israeli's close attachment to Christian Lebanese forces has been apparent for a long time, but not as much as when the Israeli army withdrew from south Lebanon on June 13 following the invasion a month before and turned key positions over to right-wing Christian militias, against the wishes of the United Nations. That step led to suggestions that Israel intended to circumvent the United Nations and retain control over the border area by proxy, since it is known to supply the Phalangist forces with arms and money. A possibility raised by the threat of intervention is that of an internationalization of the Syrian-Christian conflict, which ultimately could leads to a partition of Lebanon into Christian and Moslem sectors. The secretariat of Israeli's Democratic Movement for Change Party yesterday suggested such a step when it called on the government to demand U.N. Security Council action in the Beirut conflict. Meanwhile, Christian military leaders in Beirut said that 450 Christians have been killed in the recent attacks and 1,400 have been wounded. A spokesman for the Phalangists said that the Christians, surrounded by approximately 20,000 Syrian troops, could hold out for only a few more days. Peres insisted he would conduct no negotiations with Sadat. ""I would rather describe the meeting as a dialogue. I am not coming with my own plan,"" the Israeli Labor Party leader said. Meanwhile, qualified sources said the United States has set July 18 as the opening date for talks on the Middle East in London among the Egytian and Israeli foreign ministers and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance. The talks will be the first face-to-face peace negotiations between Israel and Egypt since January. Peres called the new Egyptian proposal ""incomplete."" ""It describes what Israel should do but it does not say what Egypt would do in return,"" he said. ""There is practically nothing in it about peace and normalization."" Peres said the initiative for his meeting with Sadat came from Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky and Socialist International president Willy Brandt of West Germany. The Egyptian leader is to meet with both Kreisky and Brandt during his five-day visit here. It will be Peres' second meeting with Sadat. They met first at Salzburg, Austria, in February.

30,"      By  William Branigin          William Branigin Reporter and editor covering breaking news  Email  Bio        January 30, 1980  For the Afghan refugees at this camp in western Pakistan, home is just over a snow-covered mountain. That is why they refuse to leave their remote, rocky hilltop for camps deeper inside Pakistan where they might find easier access to relief aid and a more hospitable climate. ""We want to live here, as close as possible to our country,"" says Mitta Khan, a grizzled villager wounded in fighting against Afghan government troops two months ago. Nevertheless, he refuses to return to Afghanistan without new weapons and ammunition to carry on a guerrilla war against the Soviet troops that invaded his country last month. We have to stay here,""Khan said, ""because we're helpless and empty-handed."" For the Pakistani authorities who administer and guard this territory, which jabs like a finger into Afghanistan's eastern flank, thousands of heavily armed refugees on this side of the border can only mean trouble. In view of what they regard as a Soviet threat to their country's fragile integrity, the Pakistani armed forces here are taking care to keep a low profile and avoid any activities that might appear provocative to their neighbor. At headquarters in nearby Parachinar of the district's Frontier Corps, the Pakistani military's border guards, a young officer acknowledged that the Army deliberately was not reinforcing its troops here because that might entail reciporcal action by the Soviets. ""Then, just one spark and there would be war,"" the officer said. So far, he said, the Soviets have not made any move to deploy in strength along Afghanistan' eastern border with Pakistan, although that is where much of the Afghan rebel activity has been concentrated. Nor has there been any effort by the new rulers in the Afghan capital of Kabul to man the border posts near the Afghan village of Patan a few miles north of here. From the Pakistani side, the fortress-like Afghan post shows no sign of life. Like many other such posts, according to Pakistani officers, it has long been abandoned. Except for the nearby Pakistani border station, manned by a dozen guards, there appears to be nothing to stop the flow of refugees across the border. The border station is easily avoided. However, local authorities have received reports, which they have not been able to confirm, that Soviet forces have mined the dirt roads leading to that crossing point. In any case, most other passes through the area's high mountains have been blocked by snow, and refugee crossings lately have slowed to a trickle. An estimated 600,000 Afghan refugees have fled to Pakistan since an April 1978 coup brought the first of three Marxist governments to power. One place where Afghan refugees are still able to cross is over the relatively low mountains just west of this camp. That was the route taken three weeks ago by the 50 families -- nearly the entire population of the Afghan village of Sikram near the town of Gardez -- that now live in a conglomeration of about 30 tents, 20 camels and assorted cattle, goats, chickens and dogs. In mid-December, according to Ghanam Rang, the camps' elder, bombing destroyed many of the houses in the village. Even cattle were killed, he said ""Throughout the year we were subjected to bombing,"" Rang said. ""Then when we could no longer put up any resistance, we had to leave."" Rang and other refugees claim that even before the Dec. 27 Soviet-inspired coup in Afghanistan, the air strikes against Afghan villages were carried out by Soviet pilots. Other accounts by refugees in this area vary little. Most describe spontaneous local uprisings against a communist Afghan government regarded as un-Islamic and infidel, followed by harsh retaliation including aerial bombardment of villages, then a trek to Pakistan because of inadequate means to fight back. ""Nobody incited us to fight against the enemy,"" Rang said. ""We ourselves started fighting for the glory of Islam. We are believers in God, and these people wanted us to leave our faith. Tell me, how can I renounce my religion?"" Conditions here are among the most miserable of the Afghan refugee camps that have sprung up since Moslem rebels began to wage an uncoordinated guerrilla war against the central goverenment 20 months ago. The refugees at Matasangar Camp live almost exclusively on bread and tea. They say none of the food donated by foreign relief agencies and governments has reached here yet. What they have received so far has been wheat flour sold to them at reduced prices by the financially strapped Pakistani government, as well as some donated tents and blankets. The subsidized Pakistani food program also is stretched thin. To supplement a U.N. World Food Program relief effort that is just getting off the ground, the Pakistanis also are giving the refugees four biscuits a person each month. The world Food Program is to supply $5 million worth of wheat, lentils, vegetable oil and dry skim milk over a six-month period. But that will fall well short of the refugees' estimated needs. The altitude here is higher -- about 5,700 feet -- and the weather harsher than at any other camp. About 20 persons, most of them children, have died in the subfreezing temperatures since this and an adjacent camp were set up. In their tents -- most of them leaky patchworks of hemp matting and sectins of canvas -- partitions of dried mud separate the refugees' sleeping areas from spaces for their animals. One reason for concern is growing resentment among Pakistani Moslems of the Shiite sect against Afghan refugees, who are almost entirely Sunni Moslems. ""The Shiites are not happy with the influx of Afghan refugees in this area,"" said Taj Mohammad Khan, the federal administrator of the Kurram Agency, or district, in Parachinar. ""They fear that if the Sunnis settle here, it will disturb the balance. To show their displeasure, they have killed a number of Afghan refugees on the road."" He said that since November, 12 refugees have been killed near Parachinar, which has a Shiite majority. Pakistani Sunnis, who are in the majority nationwide, seem to be tolerating the refugees, if not always welcoming them with open arms. Local Pakistani officials charged with distributing assistance to the refugees here appear genuinely interested in helping them and try hard to allocate their meager resources.

31,"      By John Lantigua     April 8, 1985  Large areas of the northern Nicaraguan mountains have been cleared of civilians, according to government military officials, who say those wilderness areas are now strictly war zones in which the Sandinistas will increase their firepower. On a recent trip beyond this town 120 miles north of Managua, I walked about seven miles into one of those newly militarized zones where until now the rebels had been able to find food, refuge, information and recruits. The residents evacuated in the past two months were among at least 7,000 families that the Sandinistas say they are in the process of relocating to less remote areas. According to local military officials, the road I followed is being improved to facilitate the Army's access to the mountainous zone, considered strategic because it is just across the border from Honduras and the largest of the rebel camps, called Las Vegas. The spine of hills that runs out of Honduras and by Murra has been a principal thoroughfare for the contra rebels who enter Nicaragua from that camp, Sandinista officials say. Houses along the road were abandoned and had been emptied of all possessions. In some cases, roofing material had been dragged away and the insides of the stripped houses were exposed to the elements. In other houses, bread ovens and primitive cooking stoves made of clay had been smashed to prevent use by the rebels. There were no people to be seen. Chickens, pigs and cows, which normally surround such rural houses and which the rebels have been known to buy from farmers, were also gone. On trees, the Sandinistas had posted a message telling the rebels that 1985 would be a year in which they ""continue to be defeated"" and offering them amnesty. Entitled ""A Letter of Return,"" the poster featured a drawing of a uniformed rebel turning in his rifle and being welcomed joyfully by his family. ""The Popular Sandinista Army agrees to respect your life, your physical integrity and agrees to give you just and dignified treatment if you deliver yourself with this document to our troops or to the nearest militia post with your rifle and your equipment,"" it said. After almost two hours of walking, I rounded a bend and was stopped by the sound of a bullet being shifted to the chamber of a bolt-action rifle. No one was visible. As I raised my hands, a Sandinista soldier stepped out from behind a canvas lean-to farther up the road. Lt. Felix Sanchez, who was at a makeshift camp around the next bend, said no civilians were to be in the area. He said the next Sandinista outpost, at an abandoned hamlet called Rosario overlooking the border, had been besieged last month by hundreds of rebels, and that 11 Sandinistas had died there. Sanchez said his men, who patrol for three miles around their camp, taking them close to the border, had not seen a contra in two weeks. ""We think they are in Honduras reorganizing,"" he said. ""They used to take advantage of people who lived in areas like this. They used to get food from them, but now they can't anymore and they are having to reorganize."" In an interview in Managua, Tomas Borge, minister in charge of internal security, said that with civilians removed from the area ""it makes it easier to use our artillery. It clearly becomes a war zone."" Observers said they expect to see use of Soviet-made Mi24 helicopter gunships. Asked if the Mi24 would be used in the new militarized zones, Borge said: ""If such helicopters were here, it would be stupid to have them as museum pieces."" Borge said he expected rebel attacks soon in conjunction with a congressional vote on whether the United States should renew their funding.   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,"      By  Michael Cavna          Michael Cavna Writer/artist for Comic Riffs, covering visual storytelling, cartoon art/illustration, comedy/satire and animation.   Email  Bio  Follow         November 14, 2013    HAVING THE name “Seth MacFarlane” attached to an animated show about immigration already had some pop-culture watchers on high alert. A new name on the project, though, seems to have assuaged some concerns.  Lalo Alcaraz, the commentator and creator of the syndicated, sociopolitically themed strip “La Cucaracha,” has been announced as a writer on the show “Bordertown,” which is set to debut next fall on Fox. Now there’s a distinct ray of hope that even if the show takes satiric swipes at immigrants, those one-liners will be just one part of an equal-opportunity comedy. “Everybody gets poked fun at in ‘Bordertown,’ “ Alcaraz tells Comic Riffs, “but its main focus is the changing world around the modern-day Archie Bunker, put-upon character, [Border Patrol agent] Bud Buckwald -- and his relationship with his neighbor, the unflappable and optimistic Mexican immigrant character, Ernesto Gonzalez.”           ""Bordertown’s” lead characters include Archie Bunker-like Border Patrol agent Bud Buckwald and his unflappable Mexican-immigrant neighbor, Ernesto Gonzalez. (Created by SETH MacFARLANE/Courtesy of FOX TV)     “Bordertown” is set in a fictitious Texas town near the U.S.-Mexico border. And if the cast of characters was going to be diverse, then it made sense to have the writers’ room reflect that. “The writers’ room is actually pretty diverse, and we are focused on doing political and social satire with some meaning,” says Alcaraz, a California native of Mexican American descent. He is a vocal commentator on issues concerning Latinos, largely through both his comic strip, which became syndicated in 2002, and his L.A.-area radio show, ""Pocho Hour of Power.”  [LALO ALCARAZ: On creating Occupy Art] So how did Alcaraz — author of the upcoming book “Imperfect Union” (Basic Books) — become involved? “I was called in by creator Mark Hentemann, who was looking for diverse writers for ‘Bordertown,’ “ says Alcaraz, who has noted that four of the show’s dozen writers or so are Mexican American. “He had read in Gustavo Arellano's ‘Ask A Mexican’ book that I was known to be a somewhat funny fellow.” [LALO ALCARAZ: On caricaturing Mitt Romney] As a fan of MacFarlane’s “Family Guy,” Alcaraz has a sense of what he’s in for. He’s only several days into the job, however — what will he do the first time he thinks a stereotype in the script crosses the line? “I don’t know,” Alcaraz jokes. “Pray for me.”   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,"     Ivanka Trump on May 7 at the White House. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)           By  Alexandra Petri          Alexandra Petri Columnist offering a lighter take on the news and opinions of the day  Email  Bio  Follow         Columnist  June 20, 2018    “Remember that nothing is forever, except that you’re a parent.”— Ivanka Trump, “Women Who Work” May 8: Attorney General Jeff Sessions announces that a new zero-tolerance policy of prosecuting all those who enter the country illegally may cause families to be separated. Based on statistics released Tuesday by the Trump administration for May 5 to June 9, approximately 65 children are separated from their parents every day. May 9: About 65 children are separated from their parents. May 10: About 65 children are separated from their parents. I should not say “are separated.” This is too passive. The children and their parents arrive together, and then U.S. agents mark the children as unaccompanied minors and send them to a detention facility. May 11: We separate 65 children from their parents. It is like a summer camp, except for the minor detail that you get to go to a summer camp voluntarily and your parents know that is where you are being sent. May 12: We separate 65 children from their parents. May 13: We separate 65 children from their parents. It is just like when a parent commits a crime and goes to jail, defenders of the policy suggest. It is just like that, except instead the children are sent to a detention facility all by themselves. May 14: U.S. agents separate about 65 children from their parents. May 15: At the border, U.S. agents separate 65 children from their parents, give or take a child. Give or take a child. May 16: Sixty-five children, more or less, are marked as unaccompanied minors, although they have arrived at the border with parents, and are sent to a detention facility. May 17: This is not so bad. The 65 children who are taken from their parents today will get to watch television at the facility, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen reassures us. May 18: Thirty children are taken from their parents, then 35 more. Or maybe yesterday they were lax and only took 50 children away (telling their parents they were going to take baths) and did not bring them back. But if that was true, they must make up for it today, and so today it is 70 children. May 19: Sixty-five children are taken from their parents. May 20: A child is taken from her parents and then a child is taken from his parents and then a child is taken from her parents. This happens 65 times. May 21: Another 65 children arrive at the border with their parents and are taken away from them. May 22: As a special surprise, the children taken from their parents today are all child actors! No. They are just children, again. May 23: Sixty-five children are taken from their parents. May 24: On Instagram, Ivanka remembers the time her son came to visit her at the office as her “#lunchdate” with a #tbt photo. They had chicken and broccoli and walked past the Rose Garden. Also, 65 children are taken from their parents. May 25: Sixty-five children are taken from their parents. May 26: Sixty-five children are taken from their parents. May 27: On Instagram, Ivanka holds her son close and presses their foreheads together. “My <3,” she captions this, using an emoji heart. Sixty-five children are taken from their parents. May 28: Sixty-five children are taken from their parents. May 29: Sixty-five children are taken from their parents. May 30: We take 65 children from their parents. May 31: We take 65 children from their parents. June 1: We take 60 children from their parents. Then five more. June 2: We take 65 children. Their parents are given a piece of paper with a phone number they can call. The phone number is maybe right. June 3: Sixty-five children are taken from their parents. June 4: Sixty-five children are taken from their parents. This is about three small school buses full. June 5: Sixty-five children are taken from their parents. If we are lucky, they will not be permanently traumatized, but the American Academy of Pediatrics does not think we are lucky. June 6: Sixty-five children are taken from their parents. June 7: Sixty-five children are taken from their parents. June 8: Sixty-five children are with their parents and then — they are sent somewhere else, and they do not know when they are going to see their parents again. June 9: Sixty-five children are taken from their parents. June 10 to 13: The data only extends through June 9, but if we continue at the same pace, we separate 260 children from their parents from June 10 to June 13. A small elementary school. June 14: “Happy Birthday, Dad!” Ivanka posts on Instagram. “I love you very much.” June 15: Ivanka’s daughter gets a photo credit for a picture taken on “date night.” Ivanka is walking across a log in bluejeans and a clean white shirt, smiling a broad smile. June 16: Again, the data stopped on June 9. It is possible that 65 children were taken from their parents today. Or it could be even more. June 17: Ivanka wishes “Happy Father’s Day to these two amazing dads” to a picture of Jared Kushner and President Trump low-fiving. In another post, she wishes “my love” a “Happy Father’s Day.” In the accompanying picture, she and Jared stand with all three of their children. Everyone is smiling. No one is crying or screaming. Not where Ivanka can hear, at any rate.   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

36,"      By  Philip Kennicott          Philip Kennicott Art and architecture critic  Email  Bio  Follow         May 23, 2003  Americans, who are protective or even prickly about the meaning of what happened on Sept. 11, 2001, may find filmmaker Bahman Ghobadi's view disconcerting: ""You can be 100 percent sure that if these Hollywood films were not being disseminated throughout the rest of the world in such a way that everyone can see these special effects . . . that September 11 probably wouldn't even have happened, it would not have become part of the imagination of the people."" This is not an ""America's to blame"" argument, or echoing certain televangelists, a ""decadent America got what it deserved"" argument. It's an argument about the power of images, made by a Kurdish Iranian film director for whom images are sacred. Ghobadi, whose ""Marooned in Iraq"" opens in Washington today, comes from a society in which images are constrained because of censorship, difficult to produce because of poverty, and rich in meaning because of scarcity. In an interview in Washington last month, on the same day that U.S. troops seized Saddam International Airport in Baghdad, Ghobadi looked at America from the outside, as a colossus of visual production yet naive about the consequences of how it shows itself to the world. Ghobadi's new movie, set in the aftermath of the Iran-Iraq war, among a Kurdish people traumatized by Saddam Hussein, never shows the viewer Hussein himself. But the Iraqi leader is a presence, as are warplanes, heard but unseen overhead. The film follows the trek of Mirza, a famous musician, as he and his two sons search for Mirza's ex-wife, lost among refugees. Everyday life -- brutal, bracing and filled with crime and misadventure -- is in the foreground; the political background is implied and limned with the barest strokes. ""It's more impactful to see a child who has lost his limbs because of a land mine or a bomb, or a woman who doesn't have a voice because of chemical war, than to see the action of war,"" says Ghobadi. He also had difficulty getting permission to use military equipment or explosive effects. But as a filmmaker, he makes a virtue of necessity: One of the most haunting scenes in the new film shows dozens of paper airplanes gliding through the air as planes roar overhead. He has a strong distaste for American special effects and the sheer density of violence in American films, and he warns: ""The films coming out now are probably the worst advertisement of and PR for the American people."" Ghobadi, born in 1969, belongs to a young generation of Iranian filmmakers who are bringing new grittiness to the poetic austerities of Iranian cinema pioneered by older masters such as Abbas Kiarostami and Mohsen Makhmalbaf (with both of whom Ghobadi has worked). Ghobadi's first feature, ""A Time for Drunken Horses"" (2000), fell into the subgenus of Iranian films about children, a convenient form in which directors could bypass strict censorship rules about how women can be depicted and society criticized. American movies about children are often about infantilized adults, children as proxies for adult desires and ambitions. Iranian films about children tend to be about children as children, but bearing the burdens of the world and responsible beyond their years. There was a Dickensian sadness about ""A Time for Drunken Horses,"" which follows the efforts of brother and sister to care for each other and their severely ill brother. They don't ape the adult world, but are thrust into it by the hard necessities of life. ""Marooned in Iraq,"" a film about adults who are often more ridiculous than children, is an abrupt departure from that world. The tone is disturbingly unsettled. It opens with suggestions of the Three Stooges, men engaged in a manic but hard-edged interplay that borders on slapstick; yet these are stooges stuck in a landscape scarred by genocidal mayhem. Much of the film happens in blindingly white snowscapes, chilly, barren and isolated. The border that divides Iran and Iraq, the setting for both the new film and ""A Time for Drunken Horses,"" is a silent, terrifying, abstract line in the snow. ""The biggest enemy to the Middle East, to that region of the world, to the world itself, is boundaries,"" says Ghobadi. ""These are not boundaries that we laid down for ourselves, they were imposed by powers that we do not even see, that are far away from us. They espouse this idea of the global village, yet in our region of the world, they are laying down more and more boundaries, shifting them, changing them so that it benefits their own self-interest."" Ghobadi is a short, compact man, with neatly trimmed hair, and he is dressed in functional, drab clothes. There's more fatigue than rancor in his discussion of what it's like to be a Kurd, to be a pawn in an endless historical chess game. Ghobadi is against the war, and against Saddam Hussein; he wants only to see Hussein finished. Borrowing an analogy from Hollywood, he says it's time this trilogy ended, a trilogy that began with United States support of Hussein in the Iran-Iraq war, continued with an inconclusive Empire Strikes Back in the Gulf War, and is now, finally, reaching a denouement. ""The Kurds have become the football that is tossed around between Iraq, America, Europe, Syria, Turkey,"" he says. Being at the mercy of someone else's spectacle is an idea that brings together two facts central to him: the Kurdish sense of being out of the game, and the preciousness and power of imagemaking. ""In Kurdistan the families will go up on a hilltop and the blue sky becomes their screen,"" he says. ""They watch planes fly overhead and the bombings occur and characters like Saddam and Bush and Tony Blair -- they all come and go -- and [they] sit there with their version of popcorn. This is their movie theater, this is their version of reality."" He could be describing a scene from ""Marooned in Iraq"" in which school is held on a hilltop, a class watching a jet's contrail faint against the blue sky. In ""A Time for Drunken Horses,"" a terminally ill teenage boy (stunted in size and emotional maturity) receives a hard-won gift: a picture of a celebrity bodybuilder, grotesquely oversize with veins bulging under the skin. His brother, who purchased the image, earns money by carrying mysterious bundles across the snowy border. The image is tacked to the wall of their hut, a window (or screen) onto a world that must otherwise be imagined and inferred from the faintest evidence. ""For me, television and cinema are holy, they should be revered, treated with a great deal of respect,"" Ghobadi says. Thus, he finds it odd that American television can't stop showing Saddam Hussein on his balcony, firing his rifle into the sky. For Ghobadi, Hussein is a substantial enemy, to be effaced; repeatedly showing his image only legitimizes him. ""In most mainstream media, the superstars are the Saddam Husseins, the Tony Blairs, the George Bushes . . . and the Kurds become the extras, the anonymous people, the villagers,"" says Ghobadi. ""But they are the ones being affected the most. In my films the Kurdish people are the superstars, and the rest of the people who don't deserve the attention, they are relegated to the background."" The contrast between a Kurdish boy drinking in a single image, and Western children who live saturated in images, functions like a warning to the viewer: Nothing in Ghobadi's films can be easily read. Kurdish society and American society stand across a chasm from each other. Even the sense of slapstick at the opening of ""Marooned in Iraq"" may be a misreading. ""Kurdistan, because of all the problems it has had, has been held back one or two generations,"" Ghobadi says. ""Perhaps for you it hearkens back to something from 60, 70, 80 years ago. For us, this is very much the reality of today, the behaviors, the actions, the motives."" ""Foreign film,"" warn some critics, is in danger of becoming not so foreign, as directors outside of Hollywood cater to a Western appetite for heartwarming tales of colorful country life. Ghobadi's films, however, remain resolutely, uncompromisingly foreign. The behaviors, the actions, the motives, are not always easy to interpret. Even the color palette, a vital part of other Iranian films, is kept strictly muted. With the success of Iranian film at Western film festivals (Ghobadi's first feature took the Golden Camera at Cannes), new offshoots have developed. Some Iranian films have become slicker. Ghobadi's represent a kind of dissent, a flinty, hard-nosed, realist view of a cruel world, with no comforting mysticism. They are so detached that they carry no residue of sadness or horror. They leave one empty. They are, like a mute victim of chemical weapons that figures in this feature, mere evidence, rather than dramatic enactments, of what is wrong in the Kurdish homeland. Marooned in Iraq (97 minutes, in Farsi and Kurdish with subtitles, at Cineplex Odeon Dupont Circle and Landmark Bethesda Row) is not rated and includes war imagery. ""The biggest enemy . . . is boundaries,"" says Kurdish Iranian director Bahman Ghobadi.A young Kurdish girl in Ghobadi's ""Marooned in Iraq,"" which opens in Washington today.

37,"      By Thomas W. Lippman     March 13, 1977  President Anwar Sadat of Eyypt opened the Palestine National Council meeting tonight with a strongly worded rejection of President Jimmy Carter's concept of defensible borders of Israel. Sadat did not mention Carter by name, but he told the applauding Palestinians that ""I want all to listen on this occasion. We shall not cede one inch of our land. The national land is not open to bargaining."" It was the first authoritative Egyptian response to Carter's suggestion this past week that a Middle East peace settlement might include some defense lines for the Israelis beyond that country's recognized 1967 frontiers. Sadat was delivering the opening address at the Palestine Liberation Organization representative assembly's first session since 1974. The position on the issue of secure borders that Sadat expressed tonight is the same as it was before Carter raised the subject - that it is a thinly disguised excuse to ""sanctify"" Israeli territorial expansion. If it ever had any merit as a strategic concept, he said, that was ""blown away by the winds' in the October 1973 war, when the most secure borders the Israelis could hope for, the Suez Canal and the Bar Lev line, were breached by the Egyptians."" In the Egyptian view, security for Israel lies in coming for terms with its neighbors, not in digging in against them. The secure-borders issue is ""nothing but a fantasy,"" Sadat said. ""It is not admissible that anybody should speak of secure boudaries as part of the Israeli conception, it is absulutely unjust and unacceptable,"" In any peace agreement, he said, Isreal should withdraw completely from the territory occupied in 1967 because ""we don't believe in rewarding the aggressor."" When he finished, he received a warm handshake and smile from Yasser Arafat, chairman of the PLO executive committee, and in that gesture lies a possible clue to the mood of this council. Sadat said nothing, at this gathering of Palestinians about regaining all of the former Palestinian mandate or eliminating Israel. On the contrary, his remarks were in the context of his often-stated policy if the Isrealis will withdraw from the territories captured in 1967 and allow the creation of what Arafat called a ""Palestinian national authority in a free country."" That appears to be the central decision facing the Palestinians here - whether to go to Geneva and accept officially as they have unofficially, the idea that they will have to settle for a mini-state, linked in some way to Jordan, in plate of their old dream of a return to all of their form homeland. The leadership insists that this council will not even discuss revision of the Palestine National Charter, which calls for the elimination of Israel. But the Palestinians are under heavy economic, military and political pressure from Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia to accept what they can get in an overall settlement with Israel. In practical terms, that means at most a West Bank Gaza Strip state, and many Palestinian leaders, including Arafat, are said to be resigned to that. The National Council, which is expected to last about a week, is also scheduled to take up the rapprochement with Jordan, escalated anti-Israeli activity inside the occupied territories, and reunification of the military units that were pitted against each other in the Lebanon war. [Israeli security forces prevented student demonstration today in four West Bank towns in support of the Cairo meeting, the military said, according to AP. Four youths were detained to Nablus]. The national council is an umbrella group commonly referred to as a Palestinian Parliament in exile. Its 290 seats are filled by Palestinians from throughout the world, representing all shades of Palestinian opinion from hard-core guerrilla rejectionists to Western-oriented politicians willing to accept peace with Israel. All major known factions to the Palestinian movement, are represented. The congress was recently enlarged from 187 seats to give additional representative to independents and the so-called Palestinian diaspora, that is, those Palestinians who have moved to other countries. The dominant group is still the Al Fatah guerrilla organization led by Arafat, which has about 45 per cent of the seats. The pro-Syrian Saiqa group under Zoheir Mohsen, the PLO military commander, his 15 seats. Other important blocs are the militant Rejection Front guerrilla organizations led by George Habash of the Popular Front of the Liberation of Palestine, and worker and student groups. Some seats are expected to be left vacant - those allocated to Palestinians living in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Palestinian sources say that even if these members were allowed to attend by Israel, the leadership discouraged them from coming out of fear they might not be allowed to return home.

38,"      By Roger Mann     April 27, 1977  Armed with automatic weapons, Tanzanian paramilitary unit is now patrolling the Kenya-Tanzania border. Relations between the neighboring states have sunk to a new post-independence low during the past week since Tanzania's Minister for Home Affairs Hassan Moyo announced that their 450-mile border would be permanently sealed. Tanzania first closed the border in early February and impounded several million dollars' worth of Kenyan vehicles and private aircraft, but Kenya has not retaliated. ""As far as we are concerned,"" said a Kenyan immigration official here at the border, ""Things are normal. We are open 24 hours a day."" He conceded, however, that during the past week only four vehicles crossed his post. Yesterday, two journalists who came to Namanga to report on the border situation for Finnish television were arrested by Tanzanian authorities while filming a sign that reads ""Welcome to Tanzania."" The tension between Kenya and Tanzania grew out of the collapse of East African Airways in January. The two countries and Uganda had owned the airline jointly. Kenya subsequently started its own airline with leased Boeing 707s and three DC-9s salvaged from East African Airways. Tanzania plans to inauguarate its own national carrier next month. Delegations from the two countries met twice last month in an effort to normalize relations. Kenya has asked that its property be returned immediately and that assets of the near-dead East African Community be divided as the courts may decide. All of the Lake Victoria steamers and most of the community's aircraft were in Kenya when the community fell apart early this year. Tanzania, however, wants to use the ships and planes and has tied the return of Kenyan property to the immediate division of the community's movable assets. All of the Community's assets were jointly paid for by the three partner states. The cooperation of socialist Tanzania and capitalistic Kenya in the East African Community had been something of an anomaly. Kenyans seem bewildered at the permanent closing of the border, and there is a widespread feeling that the move had more to do with politics than with economics. Nairobi's Weekly Review speculated that ""In order for socialism to succeed, Tanzania must seal itself off from all capitalistic influences, and not just capitalistic goods."" President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania told his countrymen yesterday that the breakup of the Community was a major setback for the country's development plan and that large new infrastructure investments must urgently be made now. Tanzanian customs and immigration officials admit that they are now virtually powerless and that their post and the border area has been controlled by the paramilitary unit for about a month. On Tanzanian who has worked as a driver for the same concern in Kenya for 20 years was caught in Tanzania when the surprise closure announcement was made. He said that troops set up a roadblock 20 miles from the border and told him nobody could pass without a special reason. The driver made an excuse to get to the next town and then walked the remaining 17 miles through the bush to get back to Kenya. From here at Namanga it appears that Tanzania could be preparing for a long spell of stormy relations with Kenya. ""Tanzanians are our friends and neighbors,"" said a Namanga shopkeeper, ""but now we feel that the Tanzanian government is our enemy.""   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,"      By Jonathon C. R and    al     November 1, 1979  Iraq served notice today that it was withdrawing from its 1975 peace agreement with Iran that ended three years of border hostilities. The move reflected seriously deteriorating relations between the two Moslem neighbors, as well as Baghdad's unease about sectarian religious dissent both at home and in other Arab nations. Analysts here suggested Iraq was seeking to press its relative advantage against troubled Iran as revenge for the 1975 accord, when Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi extracted a high price for ending the Kurdish conflict, which was undermining Bagdad's authority. In addition to further undermining regional stability, increasing tensions between Iran and Iraq could seriously threaten a major portion of the world's oil supply. Iran's oil-producing region is inhabited largely by Arabs who are subject to appeals from Iraq, while Iraq has a large population of Shiite Moslems whose loyalties constantly are being tested by Iran's militant Shiite clergy. A major recurring theme among international oil analysts, is a serious disruption of supply caused by worsening relations between Iran and Iraq. The Iraqi move -- in a statement released to a newspaper here, a traditional conduit for major Arab world pronouncements also underscored tensions with other neighbors. It revealed, in additions an apparent desire to thwart Syrian and Palestinian mediation efforts aimed at smoothing over misunderstandings between Iran and other Arab states and indicated the Baghdad government's return to its classic odd-man out role in Arab politics. Iraqi Ambassador Abdel Hussein Muslim Hassan told the independent, daily An Nahar that Iran should ""immediately"" grant self-rule to its volatile Arab, Baluchi and Kurdish minorities, withdraw from three key Persian Gulf islands and return to entire Shatt-al-Arab Esturary to Iraq. p Under the March, 1975 Algiers accord, Iraq granted Iran half of the long disputed estuary, which leads 120 miles from the Persian Gulf to the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The two signatories also agreed to define other common borders and stop supporting subversion within the other state. That undertaking ended American, Iranian and Israeli aid to the late Mullah Mustafa Barzani's rebellion in Iraqi Kurdistan, which soon thereafter collapsed. The demands in the statement published in An Nahar, and the suggestion that Iran ""voluntarily"" agree to the amendments therefore, effectively gut the agreement. The short-lived reconciliation between the warring Baath Party governments in Iraq and Syria collapsed this summer after less than a year, Damascus propaganda resumed its old accusations that Baghdad had sold out Arab interests in the 1975 accord. Relations between Iraq and the Shiite Moslem clergy that now rules Iran began deteriorating in the fall of 1978, when Baghdad forced Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to leave his Iraqi exile in the holy city of Najjaf. The ayatollah replaced the shah in February this year. In recent months, relations have declined further as Baghdad and Tehran have accused each other of arming and otherwise encouraging their respective Kurds to revolt. And khomeini's government has backed the shah's controversial 1971 occupation of the Arab islands of Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tumb near the strategic Straits of Hormuz. An estimated 60 percent of the noncommunist world's oil passes through the area. Before the 1975 agreement, Baghdad claimed Iran's oil-producing Khuzestan Province, which originally was populated exclusively by Arabs and which the Iraqis called Arabestan. Support for the Baluchis, split between southeastern Iran and southwestern Pakistan, was also a standard pre-1975 Baghdad policy. Also behind the Iraqi move was increasing uneasiness of the Sunni-Moslem government in Baghdad in dealing with its Shiite Moslem majority ever since Khomeini came to power. There has been Shiite unrest in Kuwait and Bahrain, which also have Sunni minority governments, prompting fears -- not only in Baghdad -- that Khomeini aspired to export his Shiite-led revolution. Shiite riots in June were said to have helped prompt Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein to oust President Ahmed Hassan Bakr and purge leading party and government officials the following month. Low level urban guerrilla activity by Shiite dissidents has been reported in and around Baghdad and other Iraqi cities. New President Hussein's espousal of such nationalist Iraqi themes such as the return of all the Shatt-al-Arab, backing for the Khuzistan Arabs and an end of Iran's occupation of the three islands appear aimed at widening his power base. His seeming adoption of the ""best-defense-is-an-offense"" policy toward Iran has led him, according to specialists, to encourage the presence of some of the shah's former generals -- and former ambassador to Washington Ardeshir Zahedi -- in the border area. Many of the shah's pretorian guard -- the so-called Javidan, or ""immortals"" -- were Kurds and the high officers' reported presence in the border area was thought to be connected with anti-Khomeini activity. Analysts were struck by the rapidity of the Iraqi government's return to its traditional go-it-alone attitude. Only a year ago Iraq reversed a decade of isolation by offering to end its feud with Syria and cooperate with other Arab governments in an effort to offset a separate peace between Egypt and Israel. But Saddam Hussein's master plan soon came undone. Contributing factors were the Iranian revolution, the Iranian Kurds' uprising, and the ensuing nervousness about Shiite unrest.

40,"      By Alma Guillermoprieto     November 17, 1981  Bianca Jagger and an aide to Rep. Ronald Dellums (D-Calif.) as well as several representatives of relief and church organizations were reported today to have witnessed an incursion by the Salvadoran Army into Honduras near a refugee camp. Earlier in the day, a plane belonging to the French relief group Aviation Sans Frontieres was set on fire in La Virtud, site of the refugee camp, by a rightist paramilitary group before it could take off to pick up a group of journalists waiting in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras. The rightist group is presumed to be the Honduran Movement for Anticommunist Action, which painted red graffiti last night on the houses used by the various relief agencies operating in La Virtud. Approximately 120 armed civilians entered the camp at La Virtud at about noon and surrounded the refugees, officials of Aviation Sans Frontieres said. The officials were in radio contact at the time with the visiting church and relief delegation, which was making a one-day visit to the camp. The group of Salvadoran soldiers remained outside the camp, the officials of the French relief organization said the delegation reported. Jagger, the Nicaraguan ex-wife of rock star Mick Jagger, and the other visitors took photographs as the civilians tied up about 20 refugees at gunpoint and tried to lead them away, the aid officials said. A discussion ensued between the members of the relief delegation and the armed civilians after which the captured refugees were released and some of the delegation members' cameras were broken by the armed civilians, the aid officials said. The soldiers and the armed civilians subsequently withdrew to the outskirts of the tiny mountain village where approximately 10,000 refugees live. Groups of armed Salvadoran civilians frequently operate jointly with Salvadoran troops inside the country. The visiting delegation -- also including Robert Brauer, Dellums' aide; James Gittings, editor of the Protestant Church publication AD; and Russell Davenport, a consultant to the international relief organization OXFAM -- has decided to stay on in La Virtud, several members told the officials here, to guarantee the safety of the refugees. The visitors have been in contact with the offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees from whose offices the two-way radio, often used by the private relief organizations, operates. The U.N. High Commissioner's office has requested an interview with the commander of the Honduran Army in charge of the La Virtud region, officials of Aviation Sans Frontieres said. The burning of the plane in La Virtud, prevented a group of journalists to join the delegation in a visit to the Honduran camp. Approximately 10,000 Salvadoran refugees are housed in 10 camps and many peasant homes along the Honduran border. The refugees, victims of the Salvadoran civil war, are cared for by an assortment of international relief organizations.   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,"      By  Karen DeYoung          Karen DeYoung Associate editor and senior national security correspondent  Email  Bio  Follow         May 14, 1983  Nestled at the edge of San Jose's bustling international airport, two hangars house a half dozen small propeller planes and a two-seater bubble helicopter. On the grass outside, partially overgrown by weeds and clearly long disabled, a camouflage-painted Sikorsky chopper lies on its belly. ""Welcome to the headquarters of the air force of Costa Rica,"" Information Minister Armando Vargas says solemnly, just before breaking into a laugh. Government officials here seem to take pride in exposing their country's military weakness, from its handful of unarmed aircraft and four-boat navy to the poorly equipped 6,000-man police force that is constitutionally barred from turning itself into an army. But after 35 years of relatively peaceful existence as a regional anomaly, with a stable democracy and no declared internal or external enemies, Costa Rica is finding it increasingly difficult to remain aloof from the bloody conflicts sweeping the rest of the isthmus. A longtime avid and often amused observer of political strife in neighboring Nicaragua, Costa Rica now sees the problems immediately across its northern border and beyond as a threat to its own political system, its fragile economy and the image of international neutrality it has cultivated carefully for decades. Nicaragua's Sandinista government has charged that escalating attacks along its southern frontier led by exiled guerrilla hero Eden Pastora have been launched from inside Costa Rican territory. While officials here issue public denials, they acknowledge privately that they have little control over rebel activity and note the difficulty of stopping a movement that has widespread public support in Costa Rica. In the capital, rival representatives from countless factions in the various Central American wars gather in freedom to plot and plan and hold press conferences, leading to charges that Costa Rica condones their actions. Despite its gratitude and continuing desperate need for U.S. economic aid, the government visibly winces each time the Reagan administration loudly proclaims that Costa Rica shares its concern and supports its policies in the region. As a result, officials here said, longtime democratic friends in Western Europe and Latin America, whose help also is needed, have begun snubbing San Jose as they see the long arm of Washington draped around Costa Rica's shoulder. ""We feel a little bit alone,"" President Luis Alberto Monge said in an interview . In what he described as an act of near desperation and critics inevitably called a response to U.S. pressure to involve other nations in its anti-Sandinista campaign, Monge has called for a multinational Latin American force to oversee Costa Rica's border with Nicaragua and certify its neutrality. The effort has been met with suspicion and a thinly veiled reluctance to help. ""We are not prepared for a situation of this magnitude,"" Information Minister Vargas said, ""but we don't want to be, either. We don't want to fall into the trap of creating another power base here"" by reestablishing the army disbanded by law a quarter century ago. ""The Nicaraguan problem is a problem inside Nicaragua, of Nicaraguans fighting Nicaraguans,"" Vargas said. ""At this time of economic crisis for us, Costa Rica does not want to be involved."" Yet, whether its government likes it or not, Costa Rica is involved in Nicaragua's problems, for reasons of geography, of history and the clear desire of many of its own people to play a role. One of the first challenges to the newly pacifist Costa Rica during the early 1950s was an attempt by a disgruntled would-be president to overthrow the government here with the help of Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza Garcia, the father of the man the Sandinistas ultimately ousted. By the time the Sandinistas were ready to make their move against the son, beginning in 1978, Costa Ricans were only too happy to lend their territory and their support to the effort. ""We were the ones who gave them guns,"" said Public Security Minister Angel Eduardo Solano. ""It was here that the planes landed with arms. They would have been nowhere without us."" But if there is one thing Costa Ricans dislike as much as they did the Somozas, it is communism. Once the Sandinistas veered to the left with Cuban help, Solano said, Costa Ricans felt ""betrayed."" The troubles inside Nicaragua coincided with Costa Rica's worsening economy and a series of strikes and political pressures from the domestic left that many here believed were at least encouraged by Cuba and the Sandinistas themselves. When Monge assumed office one year ago, Costa Rica was officially in a state of crisis. As Washington quickly came to his aid, Monge soon became one of the Reagan administration's most visible friends among Latin American democracies. While not exactly echoing the adminstration position on Nicaragua, Costa Rica rarely disagreed. ""Of course you're going to be nice to someone who's going to give you millions of dollars,"" former president Daniel Oduber said. Yet he and Monge agreed that no Costa Rican president could survive domestically on an anti-American platform. ""Costa Rica is basically a pro-Yankee country,"" Oduber said, ""perhaps the only one truly so in all of Latin America."" It is only recently, however, that the cost of such closeness has begun to approach the benefits. Monge said he does not share Washington's belief that the mere existence of a Marxist government in Nicaragua poses a threat to regional stability. If the Sandinistas would behave, he said, Costa Rica would be ""prepared for peaceful coexistence with a neighbor that has a different philosophy."" Costa Rican officials insist that despite an antipathy toward the Sandinistas and a fear of leftist expansionism, they truly want to remain as uninvolved as possible with U.S. security strategy in the region. ""The responsibilities and interest of the United States are different from those of Costa Rica,"" Monge said. He has offered San Jose as a site for U.S.-opposed open dialogue between El Salvador's beleaguered government and its guerrilla opponents. At the same time, at the end of his first year in office, Monge has succeeded to a large degree in stabilizing the Costa Rican economy. The strikes and subversion here have largely ceased, due in the eyes of many officials to Costa Rica's pledge to stay out of Central American battles and spend its money at home. But as the border situation has deteriorated over the past several weeks, Costa Rica says it fears that the gains of the past year could be lost and that a public display of unarmed weakness will no longer provide enough defense.

45,"     Sean Hannity of Fox News during the Conservative Political Action Conference on March 4, 2016, in National Harbor, Md. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)           By  Erik Wemple          Erik Wemple Media critic with a focus on the ups and downs and downs of the cable-news industry.   Email  Bio  Follow         Media critic  June 21, 2018    Peril comes with taking up a position in today’s polemical trenches alongside a man with no convictions. In keeping with President Trump’s hard line on immigration, Attorney General Jeff Sessions in April launched a “zero tolerance” policy vis-a-vis “criminal illegal entry.” Noted Sessions, “To those who wish to challenge the Trump administration’s commitment to public safety, national security, and the rule of law, I warn you: Illegally entering this country will not be rewarded, but will instead be met with the full prosecutorial powers of the Department of Justice.” Omitted from the Justice Department announcement was its core ugliness. The spike in prosecutions, as it turns, out would necessitate the separation of children and parents at the border, with about 2,000 kids so yanked between April 19 and the end of May. Once the backlash surged, so did the gaslighting. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen claimed there was no policy to separate families, that “Congress alone” could fix the matter. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders spoke over and over again about following the law. Which brings us to Sean Hannity, the Fox News host who appears to seesaw between parroting the White House line and dictating it. Hannity is known as the president’s “shadow chief of staff,” and a man reaches that exalted perch only via skill. Look, for instance, at how Hannity maneuvered through this week’s awkward events. When criticism of the family-separation policy was peaking earlier this week, Hannity lashed back at the critics by saying such things as, “As I said earlier, no one likes the idea of separating any child from any parent. But this issue has been in the hands of Congress, and right now, the whole issue can be fixed. Every law can be changed, and if they did their job, it would happen. It is the law.” And: “Fix the law.” Everyone who had stuck a neck out for the Trump-Sessions act of inhumanity — i.e., Nielsen, Sanders, Hannity, Corey Lewandowski, among many others — found themselves exposed on Wednesday, when Trump signed an executive order that backpedaled. “We’re going to have strong — very strong — borders, but we are going to keep the families together. I didn’t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated,” said Trump. While many of the policy’s defenders can duck the media spotlight for a few days, Hannity has no such luxury. He hosts a weeknight program on Fox News, and his ratings are the envy of his competition. Accordingly, this man has to find the least intrusive, the most logical-sounding, the most plausibly specious way of disappearing his previous remarks and replacing them with a brand-new defense of the president. That genius was fully engaged on Wednesday night, as Hannity offered these words about the executive order: “And earlier today — by the way, the president has been saying it all week. The president addressed this important issue, and he signed an executive order undoing their damage and ensuring that illegal immigrant families would be kept intact. By the way, not his law, he didn’t pass it. Congress did. Another president signed it, but he fixed it.”      If you’re a Hannity viewer, and you missed the Justice Department policy announcement or the hundreds of fact-checking stories on just who caused this crisis, you might suppose that the family-separation policy fell from the scorching skies of the Southwest onto the vast U.S.-Mexico border. And there it sat, awaiting a “fix” from the president. Elsewhere in his rant on the matter, Hannity continued casting the impression that the scandal was purely legislative: “By the way, what Donald Trump signed today, let me be blunt, it’ll last five minutes in a courtroom before it’s thrown out, but at least gives Congress time to do their job,” he said. The contortions showcased on “Hannity” aren’t an isolated or accidental phenomenon. They’re programmatic, not to mention unconscionable. Earlier this week, the general tenor of Fox News prime-time apologism for Trump’s immigration policies caught the attention of Hollywood types working with Fox News’s corporate sibling. In response to a tweet highlighting Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s argument that people should believe the opposite of what mainstream outlets are reporting, “Family Guy” creator Seth MacFarlane riffed, “In other words, don’t think critically, don’t consult multiple news sources, and in general, don’t use your brain. Just blindly obey Fox News. This is fringe [stuff], and it’s business like this that makes me embarrassed to work for this company.” Antagonism from members of the Hollywood elite, of course, can only delight people such as Hannity, Carlson and Laura Ingraham, the other main feature in Fox News’s prime-time opinion block. In cable news, ratings justify everything, and Fox News opinionators won’t imperil their standing with the backbone of the Trump plume. And that particular demographic cares a great deal about immigration, as voter surveys have concluded. Per the Atlantic:  Contrary to popular narratives, only a small portion—just 27 percent—of white working-class voters said they favor a policy of identifying and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally. Among the people who did share this belief, Trump was wildly popular: 87 percent of them supported the president in the 2016 election.  We don’t know for sure how many of those folks watch Fox News — probably a great, great number. We do know, however, that Carlson, Hannity and Ingraham fashion their presentations with them in mind. In her remarks this week, Ingraham referred to the facilities holding separated children as “summer camps”; Hannity grasped for any stray talking point to deflect from the president’s culpability; Carlson earlier this year shouted down the president when he appeared to go a bit wobbly on immigration — signals to the Trump White House that if you want to get even more extreme on this policy area, your cheerleaders on cable news remain with you. No one nourishes white cultural anxiety like this crew.   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,"       By  Reid Wilson          Reid Wilson  Bio  Follow         February 26, 2015     Members of the National Guard patrol along the Rio Grande at the Texas-Mexico border on Feb. 24 in Rio Grande City, Tex. (Eric Gay/AP)  A top Texas law enforcement agency says border security organizations have apprehended several members of known Islamist terrorist organizations crossing the southern border in recent years, and while a surge of officers to the border has slowed the flow of drugs and undocumented immigrants, it’s costing the state tens of millions of dollars. In a report to Texas elected officials, the state Department of Public Safety says border security agencies have arrested several Somali immigrants crossing the southern border who are known members of al-Shabab, the terrorist group that launched a deadly attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya, and Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya, another Somalia-based group once funded by Osama bin Laden. Another undocumented immigrant arrested crossing the border was on multiple U.S. terrorism watch lists, the report says. According to the report, one member of al-Shabab, apprehended in June 2014, told authorities he had been trained for an April 2014 suicide attack in Mogadishu. He said he escaped and reported the planned attack to African Union troops, who were able to stop the attack. The FBI believed another undocumented immigrant was an al-Shabab member who helped smuggle several potentially dangerous terrorists into the U.S. [Drone strike kills senior al-Shabab official in Somalia] Authorities also apprehended immigrants who said they were members of terrorist organizations in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. The Department of Public Safety said the report, first published by the Houston Chronicle, was not meant for public distribution. “[T]hat report was inappropriately obtained and [the Chronicle was] not authorized to possess or post the law enforcement sensitive document,” department press secretary Tom Vinger said in an e-mail. U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to requests for comment. The department said it had come into contact in recent years with “special interest aliens,” who come from countries with known ties to terrorists or where terrorist groups thrive. Those arrested include Afghans, Iranians, Iraqis, Syrians, Libyans and Pakistanis. In all, immigrants from 35 countries in Asia and the Middle East have been arrested over the past few years in the Rio Grande Valley. The department says there is no known intelligence that specifically links undocumented immigrants to terrorism plots, but the authors warn it’s almost certain that foreign terrorist organizations know of the porous border between the U.S. and Mexico. “It is important to note that an unsecure border is a vulnerability that can be exploited by criminals of all kinds,” Vinger said. “And it would be naive to rule out the possibility that any criminal organizations around the world, including terrorists, would not look for opportunities to take advantage of security gaps along our country’s international border.” Even without the threat of foreign terrorists making their way across the border, Texas law enforcement officials say seven of the eight major Mexican drug cartels operate throughout Texas. Those cartels have sent assassins as far north as the Dallas-Fort Worth area to commit murders, and the drug trade is thriving. The cartels are also branching into sex trafficking, which can present a lower risk and yield a higher profit than the drug trade, the report says. Law enforcement officials have uncovered major trafficking rings operating in Texas, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee and several east coast cities. Almost all human smuggling rings have ties to the Mexican drug cartels, the report found, and in many cases undocumented immigrants are kept locked in small, confined spaces where they go days without food or water. Law enforcement officials found one “stash house” in the Houston area crammed with 115 illegal immigrants. The report says the Gulf, Zeta, Juarez and Sinaloa cartels have the most prominent footprints in Texas. Officials are also worried about the growing influence of MS-13, the Salvadoran gang that originated in Los Angeles. The cartels have been “effective in corrupting U.S. law enforcement officials at all levels,” the DPS report says. But the surge of Texas DPS officers, National Guard troops and other law enforcement officials, ordered by then-Gov. Rick Perry (R) last June, has worked to stem last year’s flood of undocumented immigrants crossing into the Rio Grande Valley. [Gov. Perry to send National Guard troops to Mexican border amid migrant crisis] Border officials apprehended 313,000 immigrants in FY 2014, nearly three times the number caught in FY 2011. In recent months, that number has diminished significantly. The report said the number of arrests per week had fallen from a high of about 6,000 to around 2,000. The surge has also led to the seizure of more than $1.8 billion worth of cartel drugs, or about 150 tons of marijuana, 588 pounds of cocaine and 320 pounds of methamphetamines. Cartels have shifted marijuana trafficking west, from McAllen to the small towns of Escobares and Roma. The cartels are sending scouts to watch U.S. border patrol officers, and they believe the Texas border surge will end soon, once the money runs out, according to intelligence collected by the Department of Public Safety. It is not without costs. DPS said the state and National Guard have spent more than $102 million deploying troops and officers and bolstering surveillance capabilities. The state has already installed 1,224 surveillance cameras along the border, and another 4,000 cameras will be installed in the coming months. Fully securing the border would require the constant presence of an incredible number of troops — as many as 76,000, the report found. This summer, the surge sent about 1,000 National Guard soldiers to the border.   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

49,"           By  Greg Sargent          Greg Sargent Opinion writer covering national politics  Email  Bio  Follow         Opinion writer  June 18, 2014    If you want to understand just how difficult a jam Obama is in right now on immigration, pay close attention to Hillary Clinton’s remarks at a town hall meeting yesterday on what to do about the tens of thousands of minors who are crossing the border illegally into South Texas. Clinton gives a nuanced answer, but ultimately she declares they must be sent home. It’s an answer Obama is to some degree constrained from giving. Meanwhile, this is ballooning into a major crisis: In total, 90,000 minors may be apprehended this year and another 142,000 next year. Clinton makes a good moral case for legalizing those who are “raising families and working hard and contributing to our country” — the Rubicon that Republicans won’t cross. She allows that Obama — who is under pressure to ease deportations but is required to continue them under current law — is in a tough spot, while arguing that the ultimate humanitarian goal must be to stop breaking up families. But her answer on what to do about migrating minors is the most important:  “The numbers are increasing dramatically. The main reason I believe that’s happening is the violence in certain of those Central American countries is increasing dramatically…we have to provide the best emergency care we can provide…we have children five and six years old who have come up from Central America… “They should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are. There are concerns about whether all of them can be sent back, but I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families…We have to send a clear message: Just because your child gets across the border, that doesn’t mean the child gets to stay. We don’t want to send a message that’s contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journey.”  This gets at exactly why this situation is so difficult. On the one hand, Clinton is right to note that the surge in unaccompanied migrants has many causes, such as violence in home countries. However, it is also true that one thing driving the spike really is the belief that children will be allowed to stay. Republicans blame this perception on Obama’s de-prioritization of deportation of the DREAMers, to buttress their broader case that Obama’s refusal to “enforce the law” is causing the crisis and is generally responsible for border chaos. However, the kids are not eligible to stay under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. And even if the mis-perception that they are eligible is a partial cause of the crisis, that is not a good argument, in and of itself, against the policy. Indeed, it’s telling that Republicans will not answer when asked directly whether they want Obama to deport more DREAMers and other low-level offenders from the interior. We do know that human smuggling networks may be “falsely propagating the rumors to recruit clients, whose families pay large sums for the trip north.” And the administration — like Hillary — is working to send the message that these rumors are false. The problem for Obama: He cannot lean as hard into the message that these kids need to be sent home as Hillary does. That’s because such talk would play into the “deporter in chief” narrative of his critics on the left. It’s also because deporting the kids immediately is simply not an option. In some cases, as Hillary says, that wouldn’t be a desirable outcome, given conditions at home. More broadly, current law requires them to be channeled into legal proceedings, and united with family members if possible while awaiting a court date. But courts are backlogged, and according to advocates, many don’t show up, meaning they essentially disappear. As best as I can determine, the administration has not released numbers on how many who arrived in this fashion showed up in court and/or have been sent home. Indeed, while Hillary suggests sending the kids home is an option, the crisis has no easy solutions. Frank Sharry of America’s Voice tells me:  “It’s easy to say they should all be sent home. But that’s really hard to do. The law requires them to get their day in court, and many will qualify for some form of relief. You have to make sure these kids have an opportunity to present their situation in court, because they are more like refugees than immigrants. Making sure they show up would require holding all these kids in huge detention centers — rather than releasing them to family — and a massive infusion in judges to relieve the backlog of the courts, neither of which is possible under current budgetary and political restraints.”  Bottom line: Obama’s political and policy challenge is to strike the right balance between humanity and rule of law. Yet it isn’t clear there is an easy answer on either front, let alone a way to balance the two. And so, the crisis probably has to be managed as best as possible. But the “optics” of this are terrible, which will make it easier for Republicans to demagogue the issue to avoid participation in solving the short-term or long-term crisis. It’s far easier for Hillary to strike this balance, because she only has to do so rhetorically. But Obama has to strike it in the real world. It’s not clear to me there’s a way to do this successfully. But it is clear the problem isn’t going away.         window.havePowaBoot=true;    ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the number of unaccompanied children arriving from Central America surged in May, many members of Congress in both parties have argued the president has mishandled the situation and should witness the crisis first hand. Two of the most vocal critics, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), have not visited in the last two months. Cruz’s office noted that the senator toured an air force base in San Antonio last month where many of the children are being held, and will be on a trip this Friday to the Rio Grande Valley. Among Democrats, House Democratic Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said it “wouldn’t hurt” Obama to visit the border, but he has not been either. Members of the congressional leadership who have not been to the border include chair of the House Republican Conference, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), and Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wy0.), chair of the Republican Policy Committee Chair. Obama visited Texas last week and declined to go to the border, stating he was “not interested in photo ops” but “interested in solving the problem.” Many Republican members of Congress from Texas have explicitly hit out at the president for avoiding the border — including Reps. Kenny Marchant, Joe Barton and Jeb Hensarling — even as they themselves have not visited, at least until now. The Texas delegation is scheduled to visit to the Rio Grande Valley on Friday on a trip led by Rep. Sam Johnson (R-Tex.), to examine the crisis first hand. Other members who have not been since May are planning trips during the August recess. “There’s no way to fully grasp the scope and depth of the crisis through a simple briefing in Washington,”  Johnson said in a statement. The majority of members on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, who has jurisdiction over the agencies dealing with the border crisis, have not visited the border since the crisis developed in May. The committee’s chairman Sen. Thomas Carper (D-Del.), who has supportive of the president, has not been to the border since May but visited Guatemala and Mexico in April. Sen.

53,"          window.havePowaBoot=true;           By  Jennifer Rubin          Jennifer Rubin Opinion writer covering politics and policy, foreign and domestic  Email  Bio  Follow         Opinion writer  June 18, 2018    The administration did not have the nerve to put the vice president or any Cabinet official out on the Sunday shows to defend its “zero tolerance” policy and the result mass separation of children from their families at the border. You did not see Stephen Miller out there, nor the White House official who told The Post that it was a great idea to use kids to extract immigration concessions from Congress. Instead, the administration sent out counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway, a woman who has demonstrated time and time again she will say anything — no matter how preposterous — to defend this president. Her performance — and that is what we should call it — on “Meet the Press” was stunningly disingenuous. She shed crocodile tears for the immigrant kids and invoked her own Catholicism to demonstrate how concerned she was about the children her boss is snatching away from the arms of their parents. She blamed the Democrats, the courts and even  lack of money. This cowardly non-defense suggests that she knows the policy is wrong but hasn’t the nerve to call for its end:  CHUCK TODD: Is the president ready to make that phone call to the attorney general, to [the Department of Homeland Security], to stop this policy? CONWAY: The president is ready to get meaningful immigration reform across the board. And Chuck, let me just tell you that nobody likes seeing babies ripped from their mothers’ arms, from their mothers’ wombs, frankly. But we have to make sure that DHS’s laws are understood through the soundbite culture that we live in. … These loopholes are allowing open border policies. I think what the president is saying is if the Democrats are serious, they’ll come together again and try to close these loopholes and get real immigration reform. TODD: So it sounds like, and this is going to sound harsh, but it sounds like you’re holding these kids hostage. … To get the Democrats to the table to pass some law. You just laid out — a very compassionate case for — CONWAY: Well, I certainly don’t agree with that. TODD: . . . But it’s not very empathetic — the most traumatic things to do to a kid? Separate them from their parents once they’ve made that traumatic journey. Why do that right now? I understand we have an immigration debate going on in this country. Why use these kids as leverage? CONWAY: Well, I certainly don’t want anybody to use these kids as leverage.  Evasion, denial and blame-shifting. You’d think she didn’t work in the White House and couldn’t tell her boss to reverse course. Bizarrely, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen claimed, “We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period.” If only Conway knew that when she ineptly tried to defend the indefensible policy. Melania Trump made a rare effort to weigh in on a policy issue. “Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,” a statement from her spokeswoman read. “She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.” We actually don’t need “both sides” to come together. President Trump instituted a zero-tolerance policy and has continued to carry out child separations with ruthless efficiency. If he needs new funding, his Republican allies control Congress. So what is the problem here? Al Cardenas, a longtime Republican donor and strategist, let loose on the GOP after Conway’s horrifying performance on “Meet the Press”:  I’m a refugee. I came to America. I experienced it. The pain, the heartbreak of a child about that experience will never go away in their lifetime. And to justify that by saying they have a clean bed and food is — is such a cruel comment regarding what’s going on with the children and their hearts and their parents. I will debunk two myths or lies from the White House right now. Number one, things are not the same as before on two areas. Number one, Office of Refugee Resettlement. Before this White House changed the rules, they would be the ones that would intake these children. They would interview. Most of these children had relatives here, mostly undocumented. And they would turn the children over to these relatives. The president of the United States changed it and gave ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] the jurisdiction that the Office of Refugee Resettlement for decades has had.  . . . And the second policy that’s really all here, the president has total authority to deal with the separation of children. And so all of those arguments are fallacious. In the meantime, we’ve had more than 2,000 children separated in just a few weeks. That’s deplorable. It’s wrong. And this thing needs to get fixed.  It was left to former first lady Laura Bush to make the most stirring and convincing case against the Trump policy. “I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries, but this zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart,” she wrote in an op-ed for The Post. “Our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert outside of El Paso. These images are eerily reminiscent of the Japanese American internment camps of World War II, now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in U.S. history. We also know that this treatment inflicts trauma; interned Japanese have been two times as likely to suffer cardiovascular disease or die prematurely than those who were not interned.” The problem is that Republicans have become so invested in anti-immigrant furor that they cannot stop, even if they wind up humiliating themselves and doing real political damage to the party. Rick Santorum — Mr. Family Values — appearing on CNN blamed the parents; they shouldn’t have come, he intoned. First, these are desperate people who in many cases are escaping violence and potential death. Second, it is not acceptable for a decent and humane country to visit the sins of the parent on the child. We are responsible for that child — morally required to, at the very least, not traumatize him or her for life. As with so many of his scandals and outrages, Trump doesn’t want to accept blame for his own decisions. Here, there should be no doubt that he could stop child separation. But he won’t. Americans regardless of party should speak with one voice. Enough.    ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,"     ""Mr. Obama, tear down this wall."" (Sam Hodgson/Bloomberg News)       By  Max Ehrenfreund          Max Ehrenfreund Reporter  Bio  Follow         November 10, 2014  The Berlin Wall wasn't just an ugly symbol of Communist oppression in Eastern Europe and Russia. For the people who lived behind it, the wall's  practical significance was that it stopped them from leaving their homes and seeking a better life in the West. Protesters in Berlin breached the wall 25 years ago -- on  Nov. 9, 1989 -- which might seem like a long time ago. But barriers to migration -- both legal and physical -- are still keeping people in developing countries poor, while posing a real, long-term risk to the economies of rich countries. Several economists have made this point forcefully in the past few days. Tyler Cowen argues that in poor countries where the population is projected to grow enormously in the next few decades, the only way people will have enough to get by is if they can move to wealthier parts of the world. Meanwhile, as the fertility rate falls in the developed world and the population ages, those countries will have to rely on young migrants from elsewhere to avoid a lasting decline in their economic vitality. The argument for open borders goes beyond self-interest. Tim Harford notes how unfair it is  that that someone's nationality is the most important factor in his or her chances in life. The differences between countries are much greater than the differences within them. McDonald's employees in the United States make 10 times what they would make doing the same jobs in India. As Eric Posner and Glen Weyl note, the poorest Americans -- those making $3,000 or $4,000 a year -- are doing better than three-in-five people around the world, at least in terms of dollars. A real commitment to fairness, Posner and Weyl argue, means giving people in poor countries an opportunity to move to richer ones. Frustrated crowds looking for barriers made of cement and wire to topple won't always find them, but here are five places that could benefit from the crumbling of ""walls"" around the world.  Japan: Thecountry could use more liberal immigration policies probably more than any other developed nation, but an antipathy toward immigrations and the Pacific Ocean keep migrants out more effectively than any wall. Given those policies and the country's low birthrates, it's no surprise that the nation's economy has been near-stagnant for so long. Australia: Theislandnation has also taken drastic measures to stop migrants from coming ashore. The country built a detention center in the heart of the jungle on Christmas Island, hundreds of miles northwest of the mainland at a cost of $370 million -- an enormously expensive project to detain around 1,200 people. European Union:Migrants from all over Africa cross the Mediterranean to seek asylum in the EU on the Italian island of Lampedusa. Last year, the island made headlines when hundreds of people drowned after a overburdened boat bound for the island from the Libyan coast caught fire and capsized. Then again, there are still places where old-fashioned walls do matter. Take the Spanish enclave of Melilla in North Africa, where migrants climb fences to cross Europe's political boundary, or the eight-mile fence Greece built along its narrow border with Turkey. United States: The U.S. maintains a southern fence of about 650 miles, even though just as many Mexicans are returning home as are immigrating. Tearing down this particular wall might be too bold a measure, but immigration reform could provide a nice boost to America's economy.  As the U.S. example shows, reforming immigration laws can be difficult politically. Posner and Weyl's unpleasant suggestion is that policymakers in rich countries seek a compromise with opponents of immigration. As Qatar does, they could allow in more workers without extending legal protections to them. It's an idea worth considering, at least, given how much there is to gain from immigration for everyone involved. This is all easier said than done. China isn't eager for North Koreans to immigrate en masse across their border, even if Pyongyang would let them. In Israel and the Palestinian territories, concerns about economic freedom are an afterthought given the intensity and intricacy of the conflict there. A border crisis was what finally forced Germany's two halves back together in 1989. East Germans were leaving illegally in droves through neighboring countries, and demonstrators pulled down the wall after East German officials fumbled their response. Following reunification, East Germans took advantage of their newfound freedom to move West by the millions -- a mass migration that continued until very recently. That's not counting all those in the rest of the Soviet bloc who left after the end of Communism, especially after some countries joined the European Union. Per-capita income in East Germany has more than doubled since reunification, as The Economist reports. Almost every East German home now has central heating, compared to only three in five under Communism. Standards of living have improved in the West as well. To be sure, those changes are largely due to the end of Soviet planning, not just to emigration from Eastern Germany. Still, the economic case for immigration is as strong today as it was in 1989. The easier it is to cross a border, the better off are the people who live on both sides of it.    Migrants cross into Spanish Melilla last month. (Jose Palazon Osma/AFP Photo/Prodein)    ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

56,"          window.havePowaBoot=true;           By  Jennifer Rubin          Jennifer Rubin Opinion writer covering politics and policy, foreign and domestic  Email  Bio  Follow         Opinion writer  February 26, 2018    The Post reports:  The Supreme Court on Monday declined to enter the national controversy over “dreamers,” turning down the Trump administration’s request to immediately review lower court decisions that keep in place the program that protects undocumented immigrants brought here as children from deportation. … Federal district judges in California and New York have issued nationwide injunctions against ending the program, siding with states and organizations challenging the administration’s rescission. The court orders effectively block the Trump administration from ending the program on March 5, as planned. No appellate court has reviewed those decisions, and it would have been exceedingly rare for the Supreme Court to take up a case without that interim step. In the past, the court has granted such cases only in matters of grave national importance, such as the controversy over President Richard Nixon’s White House tapes or solving the Iranian hostage crisis.  It bears repeating that this is not a decision on the merits. Appellate courts can lift the injunctions at any time, even before a ruling on the merits. At best it is a momentary pause for beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, as well as for Congress and President Trump. Trump and the anti-immigrant far right took a victory lap when the president’s veto threat helped quash the only viable bill to provide relief for the dreamers. Now, however, they face a political nightmare. If they do nothing and the court injunctions lift, they’ll be faced with the prospect that the midterms will come amidst poignant scenes of family separation. Just like the teenagers from Parkland, Fla., have demolished the National Rifle Association’s media spin, sympathetic dreamers who have spent virtually their whole lives in the United States will be on TV nonstop describing their contributions to America and their loyalty to this country. It’s one more political nightmare, especially for Republicans running in states such as Nevada, Florida, California and Arizona, where mobilized Hispanic voters can deliver knockout punches to the anti-DACA party. Barring a miraculous conversion of House and Senate Republicans, the only solution that seems possible with GOP majorities in the House and Senate is a temporary fix. Republicans cannot drive too hard a bargain without running the risk of setting off the deportation nightmare. They also know that after November, there may be a Democratic majority in one or both houses. Therefore, it’s in their interest to strike a deal now. One path would be for Trump, who started the entire debacle by rescinding DACA, to extend the deadline. Sure, Attorney General Jeff Sessions claimed DACA was unconstitutional, but if it was nevertheless constitutional for the administration to let the program run through March 5, 2018, why not March 5, 2019, or 2020? Trump can claim to be the great savior and also spare his party a PR disaster. Alternatively, Congress could put together a temporary fix. The Hill reports:  Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) is in talks with Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) about a plan to tie a three-year extension of protections for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients with roughly $7.6 billion in border security. “I can promise that I’ll be back on the floor, again and again, motioning for a vote until we pass a bill providing relief for those struggling due to our inaction,” Flake said, outlining his plan.  Procrastination — like serial continuing resolutions — has become a favorite tactic for a dysfunctional White House and inept Congress. “A temporary DACA fix is our only option for this Congress,” says Cato Institute’s Alex Nowrasteh, who favors a plan to legalize dreamers. “It kicks the legislative can down the road but at least it doesn’t kick 700,000 people out of the country.” The temporary patch won’t satisfy immigration activists, but it seems to be the least horrible alternative. “In a world where congress functions in the interest of the American people, we would have a permanent solution for border security and for Dreamers. Sadly, that is not the world we live in,” Ali Noorani of the National Immigration Forum tells me. “It seems likely the most the legislative market can bear is a temporary solution for Dreamers and the border. While we hope Congress can get to a permanent fix, a three-year patch brings stability to worksites and homes.” A temporary deal also would spare Trump from a confrontation with his anti-immigrant base. He could then claim the border money was effectively a “down payment” on the wall (or something like that). Nevertheless, even a short-term fix is no slam dunk. Frank Sharry, who heads the progressive, pro-immigration group America’s Voice, tells me. “I wish I could be optimistic but I’m not. Even a two- or three-year extension for current DACA recipients requires Republican leaders to grow a backbone and Trump to release the hostages.” He adds, “I’m not holding my breath.” The GOP has revealed that its anti-immigrant contingent has a stranglehold on the party. Whether the GOP is prepared to court political disaster to satisfy that contingent remains to be seen.
