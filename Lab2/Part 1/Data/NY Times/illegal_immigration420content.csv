0,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Friday that he withdrew his nominee to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement because he wanted the agency to go in a “tougher” direction, a surprise decision before the president’s trip to the southwestern border.Ronald D. Vitiello, who was nominated last summer by Mr. Trump to run ICE, the agency that arrests, detains and deports people who are in the United States illegally, has been serving as the agency’s acting director since last June. He had planned to accompany the president on his trip to California, but was left behind.“Ron’s a good man, but we’re going in a tougher direction,” Mr. Trump said to reporters as he left the White House en route to Calexico, Calif.Mr. Vitiello’s nomination had been awaiting approval by a second Senate committee and confirmation by the full chamber. In an email to ICE employees on Friday afternoon, he signaled that he planned to remain at the immigration agency. No replacement has yet been named.“While I will not become the permanent director of ICE, I look forward to working alongside you in serving the American public with integrity, courage and excellence,” Mr. Vitiello said in the email, which was read to The New York Times by an ICE employee on the condition of anonymity.One person familiar with the president’s thinking said that Mr. Trump believed that Mr. Vitiello did not favor closing the border, as the president had proposed before backing off that threat this week.Another person said that Stephen Miller, the president’s chief policy adviser and a supporter of curtailing legal and illegal immigration, did not support Mr. Vitiello’s nomination. The two people familiar with the president’s thinking both spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the internal White House decisions.The president’s abrupt decision came at a time when his administration considers the United States border with Mexico to be in crisis because of the flow of people trying to get into the country, making it a priority to have a confirmed appointee leading the agency to carry out the administration’s policies. But some senators, including Republicans, had concerns that Mr. Vitiello was not the right person for this job.Mr. Trump, who has continued to push for stronger deportation rules, had also expressed concern about whether a career civil servant, like Mr. Vitiello, would be up to the task. ICE has been led by acting directors since January 2017.Mr. Vitiello had recently been more outspoken about overflowing immigration facilities and strapped resources at the border. But that did little to assuage the National ICE Council, a union representing agency employees, which in February told the Senate it opposed Mr. Vitiello’s nomination over what was described as his controversial posts on social media and his treatment of some ICE agents.The request to withdraw Mr. Vitiello’s nomination surprised officials on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Even some Department of Homeland Security officials questioned whether it was sent in error."
1,"As thousands of families fleeing violence, poverty and oppression in Central America arrive at the American border, the Trump administration has responded by separating children and parents and cracking down on asylum claims.A more humane, and effective, response would be to address the sources of the desperation that propelled these people north. President Trump chose on Monday to reaffirm his punitive bent, complaining about the exodus of migrants and saying he told the leaders of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, whose countries receive millions of dollars in annual aid, “We’re not sending it anymore.” But what if the United States truly prioritized helping these nations?Plagued by corruption, violence and gang terror, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras need stronger and more honest judges and police officers, better schools and economic development. Elites control much of the land and avoid taxes, even at some of the lowest tax rates in Latin America. Bribery is rampant, and too often leaders lack the interest, competence or will to manage such problems. Over the years, the United States has contributed to instability by supporting autocrats in civil wars and tolerating corruption that has bred criminality. In 2017, Washington recognized the results of the Honduran presidential election days after the Organization of American States called for new elections because of voting irregularities.The United States has also invested in Latin America for decades to promote democracy and economic and social development. But the Trump administration has begun to place “more emphasis on preventing illegal immigration, combating transnational crime and generating export and investment opportunities for U.S. businesses,” according to a report last month by the Congressional Research Service, which does nonpartisan research for Congress.While the administration has tried to scale back aid, Congress has resisted, appropriating $2.1 billion for the region from 2016 to 2018, roughly double what had previously been allocated.Results are mixed: While murder rates in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras declined in 2018, they are still very high, fueled by the trafficking of 90 percent of the cocaine bound for the United States. Economic growth has been steady since 2014, but poverty rates are relatively unchanged. While officials have pursued criminal cases involving presidents and other leaders, opposition from political and economic interests threatens to upend their work.But there are reasons for hope: A 2014 study found that community-based programs to reduce crime and violence in Central America, run by the United States Agency for International Development, reported 19 percent fewer robberies and 51 percent fewer murders. Other programs, also funded mainly through U.S.A.I.D. and the State Department, help vet police officers, get them to work more closely with communities, identify youth prone to violence and work to change their behavior. Prosecutors and judges are being given training and technical assistance on managing cases and gathering evidence; journalists, activists and civil society groups are being counseled in how to protect themselves from threats. Other programs seek to make the civil service more professional, help subsistence farmers diversify their crops and increase yields and connect regional electric grids.`Eradicating gangs, which drive much of the northward migration, is especially difficult. The International Crisis Group has warned that mass deportations from the United States risk fueling gang violence unless accompanied by serious economic investment in impoverished communities. Just subjecting gang members to harsh prisons and branding them terrorists has backfired, the group said.In the end, it is Central American leaders who must carry out reforms. They are more apt to do that with international support. But America can slow the exodus of the desperate by investing in democracy, judicial reform and economic growth. So far, Mr. Trump has shown little interest."
2,"A man was charged with murder on Wednesday after he fatally shot a California police officer who pulled him over under the suspicion of drunken driving, the authorities said.The man, identified by the authorities as Gustavo Perez Arriaga, was arrested Friday after a manhunt that fueled tensions over illegal immigration when President Trump tweeted about it. The police say Mr. Perez Arriaga entered the United States illegally.On Wednesday, Mr. Perez Arriaga’s lawyer argued that he was mentally incompetent and unable to stand trial, delaying the criminal proceedings, said John Goold, a spokesman for the Stanislaus County district attorney.Mr. Perez Arriaga, who is in his 30s, is accused of shooting and killing Ronil Singh, a 33-year-old officer with the Newman Police Department, early on Dec. 26. The police said the shooting occurred after Officer Singh pulled Mr. Perez Arriaga’s vehicle over because he suspected that he was driving under the influence.The gunman fled in his pickup truck, according to a statement from the sheriff’s department. Mr. Perez Arriaga was arrested two days later.Sheriff Adam Christianson of Stanislaus County said at a news conference on Friday that the authorities believed Mr. Perez Arriaga was trying to escape to Mexico when he was arrested that day at a home in Lamont, Calif., about 10 miles outside Bakersfield.The sheriff said Mr. Perez Arriaga had crossed the border from Mexico illegally “some time ago,” worked as a farm laborer and bragged on social media about being active in a street gang.The sheriff said that Mr. Perez Arriaga had previously been arrested twice on suspicion of drunken driving.In the criminal complaint, Mr. Perez Arriaga was also identified by three other names. Mr. Goold said that prosecutors were not certain of his real name, but on Wednesday at the County Court in Modesto, he identified himself to the judge as Paulo Virgen Mendoza.Stephen Foley, the defendant’s lawyer, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday evening.According to the criminal complaint, prosecutors requested that the murder charge be considered under “special circumstances,” meaning the maximum punishment could be the death penalty or life in prison without parole. Those special circumstances include killing a police officer or committing murder in an attempt to avoid a lawful arrest.Mr. Trump tweeted about the case during the police’s manhunt — and the federal government shutdown prompted by his demands for a border wall with Mexico.Officer Singh was an immigrant from Fiji, officials said, and had worked for the Newman Police Department since 2011. He was married and had a 5‐month‐old son.After spending Christmas morning with his family, he went on duty that night. His funeral was on Wednesday.At least seven people have been charged with being accessories to the crime. The police say they helped Mr. Perez Arriaga elude the authorities. All have pleaded not guilty, according to local news reports."
3,"When federal immigration agents carried out a workplace raid at an electronics repair company in Texas this week, they handed out color-coded bracelets. People whom they deemed authorized to work in the United States received green wristbands. Those suspected of being undocumented wore yellow.It was an emotional scene punctuated by the arrests of more than 280 employees who were detained on immigration violations — the biggest single workplace sweep since 2008, officials said, and the largest since President Trump took office with a pledge to crack down on illegal immigration.The operation on Wednesday in Allen, a suburb of Dallas, evoked strong reactions, as families rushed to the site of the raid, protesters gathered outside an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement office in Dallas, and immigrant advocacy groups condemned the operation for throwing families’ lives into turmoil in a matter of hours.The employees arrested, who were predominantly women, hailed from 15 countries, including El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Nigeria and Venezuela, according to ICE. The agency said more than half of the workers had been released with orders to appear before a federal immigration judge, but 110 people remained in custody as of Thursday.Katrina W. Berger, who leads the agency’s Homeland Security Investigations unit in Dallas, said its focus was on a criminal investigation into the company, CVE Technology Group. But she said the authorities could not “turn a blind eye” to the unauthorized workers who were found there.The authorities executed a criminal search warrant at the company, which refurbishes and repairs cellphones and other technology equipment, after getting “many tips” that the business was hiring workers who were using fraudulent documents, Ms. Berger said.“Businesses that knowingly hire illegal aliens create an unfair advantage over their competing businesses,” Ms. Berger said at a news conference after the raid. “They take jobs away from U.S. citizens and legal residents, and they create an atmosphere poised for exploiting an illegal work force.”By Thursday, frantic families were seeking help from Raices, a Texas-based organization that offers free and low-cost legal services to immigrants and refugees, said Felix Villalobos, a lawyer in the organization’s Dallas office. He said the group had been inundated with requests, as many employees remained detained.United We Dream Texas, an organization led by young immigrants, condemned ICE in a statement for “targeting black and brown immigrant workers.” “Within hours, the lives of hundreds have spiraled into turmoil and anxiety,” the group said. “These workers are now in the hands of an agency that is abusive and negligent towards the physical and mental well-being of the people they target.”In an email on Thursday, Edward Cho, the chief executive of CVE Technology Group, said the company has a strong history of complying with federal immigration and employment laws.“We are cooperating with the authorities and intend to continue doing so,” he said. “We are also focused on providing support to impacted employees and their families, for whom this is a profoundly upsetting development.”Workplace raids have become more common under Mr. Trump, whose strict enforcement agenda has pushed the population of detained immigrants to the highest levels in history. Homeland Security Investigations opened about 6,850 workplace investigations last year, a jump from about 1,700 the year before. Officials also made nearly 800 criminal arrests, up from about 140 in 2017, according to figures released by ICE in December.The operations recall the high-profile immigration raids that made headlines during the presidency of George W. Bush. One of the biggest workplace raids, in May 2008, resulted in the detention of nearly 400 undocumented immigrants, including several children, at an Iowa meatpacking plant.The Obama administration took a more hands-off approach to enforcement, auditing employers’ compliance in documenting their workers’ status without conducting many on-site investigations.About eight million of the nearly 11 million immigrants unlawfully in the United States participate in the labor force. They account for about 5 percent of all workers, according to the Pew Research Center.Experts say that workplace raids primarily serve as a deterrent for employees — dissuading workers who are in the country illegally from showing up at their jobs and warning prospective undocumented immigrants that, even if they make it across the border, they may be captured at work.While the raids may also make employers think twice, it has traditionally been difficult for the government to take criminal action against businesses that hire unauthorized immigrants.A handful of employers faced prominent criminal cases in recent years. Last year, after federal agents rounded up about 100 workers at a meatpacking plant in Tennessee, the owner of the company pleaded guilty in federal court to fraud and employing unauthorized immigrants.But many companies avoid serious charges because it is often impossible to prove that they knew someone was unauthorized to work.Kathleen Campbell Walker, who is on the board of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said unauthorized immigrants seeking work may present fake documents, and it is up to employers to verify that the paperwork is legitimate.In some cases, she said, businesses are hiring and recruiting undocumented workers to try to cut costs and stay competitive. But there are other situations in which businesses don’t properly assess the documents — or get fooled by realistic fakes. “Many employers don’t have a clue to be able to spot something that is fake,” she said.The law requires only that employers ensure that documents appear to be valid, and federal law prohibits them from requiring specific types of identification from workers.The standard is: “To a reasonable employer, on their face, do they appear to be valid?” Ms. Campbell Walker said.Immigration officials said CVE Technology Group had “knowingly” hired unauthorized immigrants. After an audit earlier this year found “numerous hiring irregularities,” officials executed a criminal search warrant on Wednesday.The vast and complex operation involved more than 200 law enforcement officials who arrested people suspected of being undocumented while also working to identify the sole caregivers of children and others who should be released quickly on “humanitarian grounds,” Ms. Berger said.Mr. Villalobos of Raices said his group was working to independently confirm what had happened and to quell a panic that was rippling among immigrants locally and beyond. “Even if they live nowhere near that city,” he said, an operation like this can scare families into changing their habits, including their driving patterns.The families who rushed to the site of the raid on Wednesday “were pretty emotional,” he said. Some were left waiting for hours or more for their loved ones to be released.One man told a local television station, WFAA, that his fiancée had been detained. They were planning to get married in May, he said, but he feared she now would face deportation."
4,"An undocumented immigrant who worked at one of President Trump’s golf clubs in New Jersey for years and recently spoke out about her experience will attend his State of the Union address after being invited by her Democratic congresswoman, the woman’s lawyer and the congresswoman’s office said Wednesday.The undocumented immigrant, Victorina Morales, had worked as a housekeeper at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., since 2013, and spoke to The New York Times as part of an article published last month. The report revealed that the president’s company — the Trump Organization — was, for years, employing people at the golf club who are in the country illegally.In a brief interview on Wednesday, Ms. Morales said that on the advice of her lawyer, she stopped going to work on Dec. 4, two days before the Times article was published. Still, the lawyer, Anibal Romero, said that neither he nor his client had received notice that she had been fired. He said Ms. Morales’s employment status with the golf club was not entirely clear.Since leaving her job, Ms. Morales, who is from Guatemala, has campaigned for rights and fair treatment for undocumented immigrants. On Wednesday, she said she was pleased to have been invited to the State of the Union, that she has accepted the invitation and that she was “very proud because I am going to raise my voice for all of us immigrants.”“I’m not scared to show my face,” she said, speaking in Spanish. “I am not speaking for me, I’m speaking on behalf of millions of undocumented immigrants who live in the United States.”The congresswoman, Bonnie Watson Coleman, represents the New Jersey district in which Ms. Morales lives. The news that Ms. Morales had been invited to attend Tuesday’s State of the Union address as Ms. Watson Coleman’s guest was reported by The Washington Post on Wednesday.“Immigrants by and large are hardworking, trustworthy and skilled people who simply want to work and build better lives here,” Ms. Watson Coleman said in a statement. “For years these kinds of people were loyal and dedicated enough to be Trump Organization employees. I hope that in his State of the Union address, Donald Trump will finally acknowledge the real face of immigrants in this country — women and children fleeing violence; law-abiding, taxpaying people who would do almost anything to be Americans. And if he can’t, I’ve invited Victorina so that he may look her in her eyes to tell his lies to a familiar face.”The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday evening.Mr. Trump has made border security and protecting jobs for Americans cornerstones of his presidency, and his insistence on building a border wall led to the recent partial government shutdown. He has labeled illegal immigration “a major, major problem,” and pledged to build a border wall while his administration has carried out workplace raids and payroll audits.The Times article, published Dec. 6, said undocumented immigrants had been employed for years at the Trump National Golf Club as housekeepers, landscapers and kitchen staff. It also said they were kept on the payroll even though management was aware they had used phony documents to secure employment, as is common among undocumented immigrants.Ms. Morales previously told The Times that a manager at Bedminster had helped her secure a new fake Social Security number and legal permanent-residency card after telling her that those on file had expired.Since the article was published, about a dozen workers deemed ineligible to work in the United States because they lacked legal immigration status have been terminated at the Bedminster club, according to people familiar with the matter.Another dozen were fired at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, N.Y., this month, a development first reported by The Washington Post.The Trump Organization also said late Tuesday that it was putting in place a system to weed out undocumented immigrants who try to get jobs at its properties.“I must say, for me personally, this whole thing is truly heartbreaking,” Eric Trump, an executive vice president with the Trump Organization, said in the statement on Tuesday. “Our employees are like family, but when presented with fake documents, an employer has little choice.”He said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the Trump Organization, and that it “demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately.”"
5,"The last government shutdown ended because Democrats stood firm against President Trump’s border wall. But funding will soon run out again, talks between Democrats and Republicans are in crisis, and Mr. Trump remains committed: “The Wall will get built one way or the other!” he tweeted on Saturday.The Senate’s minority leader, Chuck Schumer, has made it clear that Mr. Trump won’t get his way: “Democrats are against the wall.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has admirably enforced party discipline, has called the wall “immoral.”Yet at the same time, Ms. Pelosi has emphasized that “Democrats are committed to border security.” She has critiqued the wall on the narrow grounds that government should instead employ “evidence-based knowledge about how we best secure our border.” James Clyburn, the majority whip, fleshed out what that might look like: a “smart wall,” including more Border Patrol agents. This, too, is immoral.It’s also bad politics. Democrats should follow their voters, who increasingly want more open borders, and reframe the immigration debate by rejecting the very notion that the border needs more “security” and making it clear that the real problem is the denial of migrants’ rights. The time has come for the Democratic Party to push for concrete policies to make the border more open.There is plainly no need for more security on the border. Illegal entries to the United States (as measured by Border Patrol apprehensions, which the government has long used as a proxy) began to fall at the turn of the century, and have plummeted since 2006. They remain at historic lows today. Those who are coming to the country are often Central Americans fleeing violence that United States policy in the region helped foment.And when it comes to drugs — a favorite justification of Mr. Trump’s for his wall — evidence shows that more “border security” does not stop trafficking. From the 1970s on, every crackdown on a drug-smuggling route, whether it was heroin via the French Connection or cocaine through the Caribbean, has only led to new innovations in the trade that have empowered murderous Mexican cartels. Some scholars even argue that the rise of fentanyl can be traced to drug interdiction.Then why, if there isn’t truly a crisis on the border, do the Democrats continue to invoke the need for more “border security”? Largely because the conversation about the border and immigration has moved so far to the right over the past 30 years. As the linguist George Lakoff and Sam Ferguson, his student at the time, wrote more than a decade ago, the narrow framing of the “immigration” debate “has shaped its politics, defining what count as ‘problems’” and, as a result, “constrains the solutions needed to address that problem.” When the “problem” is defined as “illegal immigration,” it becomes about “the illegal act of crossing the border without papers,” and so “the logical response to the ‘wave’ of ‘illegal immigration’ becomes ‘border security.’”Since Bill Clinton’s presidency, the Border Patrol has grown from 4,100 agents in fiscal year 1992 to more than 19,000 today. The United States has built hundreds of miles of border fencing since the 2006 Secure Fence Act, which Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton voted for. “Well, I voted for border security, and some of it was a fence,” Mrs. Clinton feebly said in 2016 when pressed about the 2006 vote that within a decade had become controversial.Democrats have for far too long let their political opponents define the terms of debate. Now they’re doing it again: House Democrats’ proposal heading into the negotiations with Republicans didn’t include funding for new physical barriers or additional Border Patrol agents, but it did offer significantly increased funding for “border security technology.”That’s not only bad for immigrants who, as a result of militarized borders are more likely to be kidnapped, violently assaulted and driven to cross via the lethal desert. It’s also bad for Democrats, who are handing ammunition to the nativist right at a time when Republicans are on the back foot and polls show that Democratic voters are moving decidedly leftward on immigration and the border.[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]Voters used to overwhelmingly favor less immigration, but opinions have changed fast amid an immigrant rights movement that took off in 2006 and partisan polarization driven by aggressive enforcement. In 1994, just 32 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning Americans and 30 percent of Republicans agreed that immigrants strengthened the country, according to the Pew Research Center. But by 2016, the share of Democrats who said so had skyrocketed to 78 percent. In 2006, 37 percent of Democrats said that immigration levels should be decreased, while only 20 percent said that it should be increased. In 2018, 40 percent said that it should be increased, with just 16 percent calling for restriction. The same trend has held on border politics: In 2010, 47 percent of Democrats said that they equally prioritized legalizing undocumented immigrants and “better border security and stronger enforcement of immigration laws,” while just 29 percent prioritized legalization alone. By 2018, the number prioritizing legalization alone skyrocketed to 51 percent.Under President Trump, polarization has accelerated — and that’s a good thing. The vanishing bipartisan consensus orchestrated mammoth deportations and militarized the border in the quixotic hope of placating the nativist right and winning it over to supporting immigration reform. This strategy only inflamed the right’s paranoiac ravings and helped move the goal posts to new extremes. Which is why we find ourselves, in 2019, with the possibility of beginning a second government shutdown over the wall.So, what should the Democrats pursue instead? A break with a failed bipartisan consensus.Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib, all Democrats who are new to the House, have drafted a letter urging opposition to any deal that increases Department of Homeland Security funding in any form. That’s a good start.The border must be demilitarized, which would include demolishing the already-existing wall and dramatically downsizing the Border Patrol. Criminal sanctions on illegal entry and re-entry must be repealed. Opportunities for legal immigration, particularly from Mexico and Central America, must be expanded. The right to asylum must be honored. And citizenship for those who reside here must be a stand-alone cause, unencumbered by compromises that are not only distasteful but also politically ineffectual — and that today would provoke opposition from the nativist right and the grass-roots left. If Democrats stick to the center on immigration, they will find themselves fighting on two fronts. A fight against Republicans, with the left at their back, will be far easier to win — and a more noble victory.Simple realism dictates that no legislation to grant citizenship to the millions of undocumented Americans who deserve it will be passed until the Republicans are defeated. There’s no use trying to appease them. The bipartisan consensus supporting harsh immigration and border enforcement has fractured. Democratic elected officials need to catch up."

I spent four years as a reporter based in Mexico and two in Arizona, and I’ve stood on stretches of the border with one boot in one country and the companion in the other.With the border so much in the news these days, and with New York Times correspondents spending so much of their time crisscrossing back and forth, we figured we’d offer readers the chance to spend some time there, too.Follow along and you’ll get a more nuanced sense of the long line between Mexico and the United States. It’s neither as terrifying nor as trouble free as it’s portrayed.— MARC LACEY, National editorThere are no one-way signs at the border. Surging north are migrants, truck drivers, shoppers, smugglers and numerous others. Going the other way last week were two men in an old tan pickup truck.Following in a long tradition of Americans heading to Mexico in a hurry, the men, driving south out of Nogales, Ariz., made a swift and sudden run across the border. A Customs and Border Protection agent opened fire. The truck roared about 20 feet into Mexico and plowed into a concrete barrier.“He’s alive, he’s alive!” somebody screamed as Mexican police officers rushed forward.A few yards away, a tamale vendor named Francisco said he was pretty sure that the driver had tried to run over one of the agents. Then “they shot him in the head,” said Francisco, who is known by other vendors as “El Toro,” but declined to give his last name.The U.S. authorities did not give a detailed account of the shooting, but the Mexican police told the newspaper Nogales International that the driver had indeed been shot in the head.A mistaken step on the accelerator? Or a 21st-century outlaw, the latest in a long line of Americans who have found what seemed to be a good reason to head for Mexico?So far, the authorities aren’t saying. Customs and Border Protection agents said investigators with the agency’s Office of Professional Responsibility and others were examining the shooting, which left the 21-year-old driver, still officially unidentified, in critical condition. After being taken to a hospital in the Mexican town of Nogales, the agency said, he was transferred to a facility in Southern Arizona for advanced medical care. The passenger was released after questioning by the Mexican authorities.“No further details are expected to be immediately released,” C.B.P. said in a statement.We asked the nurses who the injured driver was and what happened to him. “No comment,” they said. We asked the local sheriff what he knew. “Nothing,” he replied.Like so much these days at the border, which is often seen as a bright line between Mexico and the United States, exactly what took place is blurry.— JOSE A.

Email us at: crossingtheborder@nytimes.com.That’s how many times the president has visited the border region since taking office in 2017.Monday’s rally in El Paso, Tex., was the president’s second visit this year, after a trip to McAllen, Tex., in January. Mr. Trump also visited the border in March 2018, when he inspected prototypes for a border wall in San Diego. In August 2017, he visited a border post in Yuma, Ariz.This year’s visits, coming amid a congressional showdown over the border wall, were meant to help the president shore up support for what he has called a “crisis” of illegal immigration. Both times — here in McAllen and here in El Paso — local residents complained that the president misstated the level of crime in their towns.This week, as the country inched closer to a Friday deadline to avert another government shutdown, congressional leaders announced a possible compromise to avoid it. On Thursday, the House and the Senate passed legislation to fund the government, and on Friday, the president announced he would declare a national emergency in order to build the wall.Here are five great ways to dive into the debate:• “In pursuit of a wall, President Trump ran into one.” This analysis of the expected deal lays out how the president came to accept a defeat, over the objections of some of his supporters.• There are nearly 2,000 miles of border between the United States and Mexico. Here’s a look at the barriers that already exist, including 700 miles of fencing built by the United States government since 2006.• Representative Will Hurd of Texas is the only Republican congressman who represents a border district. On a recent episode of The Daily, he spoke about why he disagrees with the president about a border wall. Listen to it here.• When Mr. Trump visited El Paso this week to make a pitch for the border wall, he repeated some frequent false claims about immigration. The Times fact-checked his speech here.• People in El Paso told us what they thought about the president’s view of their city."
7,"The Trump Organization said late Tuesday that it was implementing a system to weed out undocumented immigrants who try to get jobs at its properties. The move followed reports in The New York Times last month that the president’s company was employing people at its flagship golf club in New Jersey who are in the country illegally.“We are actively engaged in uniforming this process across our properties and will institute E-verify at any property not currently utilizing this system,’’ Eric Trump, an executive vice president of the company, said in a statement. “As a company we take this obligation very seriously and when faced with a situation in which an employee has presented false and fraudulent documentation, we will take appropriate action.”Thousands of employers have enrolled voluntarily in the government’s E-Verify electronic system, which checks documents provided by new hires against Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security records. A mismatch suggests that the person is unauthorized to work.All federal contractors must use E-Verify, and 22 states require at least some private and public employers to do so. The federal E-Verify database suggested that the Trump Organization did not use heightened employment document verification procedures at several of its properties, meaning that the chances of employing undocumented workers was high.The New York Times reported in December that undocumented immigrants had been employed for years at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., as housekeepers, landscapers and kitchen staff.They were kept on the payroll despite the fact that management was aware that they had used phony documents to secure employment, as is common among undocumented immigrants.Victorina Morales, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala, said that a manager at Bedminster helped her secure a new fake Social Security Number and legal permanent-residency card after telling her that those on file had expired.Since the articles were published, about a dozen workers deemed ineligible to work in the United States because they lacked legal immigration status have been terminated at the Bedminster club, according to people familiar with the matter.Another dozen were fired at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester earlier this month, a development first reported by the Washington Post.“I must say, for me personally, this whole thing is truly heartbreaking,’’ Mr. Trump said in the statement on Tuesday. “Our employees are like family but when presented with fake documents, an employer has little choice.”He said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the Trump Organization, and that it “demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately.’’The Trump Organization said last month that it would immediately terminate those who were not authorized to work in the United States. But for several weeks it failed to respond to questions about what measures it was taking to rectify the situation.President Trump has made border security and protecting jobs for Americans cornerstones of his presidency, from the border wall he has pledged to build — it recently resulted in the partial government shutdown — to the workplace raids and payroll audits that his administration has carried out.Mr. Trump launched his bid for the G.O.P. presidential nomination in June 2015, declaring that the United States had become a “dumping ground for everybody else’s problems.” Mexico was “sending people” to commit crimes and bring drugs. “They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,” he said.In a speech in Arizona shortly after, he deemed illegal immigration “a major, major problem in this country,” vowing to erect a wall along the southwest border.In August 2015, Mr. Trump told The Times that his companies employed only people with legal work papers.When the Trump International Hotel opened for business in Washington, the president boasted that he had used E-Verify to ensure that only those legally entitled to work were hired.“We didn’t have one illegal immigrant on the job,” Mr. Trump said then.About 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States and about eight million of them are in the labor force, according to the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan think tank. It is an open secret that many businesses, especially in the service sector, employ them.To deter illegal hiring, Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducts audits of businesses, having slapped tens of millions of dollars in administrative and criminal penalties on those found to employ undocumented workers since the early 2000s. These inspections have intensified under the Trump administration.From Oct. 1, 2017, through July 20, 2018, ICE opened 6,093 work-site investigations and made 675 criminal and 984 administrative work-site-related arrests, several times more than in the entire 2017 fiscal year from Oct. 1, 2016 to Sept. 30, 2017.Employers who use E-Verify contend that they struggle to attract enough workers to perform menial, physically onerous jobs. The vast majority of businesses simply require applicants to fill out a federal form, the I-9, and present identification and Social Security card, which they assume are genuine."
8,"President Trump’s family business has employed undocumented workers more broadly than it was previously believed, with multiple workers losing their jobs last month at a Trump golf club in southern New Jersey.The club in Pine Hill, N.J., known as the Trump National Golf Club Philadelphia, was the third Trump property where undocumented workers have been fired since The New York Times reported in December that the Trump club in Bedminster, N.J., for years employed immigrants who were in the country unlawfully.The president’s company terminated about a dozen undocumented workers at the Bedminster property after the article was published, as well as a dozen workers at the Trump National Golf Club Westchester, in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.People familiar with the terminations at Pine Hill said that about five workers at that property were fired or told not to report to work again, including two seasonal employees who were not scheduled to work until the spring. One of the people familiar with the matter said that many other seasonal workers expected to be told not to return in the coming weeks.The revelations about the undocumented workers has been an embarrassment for the Trump Organization, coming to light as Mr. Trump has railed against illegal immigration, blamed undocumented immigrants for crime and pledged to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep more people from entering the country unlawfully.The company has said it was duped by employees who used false identification to get their jobs. But some of the workers in Bedminster told The Times they were kept on the payroll despite the fact that management was aware of the false documents.A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on Friday.The workers at the Pine Hill property said their terminations, which occurred in January, came abruptly.“Just like that, I got fired,” said Victor Reyes, who is from Mexico and worked in the kitchen alongside the chef.“The manager called me and asked, ‘Victor, are you legal?’ I said, ‘No, I am not legal.’ It surprised me because I knew he knew that I was illegal. I have worked for him 16 years and then he asks me,” said Mr. Reyes, who added that it was his first job since crossing the border.Mr. Reyes had worked up from a dishwasher to grilling steaks and preparing a la carte orders, he said, and acquired many cooking skills along the way.The firings at the Pine Hill golf club were the result of a broader audit that the Trump Organization is conducting at its properties across the country, according to people briefed on the review. Although the organization has conducted similar reviews in prior years, this is the largest effort yet to ensure that the company’s employees are authorized to work in the country.The review has presented yet another legal and public relations headache for company executives who are trying to contain the fallout from the revelations. It comes as the Trump Organization is facing wider scrutiny from congressional Democrats examining the company’s business practices.At this point in the review, the issues appear to have been largely concentrated in the Bedminster and Westchester golf clubs, the people said, though the discovery of undocumented workers at the southern New Jersey property show that the matter is more widespread than initially believed. The terminations at the Westchester club were first reported by The Washington Post.The Trump Organization announced on Tuesday that it was using a system — known as E-verify — to prevent undocumented workers from getting jobs at its properties. For the last several years, the company had utilized that system in many of its hotel properties, though it did not adopt it at most of the golf courses.“I must say, for me personally, this whole thing is truly heartbreaking,” Eric Trump, an executive vice president with the Trump Organization, said in a statement on Tuesday. “Our employees are like family, but when presented with fake documents, an employer has little choice.”He said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the Trump Organization, and that it “demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately.”About eight million undocumented workers participate in the United States labor force, and it is an open secret that they use fake documents to get hired, typically made-up social security numbers and permanent residency cards.The Pine Hill club has an 18-hole golf course surrounded by maple and pine trees on 365 acres. Members enjoy putting greens and a 43,000-square-foot clubhouse where weddings and other events take place. Sitting atop a hill, it boasts a view of the Philadelphia skyline.The golf club employs 100 to 200 people, many of them in seasonal jobs. Immigrants employed there were charged with watering, mowing and manicuring the greens; the upkeep of the banquet hall, which has a 300-person capacity; and preparing food in the club’s restaurant.Because the workers do not have lawyers and remain in the country illegally, two of those who described the firings, as well as their family members, declined to be named.Workers said that those who were terminated were summoned to a meeting with Eric Quinn, the general manager, and a human-resources executive who they believed was from the Trump Organization. Each was told that their documents did not pass inspection after an audit and that they should leave the premises immediately, leaving some of the workers who lacked driver’s licenses to scramble to find rides home.“People were getting fired on the spot, no warning, no nothing. No time to find a job,” said one worker, who declined to be named.The worker said that the immigrants had been treated well by the club’s management and that some of them had broken down when they were fired. “It’s not easy to find a job if you don’t have papers, after you worked there,” the worker said. The general manager, according to several accounts, was said to have lamented the terminations.Executives at the Pine Hill club declined to comment.The problem of undocumented workers at Trump properties came to light in December, when The Times wrote about Victorina Morales of Guatemala, a housekeeper at the Bedminster property who made the president’s bed, washed his clothes and dusted his golf trophies for five years. After Mr. Trump was elected, a manager told her that her fake documents had expired and helped her acquire new ones.Ms. Morales said that on the advice of her lawyer, she stopped going to work on Dec. 4, two days before The Times article was published. The lawyer, Anibal Romero, has said that neither he nor his client had been notified that she was fired, and that her employment status was not clear.Ms. Morales, who is protected from deportation because she applied for asylum, was invited by her Democratic congresswoman, Bonnie Watson Coleman, to attend the State of the Union address on Tuesday. Also attending will be Sandra Diaz, a native of Costa Rica and a legal resident of the United States who said she was undocumented when she worked at the Trump resort. She will be the guest of Representative Jimmy Gomez, a California Democrat.Another undocumented worker, Emma Torres, told The Times that someone in human resources at the Bedminster club had removed her name and other undocumented workers’ names from a list of employees submitted to the Secret Service in 2017. Ms. Torres quit shortly after on her own volition.At Pine Hill, Mr. Reyes said that he was treated well by Mr. Quinn, the general manager, and expressed gratitude for the opportunity to grow professionally during his years at the golf club, where his hard work was recognized, he said. Over the years, on the job his repertoire of dishes grew and he learned English.“I had too many raises,” said the immigrant from Puebla, who said that he earned $18 an hour. The money enabled him to pay his rent and send money to his family back in Mexico.He received his first bonus in all his years working at the club, he said, in late December. In hindsight, Mr. Reyes wonders whether that was because management knew that he would not be welcome back after the winter hiatus.Now, he said, he is seething with a sense of betrayal.“I loved my job. I learned to cook everything. They helped me grow,” he said, erupting in tears. “Now I feel bad. I don’t trust nobody.”Mr. Trump, who during his campaign called Mexicans “rapists” and “criminals,” has made border security and protecting jobs for Americans cornerstones of his presidency. His commitment to erecting a border wall resulted in the recent partial government shutdown.He has deemed illegal immigration “a major, major problem,” and his administration has intensified workplace raids and payroll audits at companies suspected of employing undocumented workers."
9,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration plans to aggressively push for tougher screening of asylum seekers that will make it vastly more difficult for migrants fleeing persecution in their home countries to win protection in the United States, a senior administration official told reporters on Tuesday.The official said that President Trump ordered a shake-up of his top immigration officials in recent days because they were moving too slowly, or even actively obstructing, the president’s desire to confront the surge of migrants at the southwestern border. The asylum changes are among many policies the president wants to put into effect with a new team in place, the official said.Mr. Trump denied on Tuesday that one of those changes would be to restart his policy of separating migrant families at the border, though he said that the act of taking children from their parents — which drew global condemnation before he abandoned it last summer — was effective.“Now I’ll tell you something, once you don’t have it, that’s why you see many more people coming,” Mr. Trump said. “They are coming like it’s a picnic, because, ‘Let’s go to Disneyland.’”The administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity even as Mr. Trump was making his remarks, said a modified version of family separation, in which parents are given a choice of whether to be separated or to accept indefinite detention alongside their children, continues to be under consideration.But the so-called binary choice proposal is “not ripe for White House consideration” right now, he insisted, because the government does not currently have the detention space to hold families if the policy were put in place.The asylum changes being envisioned could drastically alter the role that the United States plays as a refuge for people fleeing poverty, violence and war. American and international laws require it to allow migrants to request asylum once they come to the country.But the official said that an initial assessment of the basis for a request for asylum — known as a “credible fear” screening — too often accepts the claim that the migrant was persecuted. The official also said that many more asylum seekers should be rejected during that first step.Out of 97,728 completed interviews with migrants in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, 2018, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services confirmed a credible fear of persecution 74,677 times, according to an agency official.Changes in the screening process could drastically lower those findings by requiring more proof from asylum seekers that they would be persecuted in their home countries. Screeners could also try to verify migrant claims by using State Department assessments of the threats that exist in those countries.Immigrant rights advocates have feared for months that the administration would try to change the standards by which asylum seekers are judged in an effort to prevent more of them from coming into the United States.The administration official blamed the delay in that effort on “deep state” bureaucrats at the Department of Homeland Security and even the president’s own political appointees in the department, whom the official described as lacking the management skills to push Mr. Trump’s agenda.The official declined to name specific administration officials who have failed. But he made thinly veiled references to two top officials at the Department of Homeland Security: John Mitnick, the department’s general counsel, and L. Francis Cissna, the head of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.He said there was “clearly a track record” in which the president’s policies have not been advanced.In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Trump falsely said that President Barack Obama had embraced the same policy of routinely separating migrant children from their parents at the border.“President Obama had child separation,” Mr. Trump said during brief remarks in the Oval Office, where he was meeting with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt. “I’m the one that stopped it.”Under Mr. Obama and President George W. Bush, immigration officials sometimes separated families when they had reason to question parentage or when there was evidence of child abuse. The Trump administration instituted a policy in which all families who crossed the border illegally were separated in order to allow the parents to be prosecuted under the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy. More than 2,700 children were separated from their parents at the border before Mr. Trump ended the policy in June 2018.[Fact check: Family separation at the border]The president’s comments come after he shook up the senior ranks of the Department of Homeland Security, forcing the resignation of the secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, and top immigration officials in a move that signaled a pending shift in immigration policies.Also on Tuesday, the acting deputy secretary of homeland security, Claire Grady, who was next in line by law to become the acting secretary, submitted her resignation, according to a Twitter post by Ms. Nielsen. Ms. Grady’s resignation paves the way for Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, to take the role.Customs and Border Protection officials this week underscored Mr. Trump’s concern about illegal immigration by announcing that more than 103,000 migrants crossed the southwestern border in March without authorization, an increase from the more than 76,000 migrants who crossed in February.“Just last month, we saw record numbers of family units and unaccompanied juvenile apprehensions in February, and unfortunately, March apprehension numbers are again record-setting and cause dire concerns for us,” said Brian Hastings, the chief of law enforcement operations for the Border Patrol.Most of the migrants — 92,000 of the 103,000 — were apprehended by Border Patrol agents, meaning they crossed in between the ports of entry.More than 53,000 of those migrants were members of a family, Mr. Hastings said, and most of those families were from Honduras, Guatemala or El Salvador.In the first half of fiscal year 2019, Border Patrol agents apprehended more than 385,000 migrants on the border, more than double those apprehended during the same time last year.Mr. Hastings said the Border Patrol can generally maintain 4,500 people in its custody. But it recently counted 13,000 migrants in its facilities, and he said the overflow has led to the release of families into cities along the border.“Backups have resulted in individuals spending additional time in Border Patrol custody in increasingly crowded conditions,” Mr. Hastings said.On Tuesday, White House officials announced that the president would appeal a judge’s ruling that blocked the administration’s “Migrant Protection Protocols,” which require some asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while they wait for their court cases.Mr. Trump has recently commended Mexico for doing more to stem migration to the border, but the officials said they have not seen any effect on the number of people crossing it. “The numbers aren’t declining; in fact, we’re still seeing 3,000 apprehensions per day,” Mr. Hastings said.Officials also revealed that among the tens of thousands of family members approaching the border each month, just 3,100 people who said they were traveling with relatives were found to have a fraudulent claim. Those people either said they had a child when the individual was over 18 or the group’s members were not really related."
10,"LAS CRUCES, N.M. — In a vast congressional district of fluted mountain ranges, chile crops and oil and gas wells on the country’s southern border, New Mexico Democrats in November broke the Republican hold on a House seat that had endured for 37 years, except for a two-year break.Xochitl Torres Small, a 34-year-old water rights lawyer, won by carefully calibrating her message as a problem-solver, like several other moderate Democrats who flipped House seats nationwide last year. Though the region is 55 percent Hispanic, she did not harp on President Trump’s border wall or his incitement of fears of immigrants bringing crime and drugs.She did not need to.“In New Mexico, we experience the positions of this president a little more intimately than a lot of people,” said Jeff Steinborn, a Democratic state lawmaker from Las Cruces. “The race baiting, divisive border politics has a very human face in our community.”As Mr. Trump agreed on Friday to end the longest government shutdown on record, in the face of  some of his lowest approval ratings ever, he backed down at least temporarily from his campaign promise of a border wall. Doing so could come at a political price with his supporters.But at the same time, there already has been a toll to his party for his insistence on hundreds of miles of new border barriers.Nowhere is that clearer than in the Southwest, where growing diversity and Mr. Trump’s demeaning rhetoric about Latino migrants are pulling parts of the region from the once-firm grip of Republicans.In addition to Ms. Torres Small’s district, Democrats flipped a House seat in the midterms on the southern border in Arizona and four seats in rapidly diversifying Orange County in Southern California.In Arizona, Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat, captured a Republican-held Senate seat, while in Texas the Democratic Senate nominee, Beto O’Rourke, came closer to winning a major statewide race than any other Democrat in 20 years. Ms. Sinema won 69 percent of Latino voters and Mr. O’Rourke 64 percent, according to exit polls.Each of the nine House members whose districts touch the border from California to Texas opposes a wall as the wrong solution for border security.“The irony of the wall is it works best the further you are from the border,” said Senator Martin Heinrich, Democrat of New Mexico, the state with the highest share of Hispanics.While Mr. Heinrich glided to re-election in November, some Democrats from nearly all-white states farther north went down to defeat. “It was a huge issue in North Dakota and Montana in the Senate races,” Mr. Heinrich said.“This constant picture painted by the president of this dangerous borderlands region is so incongruous with daily life,” he added.Republican analysts play down the role of immigration and the border in the recent Democratic advances in the Southwest. Stan Barnes, a former Arizona state lawmaker and current Republican lobbyist in Phoenix, said the positions of Ms. Sinema on the border were nearly identical to those of her Trump-hugging opponent, Martha McSally.“Kyrsten Sinema, you couldn’t tell the difference between her and Martha McSally on matters of the border,” he said. “She did not run as a Democrat, she ran as an independent or an Arizonan, and did not concede one bit of being tough on illegal immigration to Martha McSally.”Demographers have long predicted the growing share of Latinos in Texas and Arizona would turn those Republican-leaning states a shade of purple or blue. Democrats’ expectations of awakening “the sleeping giant” of Latino voters have been repeatedly thwarted.But 2018 may have moved them a step closer to the future. More than one in four Latino voters said they cast a ballot in a midterm election for the first time, versus 12 percent for whites, according to the Pew Research Center. In congressional races across the country, about 69 percent voted for the Democrat.“Immigration is the big deal breaker in not voting Republican,” said Joseph Garcia, director of the Latino Public Policy Center at Arizona State University.Because Latinos are much younger on average than whites, and many are just forming a partisan preference, Mr. Garcia predicted that Mr. Trump’s policies and language about immigrants would sour them on Republicans in federal elections for years to come.“It wasn’t just the wall, it was the rhetoric over three years demonizing Latinos in general,” he said. “That has a longer-lasting effect than just this administration.”“The die has been cast in that Arizona’s future is largely Latino,” he added, “and they’re all U.S. citizens because they were born here.” The median age of Latinos in Arizona is 26, and for non-Hispanic whites, 43.To James Kolbe, a Republican who in the 1990s and 2000s represented the Arizona congressional seat that flipped in the midterms, south and east of Tucson, the president’s rhetoric about illegal immigrants was reminiscent of the white-hot anger he heard at town hall events in the mid-2000s. But that talk is out of date, he said, because the reality on the southern border is far different.With illegal immigration near a 50-year low, more Mexicans are leaving the United States than entering. Meanwhile, there is a spike in families and children from Central America turning themselves in to border agents.Critics of the Trump administration say the actual border crisis is one of its own making because it has failed to allocate resources to process asylum seekers and humanely house children and families.In the race for Mr. Kolbe’s old district, which has swung between the parties, the losing Republican supported Mr. Trump’s wall, while the Democratic victor, Ann Kirkpatrick, opposed new border barriers and called for a path to citizenship for “Dreamers,” the immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children.While the district’s overall population since 2000 has grown by 14.5 percent, its Latino population soared 53 percent, according to a New York Times analysis of census data.Back in New Mexico, Ms. Torres Small won a narrow victory in the Second District thanks to a voter surge in Democratic-leaning Las Cruces, the state’s second-largest city.Turnout in the city and surrounding Doña Ana County was up 4 percent over 2010, while in Lea County — a Republican stronghold — turnout fell more than 7 percent, starkly showing the contrast between Democratic and Republican enthusiasm, which many observers trace to Mr. Trump.On Saturday, chants of “No wall! No wall!” broke out as Ms. Torres Small spoke at the local women’s march about the need to compromise with the president on the shutdown.“We have to make sure that people who live on the border have a voice for what we want our border to look like,” Ms. Torres Small said, according to The Las Cruces Sun News.Meanwhile, at a street market downtown where farmers sold honey and chile wreaths, shoppers said they had no sense of a crisis on the border, which is 40 miles south and buffered by scrubland of juniper and yucca.Last year the Border Patrol replaced 20 miles of low fencing meant to stop vehicles with a column-style barrier, 18 to 30 feet tall, which one shopper called a “Jurassic Park wall.”“I really don’t think about it very much at all,” said Patricia Mihok, who was selling children’s books she had written about wildlife of the Chihuahuan Desert, which straddles the international border. She worried that a border wall would threaten migrating species.Rory Richardson, 70, a retired airline pilot, called a wall a waste of money. He blamed the president for falsely accusing immigrants of crimes unsupported by statistics.“He brings out the very worst in this society,” Mr. Richardson said. “He’s talking to the people who supported him from Day 1, that don’t care about the truth. They’ve made up their minds and don’t confuse me with the facts.”But Henry Diaz, 85, a retired sheriff of Doña Ana County, who was strolling with his wife after a breakfast of huevos rancheros at Rosie’s Cafe, said a border wall was needed.“Everybody has a fence around their house,” he said. “Why do you have that? You need the privacy.”New Mexico, which last voted for a Republican for president in 2004, was once more of a political battleground than it is today. Democrats made sweeping gains in the midterms, winning not just the Second District but also the governor’s race and enlarging their majorities in the Legislature.Last week, Democratic lawmakers in Santa Fe introduced bills to make New Mexico a “sanctuary state,” which would bar state agencies from helping federal immigration authorities who seek to deport undocumented immigrants.“I think it’s important that New Mexico not help Donald Trump enact basically racist immigration policies,” Mr. Steinborn, the Las Cruces lawmaker, said."
11,"WASHINGTON — Before it became the chief sticking point in a government shutdown drama that threatens to consume his presidency at a critical moment, President Trump’s promise to build a wall on the southwestern border was a memory trick for an undisciplined candidate.As Mr. Trump began exploring a presidential run in 2014, his political advisers landed on the idea of a border wall as a mnemonic device of sorts, a way to make sure their candidate — who hated reading from a script but loved boasting about himself and his talents as a builder — would remember to talk about getting tough on immigration, which was to be a signature issue in his nascent campaign.“How do we get him to continue to talk about immigration?” Sam Nunberg, one of Mr. Trump’s early political advisers, recalled telling Roger J. Stone Jr., another adviser. “We’re going to get him to talk about he’s going to build a wall.”Talk Mr. Trump did, and the line drew rapturous cheers from conservative audiences, thrilling the candidate and soon becoming a staple of campaign speeches. Chants of “Build the wall!” echoed through arenas throughout the country.Now, Mr. Trump’s fixation with a border wall — the material embodiment of his keep-them-out immigration agenda — has run headlong into the new realities of divided government, pitting him against Democrats who reject the idea out of hand. The impasse is particularly remarkable given that even some immigration hard-liners do not regard the wall as their highest priority and fear that Mr. Trump’s preoccupation with it will prompt him to cut a deal that trades a relatively ineffectual measure for major concessions on immigration.“I’ve always thought it created a danger that he would trade almost anything in order to get the wall — I think that’s still a potential danger,” said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that argues for less immigration. “I’m still worried about that now.”That fear has been realized at times when Mr. Trump has explored a deal with Democrats on granting permanent legal status for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, known as Dreamers. The president has always walked away at the last moment from committing to preserving the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, but on Friday, FAIR, an anti-immigration group, warned him again that it would be a mistake.To many conservative activists who have pressed for decades for sharp reductions in both illegal and legal immigration — and some of the Republican lawmakers who are allied with them — a physical barrier on the border with Mexico is barely relevant, little more than a footnote to a long list of policy changes they believe are needed to fix a broken system.The disconnect is at the heart of the dilemma facing Mr. Trump as he labors to find a way out of an impasse that has shuttered large parts of the government and cost 800,000 federal employees their pay. Having spent more than four years — first as a candidate and then as president — whipping his core supporters into a frenzy over the idea of building a border wall, Mr. Trump finds himself in a political box of his own making.In transforming the wall into a powerful emblem of his anti-immigration message, Mr. Trump has made the proposal politically untouchable for Democrats, who have steadfastly refused to fund it, complicating the chances of any compromise.“As a messaging strategy, it was pretty successful,” Mr. Krikorian said. “The problem is, you got elected; now what do you do? Having made it his signature issue, Trump handed the Democrats a weapon against him.”The dynamic has been on vivid display this past week as Mr. Trump has argued that there can be no deal to reopen the government unless his wall is paid for, while Democrats, now in control of the House, have refused in ever sharper terms.“A wall is an immorality — it’s not who we are as a nation,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday. “This is not a wall between Mexico and the United States that the president is creating here; it’s a wall between reality and his constituents, his supporters.”Last month, in private comments to Democratic lawmakers after an Oval Office confrontation with Mr. Trump, Ms. Pelosi said the wall was “like a manhood thing for him.”Yet it has also become an outsize symbol in the other direction for Democrats, many of whom supported at least some sort of barrier along the border in the past but now cast Mr. Trump’s wall as a travesty. Sixty-four Democrats in the House and 26 in the Senate voted in 2006 for the Secure Fence Act, which provided for hundreds of miles of fencing along the border. Among them were Senators Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Chuck Schumer.“The only things that have changed is the situation at the border is worse and Donald Trump got elected,” said Kellyanne Conway, the president’s counselor.Ms. Conway said Mr. Trump had become so committed to a wall because it would not only prevent the entry of many illegal immigrants and stem the flow of drugs, but also discourage migrants from coming in the first place.“The reason he’s focused on the wall is he thinks you need a very robust physical barrier at the border that you can’t climb over, slide under, drive through or walk around,” she said. “He believes it’s got to be something that’s a deterrent that stops people from taking these perilous journeys.”Beyond the symbolism, Democrats now argue that a wall is an expensive and ineffective means of curbing illegal immigration. The majority of undocumented immigrants are people who overstay visas, not people who sneak across the border. A report released in March by Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security Committee found that Border Patrol agents on the front lines said they needed more technology and additional personnel to curb illegal immigration and drug traffic, with less than one half of one percent mentioning a wall.Mr. Schumer, now the Senate Democratic leader, has insisted for two years that any spending agreements contain language barring federal money for Mr. Trump’s wall. Republican leaders went along each time, even as the president became increasingly irate, once coming close to vetoing a spending package on the day of the White House signing ceremony.While most Republicans refuse to say so publicly for fear of angering Mr. Trump, many share the view that the wall is only a piece — and nowhere near the most important one — of a broader set of actions needed to overhaul the immigration system, including cuts to legal immigration, tighter standards for granting asylum and better enforcement.Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump’s acting chief of staff, gave voice to that position in 2015, when he was a congressman from South Carolina, telling a local radio station that Mr. Trump, at the time a presidential candidate, had an overly simplistic view of tackling immigration.“The fence is an easy thing to sell politically,” Mr. Mulvaney said then. “It’s an easy thing for someone who doesn’t follow the issue very closely to say, ‘Oh, well, that will just solve everything, build the fence.’ The fence doesn’t solve the problem.”“Just to say ‘build the darn fence’ and have that be the end of an immigration discussion is absurd and almost childish,” Mr. Mulvaney said.John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump’s former chief of staff, enraged Mr. Trump last year when he privately told a group of Democratic lawmakers that the president had not been “fully informed” when he proposed a border wall during his campaign, and had since “evolved” under Mr. Kelly’s tutelage. “The Wall is the Wall,” the president responded in an angry tweet contradicting his top aide.“To be honest, it’s not a wall,” Mr. Kelly said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times last month as he prepared to leave the White House, adding that the administration had abandoned the idea of a “solid concrete wall early on.” His comments prompted another irate tweet from Mr. Trump. “An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED,” he wrote.Mr. Trump himself has at other times said he is not necessarily wedded to a concrete wall but open to different forms of barriers at different points along the border, including steel slats. “I never said, ‘I’m going to build a concrete” wall, he said on Friday, rewriting history. “I said I’m going to build a wall.”NumbersUSA, another conservative group that presses for stricter immigration policies, circulated an article last month suggesting that Mr. Trump drop his wall demand in favor of a plan to mandate that all employers use E-Verify, an electronic system that checks immigration status for prospective employees.The wall “has sucked political capital from the pursuit of other, and arguably better, means to deter illegal immigrants,” wrote Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute.Yet Mr. Trump has tethered himself to the wall and shows no sign of letting go.Ann Coulter, who along with Rush Limbaugh, Matt Drudge and other conservative commentators has pressed Mr. Trump to live up to his campaign promise, said the focus on the wall was not to be to the exclusion of other policies aimed at stemming illegal immigration.“We want that stuff too — but we also want a wall,” she said in an email on Friday. “The chant at every campaign rally wasn’t, ‘Enforce E-Verify!’ ‘Tax remittances!’” she added, referring to a proposal to tax cash payments sent by immigrants to their families in Mexico and Central America.Advisers said the president became absorbed by the idea of a wall because it was the most memorable and tangible promise he made while stumping for the White House in 2016.“He wants to call it a wall because that’s what he campaigned on,” said Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax and a friend of Mr. Trump’s. “He’s very obsessed about carrying out his campaign promises — I think to a degree that’s unhealthy — but that’s important to him, and that’s not a bad thing.”Mr. Ruddy and some other advisers argue that Mr. Trump has more room to maneuver than he thinks, because his base would accept his word that some form of additional security along the border was the equivalent of a wall in terms of effectiveness.“Listening to Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter on this is a mistake,” Mr. Ruddy said. “I don’t think the president’s base moves even one inch from him even if he doesn’t get a wall. They know where his heart is, they know where his mind is.”Michael D’Antonio, a biographer of Mr. Trump, said the wall appealed to the builder and brander in him. “I think he hears the beep, beep, beep of a cement truck backing up and the product being poured and the wall rising,” Mr. D’Antonio said. “He can grasp that stuff. He loves it.”It would be a presidential legacy that future generations could see and touch, an accomplishment that would last for ages. “I think he’d like it being called the Great Wall of Trump,” Mr. D’Antonio said, with a plaque to the president who built it “every mile or so.”The simplicity of the concept made it a powerful sales pitch on the campaign trail. “It’s a four-letter thing,” Mr. D’Antonio said. “It’s an idea that can be expressed in a single word, and I think that has great appeal to him as a marketer. It’s sort of ‘crooked Hillary’ or ‘lock her up,’ but it’s even better.”"
12,"The federal government wants to issue more visas for foreign workers to take temporary jobs in housekeeping, landscaping and other fields — even as President Trump seeks to seal off the border with Mexico, where most of those workers come from.The Departments of Homeland Security and Labor said they planned to issue up to 30,000 additional H-2B visas through Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year. Congress has generally capped the number of visas, which businesses compete for, at 66,000, divided evenly between summer and winter seasons.Only workers who had previously secured the visas would be eligible for the proposed additional ones.The visas provide legal status for immigrants in temporary nonfarm jobs with landscaping companies, restaurants, hotels and amusement parks, among other industries.Last fiscal year, about 75 percent of these visas were issued to workers from Mexico, according to State Department data. Visas were also issued to, among others, Jamaicans, Guatemalans and South Africans.Business groups regularly push lawmakers to raise or eliminate the cap on the number of visas issued, a demand that has increased as unemployment has dropped and domestic workers have become more scarce.The government’s move to expand the H-2B program appeared inconsistent with the Trump administration’s repeated message about a crisis on the southwestern border of the United States. On Saturday, Mr. Trump told a gathering of the Republican Jewish Coalition that “our country’s full.”“What can we do? We can’t handle any more,” he said. “Our country’s full. You can’t come in, I’m sorry.”Alex Nowrasteh, a senior immigration analyst with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said there were “a lot of contradictions” within the government’s proposals.“On one hand, we need more people because the economy is booming,” he said. “Then on the other hand, to say, ‘The country is full, go back’ — it’s impossible to reconcile those.”The H-2B visa program, which started in the mid-20th century, has been a feature of a persistent debate over using foreign workers for seasonal labor.Unions and immigration opponents argue that hiring H-2B workers suppresses wages and deprives Americans of jobs. Advocacy groups say foreign workers are often exploited, and employers say the cap encourages businesses to hire undocumented workers.Andrea Palermo, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, did not directly answer questions about what was behind the plan for additional H-2B visas. She also did not address questions about the apparent contradiction in the administration’s positions.“Congress — not D.H.S. — should be responsible for determining whether the annual numerical limitations for H-2B workers set by Congress need to be modified, and by how much, and for setting parameters to ensure that enough workers are available to meet employers’ temporary needs throughout the year,” she said.The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday.Mr. Nowrasteh said he favored the H-2B program. “I think the economic benefits from the H-2B visa are very large, the benefits to the workers are huge,” he said.Because businesses are required to show that no American workers want the jobs, the cap “makes no sense,” he said.“If they try to hire Americans, and Americans don’t want to do that job, then there should be no cap,” he said.Mr. Nowrasteh said he believed that H-2B visas for Mexican workers have helped drive down illegal immigration. He said expanding the program or eliminating the cap could also help reduce the number of undocumented immigrants from Central American countries.Last month a bipartisan group of senators, led by Susan M. Collins and Angus S. King of Maine, asked the Department of Homeland Security to increase the number of visas as a way to support small businesses in a tight labor market, especially those preparing for the summer season.“In the short run, many areas of our country simply lack the working-age population needed to meet the demand for seasonal jobs,” the senators wrote in a letter signed by 11 lawmakers. “In some industries, particularly tourism, we fear that the demand for workers so far outstrips the available supply that businesses could be forced to curtail operations, putting at risk the jobs of American workers who fill year-round positions at these establishments.”But Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports curbs on immigration, was critical of the program and said it enabled “businesses to avoid hiring people they’d rather not hire.”“A nation with a third of a billion spanning an entire continent, with 50 million working-age people not in the labor force, doesn’t need to be importing labor,” he said.Mr. Krikorian said the proposed expansion of the program was not “backtracking or flip-flopping” by the administration.“The president has always been a big fan of these guest worker visas,” said Mr. Krikorian, who noted that Mr. Trump’s properties, such as Mar-a-Lago, use this visa program to hire workers."

Michelle Goldberg makes the case for shunning administration officials who carried out the president’s cruel policies at the southern border. Ross Douthat thinks liberals need to reckon more fully with Barack Obama’s mixed legacy on immigration. And David Leonhardt worries that the Democratic Party lacks a clear and convincing agenda on legal and illegal immigration.Then, which of the lesser-known Democratic candidates are mounting the most credible campaigns for the highest office in the land? The columnists discuss Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s fresh face, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s “resistance” candidacy, Andrew Yang’s guaranteed-income proposal, Senator Cory Booker’s mass appeal and Senator Amy Klobuchar’s “Minnesota nice.”Background Reading:I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they all intersect. I’m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I’m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the “reasonable” elites. I’ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I’m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife.I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use “liberal” as an epithet, but that’s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump’s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I’ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian émigré who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.I’ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago — first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I’ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.My politics are left of center. But I’m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today’s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges — inequality, climate change, the rise of China — and they’ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.Tune in on iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, Stitcher or wherever you listen to podcasts.

14,"TIJUANA, Mexico — The government of Mexico said Friday that it disagreed with the Trump administration’s decision to roll out a policy that forces asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while they pursue their cases in the United States — but said it would take in some of the asylum seekers anyway.In a statement, the Mexican government said that it “does not agree with this unilateral measure implemented by the government of the United States” and outlined the conditions that it had negotiated since the Department of Homeland Security announced the plan a month ago.Roberto Velasco, a spokesman for Mexico’s Foreign Ministry, said it was “trying to respond to U.S. policy” with respect to the nation’s own immigration policy. “We’re making a sovereign decision to allow some people into Mexico with very clear limits based on what our laws and international commitments allow,” he said.The policy, which the Trump administration said Thursday it would begin to implement, marks an escalation in the administration’s attempt to rein in illegal immigration and a dramatic reversal of the decades-long practice of allowing applicants to request protection from within the United States or at official ports of entry, and to remain in the country while their cases wind through immigration courts.If applied to a majority of asylum applicants, it could potentially flood Mexican border towns like Tijuana with thousands more people seeking protection in the United States.Currently, most migrants who request asylum at the border are released within days with a notice to appear at an immigration court in the interior of the country for their proceedings, a practice that President Trump has derided as “catch and release.” It takes years for cases to advance through the courts. Only 20 percent of all asylum applicants ultimately win the right to remain permanently in the country. That figure is even lower, 10 percent, for Central Americans, who account for most of those requesting asylum at the border.Mexican officials said on Friday that they had held three meetings to discuss the proposal with their counterparts in the United States since it was first announced on Dec. 20, but that ultimately the Department of Homeland Security decided unilaterally to send the first returnees.Still, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico has said he would welcome migrants and promised to respect human rights while affording them economic opportunities here in Mexico. The migrants would be granted yearlong humanitarian visas to live and work in Mexico while they await court hearings on the American side. Those court hearings would have to be scheduled within the year, officials said.The Trump administration said the measure would curtail illegal immigration while remaining faithful to international law.“For far too long, our immigration system has been exploited by smugglers, traffickers and those with no legal right to be in the United States,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, on Thursday.The Department of Homeland Security said that the claims for those returned would be adjudicated within a year, with an initial hearing held within 45 days. But immigration courts are already clogged with 800,0000 pending cases, raising questions about whether this timetable can be achieved, experts said.The policy would apply both to some asylum seekers who try to enter the United States at border crossings and to those apprehended by the authorities after illegally touching United States soil.Historically, undocumented single men have represented the bulk of those arrested and subsequently removed from the county. But since 2013, unaccompanied children and families have arrived in ever-larger numbers.That influx of people was cited by a Department of Homeland Security fact sheet as justification for the policy. Children cannot be detained for more than 72 hours in border holding facilities, prompting the authorities to release their adult parents with them, and the fact sheet referred to a shift in the profile of immigrants reaching the border, “from a demographic who could be quickly removed when they had no legal right to stay to one that cannot be detained and timely removed.”Analysts and lawyers raised other questions about the program.Human rights groups questioned the ethics of sending people fleeing in search of safety back into Mexico, which itself is experiencing horrific violence. Politically, some have asked why Mexico’s new president would essentially agree to turn his country into a waiting room for American asylum seekers.The Mexican government has cautioned that the details of who would be returned and when were still unclear. But in its statement, the government said that it would not accept unaccompanied children or people suffering from health problems. Mexico has yet to agree to accept families, but opened the door for future discussions.Also unclear were the logistics of how the asylum seekers would be taken back into the United States for hearings, or how they might obtain legal counsel while waiting in Mexico.Lawsuits challenging the policy, which may expand to other border areas, are widely expected.Immigrant advocates criticized the administration for what they regard as a denial of due process to asylum seekers fleeing extreme violence or persecution in their home countries and making a harrowing trek to reach the United States.“Once again, the Trump administration is doing everything they can to sabotage the asylum process and harm those who come to us in need of protection,” said Betsy Fisher, policy director for the International Refugee Assistance Project in New York.They cautioned that the policy will imperil the lives of immigrants, including many families with children, stuck in encampments and shelters in Mexico. Already, asylum seekers are waiting months — during which some sleep outdoors — to put in their applications.“Whether in shelters or not, the families are sitting ducks for criminal organizations,” said Lee Gelernt, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who fought in federal court to reunite migrant parents and children who were separated during a border crackdown last year. Family separations were officially suspended in late June.César Palencia, who is in charge of migrant affairs for the city of Tijuana, said that the city had received no information from the Mexican government about the plan and was not ready to receive more migrants.Tijuana did not have the space to accommodate them or resources to incorporate them, and did not want to “convert itself into a kind of shelter” for these returned migrants, he said.The border city is already overwhelmed with Mexicans deported from the United States, who arrive at the rate of 120 people each day, as well as with migrants from Central America and other countries who have come seeking entry into the United States.Tijuana is still dealing with the aftermath of the last big caravan of Central American migrants. Of some 7,000 people who arrived in November, between 1,500 and 2,000 remained in Tijuana, he said. Another caravan of between 10,000 and 12,000 migrants is heading north from southern Mexico, many likely toward Tijuana.About 1,200 people are on a list awaiting an interview with United States immigration authorities to seek asylum. Their stay could extend to at least one year if they are returned to Tijuana to wait for a court decision after making a claim."
15,"[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]SAN YSIDRO, Calif. — It was never like this before.The migrants come now in the middle of the night or in the bright light of day. Men and women arrive by the hundreds, caked with dirt, with teens and toddlers in tow. They jump the small fences in remote parts of Texas, and they gather on the hot pavement at the main border crossing in California. Tired and fearful, they look for the one thing that they pray will allow them to stay in the United States, at least for a while: a Border Patrol agent.Gone are the days when young, strong men waited on the Tijuana River levees for their chance to wade across the water, evade capture and find work for the summer. These days, thousands of people a day simply walk up to the border and surrender. Most of them are from Central America, seeking to escape from gang violence, sexual abuse, death threats and persistent poverty. The smugglers have told them they will be quickly released, as long as they bring a child, and that they will be allowed to remain in the United States for years while they pursue their asylum cases.The very nature of immigration to America changed after 2014, when families first began showing up in large numbers. The resulting crisis has overwhelmed a system unable to detain, care for and quickly decide the fate of tens of thousands of people who claim to be fleeing for their lives. For years, both political parties have tried — and failed — to overhaul the nation’s immigration laws, mindful that someday the government would reach a breaking point.That moment has arrived. The country is now unable to provide either the necessary humanitarian relief for desperate migrants or even basic controls on the number and nature of who is entering the United States.The immigration courts now have more than 800,000 pending cases; each one takes an average of 700 days to process. And because laws and court rulings aimed at protecting children prohibit jailing young people for more than 20 days, families are often simply released. They are dropped off at downtown bus stations in places like Brownsville, Tex., where dozens last week sat on gray metal benches, most without money or even laces on their shoes, heading for destinations across the United States.At the current pace of nearly 100,000 migrants each month, officials say more than a million people will have tried to cross the border in a 12-month period. Some of those arriving today will have a strong legal case to stay under international refugee treaties and federal asylum laws, but most won’t have a formal asylum hearing until 2021.The flow of migrant families has reached record levels, with February totals 560 percent above those for the same period last year. As many as 27,000 children are expected to cross the border and enter the immigration enforcement system in April alone. So crowded are border facilities that some of the nearly 3,500 migrants in custody in El Paso were herded earlier this month under a bridge, behind razor wire.In recent days, officials have grasped for ever-more-dire ways to describe the situation: “operational emergency”; “unsustainable”; “systemwide meltdown.”One top official said simply: “The system is on fire.”For President Trump, the situation at the border has generated red-hot fury. It erupted again on Sunday as he abruptly forced out Kirstjen Nielsen, his long-embattled homeland security secretary, for what he considered her failure to put an end to the surge of migrants.In recent days, the president has landed on a dark new message that, if taken literally, could mean an end to all immigration — legal and illegal — across the Mexican border. “The system is full,” the president said in California on Friday, standing in front of the rusting iron slats of the border wall that he wants to expand for hundreds of miles across the country’s southern border. “Whether it’s asylum, whether it’s anything you want, it’s illegal immigration. We can’t take you anymore.”Yet, perversely, the president’s own anti-immigrant rhetoric has helped supercharge the pipeline of migrants from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Smugglers lately have been buying radio ads in Central America, warning that Mr. Trump is about to shut down all immigration. If you ever want to go to the United States, they say, go now! “They said they would take us by bus. We would be safe,” said Jeremias Pascoal, 16, who crossed into Texas earlier this month after paying $3,200 for a “guide” who showed his group to a road where he said they could surrender to the Border Patrol. Experts say the president is not wrong when he says that “legal loopholes” in America’s immigration system are partly responsible for encouraging migrants to bring children like Jeremias on a dangerous journey that in some cases ends in tragedy. In December, two migrant children died in Customs and Border Protection custody after becoming gravely ill during their trip. Officials warn that more deaths are likely.Christopher Cabrera, a vice president of the local union of Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas, pulled out his phone last week and scrolled through dozens of pictures he has taken out in the field: Groups of more than 100 people turning themselves in at night; seriously ill children huddled on the ground, being given medical aid.“The majority of our agents get sick. Infectious disease is everywhere,” Mr. Cabrera said, including in the Border Patrol’s migrant processing center. “There’s always scabies in there. Usually we have chickenpox. We have tuberculosis in there. You name it, it’s probably been through that building. So it’s dangerous. It’s dangerous for our agents. It’s dangerous for the detainees that don’t have anything.”But the president has not chosen to prioritize a surge of new resources to the border, which could help ease the overcrowding and suffering that have gripped the migrants and the border communities where they arrive. Instead, Mr. Trump has insisted on simply trying to stop people from getting into the country in the first place — a policy of deterrence that not only has failed but has made the problem worse.In an effort to send a “you’re not welcome” message, the administration has tried a series of strategies: prosecuting everyone who crosses illegally, taking their children from them, tightening asylum standards, slowing down the number of people allowed to apply for asylum each day, forcing asylum applicants to remain in Mexico while they wait for court dates. In some cases, this approach has proved too cruel for the American public to tolerate and has run up against the protections enshrined in the Constitution, which the courts have decided protect migrants as well as citizens. Some of the president’s agenda has been blocked by Congress or the courts. None of it has fixed the problem.To the contrary, these policies have forced migrants to divert from well-staffed border stations like the one in San Ysidro, Calif., where agents deliberately slowed down the number of migrants they would allow to cross each day, toward remote areas of West Texas and New Mexico, where the two migrant children died in December.And the administration has done little to speed up the immigration courts, though that could be just the deterrent the president has sought.“The backlog has been allowed to build to the point of a crisis,” said Doris Meissner, the immigration commissioner in the Clinton administration and now a fellow at the Migration Policy Institute. “They do not accept the basic proposition that this is a population where there are people qualified for protection and that enabling the systems we have is an answer.”In a series of international human rights agreements, beginning with the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, nations agreed to allow anyone to seek asylum, even if they entered a country illegally. The agreements defined a refugee as someone with a well-founded fear of persecution based on “race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.” Determining whether an applicant receives asylum was left up to individual nations, but in the United States, the international obligations and the standards for asylum were largely incorporated into American immigration law beginning with the Refugee Act of 1980.Only about 20 percent of asylum seekers ultimately win the right to live and work in the United States by proving that they would face persecution in their home countries. Just wanting a better job doesn’t qualify. Applicants have the burden to show evidence of past persecution or compelling testimony that establishes the “well-founded” fear that they would face danger if they return home.Some have won asylum, for example, by proving that their membership in a religious minority singles them out for harassment or threats. In the past, women suffering domestic abuse have qualified, as have some victims targeted by gangs. Generalized fear of violence does not qualify. Neither does poverty.The asylum process begins with a “credible fear” screening to see if an applicant is likely to succeed in the first place.Out of nearly 100,000 credible fear interviews during the year that ended in September of 2018, an asylum officer confirmed a credible fear 74,677 times — a nearly 75 percent approval rate. A senior Trump administration official vowed on Tuesday to dramatically reduce that rate by making the standards tougher. But it is what happens after the credible fear interview that is at the heart of America’s bitter immigration debate.In 2017, 11,292 immigrants who had been released on bond or on their own recognizance were ordered deported because they failed to show up for their immigration proceedings, a 26 percent increase over the previous year, according to Justice Department data. Blanca Vasquez, who fled Honduras after gangs killed her husband and torched their home, passed a credible fear interview at the border in 2013. She was released and settled in northern Texas, where she got a janitorial job and waited for her day in court. About a year later, she said, she unintentionally missed her first hearing and was most likely ordered deported for failing to appear.She’s not sure, because she stopped going to court at all. “I got confused,” she said. “I ask God to look after me. There are too many problems in my country; I want to stay here.”Maria Perez, a Honduran who joined a caravan with her 8-year-old son, Yunior, in November, waited two months in Tijuana for the chance to apply for asylum after her son’s father was killed by a man who continued to threaten her family. When her number — 1,506 — was finally called, she and her son were soon released to await their court hearings under the juvenile protection laws. She lives now with a friend in Northern California, but she does not have a lawyer and isn’t sure how to proceed with her case.“I am very worried. I don’t know what to do,” she said.Families like Ms. Perez and her son are the biggest targets of Mr. Trump’s fury. The president and his aides blame the nation’s immigration laws — the president derisively calls them “Democrat laws” — for creating an incentive for migrants to bring a child with them to improve their chances of getting into the United States. One of them is the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, a 2008 bill signed into law by President George W. Bush that requires immigration authorities to treat migrant children differently than they do adults. The other is a 1997 legal settlement in a case known as Flores, which prevents the government from holding children or families in secure detention facilities for longer than 20 days.It was trying to get around those legal limits that prompted the administration last spring to begin forcibly separating migrant children from their parents — detaining parents indefinitely while sending children to shelters and foster care. The fierce political backlash forced Mr. Trump to abandon that approach.The president’s most recent initiative was the one calling for many migrants to remain in Mexico for the months or years it could take for an American judge to hear their case; that policy, too, ran afoul of the courts when a federal judge in California blocked its implementation. For some migrants, the policy effectively meant no asylum case at all.Miguel Aquino, 29, who fled El Salvador in a caravan in October after being shot in the leg and hand by MS-13 gang members, waited for weeks in Tijuana to apply for asylum at the sprawling San Ysidro port, the biggest on the border. He was interviewed and sent back to Mexico to wait for a court date.In March, when he arrived for a preliminary hearing without an attorney, the judge gave him more time to find one — and sent him back to Mexico to wait. Mr. Aquino said he has called eight lawyers, and they all said they couldn’t represent him because he is in Tijuana. At this point, he is tired of waiting.“The next time, if I don’t go with a lawyer and they don’t give a clear answer,” he said, “I’m going to look for another way to get in.” Mr. Trump often says he plans to build a wall on the border with Mexico to halt illegal immigration. But when the standoff over funding for the wall led to a 35-day government shutdown in December and January, it actually made things worse. Many immigration judges were furloughed, and tens of thousands of deportation and asylum cases were delayed, in some cases for years. There is another problem with the wall: Slowing the exodus of migrants from Central America would need to start in those countries first.Central America’s economies are still weak, and residents face drug and gang violence at levels largely unseen in other countries. Many are subject to deep poverty, a situation that recently reached a crisis with the collapse of coffee, corn and maize crops. M.C., a 23-year-old Guatemalan woman who asked to be identified by her initials for safety reasons, received an anonymous letter recently in her hometown, San Marcos, warning her that she would be killed if she did not give the letter writers 65,000 Guatemalan quetzals, nearly $8,500.M.C., who is three and a half months pregnant, went to the police in San Marcos. Then she got a second letter, warning her to never go to the police again. After she received a third letter, she made the decision to leave for the United States.“I didn’t want to come here at first, but then I think it’s the best thing for the baby,” M.C. said as she sat in a migrant shelter in the South Texas border city of Brownsville. “Here, he’s going to grow without crime. He can go to school.”American diplomats say the best way to confront that kind of lawlessness is with the hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid that has been flowing to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras for several years, designed to bolster the rule of law and improve the economy.Last week, Mr. Trump abruptly abandoned those efforts, ordering the State Department to scrap about $500 million in aid to the three countries. Mr. Trump’s decision has been criticized by members of both parties, who call it shortsighted.Likewise, critics say that Mr. Trump’s repeated denigration of Mexico over the years — including his insistence on building a border wall — risks undermining Mexico’s willingness to help to keep Central American migrants from traveling to the United States.“This is the first Mexican administration that has even been oriented toward doing that,” Ms. Meissner, the Clinton administration immigration commissioner, said. But blaming other countries and painting those coming across the border from Mexico as a national security threat has never failed to animate Mr. Trump’s core supporters — the ones who helped deliver him the White House in 2016.“It’s an invasion,” Mr. Trump declared in February, after Congress denied him money to build a wall. “We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country.”In fact, the migrants are mostly victims of the broken immigration system. They are not, by and large, killers, rapists or gang members. Most do not carry drugs. They have learned how to make asylum claims, just as the law allows them to do. And nearly all of them are scared — of being shipped off to Mexico, separated from their children, sent to prison. Scared, especially, of going home.Zolan Kanno-Youngs and Caitlin Dickerson contributed reporting."
16,"Welcome to a special edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run weekly newsletter from The New York Times. Like what you see? Send this to a friend. If someone forwarded it to you, sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox.The surge in Central Americans seeking asylum in the United States is straining facilities across the Southwest border, with Border Patrol processing facilities this week handling thousands of people in excess of the system’s capacity. President Trump threatened to close the border next week if Mexico did not halt “all illegal immigration” into the United States.El Paso, the Texas border city where the president held a rally in February calling for his wall with Mexico, is emerging as a flash point. Border Patrol agents in the city have begun holding migrant families in an area under a bridge, surrounded by fencing and razor wire.Photos of the conditions drew attention this week on social media and in news reports. Here’s a look at where the migrants came from, and how they came to be detained under the bridge.Agents are apprehending about 570 migrants a day in the El Paso metropolitan area, up from about 100 a day five months ago. On some days last year, there were no apprehensions at all in the entire El Paso sector, which stretches across New Mexico and a swath of West Texas.The increase translates into a lack of space at processing facilities, so officials put up a large military tent under the Paso Del Norte International Bridge in what they describe as a temporary measure. The tent has bathrooms, blankets, water and food — but people appear to be miserable nonetheless.Stays in the encampment are said to vary from several hours to a couple of days, depending on the flow of migrants across the border. Some migrants are sleeping in cots inside the government tent, while others prefer to sleep on the ground outside.Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said at a news conference on Wednesday near the encampment that the country’s immigration enforcement system is at a “breaking point.”Political and business leaders in El Paso are expressing criticism over the Trump administration’s handling of the new influx. Many in the city, a Democratic bastion, had already disputed the president’s assertion that border fencing had cut crime in El Paso.In a news conference in El Paso on Wednesday, Mr. McAleenan announced that C.B.P. was temporarily reassigning up to 750 officers to places on the border that are grappling with the increased flow of migrants. But some of those in El Paso say the overall response has been haphazard.A sticking point is the Trump administration’s plan to spend $192 million on a new immigrant processing center in the city. Officials chose an old 400,000-square-foot Hoover vacuum plant for the site.But business leaders are questioning whether the manufacturing facility is the best place to process migrants in a humane way. Others claim that federal officials chose the site despite concerns over its proximity to schools, businesses and residential areas.In any case, the new center won’t be open until at least June.Mr. Trump has lashed out at Mexico’s government, claiming on Twitter that it was doing “nothing” to stop unauthorized migrants from reaching the United States.But the view in Mexico is more nuanced. In fact, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has already given in to some of Mr. Trump’s demands, breaking with decades of asylum practices in Mexico. (Read more about that here.)Mexican authorities have been blocking groups of migrants at some border towns, intercepting unaccompanied minors before they reach American soil and allowing the Trump administration to send more than 120 migrants to Tijuana to await decisions on asylum requests.Now Mr. López Obrador’s efforts to avoid a confrontation with Mr. Trump over the issue seem to be waning. The Mexican president said on Thursday that while he respected Mr. Trump’s position, the problem largely involved the United States and Central American countries.“I just emphasize that migration flows of Mexicans to the United States are very low,” Mr. López Obrador told reporters in Mexico City.“The Mexican is no longer seeking work in the United States,” he said. “The majority are inhabitants of our fellow Central American countries.”Border Patrol apprehensions remain well below their peak of 1.6 million in 2000. But apprehensions climbed to 467,000 in 2018, the highest level in six years. Mr. McAleenan said at his news conference on Wednesday that there were more than 12,000 migrants in United States custody at the beginning of the week. “As of this morning, that number was 13,400. A high number for us is 4,000. A crisis level is 6,000. 13,000 is unprecedented,” he said.The important thing to understand is that migration patterns from Latin America have undergone a big shift.Standing in contrast to previous migration surges, the latest one involves few single men from Mexico. Instead, as more Mexicans actually leave the United States than arrive as migrants, Central American families now account for the large majority of new arrivals.Whereas the Border Patrol could easily deport undocumented Mexicans, deporting Central Americans is more challenging. Most are arriving as family units applying for asylum, a process that can take months or years to evaluate. The federal government is letting many migrants go free each week because it lacks enough beds to hold them in family detention centers.“The situation has changed dramatically, and we’re responding to it the best we can,” said Ramiro Cordero, a Border Patrol spokesman in El Paso.[More migrants are crossing the border this year.

Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]Some of the children detained under the bridge in El Paso hide their faces in their hands, shielding themselves from the blowing dust. Behind the razor wire, families sit on gravel littered with paper cups, potato chip bags and torn Mylar blankets.“This place looks like a concentration camp and we’re not supposed to have that in America,” said David Casillas, 44, a disabled veteran who tried to donate baby food on Friday to the hundreds of migrant families peering out through the fence. Border Patrol agents turned him away.The makeshift encampment under the bridge, where immigration officials are detaining hundreds of migrants in a military tent with little hot food, was set up last week after the main border processing center in El Paso reached up to 400 percent of its capacity in the largest influx of migrants to the United States in years.Similar scenes are unfolding at border stations across the 1,900-mile frontier, where Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said last week that facilities had reached a “breaking point.”In McAllen, Tex., the Border Patrol’s processing center was holding 2,200 migrants on a recent day, well over the facility’s capacity of 1,500. “Were the conditions horrible? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I guess,” Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana, said after visiting the center last week. “I don’t think they were horrible, but by the same token it was gut-wrenching to see mothers and children sitting there in cages.”The Border Patrol has been facing a record influx of migrant families since fall, but in recent weeks the numbers have begun to escalate substantially, thanks to the annual surge before the arrival of the deadly summer heat.For months, the federal authorities knew that this spring was likely to set records, but only now is it becoming apparent how big the numbers will be. Apprehensions already dwarf the numbers of five years ago and echo those of the spring of 2014, when the arrival of the first migrant families from Central America transformed the nature of immigration along the southern border.“The current surge was totally predictable and the Trump administration chose not to prepare for it. Instead it launched a raft of harsh deterrence measures that were totally ineffective,” said Wayne Cornelius, a migration scholar at the University of California, San Diego.He and other critics said the administration had focused on measures to discourage migrants, including restricting their entry at border stations and requiring some asylum applicants to wait in Mexico while their cases are processed, instead of planning humane border reception facilities and working seriously to diminish the violence and poverty in Central America that is driving the migrations.The influx has stretched every government agency on the front lines, from the Border Patrol, whose agents encounter migrants after they cross, to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, whose officers normally process them for detention or release, as well as the Health and Human Services Department, charged with the care of children who come across the border without families.In response to the surge, hundreds of agents are being diverted from ports of entry, where they facilitate international trade, to help process migrants. Immigration officers are being redeployed to the border from duties in the interior, and the government is trying to quickly expand capacity at shelters that take in migrant children.Kirstjen Nielsen, the Department of Homeland Security secretary, said on Friday that the agency is setting up a “crisis-response effort.”“The system is in free-fall. D.H.S. is doing everything possible to respond to a growing humanitarian catastrophe while also securing our borders, but we have reached peak capacity and are now forced to pull from other missions to respond to the emergency,” she said.President Trump threatened on Friday to close the southern border next week, a day after he criticized Mexico and several Central American countries for not stanching the exodus.“If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States through our southern border, I will be closing the border, or large sections of the border, next week,” the president said on Twitter.Last week Mr. McAleenan reported that on Monday and Tuesday, the agency started the day with more than 12,000 migrants in custody. By Wednesday, that number had climbed to 13,400.“A high number for us is 4,000. A crisis level is 6,000. Thirteen thousand is unprecedented,” Mr. McAleenan told reporters in El Paso.In the 2018 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, nearly 400,000 migrants were apprehended at the border, a low figure compared with the peak of 1.6 million in 2000. But experts predict that arrivals this fiscal year could hit one million, a level not seen since the record numbers in the 1990s and early 2000s.This month alone, more than 100,000 migrants are expected to be apprehended at the border. “It is absolutely a crisis,” said Henry Lucero, the ICE field director for Arizona. “We don’t have the resources to deal with all these individuals.”Once a rare occurrence, encounters with groups of 100 or more migrants are now routine for immigration agents, who must round them up and transport them to a border station.Even as rising temperatures make crossings in the Sonoran desert more perilous, border agents intercepted 400 migrants traveling in families on a single day in Yuma, Ariz., recently. An additional 300 turned themselves in south of Nogales, Ariz.Mr. Lucero said that the agency has had to redeploy agents from fugitive operations, who normally track down immigrants inside the country who have committed serious crimes, to assist at the border.Meanwhile, released migrants are spilling onto city streets. Federal authorities have been dropping them off by the hundreds every day in McAllen, with city officials desperately trying to find them temporary accommodation.“It’s one thing to find a place for 300 people to sleep and it’s another thing to find a place for 1,100 people to sleep,” said Kevin Pagan, the city’s emergency management coordinator. “It’s like you take an average high school football game down here and ask everyone to come over to your house after.”But no city has been as stretched by the crush of arrivals in recent weeks as El Paso, where a new migrant processing center designed to accommodate families and children is unlikely to open before June.On Friday, the men, women and children packed in a pen beneath the international bridge that connects the United States to Mexico squatted on the ground, munching on sandwiches out of clear plastic bags while breathing in fumes from the cars above.“I’ve never witnessed people kept under such conditions,” said Eusebio Ruiz, 59, a construction worker from Midland, Tex., who stopped briefly while crossing the bridge to peer at the migrants below. “It gives me no pleasure to see this.”Customs and Border Protection officers wore blue surgical gloves and cloth face masks while standing on the perimeter of the fenced area where dozens of immigrants stood waiting to be processed.The agency’s officials have said that migrants are spending 24 hours or less under the Paso del Norte Bridge awaiting transfer to a more formal detention facility.But officials at Annunciation House, a local nonprofit that assists released migrants, said they were consistently hearing from families that they spent four or five days being processed by Customs and Border Protection.“The longest that I heard was five days under the bridge, with a 9-year-old daughter. Another woman who had four days under the bridge with her 4-year-old, and she just broke down crying talking about how horrible she felt sitting in the dirt and rocks with her,” said Taylor Levy, the legal coordinator for Annunciation House.The significant change in the composition of the migrants, from single Mexican men to Central American families and unaccompanied children has created unique challenges.Unlike Mexicans, they cannot, by law, be swiftly deported to their home country, and families also cannot be indefinitely detained because of rules limiting the incarceration of children to 20 days.Border infrastructure, largely designed for single males, has not adjusted to the demographic shift. The Border Patrol bolstered medical screenings after two children died in December. It has also received $30 million to upgrade the South Texas processing center and funding to construct the facility in El Paso.Ms. Nielsen, the Homeland Security secretary, sent a letter to Congress on Thursday describing the border crisis and measures to address it. She said that she intended to request emergency resources and the authority to deport unaccompanied children to their home countries, which is currently only legal for minors from Mexico because that country has a contiguous border with the United States.Authorities are working as quickly as possible to bolster capacity for migrant children, she said, but warned that “a potential overflow of children in D.H.S. custody represents our most acute humanitarian risk.”After closing down a desert encampment erected last year in Tornillo, Tex., which drew fierce criticism from human-rights activists, the government began to expand a temporary shelter in Homestead, Fla., which now houses more than 1,700 minors, up from 1,200 in January.“The volume of ‘vulnerable populations’ is unsustainable,” Ms. Nielsen warned in her letter. “Our system has been able to cope with high numbers in the past, but the composition of today’s flows makes them virtually unmanageable.”"
18,"President Trump delivered an address to the nation on Tuesday night from the Oval Office to make a broad-based public push for border wall funding.After his speech, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leaders, delivered a response from Capitol Hill.[Read our live analysis and fact checks of the remarks here.]The following are transcripts of both Mr. Trump’s speech and the Democratic rebuttal, as prepared by The New York Times.__________PRESIDENT TRUMP: My fellow Americans, tonight I’m speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.Every day, Customs and Border Protection agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country. We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country. America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation, but all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration.It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans. Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl. Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone. Ninety percent of which floods across from our southern border. More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we don’t act right now.This is a humanitarian crisis. A crisis of the heart, and a crisis of the soul. Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system.This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border. This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end. My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers. It’s a tremendous problem.Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the Department of Homeland Security. These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe. In fact, safer than ever before.The proposal from homeland security includes cutting edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband and many other things. We have requested more agents, immigration judges to process the sharp rise of unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy.Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support. Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home.Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier. At the request of Democrats it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It’s also what our professionals at the border want and need. This is just common sense.The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year. Vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress. The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.Senator Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other Democrats. They changed their mind only after I was elected president.Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis and they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation.The federal government remains shut down for one reason, and one reason only, because Democrats will not fund border security. My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation, but the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government.This situation could be solved in a 45 minute meeting. I have invited congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done. Hopefully we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes? They don’t build walls because they hate the people on the outside but because they love the people on the inside. The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized.America’s heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien, just came across the border. The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country. Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders.In California, an air force veteran was raped, murdered, and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history. In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor. In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl.Over the last several years I have met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration. I have held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief stricken fathers. So sad, so terrible. I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, and the sadness gripping their souls. How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask, imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken. To every member of Congress: pass a bill that ends this crisis. To every citizen, call Congress, and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border.This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve. When I took the oath of office, I swore to protect our country and that is what I will always do so help me god.Thank you and good night.__________SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI: Good evening.I appreciate the opportunity to speak directly to the American people tonight about how we can end this shutdown and meet the needs of the American people. Sadly much of what we heard from President Trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice. The president has chosen fear. We want to start with the facts.The fact is on the very first day of this Congress, House Democrats passed Senate Republican legislation to reopen government and fund smart, effective border security solutions. But the president is rejecting these bipartisan bills which would reopen government over his obsession with forcing American taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective wall, a wall he always promised Mexico would pay for.The fact is, President Trump has chosen to hold hostage critical services for the health, safety, and well-being of the American people, and withhold the paychecks of 800,000 innocent workers across the nation, many of them veterans.He promised to keep the government shutdown for months or years, no matter whom it hurts. That’s just plain wrong. The fact is, we all agree we need to secure our borders while honoring our values. We can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry. We can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation. We can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border. We can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings.The fact is, the women and children at the border are not a security threat. They are a humanitarian challenge, a challenge that President Trump’s own cruel and counterproductive policies have only deepened. And the fact is, President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage and stop manufacturing a crisis, and must reopen the government.Thank you. Leader Schumer.SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: Thank you, Speaker Pelosi.My fellow Americans, we address you tonight for one reason only. The president of the United States, having failed to get Mexico to pay for his ineffective, unnecessary border wall, and unable to convince the Congress or the American people to foot the bill, has shut down the government.American democracy doesn’t work that way. We don’t govern by temper tantrum. No president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down. Hurting millions of Americans who are treated as leverage.Tonight, and throughout this debate and throughout his presidency, president trump has appealed to fear, not facts. Division, not unity. Make no mistake, Democrats and the president both want stronger border security. However, we sharply disagree with the president about the most effective way to do it.So, how do we untangle this mess? Well, there’s an obvious solution. Separate the shutdown from arguments over border security. There is bipartisan legislation supported by Democrats and Republicans to reopen government while allowing debate over border security to continue.There is no excuse for hurting millions of Americans over a policy difference. Federal workers are about to miss a paycheck. Some families can’t get a mortgage to buy a new home. Farmers and small businesses won’t get loans they desperately need.Most presidents have used Oval Office addresses for noble purposes. This president just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration.My fellow Americans, there is no challenge so great that our nation cannot rise to meet it. We can reopen the government and continue to work through disagreements over policy. We can secure our border without an ineffective, expensive wall. And we can welcome legal immigrants and refugees without compromising safety and security.The symbol of America should be the Statue of Liberty, not a 30 foot wall. So our suggestion is a simple one. Mr. President, reopen the government, and we can work to resolve our differences over border security. But end this shutdown now.Thank you."
19,"The struggle in the abortion debate is, in many ways, a struggle over language.For example, I am pro-life. I strongly support rights and protections for mothers and children, including prenatal children, and other vulnerable populations. I want to see the laws of this country protect these people as well. In my view, this makes me pro-life. That’s why I use the phrase “prenatal child” where other people would say “fetus.”In the view of those people, and of mainstream news outlets, I am not pro-life; I am anti-abortion. This language allows critics to dismiss me and fellow pro-lifers as single-issue obsessives, which we are not.In recent years abortion-rights supporters moved from using neutral language like “autonomy” and “choice” toward using positive, stigma-defying language. Groups like Planned Parenthood now speak about “abortion care.” Oprah profiled activists who urge people to #ShoutYourAbortion. Billboards erected by abortion-rights supporters proudly say that abortion is a “family value.”Defying stigma is one thing. But the stakes of this debate are never higher than when we decide on language to describe the object of abortion.The New York Times editorial board, for instance, recently used the phrase “clusters of cells that have not yet developed into viable human beings,” in a discussion of rights being extended to a fetus in the womb, or what I call a prenatal child.Language like this ignores the fact that each of us once existed as “clusters of cells that have not yet developed into viable human beings.” It seeks to hide the fact that by the time most surgical abortions take place, a prenatal child has electrical activity in the brain and a beating heart.Other words and phrases used in the discussion about abortion seek to obscure this reality as well: “tissue,” “part of the mother,” “parasite,” “potential life.” Even the term “fetus” is dehumanizing. Outside of an abortion context, an obstetrician-gynecologist doesn’t generally speak to a mother about her fetus. She talks to her about her baby. Family and friends organize baby showers, not fetus showers. A mother-to-be has a baby bump, not a fetus bump. She is “with child,” not “with fetus.” It is not unusual for major news outlets, such as the BBC, to use the phrase “unborn babies” when they report on new prenatal surgical techniques.We have shifted our language in ways that hide the dignity of the vulnerable, in this instance and on issues far from the abortion debate as well. This is part of what Pope Francis calls “throwaway culture.” What he is describing is often connected with the excesses of consumerism, a culture in which human beings whose dignity is most inconvenient are discarded as mere objects. Such a culture requires the use of language that deadens one’s capacity to show concern for those who need it most.Pope Francis has saved some of his strongest language for condemning abortion. But he consistently applies his concern about throwaway culture to other populations. Rehumanize International, a pro-life group, has done research on how this culture affects different populations, including racial minorities, people with disabilities, older people, immigrants and refugees, enemy combatants and prisoners. The research has found tragic patterns in which marginalized populations are referred to as sub-humans, defective humans, parasites — and in the process become thought of as objects, things and products.The Trump administration’s forced separation of immigrant children from their parents is a classic example of using people as objects. The administration’s ill-conceived attempt to use the profound suffering of children to deter illegal immigration failed to respect these children as human beings deserving of care and respect, not objects to be used as a means to an end.As Bishop Daniel E. Flores of the Diocese of Brownsville, Tex., noted when the policy was first underway: “Children are not instruments of deterrence. They are children.”Throwaway culture has infected our attitude toward undocumented immigrants generally. We hire migrants for low-wage jobs, paying them less than minimum wage and refusing to pay overtime rates and standard benefits — while at the same time refusing them the basic dignity of human equality. Dehumanizing language gets us to this point. Political leaders and others dismiss migrants as “illegals.” Or as “swarms” of “undesirables” and “parasites.” Some even dismiss this population as “rapists” and “animals.”A genuine concern for justice for the most vulnerable — one directed at something other than advancing a particular political agenda — must resist throwaway culture across issues that transcend our crumbling right-left politics. People who are committed to justice for the most vulnerable will be on the alert for dehumanizing language intended to confirm biases and serve the interests of those who hold power over the weak.Doing so is particularly important at this moment. We are likely to see a newly intense debate over abortion at our newly constituted Supreme Court. If we are to avoid the hopelessly stale culture-war debates of the 1970s, then we must refuse the false choice between supporting vulnerable women and protecting vulnerable prenatal children. It will mean genuinely wrestling with the complexity of doing both. And it will mean engaging the arguments of our perceived opponents in good faith."
20,"CALEXICO, Calif. — The barbed wire overhead evokes danger and violence, but Maritza Hurtado cannot take it seriously. When the sharp coils were placed on top of the old border fence several months ago, running right along the main boulevard, she chalked it up to political propaganda from a White House that does not understand life along the Southwest frontier.“This is not a war zone,” Ms. Hurtado said from her tax and immigration consulting office in downtown Calexico, from which she can peer into Mexico. “I’ve had a business here for 30 years and we’ve never needed the barbed wire. Why now? To me, it feels as if I’m enclosed.”For nearly a year, President Trump has pointed with pride to a renovation project replacing two miles of border fencing in Calexico. He hailed it as “the start of our Southern Border WALL!” — to the great consternation of many of the town’s residents, who are wary of becoming the public face of a hard-line immigration policy that most here do not agree with. The attention the president’s tweet brought was surreal, in part because the construction replaced an unsightly stretch of steel fencing that was already there.Nationally, partisans and journalists began to debate whether the 30-foot-tall steel slats that make up the replacement barrier should be called a “wall” like the one Mr. Trump promised during his campaign. Others said it was just a “fence,” a distinction that has taken on great importance in Washington.Lost amid the battle over credit and semantics was how Calexico residents themselves felt about becoming characters in Trump-era political theater. For many, a sense of apprehension turned to anger when the military installed barbed wire on top of older border fencing, which runs through downtown.“This community is basically being used for political purposes,” said Ms. Hurtado, who served as the town’s mayor until December. “And it’s happening throughout these border cities that are just like ours.” She tried to remain diplomatic when television news crews asked her for comment about the barrier last spring, she said, to “avoid making more drama for this community that has nothing to do with the national problem.”But she said she felt incredulous over the administration’s insistence that the replacement fence is part of the wall: “Before we started this project here to do the replacement, Border Patrol came to visit us about three times to ask us to please participate in avoiding the drama. They came to say, three times, ‘You guys, just so you know, we’re starting this project, and it’s not the wall,” recounted Ms. Hurtado, a Democrat who did not vote for the president. “And then here comes Trump and says, ‘It’s the wall!’”[Read more about how the people who live on the border feel about the wall: ""We have other problems here that need fixing.""]The town has received a steady dose of attention from Trump administration officials since last spring. Vice President Mike Pence visited the barrier in April and said the administration was “committed to seeing the construction of a border wall.” In October, the Homeland Security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, visited to unveil a plaque crediting the president with the barrier.This month, the president tweeted again: “The Fake News Media keeps saying we haven’t built any NEW WALL,” he wrote, apparently in reference to the barrier in Calexico. “Below is a section just completed on the Border. Anti-climbing feature included. Very high, strong and beautiful! Also, many miles already renovated and in service!”Amid a continuing national debate about the border, which has resulted in the longest government shutdown in history, many in this town of 40,000 have struggled to reconcile ominous warnings they see projected from the White House about life on the border with their own experiences living in the quiet agricultural community 120 miles east of San Diego.Calexico has long celebrated its interdependent relationship with Mexicali, its sister city directly across the line; the two cities’ downtowns are bisected by pillars where the border lies. Shoppers from urban Mexicali, which has a population of about 1 million, are vital to Calexico’s small-town economy and cross to shop at large outlet stores on the American side. Americans head to the Mexican side on weekends for cheap health care, entertainment and concerts.“We’re right up against each other. Each city depends on the other,” said Hildy Carrillo, the executive director of the Calexico Chamber of Commerce, who like Ms. Hurtado did not vote for Mr. Trump. “The families are on both sides of the border. The businesses are on both sides of the border. And the education, the entertainment and the culture are on both sides of the border. Punto.”[Read about how charities are stepping in to help released migrants.]Rather than a border wall, residents here express enthusiasm for modernizing the Calexico West Port of Entry, which they hope will expedite traffic and allow for a fluid flow of business between the two sides. The number of legal northbound crossers each day, leading to hourslong lines, is astounding: about 20,000 pedestrians and up to 20,000 vehicles, according to the General Services Administration.Ground was broken in 2015 on the first stage of the renovation, a $121.9 million project completed in September 2018. Town officials are hopeful the second phase will be funded by Congress.“We have been waiting for that funding, for years, for our port of entry,” Ms. Hurtado said. “That’s been our struggle. We don’t need a wall. We’ve been struggling to get the money for the door.” The president’s previous threats to shut down the border had also concerned her. “We’re depressed and you’re going to kill us if you shut things down. It’s like, help us by knowing us, you know?”After Mr. Trump’s tweet about the “Border WALL!” Ms. Hurtado had T-shirts made and distributed. They read, “It’s Not A Wall.”The high volume of legal traffic does not mean that illegal border crossings do not happen here. The risk those migrants pose, however, and the characterization of the numbers who jump the fence is enormously overstated, Ms. Carrillo said.The real danger, many here said, lies in drug trafficking conducted through sophisticated tunnel systems built by cartels.During a drive through downtown Calexico, Victor Carrillo — Ms. Carrillo’s cousin and a former City Council member, mayor and county supervisor — pointed to a house where federal authorities found an expansive underground tunnel in 2016 that ran from the United States to Mexico. As he drove, Mr. Carrillo and a friend pointed to other areas where tunnels were found, where sink holes formed because of attempted burrowing and where the authorities suspect there could be new tunnels.“They’re everywhere. Every new apartment complex you see go up, you figure” there might be a tunnel there, Mr. Carrillo said.A wall, he pointed out, does not even begin to address that problem.The politics of the Imperial Valley are generally not with the president. The county gave Hillary Clinton 68 percent of the vote in 2016 compared with 27 percent for Mr. Trump. The 51st Congressional District, which runs along the southern border from the Arizona border to San Diego, supported the incumbent Democrat, Representative Juan Vargas, with 71 percent of the vote versus 29 percent for his Republican challenger. Eighty-four percent of Imperial County residents are Latino, according to 2018 data by the United States Census Bureau.That is not to say that there are not people here and in the broader Imperial Valley, which is a large agricultural region, who support the president’s policies. But in Calexico, it seems, few like to speak about it publicly. And even some of those who lean conservative have reservations about the president’s talk on immigration.John Renison, 70, an Army veteran and longtime Calexico resident who is a former City Council member and county supervisor, began his political career here in the 1990s as a Republican but is reluctant to identify with either party today. But he said the barbed wire running through Calexico is a distasteful statement, as is, he said, the president’s general rhetoric about immigration.“We do not have a crisis on the border. We are not in fear of being invaded like he said,” Mr. Renison said. “What’s really laughable is you think you’re going to stop illegal immigration by constructing walls and fences.”"
21,"Across the decade that preceded Donald Trump’s election, American politicians of both parties consistently tried to pass big, sweeping immigration bills that would legalize most of the country’s illegal population and increase immigration overall. These bills failed because of populist opposition, at first bipartisan (the resistance of a certain socialist senator from Vermont helped doom the 2007 effort) but increasingly simply conservative, and over time the conservative opposition developed a well-founded suspicion of Republican elites, whose plans on immigration always seemed to require ignoring their own base.This sense of betrayal was fertile ground for Trump, who used bigotry and bluster to sell himself to immigration hawks as a Republican who wouldn’t, indeed couldn’t, sell them out. You could trust him more than the Bushes and Rubios because he was willing to be disreputable, willing to give the finger to elite opinion, willing to play not only the tough guy but the bad guy. And you had to trust him, some hawks argued, because the Democrats had been radicalized on the issue and the hour was late; it was either Trump or a Californian future, in which waves of immigration transformed the entire United States into a one-party, Democratic-governed state.But the irony was that the populist resistance had already itself been reasonably effective in achieving some of the goals that Trump promised to pursue. Over the years when bipartisan elites were seeking the grail of “comprehensive” reform, they tried to appease skeptics with various forms of border-security spending, and this spending really did gradually harden the United States-Mexico border and make it much more difficult to simply slip across. Combine this with economic and demographic change in Latin America, and by the time Trump took office, border crossings had fallen by two-thirds since the presidency of George W. Bush.In this sense Trump was a lagging, not a leading, indicator. He represented the political triumph of an attitude that had already changed policy, albeit in piecemeal and only half-intentionally, and partially sealed the porous borders of 15 years before. And his chief proposal, the famous wall, would have been a (literal) extension of the existing border-security project rather than a radical addition.[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]This reality created an interesting opening, especially in Trump’s first year, for a different kind of comprehensive deal, between restrictionists feeling a little more secure in their position and immigration advocates feeling chastened by populist backlash. And there was even some evidence that the White House might be groping in this direction — toward reforms that would seek stability more than radical change, tilting the entire system away from low-skilled immigration and toward recruitment, and compromising between restrictionists and enthusiasts by trying to keep the overall immigration rate about the same.But that possibility has evaporated because of the second irony of immigration in the Trump era. Having inherited a border situation that was somewhat better than his rhetoric of crisis suggested, Trump has now been handed an actual crisis — a wave of Central American families claiming asylum, which has returned monthly crossings to their highest levels in a decade and overwhelmed the system for handling new arrivals.There is a sense in which this crisis vindicates immigration hawks, who warned from the late-Obama era onward that the immigration decline wasn’t necessarily permanent, that there could easily be another wave, that United States policy — particularly the Obama precedent of a tacit amnesty for child migrants — created specific incentives for families and children to come north.But those same hawks ended up electing a president whose signature immigration policy, more walls to deter border-crossers, has proved largely ineffective in dealing with an immigration crisis created by people surrendering to Border Patrol officers and asking for asylum.Nor does that president have the capacity to devise a more effective response, it seems, since any policy solution would require two negotiations. First, negotiation with Congress, to change asylum law to override the court decisions currently tying up the Trump White House’s attempts at deterrence — like the attempt to make Central American asylum petitioners wait out the process in Mexico. Second, negotiation with the Mexican government, to get more help discouraging migration on its side of the border. For a different president these tasks would be challenging; for Trump, they seem impossible.Hence the flailing on display this week, with the president purging his entire Homeland Security apparatus, in the hopes of finding somebody with the requisite toughness to succeed where the present staff has failed. Since “toughness” apparently means one of two things — returning to the cruelty of child separation or ordering Border Patrol agents to simply ignore asylum law themselves — it’s doubtful that this purge will produce anything except more unpopularity for Trump's policies, and more unsuccessful collisions with the courts.The flailing also absolves the Democratic Party, currently torn between radicalism and evasion on immigration, from actually having to propose a coherent alternative to the White House’s approach. If this sort of crisis were happening on President Hillary Clinton’s watch, it would create all kinds of political problems for the Democrats; as it stands, they can point at the man who once boasted of Washington that “I alone can fix it” and say, well, why don’t you?There is still some political peril here for liberals, who may be inclined to confuse the public’s distaste for Trump with a consensus for an open door (though that Vermont socialist is still willing to swat down calls for open borders). But the greater peril by far is for conservative immigration skeptics, for whom the Trump presidency is at risk of turning into a policy disaster.The attempts to increase deportation have been real enough, but they will be evanescent should Trump lose in 2020. The attempt to legislate sustained legal-immigration cuts has conspicuously failed. Someone in the administration is making deals behind the scenes to increase visas for low-skilled guest workers — one of the policies that hawks resisted for years in “comprehensive” bills. And the longer the current border crisis goes on, the more this White House’s most important legacy may be offering evidence that even Donald Trump, even Donald Trump, can’t really stop illegal immigration when enough people get the idea to bring their kids and come.For every conservative faction, supporting Trump was a gamble — do you reach for short-term victory, even though his incompetence and unfitness might cost you in the long run? The danger for immigration hawks is that the long run has already arrived."
22,"WASHINGTON — President Trump, facing a growing public backlash over the partial government shutdown, shifted course on Saturday and offered Democrats a deal: temporary protections for roughly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border.But the proposal, which Mr. Trump unveiled in a 13-minute address from the White House, appeared dead on arrival in the Capitol. Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected it even before Mr. Trump spoke, and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, denounced the offer as “not a compromise but more hostage taking.”With the shutdown entering its fifth week and polls showing a majority of the public blaming Mr. Trump, the president’s advisers have been searching for an exit strategy. Saturday’s speech grew out of talks that Vice President Mike Pence and the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, have had in recent days with lawmakers including Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader.The proposal was Mr. Trump’s first public offer to Democrats since the partial shutdown began nearly a month ago. It came after an acrimonious week of tit-for-tat politics, in which Ms. Pelosi told the president he could not deliver his State of the Union address in the Capitol until the shutdown was over, and the president retaliated by grounding a plane that was supposed to take Ms. Pelosi on a fact-finding mission to Afghanistan.In casting the plan as a compromise, the president sought to shift pressure to Democrats — who have repeatedly refused to give Mr. Trump any money for his border wall — to end the shutdown. But Democrats continued to insist they will not negotiate with Mr. Trump over border security until the government reopens.Over the course of his administration, Mr. Trump has repeatedly sought to curb both legal and illegal immigration. He has revoked Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S., which offers crucial protections for immigrants, for people from some Latin American and African countries. And he has moved to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, an Obama-era program that shielded the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation.In the deal he outlined on Saturday, Mr. Trump offered to restore T.P.S. protection for 300,000 people, and said he would allow 700,000 Dreamers to keep their protections for three more years in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier.“That is our plan,” Mr. Trump said. “Border security, DACA, T.P.S. Many other things. Straightforward, fair, reasonable and common sense with lots of compromise.” The proposal, Mr. Trump added, was intended to “break the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward.”The speech was the second time during the shutdown that the president addressed the nation about the immigration crisis. But unlike his first address, a prime-time broadcast from the Oval Office that leaned heavily on dark messaging about the dangers of crime and illegal drugs flowing across the border, Mr. Trump seemed on Saturday to soften his tone.He paired the address with his first naturalization ceremony at the White House, a move intended to underscore the idea that he supports legal immigration. And his language was markedly different; instead of insisting on the “big beautiful wall” he promised during his 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump took care to use the word “barrier” as well — and seemed to pare back his vision for it.Calling the wall “a powerful and beautifully designed see-through steel barrier on our southern border,” Mr. Trump said: “This is not a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea. These are steel barriers in high priority locations. Much of the border is already protected by natural barriers such as mountains and water.”Mr. Trump noted that he had adopted some Democratic proposals on border security. The president proposed $800 million for humanitarian assistance and $805 million for drug detection technology, in addition to funding for 2,750 more border agents and law enforcement officials and 75 new immigration judge teams.In her talking points, issued to Democrats, Ms. Pelosi said her party favored “new drug, weapons and contraband scanning technology at official ports of entry,” and “filling the more than 3,000 vacancies for customs officers.” Ms. Pelosi also intends to bring up legislation in the coming days that includes an additional $1 billion for border security, including $563 million for 75 new immigration judges and support staff.Even so, Democrats roundly criticized the president’s plan. They were particularly incensed that Mr. Trump’s offer extended protections to Dreamers and T.P.S. recipients that he himself revoked. And they said the deal was a nonstarter because it did not offer any permanent protections for Dreamers.“I think it’s simply more fake promises raising false hopes,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said. “It will fool few Americans because it’s neither serious nor credible as a real remedy for Dreamers.”Some on the right also pushed back, describing the proposal as amnesty. James Carafano, a national security expert at the Heritage Foundation who worked on Mr. Trump’s transition, was among the critics. “Amnesty encourages further illegal immigration, incentivizes the tragedy of human trafficking and undermines our citizens’ confidence in the rule of law,” he said.Mr. Pence, briefing reporters after Mr. Trump’s remarks, said the speech reflected a painstaking process of listening to lawmakers, including rank-and-file Democrats who made it clear they believed that protections for DACA and T.P.S. recipients must be included in a border security deal.And he pushed back forcefully against critics like Mr. Carafano who said the measure amounted to an unacceptable amnesty for undocumented immigrants.“There is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal,” Mr. Pence said.But that was one reason many Democrats considered it unacceptable. Other senior administration officials made it clear that part of Mr. Trump’s strategy was to try to drive a wedge within the party between those who want to hold out for a much more generous solution and those who may feel enough political pressure to end the shutdown that they will feel obliged to support it.Noting that Tuesday is the deadline for the government to reopen in time to prevent federal employees from going a second consecutive pay period without a check, Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, said Senate Democrats had a tricky decision to make. He also noted that the president’s ability to declare a national emergency was “absolutely” still a tool available to Mr. Trump to find funds to build the wall if a legislative agreement could not be reached.Now it will be up to Mr. McConnell to put legislation incorporating Mr. Trump’s proposal on the Senate floor.Mr. McConnell — who has insisted he will not put any legislation on the floor unless the president will sign it — spoke to Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner and Mr. Pence on Thursday night about finding a way forward.Mr. McConnell told the president that before he could bring up legislation on the Senate floor, he needed a “public reassurance” that Mr. Trump would sign it, one person close to the talks said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions.The president’s proposal “strikes a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle,” Mr. McConnell said in a statement after Mr. Trump’s speech.If Mr. McConnell does indeed put a bill on the floor, as the president said he would, Senate Democrats will have to decide whether to block it or let it come up for a vote. Despite Democrats’ vow to reject the measure, it could create an opening for negotiations between the two sides.The shutdown stalemate is creating increasing nervousness on Capitol Hill, especially among Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states. One of them, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, is among only a handful of Republicans who have broken with the president and called for the government to reopen without a border security deal.On Saturday, she praised the president, saying she hoped that Mr. Trump’s offer would “lead to constructive debate that will end this impasse.”White House aides and allies of Mr. Trump said Saturday that Mr. Trump succeeded in ratcheting up the political pressure on Ms. Pelosi, especially if the Senate succeeded in passing a bill.“The Democrats’ talking points have been that the president is solely responsible for shutting down the government,” Marc Short, the former White House legislative director, said. “This puts more onus on them to come back and say why this proposal is insufficient.”But one reason Democrats are so leery of the deal is that they have been down this road with the president before. Last year, Mr. Trump and Mr. Schumer negotiated $25 billion in wall money for a pathway to citizenship for the Dreamers. But that deal fell apart when hard-line White House advisers persuaded the president to back away.The standoff over the shutdown, some former aides noted, was the first time Mr. Trump has had to engage in meaningful, high-stakes negotiations. But even that has come as a last resort, in what some have likened to negotiating out of desperation after failing to score political points."
23,"(Reuters) - Grappling with a ballooning number of migrants at the U.S. southern border, President Donald Trump has suggested increasingly bold steps to fulfill his signature campaign pledge to stem illegal immigration. Yet many of his administration's ideas have been hindered by legal, practical and political obstacles. Meanwhile, the flow of migrants seeking asylum or a better life in the United States continues to swell. By March, the number of illegal entrants into the country had surged to the highest level in more than a decade. On Wednesday, the acting director of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan visited the Texas border to underscore the administration's concerns about a growing crisis. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed Thursday that the agency would set up two temporary tent facilities in Texas to process migrants, each with a capacity to hold up to 500 people. Such camps have been criticized by Congress members for holding migrants too long and not providing adequate places to sleep or shower. The president, whose statements and tweets suggest a rising level of frustration, recently cleaned house at the Department of Homeland Security, firing Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and several other high-ranking staff. He has vowed to move in a ""tougher direction."" But a look at several significant Trump Administration ideas or policies shows the difficulty the president faces in trying to reverse the tide of migration, which today is largely driven by poverty, corruption, crime and other factors in Central America.Some examples of administration proposals or policies that have run, or may run, into trouble:DETAIN ASYLUM SEEKERS INDEFINITELY U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Tuesday issued a ruling that allows asylum seekers who cross the border illegally to be held without bond as they challenge their deportation – a decision affecting perhaps tens of thousands of migrants. It was the latest move by top justice officials seeking to reshape legal precedent in the country's U.S. immigration courts.(See graphic here on such actions: https://tmsnrt.rs/2XmGDDg) Rights groups have already threatened to sue over the measure - which goes into effect in 90 days - and as a practical matter, additional detention space would be needed, requiring funding from Congress. Until that happens, many migrants are likely to continue to be released with an order to appear in court. SEND IMMIGRANTS TO SANCTUARY CITIES Earlier this month, Trump proposed sending ""an unlimited supply"" of immigrants who are fighting deportation to so-called sanctuaries - the hundreds of cities, counties and states where law enforcement limits its cooperation with Trump's crackdown on immigrants living in the country illegally.Immigration experts said it would be costly to transport migrants from the border and would require shifting funds from Border Patrol and other operations. In addition, the migrants would be free to move elsewhere once released. CLOSE THE BORDER WITH MEXICOThe administration recently backed off a threat to shut the southern border, one of the busiest in the world, amid opposition from Democrats as well as often Republican-friendly business groups. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, called the idea an ""economic calamity."" MAKE ASYLUM SEEKERS WAIT IN MEXICOOne of the boldest proposals by the Trump administration has been to tap a little used clause in immigration law to send hundreds of migrants who ask for asylum in the United States back to border towns in Mexico to wait months - or potentially years - for their cases to be resolved in U.S. courts.Local Mexican officials say their towns are already overwhelmed with migrants who have nowhere to live and few job prospects, while immigration advocates say those who are stuck in Mexico often have trouble finding lawyers and receiving proper notice for their U.S. hearings. A federal judge ordered a halt to the policy but an appeals court said it could continue while the administration appeals.DETAIN MIGRANT CHILDRENThe current wave of migrants includes many more families, as opposed to the single men who flocked north in the past. That has caused the administration to take another look at a 1997 agreement, known as the Flores settlement, that strictly limits detention of children.The administration has said repeatedly that t wants to scrap the legal deal and propose new regulations. It is unclear where - and with what funding - the government would detain the youngsters. Legal challenges to this proposal have been in the works from the moment it was announced.

24,"TAMARAC, Fla. — A Florida man unleashed threatening rants over the phone against three Democratic members of Congress, as he raged against gun control, illegal immigration, homosexuals, black people and Muslims, authorities said.John Kless, 49, was arrested Friday and charged with making threatening communications, the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a news release.Kless called the Washington offices of Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey on Tuesday and left profanity-laden voicemails for each politician, a federal criminal complaint said. Swalwell and Booker are both running for president.The messages specifically mentioned the elected officials being killed.""The day you come after our guns ... is the day you'll be dead,"" Kless said in his message to Swalwell, authorities said. Swalwell has focused much of his presidential campaign on gun control.Messages left for Tlaib and Booker seemed to reference a recent viral video shared by President Donald Trump that purports to show Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a Muslim, being dismissive of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Democrats have criticized the video, with some accusing Trump of purposefully trying to incite violence against Omar.""You definitely don't tell our president, Donald Trump, what to say,"" Kless said to Tlaib, according to officials.Investigators traced the phone number back to Kless, who lives in Tamarac, Florida, the complaint said. U.S. Capitol Police previously investigated Kless for a message left in February for Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Swalwell tweeted his thanks Friday to the Capitol Police for protecting his staff and constituents.Court records didn't list an attorney for Kless."
25,"(Reuters) - The Trump administration lost a court bid on Thursday aimed at striking down California's ""sanctuary"" statutes that prevent local law enforcement from helping the U.S. government's crackdown on illegal immigration.(graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2XmGDDg) The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco largely affirmed a July ruling from a lower court, which had found the California laws do not conflict with federal immigration rules.The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.California's Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement, ""We continue to prove in California that the rule of law not only stands for something but that people cannot act outside of it.""Scores of Democrat-controlled cities and counties have adopted policies to limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, making them a target for President Donald Trump. He recently suggested he would send an ""unlimited supply"" of migrants in the country illegally to sanctuary cities.The Trump administration has also tried to deny public safety grants to some sanctuary cities, a policy that has been generally blocked by federal courts.The California laws prohibit private employers in the state from voluntarily cooperating with federal immigration officials and bar local law enforcement from sharing information about the release of illegal immigrants from custody.The appeals court reversed the lower court regarding a part of a third law, which empowers the California attorney general to monitor conditions in immigrant detention facilities. The Court of Appeals said the requirement that an inspection of the circumstances surrounding the apprehension and transfer of an immigrant discriminates against the federal government.The Court of Appeals directed the U.S. District Court in Sacramento to review that part of its ruling.The case stems from a March 2018 lawsuit by the Department of Justice, which contended that the laws violated the U.S. Constitution.

26,"EL CENTRO, Calif. — Donald Trump was on the television, but no matter. Ferdinando Galeana’s customers were watching their plates, not the president.As Mr. Trump delivered an ominous State of the Union address from Washington, which warned repeatedly about the dangers along the southwest border, Mr. Galeana dutifully tended to orders of tacos, horchata and micheladas at D’Poly, the Mexican eatery his family runs here about 10 miles from the Mexican border. What the president was saying on the screen behind him, said Mr. Galeana, would not help his small business, his family or his five dozen employees.“What we need here is someone to help people looking for jobs,” said Mr. Galeana, whose wife and American-born children work with him at the restaurant. “The things he says, they make me laugh.”Residents of El Centro and several other towns along the California-Mexico border have watched with curiosity and apprehension in recent years as the president has escalated his calls for a wall along the southwest frontier. Mr. Trump repeated his warnings about such perils again Tuesday.“Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis,” Mr. Trump said during his speech, delivered not long after a bitter impasse over funding for a border wall that shut down the government for 35 days. “Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our very dangerous southern border.”[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]On a busy Tuesday night at D’Poly, patrons occasionally glanced at the screen that played the president’s address to the nation. Most paid it no mind at all. Mr. Galeana and others said they had largely tuned out what the president has to say because, too often, his rhetoric is disconnected from what their communities really want. They have struggled to reconcile the president’s warnings about threatening conditions on the border with their own experiences living in this quiet, largely agricultural hamlet.“What he’s saying on the news is different from what we’re seeing here,” said Cecy Magallanes, 45, who is originally from Mexicali, not far across the border in Mexico, and works as a school bus driver.She said Mr. Trump’s previous calls for a border wall seemed “like a strategy to get votes.”“His wall — always his wall,” added Cesar Salas, Ms. Magallanes’s husband, shaking his head.Located on El Centro’s Main Street, D’Poly and its clientele embody the biculturalism of border towns across the Southwest. Farm workers, white-collar professionals, big families and off-duty Border Patrol agents congregate here for tacos, sopes and flavored juices. Modern and minimalist, the restaurant’s gray walls and dark wood floors could be the backdrop of an elegant Crate and Barrel photo shoot — save for an arresting pink mural of Frida Kahlo that instantly sets the room apart. Flashes of pastel pop from behind a tiled bar, which includes a display of “Dia de los Muertos” statuettes.[Read: State of the Union Fact Check: What Trump Got Right and Wrong]English and Spanish are heard virtually interchangeably at table after table. Latin pop plays in the background, songs like “Dónde Estarás” by the Mexican electrocumbia musician Raymix.Mr. Galeana, who owns the restaurant along with his wife, Teresa, said he and his family decorated with the idea of showcasing Mexican culture in a modern setting, a concept that “so often is lost” in Mexican restaurants in favor of stereotypical décor like sombreros.“Our idea was to show that Mexico is not just what the stereotypes say: It’s so much more,” he said. “We are proud of our culture, and we want to show that.”That is what many of those here say they wish the president understood: Immigration and cross-national exchanges are celebrated in these towns along the border.Hildy Carrillo, the executive director of the Calexico Chamber of Commerce, has been sharply critical of President Trump’s immigration policies. She watched with exasperation last year when Mr. Trump called the replacement of the town’s border barrier “the start of our Southern Border WALL!” She said she feared the president’s remark would turn Calexico into an anti-immigration symbol and make it seem unsafe.For that reason, Ms. Carrillo, a Democrat, chose not to watch the speech Tuesday — “one of the few I’ve ever missed,” she said. She went shopping instead, she said, because “I refuse to get stressed out having to listen to him.”Such frustrations are frequently expressed in towns along the southwest border, which spans nearly 2,000 miles from California to Texas. Public officials from El Paso took to social media after Tuesday night’s speech to accuse the president of intentionally misleading the public after he said a border barrier had turned around high crime rates in the city. “Simply put, walls work and walls save lives,” Mr. Trump said.“He lies. @POTUS is once again lying and using the #SOTU address to spread falsehoods about our beloved city of El Paso,” Representative Veronica Escobar, a Democrat who represents El Paso, said on Twitter.A fact check by The El Paso Times on the matter, prepared in January but circulated heavily again on Tuesday night, found the city’s crime rate peaked in 1993, but by 2006 had sharply declined to its lowest level in decades. Construction on the border fence that Mr. Trump appeared to reference began in 2008.The paper also pointed out that, before the Bush-era fence was approved, El Paso and Ciudad Juárez had been separated by a border barrier for decades.Before the speech on Tuesday, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, a Democrat, denounced “the president’s charade of border fear-mongering” and ordered the withdrawal of most National Guard troops stationed at the border in her state.Many people living along the border, including Mexican immigrants, say they understand the desire for strong border security. But in conversations here in El Centro on Tuesday, even those who agreed with some of the president’s positions were quick to point out that his statements about immigrants, and Mexicans in particular, made them disinclined to support him.Aleyda Montejano, 21, who is Mexican-American, lives in the town of Imperial but goes to hairstyling school in Mexicali because it is less expensive. She said that she agreed with the president that there needed to be a deterrent to illegal immigration. But she said that message was difficult to separate from his tone.“The way he talks about Mexicans, I just don’t agree with it,” she said. “The reason people come here is to have a better life. But, about the border, there are some people that cross illegally and that’s not right.”Brian Arturo Posada, 19, an American citizen who grew up in Mexicali, said that he was sympathetic to some of the things Republicans in Washington talk about, like preventing abuse of social benefits such as unemployment insurance. But he said the president’s tone in past speeches too frequently crossed the line when he talked about immigrants and Mexican laborers.“The only thing that really I didn’t like was when he said all Mexicans are gangsters,” he said. “That’s not true, it’s not true. And when he was keeping those kids in jails, that made me really mad.”Meanwhile, several Mexican laborers in the region said they fear that the president’s warnings about immigrants and crime exacerbates discrimination against them.Cristina Bejarano, 34, a Mexican laborer who picks cilantro and lives in Calexico, about 12 miles south of El Centro, said that life for her and other immigrants in the region can be difficult because of the nature of farm work. But she said she moved to the United States two years ago because, even if farm labor is backbreaking, her life and prospects are better here than in Mexico.She said she wished President Trump and others could understand that.“A lot of people haven’t had a chance to meet any Mexicans,” Ms. Bejarano said. “They say we’re all criminals when we’re not. Just because we’re brown doesn’t mean we’re dirty.”"

If someone forwarded it to you, sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox.By Manny Fernandez in Donna, Tex.It’s springtime on the border, and that means the winter season is winding down — the months when tens of thousands of retirees from Minnesota, South Dakota, Illinois and other parts of the Midwest adopt South Texas as their home away from home.Retirees in swimsuits ride their bicycles to the pool, bright noodles tucked under their arms like jousting lances. They line the streets for golf-cart parades. They venture into Mexico, shopping for cheap medicine, getting pedicures, undergoing low-cost dental work and sipping goblet-sized margaritas.They are known as Winter Texans, and they concentrate mainly in the Rio Grande Valley, the temperate region deep in South Texas that is also the place where the largest number of migrants has been crossing lately from Central America — President Trump has declared a national emergency along the border and stationed Army troops to help control the escalating influx. One of their base camps was a quarter-mile from where seniors at the Victoria Palms resort in Donna deploy by the dozens to occupy five pickleball courts.The annual invasion of Midwesterners — and a number of Canadians — has decreased in recent years, but they remain an economic and cultural force. An estimated 106,000 Winter Texans spent about $528 million in the valley in the 2017-18 winter season, according to a survey by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Tex-Mex restaurants fly welcome banners for them. There are Winter Texan newspapers, age-qualified RV parks, expos, cruises, theater productions and bumper stickers — one pickup truck in the border city of McAllen had two: “Iowa Winter Texan” and “I’m retired. Go around.”“It gets me out of the snowbanks,” said Dean Miller, 58, a resident of Detroit Lakes, Minn., who spends the winter living and working at the Winter Ranch resort in Alamo. “You’ll go to some event down here and you’ll find your neighbor from back home.”The majority of Winter Texans are white and in their early 70s. Many of them voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, and their very presence this winter quietly subverted the president’s assertion that the border is in crisis. They have been coming to the region for years — in some cases, their parents were Winter Texans, too — and the political dynamics and national-emergency rhetoric has no effect on how, or where, they spend their retirement.“We don’t see what you see on TV,” said Terry Goss, the general manager of Victoria Palms, one of the largest Winter Texan communities, with up to 2,500 retirees.What do Winter Texans see, exactly?A slice of border life that looks nothing like what many Americans think of as border life. There was Nathan’s fourth annual Sock Hop at Ranchero Village in Weslaco one Friday. There were fish frys and riverboat tours, line dancing and karaoke sessions, bluegrass acoustic jams and nondenominational church services. At the Winter Ranch resort in Alamo one Monday afternoon, the Winter Ranch Players packed the house with three one-act plays, “The Ethel and Albert Comedies.” At Victoria Palms, Mr. Goss spoke standing next to a poster listing all the sold-out shows at the resort’s ballroom, one of them a Rolling Stones tribute band concert. Victoria Palms is so popular with Canadians that a Victoria Palms reunion is scheduled most summers near Toronto.Margaret Hitzemann, 63, who normally lives in Onamia, Minn., spent the past two months in a townhouse in Port Aransas, near Corpus Christi. One rainy afternoon, she and her husband visited the Mexican tourist town of Nuevo Progreso. They bought crispy chapulines — crickets, a fried delicacy — and went into a pharmacy to buy some cheap medicine.“We don’t take a lot of meds, so we were thinking, ‘Oh, let’s go down and get some cheap Tylenol and Advil and that kind of thing,’” Ms. Hitzemann said. “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, this isn’t any cheaper than Walmart.’ So we ended up not buying any medications.”In a region with a large Latino population and tolerant attitudes toward immigration — many people have family members on both sides of the border — culture clash with the Northerners is inevitable. The study released by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley included unedited messages from Winter Texans to local officials, and some of the sharpest comments read: “Be more American, less Mexican. This is not Mexico!” and “Have channel 5 respect Mr. Trump” and “Keep the grass cut, the trash picked up and speak English.”Already, the exodus back north has started. The end of the season for many comes on Thursday, with the annual Winter Texan appreciation day in Nuevo Progreso.For some, the season never ends. There are Converted Texans, former Winter Texans who settle in the valley for good. Kristi Collier, a McAllen native who runs a media and hospitality company that caters to Winter Texans called Welcome Home, Rio Grande Valley, hosts an annual Converted Texan Fiesta in April. (She leads a swearing-in ceremony.)Among the ranks of the converted are Ken and Lois Lane, originally from Anchorage, who started spending winters at Victoria Palms in 2005. They now live there permanently in a double-wide mobile home.“I think the cost of living here is very reasonable, compared to many other places,” said Mr. Lane, 73, a retired power dispatcher for an electrical company.He and his wife visited Nuevo Progreso and hosted their son and his family from Iowa over spring break.

28,"TIJUANA, Mexico — A new Trump administration policy forcing certain asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases are processed in the United States took effect on Tuesday, when American officials ushered the first such migrant through a Southern California border gate into northern Mexico.The migrant, a 55-year-old man from Honduras, had applied for asylum in the United States after crossing the border from Mexico. Under the new policy, he will live in Mexico temporarily, returning to the United States only for court dates pertaining to his case.Dressed in a brown jacket and black cap, he looked dazed as he emerged late Tuesday morning on the Mexican side of the border in Tijuana and was swarmed by scores of reporters, photographers and television cameramen.“I’m very tired,” he mumbled before being quickly spirited away in a van by Mexican migration officials.The new policy, first announced in December by Trump administration officials, is a dramatic step in what they cast as an effort to rein in asylum fraud and illegal immigration. It represents a major shift from a longstanding practice that permitted most migrants who requested asylum to go free in the United States while they awaited the outcome of their cases.American officials said that under that policy, many asylum applicants would never show up for their court dates and would simply vanish into the interior of the country.If the policy is applied to a majority of asylum applicants on the Mexico-United States border, it could result in thousands more migrants flooding Mexico’s border states every year.Mexican officials said that while they disagreed with the Trump administration’s new policy, they have agreed to take in certain asylum seekers and vowed to protect the migrants’ human rights and allow them to work in Mexico while their cases unfold in the United States.Rodulfo Figueroa, an official with Mexico’s National Migration Institute, said the man in the brown jacket, whose name was not revealed, would be the only migrant returned to Mexico on Tuesday under the new policy, but that more are expected soon.“We’re just reacting to a unilateral decision,” said Mr. Figueroa, a top federal migration official in the Mexican state of Baja California.Since the Trump administration’s announcement of the new asylum policy, Mexican officials have been negotiating with their counterparts in Washington to define the conditions under which they would accept the migrants.On Monday night, Tonatiuh Guillén López, the commissioner of Mexico’s National Migration Institute, said Mexico would only accept migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras between the ages of 18 and 60. He also said that Mexico would only receive returned asylum seekers through the border crossing that connects Tijuana with San Diego, California.The returned asylum seekers will be granted special four-month, multiple-entry visas that would allow them to travel to the United States for their court dates and then once again return to Mexico, Mexican officials said. Some of the returnees will already have one-year humanitarian visas which allow them to work and travel freely in the country. Asylum cases in the United States can take years to resolve, yet it remained unclear whether and under what terms the Mexican visas would be extended.The American policy change applies to some asylum seekers who try to enter the United States at official crossings on the country’s southern border, or are apprehended on American soil after trying to cross illegally. But it will not apply to Mexican asylum seekers who might risk harm if returned to Mexico, the very place where they are claiming fear of persecution as grounds for their asylum claim.Migrants’ advocates and human rights groups have vociferously criticized the American policy shift, saying Mexico, which is suffering historic levels of violence, is not a safe place to send people who already fear for their lives. In addition, Tijuana and other border towns are already overwhelmed with migrants deported from the United States as well as migrants from Central America and elsewhere seeking to enter the country.In meetings in recent days, American immigration officials have assured advocates that the returns would be conducted in close coordination with Mexican officials, who will preapprove all returnees. For now, the officials said, only single adult males in good health would be sent back to Mexico.While the Mexican government has claimed that the policy implementation was a unilateral American move, the United States immigration officials, from the Customs and Border Protection agency, assured the advocates that they had been working with their Mexican counterparts at all levels for months and would continue to be in daily contact for at least the next 30 days while the program was gaining speed.American advocacy groups are expected to file legal challenges to the new policy in the coming days, after gathering evidence from its rollout.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico has said he wanted to welcome migrants and foster employment opportunities for them, and he has begun to follow through on his promises, encouraging immigrants to stay and work in Mexico by making it easier to get visas and promoting job-creation strategies.Some asylum seekers who had just arrived in Tijuana were surprised to hear on Tuesday about the new American asylum policy.Anabel España, 39, a Honduran migrant who hoped to apply for asylum in the United States, said that staying in Mexico for many months was never her plan.“We don’t know what can happen to you here, if you will be kidnapped,” she said. “Tijuana is not exactly the safest place, you know?”But Ms. España, who said she had fled extortion threats in Honduras, said at least she could work and wouldn’t be held in a detention center in the United States.“At least here we are free,” she said."
29,"ALPHARETTA, Ga. — At the beginning of the year, 21 Savage was at his commercial apex. His second album, “I Am > I Was,” spent two weeks atop the Billboard album chart. “Rockstar,” his collaboration with Post Malone, was nominated for two Grammys, and he was set to perform at the ceremony.But now he has a new, perhaps even higher-profile public role: To his supporters, he’s a possible martyr of conscience, under fire for his choice to express his political views in his music.A week before the Grammys, 21 Savage was arrested in Atlanta and put into removal proceedings by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which said he was an “unlawfully present United Kingdom national” and charged him with overstaying his visa. A week and a half later, he was released on $100,000 bond.21 Savage — birth name She’yaa bin Abraham-Joseph — was, unknown to most, born in London in 1992, and an undocumented immigrant in the United States. That alone makes him vulnerable to removal by the immigration authorities.But in an interview earlier this month, two of his attorneys — Dina LaPolt, his general counsel, and Charles Kuck, his immigration attorney — proposed that there might have been political motivations at play.Three days before 21 Savage’s arrest on Feb. 3, LaPolt was already putting an action plan in motion. “We had heard that they were looking at him,” she said.In late January, 21 Savage performed a new version of his single “A Lot” on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” with lyrics that touched on the issue of children being separated from their parents at the United States border, a controversial Trump administration tactic to discourage illegal immigration.“There was scuttlebutt after the Jimmy Fallon show” coming from “some very high levels in Washington,” LaPolt added. What she heard suggested that 21 Savage had ruffled feathers.And so on the Thursday before the Super Bowl, LaPolt dispatched another attorney from her firm, Danielle Price, to Georgia to accompany 21 Savage back to California, a more immigrant-friendly state with a newly passed sanctuary law. He declined to go until after completing his contractual commitments — a pair of concerts at events surrounding the game — that weekend.While his case winds its way through the immigration system, 21 Savage’s team has been actively underscoring the political dimension to his plight and marshaling public support. A #Free21Savage coalition of a couple of dozen activist organizations is drawing attention to his situation, and two members of Congress — Hank Johnson and Zoe Lofgren — spoke publicly on his behalf while he was still in detention. Lofgren, from California and chairwoman of the House Judiciary Immigration and Citizenship Subcommittee, released a statement opening the door for 21 Savage to appear as a witness before her subcommittee and floating the idea that he had been arrested as a result of publicly questioning United States immigration policy. “Was his arrest in response to his Constitutionally protected speech?” the statement said. “It looks like that.”Bryan D. Cox, ICE’s Southern Region Communications Director, said in an email, “We’re not able to give any additional comment on this case.”Now that 21 Savage has been released on bond, his case moves to a different docket, for those who aren’t detained. The wait for his next hearing could be more than a year. “Time is our friend,” Kuck said. “We want to make sure we can maximize the politics and the process.”When 21 Savage was in detention, he “tried to refrain from talking to my mama and my kids — I ain’t want them to hear me through the phone,” the rapper said. He did want to speak with his lawyers, however. “I don’t like hopes and none of that,” he said he had told them. “Keep it real.”Between them, there is an easy rapport. In his music, 21 Savage rarely raps above a whisper, and in person, he was contained and disarmingly calm, speaking forcefully without ever raising his voice. On the day after his release, he was wearing all black, from his Balenciaga jacket to his Prada shoes, and his demeanor was studious. By contrast, his lawyers were sharp-tongued and defiant. While they barked on his behalf, he maintained imperturbable cool.For now, anyway, they will do much of the speaking. After interviews the day after his release with The New York Times and “Good Morning America,” 21 Savage has gone almost completely silent.HIP-HOP MYTHOLOGIES are built on regional specificities. More than any other genre in American pop, rap music understands itself as the product of place. 21 Savage’s Atlanta is and has been the center of the genre’s innovation for more than a decade now — the most vital creative hotbed of the most vital American music.So the knowledge that he initially came from elsewhere served as a useful reminder that this American music, like so many American musics before it, wouldn’t sound the same without immigrants. A quick reminder: Almost all of hip-hop’s founder generation — Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh — was born in the Caribbean. The island influence continues through today: Last year, Nicki Minaj wrote on Instagram about coming to the United States as an undocumented immigrant from Trinidad and Tobago when she was 5.Hip-hop has also faced immigration crises before. Slick Rick, one of the most innovative rappers of the late 1980s and early 1990s, was born in England. In 1991, he pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted murder (and other charges) in connection with the 1990 shooting of his former bodyguard. In 2001, he was arrested after performing on a cruise ship that left American waters and put into deportation proceedings, beginning a tug-of-war over his residency until 2008, when he was pardoned by David A. Paterson, then the governor of New York. In 2016, Slick Rick was granted United States citizenship.In 2009, Shyne — a protégé of Sean Combs — was deported to Belize, where he was born, not long after completing his sentence for attempted murder, assault and reckless endangerment related to the infamous 1999 shooting at Club New York (which also involved Combs and his girlfriend at the time, Jennifer Lopez).Slick Rick was, at times, a cause célèbre, but largely among the genre’s elders. Shyne became, in essence, collateral damage of late-90s rap excess. But both cases unfolded in far less dramatic moments of the immigration debate. By rapping about the child separation policy, 21 Savage inserted himself directly into a noxious political climate. And while many rappers, from YG to Eminem to Jay-Z, have spoken openly of their contempt for President Trump and his policies, none had as much to lose.Early in his career, 21 Savage did not immediately appear as a likely candidate for a political agitator. On his earliest mixtapes, he emerged as a coldhearted menace, dulled to the world’s pain. His lyrics were bleak, his attitude bleaker. Over the last couple of years, as he has become increasingly popular, he’s been steadily remaking his public image — a product, he said, of being exposed to more of the world.“I think financial freedom made me grow as a person,” he said, speaking about his desire to help others. “I did it as soon as I had the resources and the time. ‘Cause when you first start making money, it’s like you still figuring yourself out.”“But then it’s like, O.K., we a machine now,” he added. “Now we can get everybody else right.”It was this impulse, LaPolt said, that resonated with her when she was first in discussions to represent 21 Savage last year. “I realized how much he did for the community,” she said, citing his back-to-school drives and interest in spreading financial literacy to underserved populations. “I said to the rest of the team, ‘This needs to be at the forefront of the storytelling.’”LaPolt is a prominent music industry attorney who was one of the primary engines of the Music Modernization Act, the copyright legislation that was signed into law in October and which, among other things, updates how royalties are paid in the streaming age. When 21 Savage was arrested, she put her Washington connections to work. Johnson, a Congressman from Georgia who had attended a back-to-school drive organized by 21 Savage, wrote a letter of support. Lofgren’s statement came soon after.On the Sunday of the Grammys ceremony, which 21 Savage ended up watching on a television in his detention-center cell, Kuck called ICE’s toll-free number for detainee information and learned that, unexpectedly, a hearing had been scheduled for Tuesday morning.NOW THAT 21 SAVAGE has been released from detention, the push to secure his status continues. His legal team has applied for cancellation of removal, which is available to individuals who have been in the United States for more than 10 years, have American citizen family members who rely on them, are of good moral character and have no disqualifying criminal convictions.In interviews early in his career, 21 Savage spoke frankly about his life before music. “I done sold cocaine, sold crack cocaine,” he told The Fader in 2016. “I never sold, like, a whole brick. I done took bricks.” In 2014 he was arrested, and later convicted, on drug charges. Last year, through a first-offender program, the conviction was removed from public record, though that still had “monstrous immigration consequences,” Kuck said. Subsequently, LaPolt hired the Atlanta-area attorney Abbi S. Taylor, who secured the vacating of the plea and the dismissal of the charges. The file is now sealed. A search for 21 Savage on the Georgia Felon Search website turns up nothing.In an hour-plus interview, 21 Savage declined to speak only about the particulars of his prior interactions with law enforcement.When ICE arrested 21 Savage, it stated that he had been convicted of an “aggravated felony” in addition to overstaying his visa. At the hearing where he was granted bond, it formally withdrew that charge.“Not only does he not have a conviction, but there are no pending charges, there never will be any charges from that, and that case is sealed,” Kuck said, “so it simply never happened.”But the specter of that case highlights a potential continuing concern: that 21 Savage’s public persona — his art, his social media, his prior public statements — could be leveraged against him. (Public image, and especially lyrical content, have often been used in legal proceedings involving hip-hop artists, as seen recently in the case of 6ix9ine.)Kuck said that such topics were raised in the first hearing, though, “it didn’t come up in a way that we believe hurt our case.”“I’m very optimistic,” Kuck added. “I am convinced that we will ultimately obtain permanent residence for him.”Asked if the uncertainty he still faces causes him anxiety, 21 Savage was blunt: “Hell yeah.”That he could be used as a political cudgel isn’t lost on anyone, including 21 Savage himself. “He goes, ‘Well, I don’t want Trump to come at me,’ and I go, ‘You’re the last person he’s going to come after,’” LaPolt said. “Who in their right mind is going to come after him and not have a complete backlash?”But for someone who for most of his life has lived with the permanent uncertainty of the undocumented, he was at his most exultant and confident speaking about not having to fight alone.“It’s like putting bulletproof glass in front of a bulletproof vest,” 21 Savage said. “I’m going to stand up already, this vest already going to stop any bullet you throw, and y’all going to come help and put some glass in front of it too? This can’t be stopped. We a tank now. We was already the army — now we coming in tanks.”"
30,"A 61-year-old man from the Dominican Republic has been waiting for his day in federal immigration court since the 1980s, unable to visit his dying mother back home or, in recent years, legally hold a job. His trial was finally to come next week.But because of the federal government shutdown, he stands to lose his precious court date.In the backlogged immigration courts, that is likely to mean not just a few more weeks of waiting, but a few more years. Migrants like this man — who asked to be identified only by his first name, Jose, for fear of repercussions in court — are being sent to the back of the line, with their new court dates coming as late as 2022.From furloughs at the Justice Department to confusion in the courts, to prison officers working without a paycheck, the shutdown has challenged the nation’s courts and criminal justice system and those whose livelihoods depend on them, slowing some cases while throwing others into disarray.[Read more: On Friday, President Trump threatened to keep the government shut down for “months or even years.""]Federal district courts are still operating because they have revenue from court fees and other sources aside from congressional appropriations. But those funds may run out as soon as next Friday, leaving it up to judges to decide which cases are critical and must be heard and which will be delayed. Criminal cases are likely to be prioritized.At federal prisons, which employ roughly 36,000 people, corrections officers who struggle during normal times to cover their bills are now expecting that next week’s paycheck will not arrive. Guards who normally take home $1,000 to $1,400 per biweekly check are scrambling to figure out how to pay for child care, rent and medications.[Read more: With no end in sight to the shutdown, 800,000 federal workers have been sent home or are working without pay.]Eric Young, the national president of prison locals for the American Federation of Government Employees, said he had heard from one prison worker in Florida who needs $200 for his supply of insulin injections. “People are having to decide whether to keep the lights on or pay for their insulin,” Mr. Young said. “It’s depressing. And it’s just unconscionable to know that the federal work force is being penalized because of politics between the parties.”About four out of every five Justice Department employees are expected to keep working, because so many are employed in law enforcement or national security jobs, including at the F.B.I., the D.E.A., and the Bureau of Prisons. But none are expected to be paid during the shutdown, unless their offices have a funding source separate from congressional appropriations.The shutdown has already led to a slowdown in civil lawsuits, and some confusion, as federal judges across the country have issued a hodgepodge of conflicting orders. In the Federal District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, a federal judge ordered that all cases in which the federal government is a party be delayed.Another judge issued an order exempting his own cases from the first judge’s order.The second judge, Joseph R. Goodwin, wrote: “It is my view that the government should not be given special influence or accommodation in cases where such special considerations are unavailable to other litigants.”Justice Department lawyers whose civil cases are not granted delays can keep working to meet court deadlines and requirements for filings and appearances. Most federal prosecutors and support staff for criminal cases are continuing to work.[Read more: What is and is not affected by the shutdown.]Elsewhere, Justice Department lawyers have begged to delay civil cases in which the government — or even President Trump — is being sued, saying they are now prohibited from working on these cases except in emergencies and other very limited circumstances. They have met with mixed success.In a lawsuit alleging that Mr. Trump used his Washington hotel to illegally profit from business with foreign countries, a delay has been granted.But in a case that seeks to block the Trump administration from questioning people about their citizenship in the 2020 census — a measure that critics say is devised to suppress responses from migrants — the judge, Richard Seeborg of Federal District Court in San Francisco, denied a request to delay and ordered the trial to begin Monday. The Justice Department says it will comply.Judges will have significant latitude to determine which cases go forward and which are delayed, once the court fees and other revenue are depleted.“Judges are in the best position to determine what cases have an urgency,” said David Sellers, the spokesman for the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.Mr. Sellers said judges will continue to appoint defense lawyers to represent criminal defendants too poor to pay for one, and jurors will continue to be empaneled. They will get paid, he said, once money is appropriated.Advocates for prisoners and their families fear that the shutdown could delay the implementation of a new criminal justice bill that promised to shorten sentences for some federal inmates by recalculating the amount of good time credit they have earned, because the Justice Department must create new tools and protocols first.The deadlines for those “were already pretty ambitious, even when the department was fully staffed and appropriated,” said Kevin Ring, president of FAMM, a nonprofit group that was founded to oppose mandatory minimum sentences. “We’re watching that closely.”But probably no system is feeling the shutdown as much as the already overburdened immigration courts, where there are more than 800,000 cases pending. Most of these courts, except those that hear the cases of those currently in detention, are now closed because of the shutdown.As a result, the impasse over the Trump administration’s demand for a border wall to halt illegal immigration will result in long delays in deportations for those who are already here but ultimately lose their cases.“That is the irony of this shutdown,” said Judge Amiena Khan, the executive vice president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, the judges’ union. “The impact is most acutely felt in immigration courts and proceedings where cases will not be going forward.”Because of the volume of trials from the past two weeks that now must be rescheduled, the affected cases are likely to be pushed to the end of the judges’ dockets rather than squeezed into their schedules once the shutdown ends.In New York, home to one of the busiest immigration courts in the country, those whose trials have been postponed will have to wait until the end of 2022 and 2023 at the earliest before their cases are heard because of the backlog, Judge Khan said.“I was very nervous because we were so close, and this is just making me even more nervous,” Jose said. “Every day I hope the government reopens.”"
31,"The debate around a border wall and immigration has become so distorted by President Trump’s superheated nonsense — we must build a wall to keep out all these rapists and murderers, and Mexico will pay for it — that we’ve forgotten what it would sound like if we actually had a president framing the real border issue in a really honest way to come up with a real solution — not just one to energize his base.Unfortunately, we have a president who wants to spend $5.7 billion on a wall to fix his political problems with Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham. When what we need is a president who wants to spend $5.7 on a multipronged strategy that will address the actual immigration challenge we face.Here is how a real president would explain it: My fellow Americans, we face a global crisis: More people are on the move today seeking jobs, asylum from murderous governments, safety from environmental disasters or just looking for order than at any time since World War II — some 70 million people.Why now? Answer: During the late 19th and the 20th centuries the world shifted from being governed by large empires in many regions to being governed by independent nation-states. And the 50 years after World II were a great time to be a weak little nation-state — for several reasons.[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]First, because there were two superpowers competing for your affection by throwing foreign aid at you, building your army, buying your cheap goods and educating your kids at their universities. Second, climate change was moderate. Third, populations were still under control in the developing world. Fourth, no one had a cellphone to easily organize movements against your government or even see what Paris or Phoenix looked like. Fifth, China was not in the World Trade Organization, so every poor country could be in textiles and other low-wage industries.All of those advantages disappeared in the early 21st century. Climate-driven extreme weather — floods, droughts, record-setting heat and cold — on top of man-made deforestation began to hammer many countries, especially their small-scale farmers. Developing-world populations exploded thanks to improved health care. Africa went from 140 million people in 1900 to one billion in 2010 to a projected 2.5 billion by 2050. The same surge happened in Central America, in countries like Guatemala.Meanwhile, the smartphone enabled citizens to easily compare their living standards with Paris or Phoenix — and find a human trafficker app to take them there. Also, China joined the W.T.O., gobbling up low-wage industries, and the end of the Cold War meant no superpower wanted to touch your country, because all it would win was a bill.The result: It’s much harder to be a weak country today, and the weakest of them are starting to fail or fracture and hemorrhage their people. That’s Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Venezuela in our hemisphere and Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya and many countries in sub-Saharan Africa across the Atlantic.This is creating wide zones of “disorder” — and the biggest geopolitical trend in the world is all the people trying to get out of zones of disorder into the world of order. And that is what’s creating all the populist, nationalist, anti-immigrant backlashes in the world of order — particularly in America and Europe.That is the real context for this immigration crisis. What’s the answer? Well, if you look at what slowed the flood of single Mexican men illegally and legally coming to America in the last decade, it was the combination of greater economic opportunity in Mexico, thanks in part to Nafta, plus slower population growth in Mexico, plus improved governance in Mexico, plus better border security along the Mexico-U.S. border.That same formula has to be applied now to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. They have become the primary source of all those migrants and caravans coming to America today, including 187,000 minors without adult guardians, who were picked up by the U.S. Border Patrol between 2014 and 2018. Their parents sent them our way to connect with relatives already here or to be shielded from forced gang recruitment and violence.A report last June by the Council on Foreign Relations noted, “In 2015, the latest year for which data is available, as many as 3.4 million people born in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras were living in the United States, more than double the estimated 1.5 million people in 2000.” Because of rampant corruption and gang warfare, Salvadorans, Hondurans and Guatemalans each year pay an estimated total of $651 million in extortion to organized crime groups. These gangs, like MS-13, exploded in Central America in the mid-1990s “following large-scale deportations from the United States of undocumented immigrants with criminal records.”That’s why, among other things, a smart U.S. immigration policy would promote family planning in rural areas in Central America. Letting America’s religious right limit U.S. family planning assistance abroad is stupid. The only thing more stupid is not working to mitigate climate change, which Trump refuses to do. Extreme weather has been disrupting small-scale farming in Central America. And when small-scale farming weakens or collapses, people leave the countryside and flock to the city. And if they find high unemployment and high crime rates there, they head to America.At the same time, we need an investment shock by local and foreign companies and governments to build infrastructure, tourism and trade in Central America so more people can thrive there, especially when 61 percent of the population is under 29 years of age.Alas, though, investment rates average just 12 percent of G.D.P. in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, while in Mexico it’s 26 percent.Yes, both legal and illegal immigrants actually contribute, on balance, to American growth, but there is no question that border security, asylum courts, resettlement and absorption facilities put pressure on federal, state and local governments. But …The U.S. could spend millions of dollars to help stabilize Central American countries — so that more of their citizens could stay home, which most immigrants prefer — and we’d still save money and reduce illegal immigration. It costs us anywhere from $14,000 to $38,000 to detain and deport a single migrant.Finally, we also need fences, drones and sensors to strengthen the border in places. But rather than building a $5.7 billion wall against Mexico, what we need most is to help Mexico improve its capacity to intercept migrants at its southern border with Guatemala — where all Central American migrants headed north have to pass. It’s not that hard. There are only two main roads out of Guatemala to the north, with a mountain in the middle. It’s called Mexico’s “Tehuantepec isthmus bottleneck.”If we worked with Mexico to create better entry-point infrastructure there with biometric controls and improved ability to inspect vehicles, people and merchandise to stop smugglers — and even interview potential asylum seekers there — we would significantly reduce the numbers coming out of Central America, crossing Mexico and piling up at our border.In sum, we need a plan that creates a wall, not a wall that substitutes for a plan. That’s what a real president would offer. If only we had one.But have no illusions: More weak nation-states will be imploding under these pressures in the coming decade and no empire is going to impose order there; those days are long gone. But many of these states simply cannot effectively govern themselves any longer. (Heck, Britain can’t effectively govern itself any longer!)So how the world of order collaborates to bring order to more and more of these places — Italy has basically created and funded the Libyan Coast Guard to protect itself from migrants crossing the Mediterranean — is going to become one of the biggest governing challenges of this century."
32,"WASHINGTON — President Trump had a few things to say to start the new year.About walls. About wheels. About death and sand. About Mitt Romney and Iran. About his popularity in Europe and within the Republican Party. About essentially firing Jim Mattis as defense secretary, and forcing the retiring senators Bob Corker and Jeff Flake from office. And about validation from Kanye West and how his generals were “better looking than Tom Cruise.”He lamented being lonely in the White House over Christmas and New Year’s. He had been essentially out of public view for a week, so when he convened his first cabinet meeting of 2019, he seemed to be releasing some pent-up demand to be heard.Here are some takeaways and fact-checks from the 95-minute session on Wednesday.Walls, the president said, are a time-tested effective way to secure a border. Just look at the Vatican, he said. Is that wall, “the biggest wall of them all,” immoral, he asked. (Vatican City has walls, but they do not enclose the entire territory and visitors can easily enter some parts.) “The United States needs a physical barrier,” he said, adding that it “needs a wall.” Later, though, he said he did not really care if the barrier were called a wall, but wanted only to emphasize that a wall was needed.A wall, he said, would stop the flow of heroin into the country, and it would stop human trafficking. There are “probably” 30 million to 35 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, he speculated, and they cost the government $250 billion, which “would pay for the wall.” (Government and independent analyses have estimated there are about 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, and one of the highest estimates for costs of illegal immigration — a criticized study from an anti-immigration group — pins the figure at $116 billion. Building a wall would not remove these immigrants from the United States and reduce whatever costs they impose.) And, Mr. Trump noted, President Barack Obama built a wall around “his compound,” except that is not quite what Mr. Obama did. In any event, Mr. Trump said he did not want to be critical of his predecessor; rather, he wanted to make the point that walls work. Drones and other technology, he argued, had more limited capacity. “I know more about drones than anybody,” he said.The wall, though, had the advantage of history.“The wheel, the wall, some things never get old,” Mr. Trump said.Mr. Romney, the newly elected Republican senator from Utah, announced his presence in Washington by writing an op-ed article in The Washington Post that was a scathing criticism of Mr. Trump. Usually not one to shy from a fight, Mr. Trump was relatively restrained when he talked about Mr. Romney, who was the Republican presidential nominee in 2012.“I’d love him to be a team player, possibly he won’t be,” Mr. Trump said. The president noted that he had endorsed Mr. Romney for the Senate, and Mr. Romney, in turn, had praised him “profusely.” Then Mr. Trump added that Mr. Romney’s words might not play well in Utah, where the president said he is extremely popular. (Mr. Trump is probably less popular in Utah than almost any largely Republican state.)He went on to criticize Mr. Romney’s race against Mr. Obama in 2012, and said that if Mr. Romney had fought Mr. Obama as hard as he has fought him, Mr. Romney might have won. And when asked if he were concerned about a primary challenge from Mr. Romney in 2020, Mr. Trump replied, “They say I am the most popular president in the history of the Republican Party.” (Actually, Mr. Trump’s approval rating among Republicans was 88 percent at 701 days into his term, according to Gallup, the same as President George W. Bush at the same point. Over all, Mr. Trump’s approval ratings among his own party have largely hovered below Mr. Bush’s.) One by one, the president called on select cabinet members for their contributions to border security. One by one, they responded by praising their boss.Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, applauded his leadership on border security. She was followed by the acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, who saluted the president for giving up his Christmas and New Year’s holidays “while some members of Congress went on vacation.” Rick Perry, the energy secretary and a former governor of Texas, also praised the president, saying he had been rebuffed on border security from the Obama administration. “You’re standing up and saying don’t come,” Mr. Perry said.Not to be outdone, Vice President Mike Pence noted that he, too, stayed in Washington over the holidays. Then he, too, piled on the compliments: “I want to thank you for the strong stand you have taken on border security.” Mr. Trump was still stinging from criticism over his decision to withdraw American troops from Syria, lamenting that he was the only person who would get “bad publicity” for it. One rebuke in particular, from Mr. Mattis, seemed to prompt the president to issue some criticism of his own. “How has he done in Afghanistan? Not good. I’m not happy,” Mr. Trump said, before adding, “I wish him well. President Obama fired him and, essentially, so did I.” (Mr. Mattis resigned in protest, and Mr. Trump initially characterized the retired Marine general’s departure as a retirement.) He protested that some characterized the withdrawal as aiding Russia, insisting that “they’re not happy.” (In fact, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw American troops from Syria “correct.”) Besides, he said, Russia learned how costly and fruitless a foreign war can be after “they went bankrupt fighting in Afghanistan” even though it had good reason to invade the country “because terrorists were going to Russia.” (The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, beginning a “decade-long attempt by Moscow to subdue the Afghan civil war and maintain a friendly and socialist government on its border,” according to the State Department.) Mr. Trump then misleadingly claimed that Mr. Obama gave Iran $150 billion and $1.8 billion cash. (The first figure refers to a high estimate of frozen Iranian assets released by the Iran nuclear deal — not a check cut to Tehran — while the second refers to a payment of a debt owed to Iran.) Unprompted, the president responded to a recent poll in Europe that Mr. Romney cited in his op-ed article that showed only 16 percent of people in Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Sweden believed that the American president would “do the right thing in world affairs,” down from 84 percent in 2016.Mr. Trump took the low number as a measure of how well he is doing in the United States. “If I were popular in Europe, I wouldn’t be doing my job.”He later added, though, that he could indeed reverse those numbers. “I could be the most popular person in Europe,” he said. “I could run for any office if I wanted to.”Mr. Trump seemed to think that some of his predecessors — he did not name names — have coasted in what is frequently described as the most difficult, loneliest job in the world.“It would be a lot easier if I just relaxed and enjoyed the presidency like a lot of other people have done,” he said."
33,"As President Trump delivered his State of the Union address on Tuesday, two guests sitting in the gallery and listening closely were immigrants he has long known. They cleaned Mr. Trump’s cottage at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., despite lacking legal status in the United States.Victorina Morales and Sandra Diaz were among some 20 immigrants, many of them facing possible deportation, on the list of guests seated in the secure gallery for the annual address.Even as the president wrapped his speech in a theme of national unity, he made immigration — his signature issue — central to it, as divisive as it may be. His determination to build a wall along the southern border led recently to a 35-day government shutdown, and ahead of the next government funding deadline, on Feb. 15, there is still no deal in sight.“I never imagined I would set foot in such an important place,” Ms. Morales, 46, a native of Guatemala who worked at Mr. Trump’s golf resort for five years, said after the speech. “I was an immigrant representing many immigrants in this country who don’t want to show their faces because of what the president says. I was there for the 11 million undocumented.”Ms. Diaz, 47, a native of Costa Rica who is now a legal resident of the United States, said she “felt like Cinderella” attending the speech. But sitting in full view of the Trump family, whom she had seen frequently at Bedminster, and seeing the president deliver his address, she said, she had hoped he would have kinder words for undocumented immigrants.“It was hard to be face to face with him and realize he didn’t change his position, especially for those of us who helped his businesses prosper,” she said. “I had the trust to be inside his home and serve him.”[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]But the two former housekeepers, invited by a pair of Democratic lawmakers, represent just one side of the fractious immigration debate: Among those Mr. Trump invited were a daughter, a granddaughter and a great-granddaughter of Gerald and Sharon David, a Nevada couple killed in their home last month. An immigrant from Central America who was believed to be in the country illegally has been charged in the case.Republican lawmakers chose guests whose experiences they believe bolstered their calls for a crackdown on illegal immigration and fortification of the southern border.Michael C. Burgess, a Republican lawmaker from Texas, hosted Chris Odette, whose daughter, Chrishia, 13, was struck and killed as she was crossing the street in 2014 by a vehicle driven by an undocumented immigrant who had no driver’s license. The driver was freed on bail and evaded immigration authorities when they went to arrest him, said Mr. Odette, a resident of Rockwall, Tex.“It is important to me to hear that the president is doing something to address the immigration issue,” Mr. Odette said. “People who keep trying to block it don’t seem to care because they are not touched by the loss.”Senator Marsha Blackburn and Representative Tim Burchett, both Tennessee Republicans, invited the parents of Pierce Corcoran, 22, who died in a head-on vehicle collision in December with an undocumented immigrant in the Knoxville area.Also among the Republican invitees were leaders of the United States Border Patrol union, which has been a staunch backer of the president and his plan for a wall on the border.Democratic lawmakers, for their part, hosted immigrants who have been targeted by the Trump administration’s more vigorous immigration enforcement policies, including mothers separated from their children under the “zero-tolerance” border policy, which was suspended in late June amid widespread public outrage.Albertina Contreras and Yakelin Garcia, a Guatemalan mother and daughter invited by Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, were separated at the border on May 24 and were unable to communicate for more than a month before being reunited on July 12. Having fled domestic violence, they are living in Murfreesburo, Tenn., while they fight in court to remain in the United States.“I want to live here and get papers. It is a privilege to be here,” said Yakelin, who wore a black-and-white dress and a matching blazer for the occasion, which coincided with her 12th birthday.Gerald Michaud, 47, has been living in Brooklyn under Temporary Protected Status since an earthquake ravaged his native Haiti in 2010. The T.P.S. program enables him to live and work in the United States, but the Trump administration has moved to cancel the program later this year for Haitians, Salvadorans and others.“I am proud to represent more than 300,000 immigrants who would like a permanent solution,” said Mr. Michaud, who is a wheelchair attendant at La Guardia Airport and teaches martial arts to at-risk youths. “We are afraid. I am working legally, which I cannot do if I lose T.P.S.”The State of the Union address has long been a platform for presidents to report on key issues and seek congressional support. This is not the first time that it has been used to make a statement about the nation’s lingering divisions over immigration. In 2016, President Barack Obama invited a Syrian refugee to his State of the Union address to send the message that refugees were not a threat to the country.But what will distinguish this year’s speech from past years’ is the sheer number of invitees whose immigration status is uncertain because of the president’s policies.The attorney general of California, Xavier Becerra, delivered the Democrats’ Spanish-language response to Mr. Trump’s address. That, too, focused in part on immigration. “Tonight was about convincing us that, from here on out, the deceit and dysfunction would stop and that cooperation would begin,” Mr. Becerra said. “What we heard was the same tired refrain of building walls.”As for Ms. Morales and Ms. Diaz, the former housekeepers at the president’s golf club, Tuesday night marked a first. Until recently, neither had been to Washington before, let alone attended a joint session of Congress. Their appearance began with an invitation to Ms. Morales from Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey.“This year, there is no issue more important than the way this administration is using immigrants as an excuse to build a wall that doesn’t work,” said Ms. Watson Coleman, who represents the district where Ms. Morales resides.In recent weeks, the two women have been meeting with members of Congress and aides all over Capitol Hill, hoping to spur an investigation into the difference between the president’s harsh words on immigration and his companies’ own hiring policies.“We wanted to highlight the hypocrisy of the administration,” said Jimmy Gomez, the Democratic congressman from Los Angeles who invited Ms. Diaz. “The president demonizes immigrants, documented and undocumented, and also relies heavily on them.”"
34,"PALERMO, Sicily — Italy’s populist interior minister, Matteo Salvini, celebrated Parliament’s passage of his Security Decree to crack down on illegal immigration by assuring his supporters last year that “I won’t stop!”But stopping Mr. Salvini is exactly what Leoluca Orlando, the mayor of Palermo, the Sicilian capital, wants to do.Passed with much fanfare late last year, Mr. Salvini’s Security Decree was intended to make Italy more unwelcoming to migrants, not least by doing away with two years of “humanitarian protection” for asylum seekers, a status that allowed them to live in the country legally.Far from adding to security, says Mr. Orlando, 71, a veteran mayor and constitutional law professor who came to prominence in the fight against the mafia, the law risks pushing migrants into the shadows and the criminal underworld by denying them legal status as well as access to health care and other social services.He has refused to apply the decree in a stand that has become a prominent part of a widening grass-roots resistance to Mr. Salvini’s hard line on immigration, which is increasingly dividing the country even as it has tightened the populist government’s hold on power.On Friday afternoon, in defiance of the law, Mr. Orlando pushed through the first four applications by migrants seeking residency under their humanitarian status.By signing their applications, Mr. Orlando hopes to invite a legal challenge by the government that he can take all the way to Italy’s highest court. He intends to argue that Mr. Salvini’s measures are unconstitutional and violate the migrants’ human rights.“I cannot accept that you produce criminality,” Mr. Orlando said in an interview last month in his grand office, surrounded by gilded Islamic manuscripts, a letter from Pope Francis and a paperweight of the Dalai Lama.Many liberal mayors across the country, from Naples to Florence to Milan, applauded Mr. Orlando’s intention to defy the government, which he first announced at the end of December.Mr. Orlando’s office now hopes his action will clear the way for the mayors to create Italian versions of the sanctuary cities that sprouted in the United States in opposition to President’s Trump’s similarly minded crackdown on immigration.This week, Tuscany, Umbria, Sardinia and the northern region of Piedmont filed a legal complaint against the Security Decree, charging that it actually increased criminal activity and decreased the possibility of economic integration.In a further knock on the government, prosecutors in Sicily initiated an investigation of Mr. Salvini on charges of “kidnapping,” after his refusal to allow an Italian Coast Guard ship carrying migrants to dock this summer.In the absence of plausible political opposition at the national level, some have welcomed the signs of resistance against the government led by Mr. Salvini’s anti-immigrant League and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement.“There are many little outbreaks that have failed to form in a single flame,” said Claudio Cerasa, the author of a manual on resistance to Italy’s culture of intolerance and the editor of Il Foglio, a newspaper critical of the government.But the flickers of resistance have only inflamed Mr. Salvini, who clearly thinks he has a winning position ahead of critical European Parliament elections in May. He continues to find evermore inventive ways to ratchet up his crack down on illegal migration.Mr. Salvini has embraced the investigation aimed at him as an opportunity to play the victim of overreaching magistrates. He has already attacked the civilly disobedient mayors as scofflaws who “help the illegal migrants hate Italians, and they will answer to the law and to history.’’‘‘I will not stop,” he pledged.Indeed, last month, Mr. Salvini refused to offer a safe port to the Sea Watch 3, a vessel that had rescued 47 migrants from the Mediterranean Sea. For nearly two weeks, the ship was adrift as Mr. Salvini spoke of forming a “naval blockade” to seal off the country.The standoff ended on Thursday, only after European neighbors agreed to take in the majority of the migrants, who disembarked in another Sicilian city, Catania.The repeating loop of ships approaching Italy with rescued migrants, only to be turned away by Mr. Salvini, has given the tough-talking interior minister a seemingly inexhaustible well of talking points and advantageous television footage.“I guarantee that our position will not change: Zero Tolerance” Mr. Salvini posted on Twitter Thursday, adding later that millions of Italians “voted for me to BLOCK THE LANDINGS.”Mr. Orlando accused Mr. Salvini of fear-mongering and “using the banner of security to get votes in the next European election.”His decision, which his office said is based on his reading of Italian law, breaks a bureaucratic impasse with city workers who, unlike him, were loath to defy Mr. Salvini’s decree. It sets off a process that will likely result this month in the mayor personally granting residency to the applicants.“This is the first concrete act of opposition,” said Mr. Orlando, who is eager for Italy’s highest court to rule on Mr. Salvini’s law. “I need a court!”In the meantime, migrants around Italy are feeling the pressure.“I don’t know what to do,” Saha Abdul, 21, a migrant from Ghana, said as he shopped in the Ballarò market in the center of Palermo. He said he had tried to renew his documents to gain residency in Italy, but was told the decree made that impossible.“I’m already on the street. Everything is in my bag — water, food,’’ he lamented. ‘‘I get no help. It will push people to do what people don’t want to do.”At the University of Palermo, a group of 10 lawyers and law students offered free counsel to migrants thrown in disarray by the new decree. Outside of a classroom, lawyers worked off a call list with the names Sakko, Konate, Camara and Bolul.Migrants who arrived in Italy as minors — attending Italian schools, learning the language and integrating in their cities — often counted on the humanitarian status to remain in Italy when they came of age. Instead, many risked suddenly becoming illegal as they turned 18.Alieu Sosseh, 17, said his application for a residency permit had been postponed until later this month.“I don’t know why. I’m not trying to do something bad in this country. I have been going to school,” he said, worried that people in his situation will eventually be forced to start dealing drugs.“In life when you can’t get your meals — your breakfast — and that is the only opportunity, you can get involved in that thing,’’ he said. ‘‘You won’t like it, but you have no choice.”Mr. Salvini’s critics say that is exactly the outcome he desires. By producing more migrant crime, they say, he produces more anxiety and fear, exactly the conditions on which his law-and-order proposals feed.But Mr. Salvini argues that the mayors and other liberals are simply making excuses for migrants, who they prefer over law-abiding Italian citizens.Acting on the authority of Mr. Salvini’s Security Decree, the police last week cleared out an integration center in Castelnuovo di Porto, north of Rome. Mr. Salvini said the closure of such centers, where about 6,000 refugee applicants across the country receive shelter, would save the state about six million euros.Mr. Salvini pledged to carry out a similar evacuation of an even larger center in Sicily later this year.Such moves continue to divide Italians. The mayor of Castelnuovo di Porto expressed disgust with Mr. Salvini and took in a Somali woman. Other residents rallied around children who attended the local school and a 19-year-old Senegalese striker for the local soccer team.Mr. Orlando had supported the Sea Watch, the rescue vessel that landed Thursday, and even gave its crew a Palermo flag before they set sail. Residents in the Sicilian town Syracuse, outside of which the Sea Watch lingered, hung white sheets from their balconies reading “Let Them Dock,” and some families offered to take migrants in.Mr. Orlando is hoping that he, and the mayors who followed his lead, had at least sparked something in the country.“I played my role,” he said. “I hope I will not remain isolated and everyone will ask, ‘In my field, what can I do to be concretely against this?’”"
35,"A former employee of the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey said that her name was removed from a list of workers to be vetted by the Secret Service after she reminded management that she was unlawfully in the United States, the latest worker to assert that supervisors at the elite resort were aware that some members of their work force were undocumented.The Bedminster golf club has recently terminated several workers who were determined to be ineligible to work in the country, according to several people familiar with the matter, following a New York Times report that revealed that immigrants who presented false documents were knowingly kept on the payroll, sometimes for years.A lawyer representing the women has met with investigators from the New Jersey attorney general’s office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, presenting what he said was evidence that managers at the golf club knew that some workers were in the country illegally, and that at least one supervisor helped an employee obtain forged working documents.In the latest revelation, Emma Torres, an undocumented immigrant from Ecuador who prepared food at the club, said that members of the kitchen staff were asked in 2016, as Donald J. Trump was in the midst of his campaign for the White House, to write their names, addresses and other details, including their Social Security numbers, on a list of employees that would be submitted to the Secret Service for clearance.The golf club has been a favorite place for vacation and business meetings for Mr. Trump.“When I learned this is for the Secret Service to see the records of everyone because they are giving protection to Mr. Trump, I rushed to human resources,” Ms. Torres said in an interview. “I thought, God, what will I do?” Ms. Torres said she had used a fake Social Security number when she applied for her job.She said that she told a human resources employee, whose name she does not know, that she did not have legal status. She said that the woman replied, “‘It’s O.K. No problem.’ She scratched me off the list.”The woman then asked Ms. Torres for names of other kitchen workers who might be undocumented, which Ms. Torres said she provided.There is no evidence that Mr. Trump knew of the unlawful status of employees at the club. But halting illegal immigration, by stanching the influx across the border, and deporting immigrants living inside the country have been core priorities of his administration. Mr. Trump has demanded $5 billion in funding to erect a wall along the United States-Mexico border to help block the flow of immigrants, leading to a stalemate with Democrats that has resulted in a partial shutdown of the federal government.In a statement to the Times on Dec. 7, the Trump Organization, which owns the New Jersey golf club, pledged to terminate any workers it found to have been hired using fraudulent documents, which are typically a made-up Social Security number and green card.Managers at the golf club and at Trump International did not respond to requests for comment on Ms. Torres’s account. A Secret Service spokeswoman, Cathy L. Milhoan, said she could not discuss what measures the agency took to vet employees at the golf club. “The U.S. Secret Service does not comment on our protective operations to include the administration of our name check program,” she said in a statement.Ms. Torres said she believes the undocumented workers she identified to management also had their names removed from the list given to the Secret Service, but all of them, she said, remained on staff at the resort.At least one other undocumented employee at the resort, Victorina Morales, a native of Guatemala who had been illegally in the United States since 1999, said she was given a Secret Service pin to wear when the president was in residence at the club. Secret Service officials said the pin did not signify that she had passed any security clearance.Ms. Torres, 43, said she was hired to work at the resort in early 2015 using a falsified Social Security number and permanent resident card. She had informed a manager during her job interview that both were phony, she said, and the documents were photocopied for club files when she started working there.After a few months working as a housekeeper, Ms. Torres said she complained to management about what she felt was abusive treatment by the housekeeping supervisor and was moved to the kitchen, where she started as a dishwasher. She said she worked her way up to assistant to the chef, earning $14.50 an hour.Among other tasks, Ms. Torres noted that she made sandwiches for Secret Service agents when they began visiting the property. She also prepared food for Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump had praised her work and tipped her when she was in housekeeping, Ms. Torres recalled. But she and other former employees who have spoken with The Times said they grew increasingly uncomfortable with Mr. Trump’s derogatory comments about immigrants during his campaign. “When he won the election, fear took over me,” Ms. Torres said. “I felt I was in the lion’s den. I had to leave.”Ms. Torres quit in early 2017, after finding another job.Since The Times’s initial report that the golf club employed undocumented immigrants, three additional immigrants have come forward, saying that they used fraudulent documents to secure jobs there and that management was aware of their illegal status.Ms. Morales was still working at the club when The Times published its report, but has not returned to work since. She said that when her initial fraudulent green card expired, a manager at the club arranged for her to be driven to a place where she could obtain new counterfeit documents. She said he lent her money to purchase them.Since the article was published, the Trump Organization has been quietly scrambling to bring its golf club work force into compliance, according to former employees who have been in contact with colleagues at the club. Checking whether employees are authorized to work in the United States has resulted in the termination of about a dozen people, according to these workers and another source familiar with the organization’s workings, though management at the club has not confirmed their accounts.More broadly, the company is reviewing its staff at many properties to ensure they are authorized to work in the country, according to a person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.A lawyer representing some of the undocumented former employees, Anibal Romero, contacted the New Jersey attorney general’s office and the Office of the Special Counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in October. Mr. Mueller’s office then referred the case to the F.B.I., said Mr. Romero, who said that both state and federal authorities contacted him in November. Mr. Romero said that he handed over, among other material, the false documents that a manager had helped Ms. Morales obtain.Neither state nor federal authorities have confirmed that they are conducting a full-scale investigation into the matter.A spokesman for the New Jersey attorney general said that “as a general matter, our office does not confirm or deny investigations.” A spokeswoman for the F.B.I. declined to comment."
36,"TIJUANA, Mexico — With the bullhorn of a nationally televised address and the prestige of the White House around him, President Trump delivered a dark, if familiar, message to the American people on Tuesday night: The United States needs a border wall to stanch the flow of drugs and criminals, and it has no more room for migrants.In Mexico — the supposed origin and pipeline of these menaces — leaders and citizens reacted with a weary shrug.In the Mexican border city of Tijuana, where thousands of migrants have gathered seeking entry to the United States, most of the televisions in a downtown restaurant showed soccer matches and basketball games. Mr. Trump’s voice, nearly drowned out by music, emerged faintly from a screen in the back.Almost no one seemed to care, or even listen to what the American president had to say.Luis Arce, a 32-year-old lawyer, was among the few who took a moment to reflect on Mr. Trump’s speech. He said he was not surprised by Mr. Trump’s insistence on building a wall, nor by anything else in the remarks.“It’s a tantrum,” Mr. Arce said. “We all know he is temperamental and will never back down on this whim of his, especially since he promised it since his campaign and seems like he can’t take it back.”“A wall will clearly not solve drug addiction, the drug trade, weapons smuggling or illegal immigration,” he added. “Those are problems that have to be addressed and solved by policymaking.”The situation at Mexico’s northern border would seem to demand urgent policymaking, as the migrants gathering at cities like Tijuana have become a humanitarian and political crisis for Mexico.The demands of trying to shelter migrants and improve squalid, crowded conditions have overwhelmed local officials, and the arrival of the migrants has strained relations with the United States. Last week, Mexico called for an investigation into American officers’ repeated use of tear gas across the border.Yet the reaction to Mr. Trump’s speech on Tuesday night was muted.Although only several weeks into his term, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has gone out of his way not to antagonize his American counterpart. After Mr. Trump’s address, he appeared to weigh his words carefully.In a long interview with a Mexican news program, Mr. López Obrador said Mexico would always pursue “a relationship of cooperation, of friendship.” His government, he said, will confront migration “with development, with employment.”After the interview, reporters asked Mr. López Obrador about Mr. Trump’s speech and his insistence on the wall.“I don’t even want to mention the word,” Mr. Lopez Obrador said. “It’s an issue that’s not even on our agenda. I don’t think about it.”Instead, the president said, he would try to bring Mr. Trump around to his way of thinking.“We will persuade him, convince him that we need cooperation for development,” he said. “This is the best way to face the phenomenon of migration.”Vicente Fox, the vocal former president of Mexico, has berated Mr. Trump in the past, and on Tuesday he appeared to see no reason to let up, dismissing the American leader on Twitter: “L’enfant terrible. The enemy of all! Even himself.”Mr. Fox urged Mr. Trump, “Don’t be so stubborn,” saying that Mexico would never pay for the wall and that “as far as I understand the American people will not either.”From the day he announced his candidacy for office in 2015, Mr. Trump has made the reduction of immigration — and the construction of a wall — a central issue of his campaign and presidency, sometimes promising that Mexico would pay for the wall. He has since claimed a revised trade agreement with Mexico and Canada would pay for the wall, an idea rejected on Tuesday by Kenneth Smith Ramos, the chief Mexican negotiator for the deal.“That’s a chapter you will NOT find in the new Agreement, simply because it does NOT exist,” he wrote on Twitter.In a series of fact-checking tweets about the speech, Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico’s former ambassador to the United States, rejected many of Mr. Trump’s claims. “Saying there is a national security crisis on the border does a huge disservice to how the US and Mexico have worked together since 9/11 to ensure our border is not used by terrorists to undermine our common security,” he wrote.On Monday, Mexico’s interior minister, Olga Sánchez Cordero, staked out a position that was in implicit contrast to Mr. Trump’s.“Migrants are not criminals, much less do they constitute a threat to the security of Mexico or the United States,” she said. “They are human beings who seek to escape the reality of insecurity and poverty in their countries of origin, who seek the most elemental thing: the possibility of remaining alive and finding a job that will allow them to advance with dignity.”But although she said Mexico was open and willing to work with the United States, the two sides are still far apart on the nature of the problem itself.Mexicans in Tijuana noted as much on Tuesday, when Mr. Trump spoke.Daniel Gómez, the manager of the bar airing the speech, called it “bad news” that would discourage tourism and hurt the Mexican economy.“It is so frustrating to listen to him say the same things, which are nothing more than excuses to justify the massive problems that exists in the U.S. and blame it all on the foreigner, the Mexican, the other,” he said.“It’s infuriating because we can’t do absolutely anything about it,” he said. “All we can do is what we are doing right now, which is to sit down and watch it from afar.”"
37,"WASHINGTON — President Trump attacked Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday for rejecting his proposal to end the partial government shutdown, as he and Republican leaders in Congress sought to put Democrats on defense, a place they have rarely been during the shutdown stalemate.In a series of morning tweets, Mr. Trump said Ms. Pelosi had behaved “so irrationally” in spurning his offer to restore the temporary protections he took away from some undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall. He also pushed back against conservative critics who called the plan amnesty for immigrants who came to the United States illegally.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, plans to bring up legislation as early as Tuesday that would wrap Mr. Trump’s proposal into a broader package that would include billions of dollars in disaster relief and immediately reopen the government, an aide said. The move is intended to ratchet up pressure on Democrats, who have insisted they will not negotiate with Mr. Trump until the shutdown is over.“President Trump has put forward a serious and reasonable offer to reform parts of our broken immigration system and reopen government,” Representative Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader, said on Twitter. “The moment now turns to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. The country is watching.”But there was little indication from Democrats, who have denounced Mr. Trump’s plan as “hostage taking,” that they would abandon that position.“If he opens up the government, we’ll discuss whatever he offers, but hostage taking should not work,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, told reporters in New York on Sunday, adding, “It’s very hard to negotiate when a gun is held to your head.”With the shutdown now in its fifth week, and 800,000 federal employees still furloughed or working without pay, pressure is rising on both Republicans and Democrats to end it. If it lasts until Friday, Congress will be forced to reckon with another grim milestone: Affected workers will miss their second paycheck.[Read: Trump’s Deal Meets With Skepticism Among Immigrants in Texas]As Republicans go on offense in the Senate, Democrats will stay on offense in the House, where they have already passed a string of government funding bills that Mr. McConnell — who has largely remained on the sidelines during the shutdown debate — has refused to take up. On Wednesday, Ms. Pelosi plans to bring up a package of six bills to fund shuttered government agencies, ignoring Mr. Trump’s requests.The measures gained approval last year from Republicans on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees; in effect, Ms. Pelosi will be daring Republicans to vote against their own legislation. Democrats will also begin talking more about their own vision for border security — a shift in strategy for a party that has focused mostly on the economic and personal toll of the shutdown.Amid the posturing, however, there were some hints that Mr. Trump’s proposal, which he unveiled in a 13-minute White House address on Saturday, might open the door to talks that could result in a deal. Vice President Mike Pence, in an appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” suggested that Mr. Trump’s proposal might be amended on the Senate floor.“Well, of course,” Mr. Pence said, when the host, Chris Wallace, asked if he was open to negotiation. “The legislative process is a negotiation.”And Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a centrist Democrat, described Mr. Trump’s plan as “a starting point” on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” though he added, “You’ve got to start by reopening the government.”Polls show the public largely blames Mr. Trump for the shutdown, and his advisers have been searching for an exit strategy. Last week, Mr. McConnell told Mr. Trump, Mr. Pence and White House advisers that he needed the president to put forth a public offer so he could bring legislation to the floor.“McConnell’s view of shutdowns is when you’re in one, it’s a great opportunity for both sides to get things,” said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist and former McConnell aide who remains close to him. “And what I think is dumbfounding everyone here is: Why aren’t the Democrats treating it as a situation where they could get something? The president has opened the door for them to get something, so let’s talk.”Throughout his administration, Mr. Trump has sought to limit both legal and illegal immigration. Last year, he moved to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which shielded from deportation hundreds of thousands of young unauthorized immigrants known as Dreamers. He also revoked Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S., for some undocumented immigrants from Latin American and African countries.In the plan he unveiled on Saturday, Mr. Trump offered to restore the DACA and T.P.S. protections for three years. But Democrats say that is a nonstarter, because it does not offer a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, and because Mr. Trump is simply giving back protections that he himself took away.The McConnell aide, Don Stewart, said the Republican legislative package would include seven appropriations bills that would fund government agencies that have been partially closed for a month.“The legislation that the majority leader will bring to the floor this week would both reopen the remaining portions of the government, fund disaster relief, fund border security and address immigration issues that both Republicans and Democrats would like to address — all in one bill,” Mr. Stewart said.Mr. McConnell would need votes from all Republicans and seven Democrats for the package to pass. But only a handful of Democrats in Republican-leaning states might feel pressured enough to cross the aisle. A spokesman for one of them, Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, said Mr. Manchin — who just won re-election — would remain undecided on the Republican proposal until he saw it.In broadening the package beyond Mr. Trump’s plan, Mr. McConnell may be trying to pick up additional Democrats — especially those who are eager to vote for disaster relief.“He’s starting to move the pieces around to see what’s going to fly and what’s not going to make it,” said Jim Manley, who was a top aide to Harry Reid, the former Democratic leader from Nevada. “He’s trying to put the pressure back on Democrats, and he’s trying to see what the possibilities of a deal are by putting a larger package there. He’s trying to see how large the package has to be to bring Democrats on board.”But Mr. Trump seemed to be holding fast. He retweeted a series of endorsements of his proposal from Republican lawmakers on Sunday evening, and earlier in the day, he took aim at Ms. Pelosi and pushed back against conservative critics who have described the plan as amnesty for undocumented immigrants.“Nancy Pelosi and some of the Democrats turned down my offer yesterday before I even got up to speak,” Mr. Trump wrote. “They don’t see crime & drugs, they only see 2020 — which they are not going to win. Best economy! They should do the right thing for the Country & allow people to go back to work.”Mr. Trump went on: “Nancy Pelosi has behaved so irrationally & has gone so far to the left that she has now officially become a Radical Democrat. She is so petrified of the ‘lefties’ in her party that she has lost control...And by the way, clean up the streets in San Francisco, they are disgusting!”And to his conservative critics, Mr. Trump wrote: “No, Amnesty is not a part of my offer. It is a 3 year extension of DACA. Amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal, whether on immigration or something else. Likewise there will be no big push to remove the 11,000,000 plus people who are here illegally — but be careful Nancy!”Ms. Pelosi took to Twitter to strike back. “@realdonaldtrump, 800,000 Americans are going without pay. Re-open the government, let workers get their paychecks and then we can discuss how we can come together to protect the border,” she wrote, using the hashtag #EndTheShutdown."

Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]LOS ANGELES — The mayor of Yuma, Ariz., a town on the front lines of the latest surge in migration on the southwestern border, signed a proclamation of emergency on Tuesday as his community struggled to cope with an unprecedented number of migrant families released there by the Border Patrol.In a news conference posted on the town’s Facebook page, Mayor Douglas Nicholls said he was seeking help from state and federal authorities as a result of the “imminent threat” posed by “too many migrant releases into our community.”“It is something that we need to do to make sure that our community is maintained and that the human rights of all the migrants are maintained and that we have a path forward that respects both,” said Mr. Nicholls, who leads an agricultural city of about 100,000 people.“We are looking for a FEMA-type response. This is not a natural disaster, but it is a disaster either way. Their resources could come in and take care of the situation,” said the mayor, referring to the need for help from government resources such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency.A growing number of migrants are entering through remote areas of Arizona and New Mexico. Customs and Border Protection officials said more than 1,000 migrants had been apprehended in the Yuma sector over the past three days. On Saturday, a group of 50 Central Americans surrendered to agents in the area.Mr. Nicholls said local nonprofits had been doing their best to provide migrants with shelter, food and assistance to arrange travel to their final destinations in the interior of the country. However, “the transportation network is insufficient to keep up with demand. The backlog of people has created this capacity issue,” he said.Since opening three weeks ago, the only migrant shelter in Yuma has grown quickly, from housing 60 people at first to 200, its official maximum capacity. On Tuesday, it was sheltering 214 migrants, all of them men and women with children, and more were on their way.“With the amount of people arriving, this is very quickly escalating to the point we won’t be able to handle it,” said Capt. Jeffrey Breazeale, the Yuma County coordinator for the Salvation Army, which is running the shelter with the help of staff and volunteers from Catholic Community Services.“It’s a southern border crisis, and we are seeking help from the federal government,” Mr. Breazeale said. “The only way we know how to do that is declare an emergency.”A high-ranking border patrol official in Yuma said recently that officers there had been overwhelmed by an entirely new population of border crossers that the agency was not prepared to handle: families.From the beginning of the fiscal year on Sept. 1 through March 31, Yuma experienced a 273 percent increase in the number of migrants apprehended in the area by the Border Patrol, to 24,194 from 6,487 who arrived during the same period the previous fiscal year. The number of unaccompanied children taken in by authorities, totaling 3,679, was 51 percent higher.The Border Patrol has invested thousands of dollars on supplies — including feminine care products, diapers and baby formula — to help accommodate the influx of families. The Yuma office had been approved for overtime funding and additional agents, but none of it has been enough to handle the rising number of asylum seekers, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the situation.California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas have all been scrambling to handle the surge in migrant arrivals, most of whom are coming through Mexico from Central America. The number of families has eclipsed the number that arrived during the last spike, which occurred during the Obama administration.Despite the crush of the arrivals, authorities have not dropped migrants in the streets of Yuma. Mr. Nicholls said the city had not spent any of its own funds on the migrants, and had relied instead on donations from the community, for everything from coloring books to diapers.He said he had spoken with the staff of Gov. Doug Ducey, who will receive the declaration, and had held discussions with the Department of Homeland Security. He said he hoped that the emergency declaration would trigger further assistance.“This has moved faster than I believe anyone had predicted. The solution rests at the federal level,” said the mayor, adding that he planned to enlist other municipalities to take a similar stance."
39,"For a second consecutive week, “Saturday Night Live” avoided taking aim at President Trump and his administration in the show’s opening sketch. In fact, the sketch wasn’t even particularly political. (But don’t worry, there was still a surprise celebrity guest.)Beginning with a fake voice-over for MSNBC — “Now that the Mueller report turned out to be a big fat zero, we’re back to prison shows” — the sketch set up an episode of “Lockup: Chino Correctional Facility,” in which inmates played by Chris Redd, Kyle Mooney and Kenan Thompson boasted about the crimes that had put them behind bars.Enter Kate McKinnon, playing the actress Lori Loughlin. “Oh yeah?” McKinnon told the gang. “You think that’s insane? I paid 500 grand to get my daughter into U.S.C.”She added: “That’s not including the 300 grand I blew on tuition.”(She also said she owned the prison guards because “I helped their kids get into a really competitive pre-K,” and boasted that she was a Nation of Islam member because she’d “bought my way in for 100 grand.”)Next in the prison cell was Pete Davidson playing the lawyer Michael Avenatti,  who was indicted this week on dozens of charges.“I’m accused of crimes you can’t even conceive of,” he told the other inmates. “Like blackmailing a sneaker company. And stealing taxes from a coffee shop to fund a racecar team. I’m so shady that a porn star once said that she needs to distance herself from me.”He said he still planned to run for president, announcing his ticket as “Avenatti Baldwin 2020.”Played by Michael Keaton wearing a long white beard, the next prisoner to show up was the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who was arrested in London on Thursday.“I’m the architect of anarchy,” Keaton declared. “I’m the king of chaos. I’m the scourge of the cleaning staff at the Ecuadorean Embassy.”“Here’s how crazy I am,” he explained. “I’m wanted in the U.S. and Sweden; I’m from Australia; I live in London, in Ecuador — you try figuring that one out.”Keaton added: “I’m an actual James Bond super villain, and I’m one step away from destroying the [expletive] moon. So, you want to get nuts? Come on, let’s get nuts!”For good measure, Melissa Villaseñor appeared in the sketch as the rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine, explaining that she was in prison for less interesting reasons.“Just robbery and gun stuff,” she said.“S.N.L.” has been sending up “The View” since time immemorial, and this week it returned to the scene of that ABC daytime show. Leslie Jones played the host Whoopi Goldberg (“I’m as surprised as you that this show is a fit for me”), while Cecily Strong and Villaseñor played her round-table partners Abby Huntsman and Ana Navarro. But the sketch focused mainly on the recent bickering between the hosts Joy Behar (McKinnon) and Meghan McCain (Aidy Bryant).As Bryant declared in a meandering rant: “Can I just say something? As the princess of Arizona, there is a crisis at the border, and the border is right up in my Arizona, which was founded on sunburned women selling turquoise jewelry, not rando Mexicans. And that’s not racist, because my makeup artist is gay.”The night’s host, Emma Stone, played the former “View” host Jenny McCarthy, who has been an outspoken critic of vaccinations.“I don’t believe in vaccinations,” she said. “My doctor is Google; my scientist, Twitter; and my religion is Donnie Wahlberg.”At the “Weekend Update” desk, the anchors continued to riff on Assange’s arrest and on President Trump’s announcement that his administration was considering releasing migrants detained at the border into so-called sanctuary cities.“WikiLeaks founder and reason I put tape over my computer camera, Julian Assange, was arrested at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, and this dude did not go quietly,” the anchor Colin Jost began. A video played of the arrest, in which Assange shouts, “The U.K. has no civility!”Jost resumed:Jost went on to note that Trump had been asked about Assange’s arrest, showing a video in which the president says: “I know nothing, really, about him. It’s not my deal in life.”“What is your deal in life?” Jost asked. “I’m just genuinely curious, since you brought it up. Also, you cannot say that WikiLeaks is not your deal, because at some point it was like your whole deal.”Playing numerous clips in which Trump praised WikiLeaks, Jost responded with a reference to the night’s musical guest, a Korean boy band: “You’re more obsessed with WikiLeaks than this audience is with BTS.”The anchor Michael Che picked up the Trump thread:“Or, maybe he should send immigrants to New York,” Che continued, prompting an image of Trump Tower. “I know a huge building on Fifth Avenue where nobody wants to live anymore.”This week’s show featured performances by BTS, the first K-pop band to play on “Saturday Night Live.”If you’re wondering why their fans spent days camped outside NBC headquarters or why “S.N.L.” audience members burst into hoots, screams and applause any time the band’s name was mentioned, watch the video above, in which BTS performs “Boy With Luv” from its new album, “Map of the Soul: Persona.”"
40,"As President Trump continues his mad purge of the Department of Homeland Security, a sinister figure is emerging as the driving force behind all the chaos: Stephen Miller, the president’s top immigration adviser.A fierce restrictionist, Mr. Miller seems to have rarely met an immigrant he didn’t want to deport. He is among the hardest of hard-liners, known for spurring his boss to pursue ever more draconian measures.Not that Mr. Trump needs much encouragement. He did, after all, ascend to the White House on an immigrant-bashing, ethnonationalist platform as dishonest as it was divisive. Many of the administration’s uglier policy ideas have been a result of Mr. Trump’s failure to deliver on his signature campaign promise of a “big, beautiful” border wall. Small wonder Mr. Miller has emerged as his favorite consigliere on such matters. Mr. Miller’s preferred approach to immigration and border security is straight out of Ann Coulter’s fever dreams. He was a chief architect of the travel ban on citizens from Muslim-majority countries. He favors the building of tent cities at the border for warehousing asylum seekers. He’s agitating to end the 20-day limit on detaining migrant children. And he wants to reinstate the practice of snatching migrant children from their families — though this time he’d like to give parents a “binary choice” of having their kids taken from them or held with them in detention indefinitely.Mr. Miller is being credited with the blood bath at the Department of Homeland Security. Since Friday, a handful of top leaders have been, or are soon to be, shown the door, including the head of the Secret Service, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who was never quite ruthless enough for the president’s or Mr. Miller’s taste. More firings are expected as Mr. Miller moves to remake the department in his image.Bottom line, Stephen Miller is a man whose anti-immigration zeal remains unfettered by concern for the law, international norms or basic humanity.And yet. The portrait of the 33-year-old policy adviser as a figure of singular evil is both overly simplistic and counterproductive. Sure, the guy is a force for darkness, easing the president ever further into nativism. But no matter how much of the administration’s immigration agenda Mr. Miller has been responsible for, it’s taken a village to make that vision a reality. Giving too much credit to any one person builds up Mr. Miller, undeservedly, as a Machiavellian genius and lets many other folks off the hook.A society does not fall because of a small coterie of bad actors. Widespread rot requires legions of enablers, many of whom are driven by varying blends of personal ambition, ideological expedience and the self-aggrandizing delusion that, through their invaluable counsel, they can save the state from total destruction.Expect increasingly to hear this last rationalization from former administration officials starting redemption tours as they resume life outside the Trump bubble.Advisers like Kellyanne Conway, lawmakers like Senator Lindsey Graham and the former House Speaker Paul Ryan, party apparatchiks like the Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel and a whole host of Trump-friendly media personalities may not personally share the president’s views or policy aims. But their willingness to swallow some of the administration’s cruelest acts renders them complicit. Neither their reputations nor their consciences should be wiped clean.Take Ms. Nielsen. Since her departure was announced, she’s enjoyed some sympathy for having behaved less viciously than some in the White House desired. Throughout her tenure, stories bubbled up about how she incurred Mr. Trump’s wrath by dragging her feet on policies that would have run afoul of the law or thrown the nation into chaos. But she still carried out and aggressively enforced her share of atrocities.Now, defenders are portraying the woman who was in charge of caging migrant children as a hapless victim of the administration’s more unhinged forces.“The so-called immigration hard-liners have flailed about since the beginning of the administration, giving bad advice to the president and misdirecting resources toward the wrong solutions to the wrong problems,” Thad Bingel, a homeland security official under President George W. Bush and former aide to Ms. Nielsen, told The Times. “They apparently don’t want anyone like a Secretary Nielsen or Secretary Kelly, who deals in reality, to tell them or the president any of this.”No doubt, Ms. Nielsen had a difficult, perhaps impossible, job. But it was no profile in courage for her to cling to her morally untenable position until Mr. Trump gave her a shove.It’s tempting to see Stephen Miller as the archvillain of the Trump administration’s immigration policies. But there is much guilt to go around, and even reluctant collaborators cannot be allowed to absolve themselves of responsibility for the administration’s continuing outrages."
41,"WASHINGTON — President Trump appeared poised on Tuesday to end two months of scorched-earth confrontation without the money he demanded for a border wall as Republicans pressured him to accept a bipartisan spending deal rather than close the government again on Friday.Mr. Trump pronounced himself unsatisfied with the agreement brokered by House and Senate negotiators, and he refused to publicly commit to signing it. But he all but ruled out another government shutdown and emphasized that he would find “other methods” to finance a border barrier, leading aides and allies to predict he would grudgingly go along with the deal.“Am I happy at first glance?” the president said, speaking with reporters at the beginning of a cabinet meeting. “I just got to see it. The answer is no, I’m not. I’m not happy.”But he said he was “moving things around” in the budget from “far less important areas” to finance a wall even without explicit congressional approval, and he expressed no desire to repeat the standoff that shuttered many federal agencies for 35 days. “I don’t think you’re going to see a shutdown,” he said.Hours later, after a further briefing, Mr. Trump seemed to signal acceptance of the agreement, saying that it “will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources” and provide plenty of resources for border security even if not for the wall itself. “Regardless of Wall money,” he wrote on Twitter on Tuesday evening, “it is being built as we speak!”The compromise measure, assembled by senior members of both parties on Monday night, includes just $1.375 billion for new fencing along the border with Mexico, far short of the $5.7 billion Mr. Trump sought for a steel or concrete wall — and less even than the deal that he rejected in December, prompting the longest government shutdown in American history.The new measure will be taken up as early as Wednesday by the House, which is controlled by Democrats, followed by the Senate, which is run by Republicans.While some conservatives denounced it as a sellout, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, spoke with Mr. Trump by telephone on Tuesday and urged him to accept the compromise. “I hope he’ll sign it,” Mr. McConnell told reporters afterward. “I think he got a pretty good deal.”Mr. McConnell had initially sought to avoid the confrontation that has consumed the nation’s capital by pressing Mr. Trump to accept the previous measure in December, only to be surprised when the president changed his mind. However unenthusiastically, Mr. McConnell stood by the president for weeks and declined to put spending bills on the Senate floor that Mr. Trump would not sign.On Tuesday, however, Mr. McConnell made clear that he was ready to put the new spending package to a vote even though the president had not endorsed it and, notably, did not rule out overriding a veto if Mr. Trump turned against the compromise as he did two months ago.In an attempt to appease Mr. Trump, Republicans repeatedly referred to the deal as a “big down payment” on his wall and indicated that they were open to him transferring funds within the government to build more barriers. Mr. McConnell said he had no objection to the president using whatever “tools” were available. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee suggested using $800 million in drug interdiction funding to shore up border security in areas used by narcotic traffickers.Republicans also asserted that they scored a victory by fending off Democratic efforts to impose a stricter cap on the number of detention beds for arrested immigrants and by securing any money for a barrier given that Speaker Nancy Pelosi at one point rejected even a single dollar for a wall she deemed immoral.“It’s amazing how shutdown fatigue challenges your flexibility on things,” said Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, adding that he would most likely support the bill if the final text matched the descriptions he had been given.Current and former administration officials said on Tuesday that Mr. Trump seemed to be preparing to sign the bill and then reprogram as much money as he can on his own, although they cautioned that the president is unpredictable and his decision would depend on details still to be examined.Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who joined Mr. Trump on Monday at a rally in El Paso, told attendees at a Senate Republican lunch on Tuesday that his conversations with the president left him with the impression that Mr. Trump was preparing to “pivot” to a “yes” on the deal, according to a person in the room.Even Sean Hannity, the Fox News host who denounced the deal on Monday night as a “garbage compromise” that Republicans would have to answer for, said on Tuesday that he expected Mr. Trump to sign it to keep the government open and get his down payment. “He’s telegraphing what he’s going to do,” Mr. Hannity said on his radio program.Ann Coulter, the conservative commentator whose criticism helped push Mr. Trump into taking a tougher stand in December, agreed but castigated the president for it. “Trump talks a good game on the border wall but it’s increasingly clear he’s afraid to fight for it,” she wrote on Twitter. “Call this his ‘Yellow New Deal.’”Democrats, who had consented in December to give Mr. Trump $1.6 billion for border security, said this week’s agreement showed the folly of Mr. Trump’s brinkmanship. “The president had a better deal back in 2018,” said Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas. “He just ended up in a worse situation.”Mr. Trump told reporters that he was still thinking about declaring a national emergency to bypass Congress and finance wall construction on his own authority, but aides increasingly doubt he will, given opposition by Mr. McConnell and other Republicans.Instead, Mr. Trump seemed to be trying to frame the outcome on his own terms by insisting he would still be able to protect the border. “Right now, we’re building a lot of wall,” he said.In fact, no new walls have been built or financed by Congress based on the prototypes that the Trump administration unveiled in October 2017. Projects to replace or repair about 40 miles of existing barriers have been started or completed since 2017.Construction of the first extension of the current barriers, 14 miles of a levee wall in the Rio Grande Valley, is scheduled to begin this month, but a butterfly center has asked a judge to block construction because the barrier would bisect its property.In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Trump flip-flopped again on taking responsibility for the government shutdown. During the weeks leading up to the impasse, Mr. Trump said he would be “proud to shut down the government for border security” and would not blame Democrats. Then during the shutdown, as 800,000 federal workers were caught in the middle without paychecks, he blamed Democrats after all.On Tuesday, he switched gears again and took responsibility. “I accepted the first one, and I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished because people learned during that shutdown all about the problems coming in from the southern border,” he said. “I accept it. I’ve always accepted it. But this one, I would never accept it if it happens, but I don’t think it’s going to happen. But this would be totally on the Democrats.”As Mr. Trump weighed his options, one person familiar with his thinking described him as frustrated by months of Republicans not doing what he hoped to see done at the border.A few weeks ago, in a meeting with restrictionist immigration group leaders, Mr. Trump faulted former Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a fellow Republican, for repeatedly deferring action on the wall, with promises of doing it down the road. “Now he’s out fishing!” Mr. Trump declared, according to an attendee.The new agreement includes a provision that could give the Trump administration broad discretion to increase the number of slots to shelter detained migrants, a win for Republicans that could ease the sting of Mr. Trump’s failure to secure full funding for his wall.On its face, the agreement authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to fund about 40,000 beds for detainees, many of them in facilities run by for-profit companies and Immigration and Customs Enforcement near the border in Texas, Arizona and California.In background briefings, House Democratic aides described the language as a “glide path” from the current level of 49,000 detention beds back to Obama-era levels of 35,000 or fewer.But a summary of the provisions drafted by Senate Republican staff members placed the average number of beds funded under the deal at a much higher number — 45,274, including 2,500 for families. And that could rise to as many as 58,500 beds, Republican aides asserted in internal communications, because federal cabinet departments have latitude in how they use funds.Under the complex funding formula in the agreement, the Department of Homeland Security would have “reprogramming authority” to transfer as much as $750 million from other programs into detention.“In short, there is more than enough flexibility for ICE to respond to any forthcoming surges in illegal immigrations and apprehensions,” the document said.Two Democratic aides said the Republican memo was accurate in theory, but added that such a drastic expansion in beds was unlikely because it would require taking money from other important programs, such as disaster relief.Democrats on the committee that hashed out the deal, under pressure from immigrant rights groups and their party’s ascendant liberal wing, stalled talks over the weekend by demanding that any deal include a cap of 16,500 beds dedicated to housing detainees apprehended through sweeps of communities away from the border. There are currently 20,000 such slots.Immigrant rights advocates expressed disappointment. “For the last two years, we’ve been in a defensive posture, working to hold the line and prevent the bad, but now House Democrats have the power to start doing good,” said Lorella Praeli of the American Civil Liberties Union, which has sued the Trump administration over its detention policies.On the other side of the ideological divide, Representative Tom Graves, Republican of Georgia and one of the 17 House and Senate lawmakers negotiating a deal, said on Twitter that he had not signed off or seen a final agreement. But “based on the reports, I have concerns,” he said. “Lots of questions too.”Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and one of four lawmakers who worked out the accord, said he was not worried about objections from the right.“In some areas, we probably got more than a lot of people expected, and in some areas we didn’t get as much,” he said. “But that’s the nature of the beast.”"
42,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, defended President Trump’s threat to end assistance to three Central American countries and to close parts of the United States border with Mexico next week, saying on Sunday that it would take “something dramatic” to prevent Mr. Trump from carrying out that plan.“Why are we talking about closing the border?” Mr. Mulvaney said in an interview on ABC’s “This Week.” “Not to try and undo what’s happening, but simply to say, ‘look we need the people from the ports of entry to go out and patrol in the desert where we don’t have a wall.’”Mr. Trump’s attempt to seal off the border by building a wall, and mulling the closure of ports to tamp down on immigration and drug smuggling, is at odds with a nagging reality: Smuggling activity largely comes through ports of entry, according to government data. And the president’s move to cut off aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador ignores a longstanding strategy touted by aid groups and military experts — including the president’s former chief of staff — that supporting those countries actually makes the border safer.Still, Mr. Trump spent the week emboldened by the results of his attorney general’s summary of a report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, that said that he and his campaign had not cooperated with the Russian government. The president immediately turned back to immigration as a red-meat issue for supporters ahead of the 2020 election.“I’m not playing games,” he told reporters during a weekend in Florida, which followed a week spent berating the Democratic Party for what he called lax immigration laws, assailing countries he has accused of doing little to stop the flow of migrant traveling north, and disparaging individual travelers seeking asylum as part of a “big fat con job.”In the interview, Mr. Mulvaney criticized Jeh Johnson, who led the Department of Homeland Security under President Barack Obama, for saying in an interview last week that the situation at the border was “truly in a crisis.” Last month, 76,000 migrants were apprehended crossing the border — an 11-year high — and the crossings are expected to increase again this month.“We hate to say we told you so,” Mr. Mulvaney said. “We need border security, and we’re going to do the best we can with what we have.”In recent weeks, Border Patrol facilities along the southwestern border have been strained to a breaking point by the largest influx of migrants in years. The numbers are growing, in part, because travelers are hoping to make the journey north before summertime. Officials in El Paso resorted to creating a makeshift encampment under a bridge last week when the main border processing facility in the area was strained to 400 percent of its capacity.A full or partial sealing of the border would effectively close off the United States from one of its largest trading partners, and it could leave American citizens who cross back and forth with a sluggish or potentially nonexistent system of returning to the United States. Mr. Trump will travel to Calexico, Calif., to tour the border on Friday.Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, said in a statement on Friday that she had asked volunteers to add more support at the border, and suggested that American citizens may encounter difficulty getting through as a result.And by directing the State Department to revoke aid from the three Northern Triangle countries, Mr. Trump is seeking to punish those countries for what he says is a failure to stop migrant caravans from making their way north.Leaders of those countries have said they are committed to solving the problem, despite what Mr. Trump has said. In 2017, the United States gave $420 million to Central American countries struggling with violence. According to the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, a nonprofit organization that supports diplomatic efforts of the United States, the Northern Triangle countries committed about ten times that amount, or $5.4 billion, to improve conditions.“American aid to Central America is not charity, but an investment in our national security,” Liz Schrayer, the president of the coalition, said in a statement. “The idea of suspending the relatively small, but essential foreign assistance to the region will only exacerbate the root causes driving people to flee their homes — brutal violence, hunger and instability.”In an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN’s “State of the Union,” who pointed out to him that experts within the president’s own administration have said aid money has helped curb violence in and migration from El Salvador, Mr. Mulvaney shrugged off the data from “career staffers” and said the money had not done enough.“If we’re going to give these countries hundreds of millions of dollars, we would like them to do more,” he said. “If it’s working so well why are the people still coming?”Mr. Mulvaney’s comments represent a rightward shift for an administration that has already taken a publicly hard-line stance on immigration. In May 2017, John F. Kelly, the president’s former chief of staff and former top officer of the military’s Southern Command, said during an Atlantic Council meeting that his experience showed him that partnering with Northern Triangle countries was key to securing the border.“If we can improve the conditions — the lot of life of Hondurans, Guatemalans, Central Americans,” Mr. Kelly, then speaking in his capacity as homeland security secretary, “we can do an awful lot to protect the southwest border.”"
43,"MERIDA, Mexico — Business and political leaders from the U.S. and Mexico gathered Friday to promote greater trade at a time when actions by both governments have rattled investors, expressing optimism despite times of uncertainty and tensions over the border and illegal immigration.Investment in Mexico has been cool pending passage of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement that is meant to update NAFTA, and due to other concerns for the global economy, and attendees saw ratification as a solution to that.Thomas Donohue, president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, stressed the valuable U.S.-Mexico relationship, noting that every day the countries do more than $1.7 billion in trade and some 500,000 people cross their shared border legally for work, school, or tourism.""That's why we have fought vigorously for the successful completion of the USMCA,"" Donohue said, ""and we're going to keep up that fight until the deal is ratified and implemented."" He also called for Washington to lift steel and aluminum tariffs against Mexico and Canada before Congress considers the trade deal.In remarks to assembled executives and political leaders, Donohue issued a pointed rejection of President Donald Trump's recent threats to close the United States' southern border and warnings to immigrants not to come because ""our country is full.""""America has the lowest level of unemployment in 65 years. Simply stated, we're out of people,"" Donohue said, adding that the business community was leading efforts to expand the U.S. labor pool and toward passage of ""an effective immigration bill as soon as possible.""That message resonated well with the Mexican audience.""We just heard that the United States has money and lacks people. We lack money and have people to spare,"" said Carlos Salazar Lomelín, president of Mexico's Coordinating Business Council. ""There's no ... more clear reason to be allies.""Donohue's and Salazar's organizations signed a cooperation agreement at the end of the meeting. Also Friday, Mexico's lower house of Congress approved a labor reform aimed at ensuring workers can freely vote for their union representation and contracts, a change needed to win approval of the USMCA.While Trump recently walked back his threat to seal the country's southern frontier, redeployments of border agents to handle a surge of migrant families led to long wait times at points of entry, with drivers sleeping in their trucks to keep their place in line.Possible disruption of the cross-border industrial supply chain worried some at the gathering.""For purposes of enforcement (the administration) is drawing down on what is needed to move trading, to move people and goods legally and efficiently across our points of entry,"" said Antonio Garza, former U.S. ambassador to Mexico.Laurence Fink, chairman and CEO of investment management firm BlackRock, spoke of ample investment opportunities in Mexico and called for the two neighbors to work together.""I am deeply saddened by the rancor and the tension that has grown between our countries. .... Antagonism between our nations dehumanizes and demands, it poisons the well of economic opportunity and dims the vision that businesses, workers and investors have about what is truly possible.However Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has rattled some nerves by canceling a multibillion-dollar airport project for the capital that was already about a third built shortly after taking office Dec. 1.Representatives were promoting his signature infrastructure project Friday: an ambitious ""Maya Train"" that would link cities, beach resorts and archaeological ruins in the country's southeast. During a dinner gala the previous night at a lavish hacienda north of Merida, Mexican officials assured the guayabera-clad executives that their investments would be safe.Still, Mexico has work to do to woo foreign capital. Mexican political and economic analyst Macario Schettino wrote recently for the newspaper El Financiero that unless trends change, investment could fall 5% in the first trimester and possibly remain at similar levels throughout 2019.López Obrador said Mexico remains committed to things such as strengthening rule of law, policies favoring investment, lowering taxes and raising wages without harming business, and respecting contracts. He also promised to work with Central American nations that are the source of much northward migration to ensure that leaving one's country ""is optional, not forced.""U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said after meeting with Mexican Energy Secretary Rocío Nahle and Chief of Staff Alfonso Romo that there is no desire to roll back reforms that opened the energy sector to private companies five years ago under López Obrador's predecessor, then-President Enrique Peña Nieto — only an intention to review and evaluate their performance.""I didn't get any indication that they were looking to undo those reforms or somehow upend that effort. .... What we heard from Mr. Romo and what we heard from Minister Nahle is that they understand the sanctity of contracts, and that's very important for U.S. companies,"" Brouillette said.Often historically tricky, U.S.-Mexico relations became particularly fraught following the election of Trump, who repeatedly hammered the United States' southern neighbor on trade, the border and migration.""I congratulate the new presidential administration in Mexico for its strong emphasis on improving the economic development of this region in particular,"" U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said at the gala. ""We also thank them for assisting us as we confront the crisis at our southern border.""Mexico is the United States' second-largest export market and its third-biggest trading partner, with more than $678 billion in goods and services changing hands last year, according to Ross. U.S. foreign direct investment in Mexico was over $109 billion in 2017, he added, and Mexican investment in the United States has reached more than $35 billion.As the 2020 presidential campaign ramps up, candidate Trump is seen as likely to try to keep illegal immigration front-and-center as meat for his base.""When he is competing electorally or out there on the stump, he goes to a dark place, and Mexico is often in that place,"" said Shannon O'Neil, senior fellow for Latin American studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.""Whether it's immigration or drugs or other security threats or Mexico's effect on the economy as he perceives it, I think that will be the mainstay of his rhetoric,"" said O'Neil, who was not at the Merida gathering.Before López Obrador took office in December, many had been concerned about possible clashes between Trump and the leftist populist who won the presidency in his third try. But so far, ties between Washington and Mexico City seem to have generally held up well, with the two administrations working closely on a number of bilateral issues and López Obrador officials reluctant to react to critical tweets from Trump.Mexican officials said in Merida that from the earliest days, López Obrador's administration has looked to private sector leaders in both countries, executives with deep and longstanding cross-border ties, for cues on navigating what they expected to be a trying relationship.""I should thank President Donald Trump for being open to dealing with our commercial, migratory and security issues with respect and in a way that I consider most effective,"" López Obrador said, ""through permanent dialogue and with cooperation for development."""
44,"CONCORD, N.H. — A New Hampshire auto shop owner facing deportation to Lebanon for crimes committed 14 years ago has been denied a pardon that would have allowed him to remain in the country.Alain Ata, 34, came to the U.S. with his family at age 10. He spent several years in prison for a pair of burglaries in December 2004. Since then he has opened an auto shop in Manchester. He takes care of his elderly parents and is engaged to be married. He told Gov. Chris Sununu and the governor's Executive Council last week that he is an honest man with a good heart who has been punished enough for mistakes in his youth.But the five-member council denied his request Wednesday on a vote of 3-1. Councilor Russell Prescott, a Republican, abstained from voting in protest over the council's refusal to delay the vote by several weeks so he could gather more information. Prescott said earlier in the meeting that he supported the pardon.""It's hard to get things right all the time,"" he said. ""I believe he has paid his debt to society.""While Ata's request comes at a time when the Trump administration has been cracking down on illegal immigration, federal immigration officials started deportation proceedings in his case years ago. Ata's lawyer said he essentially has remained on ""immigration probation"" because Lebanon officials haven't submitted the necessary paperwork yet.Councilor Andru Volinsky, a Democrat, said that while U.S. immigration policies have many shortcomings, Ata was undeserving of a pardon because of his behavior since leaving prison, including causing serious injury in a drunken driving crash and violating a domestic violence protective order by contacting an ex-girlfriend and mother of his child. According to a county prosecutor, that woman's stepfather was the victim of one of the burglaries.Ata declined to speak to reporters after the vote, saying only ""thank you."" During his hearing last week, he asked for a second chance, and said he lives in fear of losing everything he has worked so hard to achieve.""If I were to be deported I would be torn from everything I love, the business I built, my daughter and my fiancée who means the world to me. I wouldn't be here to support my family and I would end up in a country I left as a 10-year-old,"" he said. ""A country where I have no friends, no family and a grim future.""His sister broke down in tears as she described the prospect of her brother being sent back to a war-torn, poverty-stricken country. Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department issued a travel advisory saying U.S. citizens should reconsider or avoid travel to certain areas of Lebanon because of the threats of terrorism, armed clashes, kidnapping and outbreaks of violence.""My brother will have zero chance at survival,"" Della Khoury said."""
45,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump had had it.The flow of migrants at the southern border was surging. Another caravan appeared to be forming. And his government had run out of holding space, forcing the release of tens of thousands of families apprehended at the border.During a meeting with senior aides on the last Thursday in March, Trump demanded drastic action to make good on the threat he'd tweeted that morning: Shut the southern border. Curbing illegal immigration was his signature issue, he railed. Why couldn't he deliver?Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen urged the president to reconsider. Her agency had already diverted hundreds of border agents away from certain crossings to process migrant families elsewhere, creating what would soon become considerable bottlenecks. Closing ports completely, she reasoned, would only encourage migrants to cross elsewhere — illegally.Trump wasn't having it. Shut the ports at El Paso, Texas, at noon tomorrow, he ordered. End of meeting.The directive set off a frantic behind-the scenes push to get Trump to change his mind, and he ultimately relented. But the episode launched a turbulent 12-day stretch that would lead to the eventual resignation of Nielsen, the potential dismissal of much of her agency's top leadership and the beginning of a new phase in which immigration hard-liners at the White House are determined to wield considerably more influence over Homeland Security.This account is based on interviews with 20 administration officials, congressional aides and people familiar with the events, many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal deliberations.___ON BORROWED TIMETrump and Nielsen's relationship was never especially close. Nielsen had been picked for the top Homeland Security job at the urging of her predecessor, John Kelly, who left to become Trump's White House chief of staff. Trump had always been suspicious of her, in part because she'd worked for former President George W. Bush. She had been widely expected to leave the department last fall after Kelly's departure from the White House, but she appeared to get back on Trump's good side during the government shutdown, when she served as one of the top defenders of his push to build a southern border wall.But Nielsen took the brunt of Trump's fury over rising border crossing numbers, and the situation was only getting worse. Aides spent months desperately trying to come up with new solutions, and some tried to steer Trump away from more drastic measures, including his talk of reinstating the family separation policy that prompted international outrage.While Nielsen had doubts at times, she had dutifully carried out Trump's orders, taking ownership of his most divisive policies, including the family separations, and spending months trying to broker arrangements with Central American countries, including Mexico. But it also fell to Nielsen to explain to Trump the legal limits of things he wanted to do. And he didn't like it.It didn't help that Kelly had been critical of Trump in appearances since he left the White House — something Trump held against Nielsen. Or that John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, had been pushing for Nielsen's ouster since last fall, telling Trump he didn't think her leadership or policies were effective.___A TRIP CUT SHORTNielsen had just landed in Europe last week for her first time as secretary when she decided to rush back to Washington, landing early Tuesday morning.Though aides had succeeded in talking Trump down from his border closure threat the week before, he had continued to crank up his rhetoric, warning by tweet that if Mexico didn't ""immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States through our Southern Border,"" he would be ""CLOSING"" the border, or large sections of it within a week.By Wednesday, Nielsen was at the border, overseeing efforts to keep asylum seekers in Mexico and preparing for the president's Friday visit to Calexico, California.But the night before Trump's visit, a puzzling notice arrived on Capitol Hill: Trump was withdrawing his nomination of Ron Vitiello to permanently lead the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. It had to be a mistake, staffers reasoned. Why would Trump be spiking his own nominee, a well-respected and longtime border official who appeared to be cruising to confirmation?Vitiello got a call that night from senior Trump aide Stephen Miller informing him that he wouldn't be joining the president on his trip to the border the next morning. There was no explanation.Nielsen had received no heads-up.But word began to spread that his nomination was being yanked.""We want to go in a tougher direction"" was all Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Friday morning.It was Step One of the plot to purge DHS leadership.Nielsen joined Trump at the border, echoing his words at a roundtable with border officers and local law enforcement and standing by Trump's side as they toured a section of newly rebuilt border fencing, introducing him to local officials.But inside she was fuming.___DUSTING OFF A LETTERNielsen returned to Washington on a Coast Guard Gulfstream as Trump continued onto California and Nevada to do some fundraising. By that night, murmurs were swirling that Vitiello's removal wasn't a one-off and that Miller was orchestrating a wholesale leadership overhaul of her department.Already frustrated by what she saw as insufficient help from departments like Justice and Health and Human Services, with clear signs that White House hard-liners were on the ascent, Nielsen pulled up the resignation letter she'd written months before — just in case.She went into a Sunday White House meeting with Trump that she'd requested not sure if she'd be fired, resign or stay to fight another day.It was, by all accounts, a cordial conversation in the Yellow Oval Room of the White House residence, with acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney in attendance. Nielsen had come prepared with a list of ideas to share with the president. But the two quickly agreed the arrangement was no longer working. Trump wanted to go in a different direction.Nielsen resigned on the spot. Trump tweeted the news before she could get her letter out.___THE PURGEStanding outside her home in Alexandria, Virginia, on Monday, Nielsen sounded just as loyal to Trump as she had at the border.""I will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis,"" she said, thanking the president ""for the tremendous opportunity to serve this country.""By the end of the day, the department she had led appeared to be on the cusp of being dismantled, with the head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the department's general counsel among those expected to be pushed out.""It's time to do things a little differently,"" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said on Fox News Channel. ""And so the president's looking around to reshape his team so he can have the people in place to carry out his agenda.""___Associated Press writer Zeke Miller contributed to this report."
46,"A recent survey asked Republicans and Democrats whether they agreed with the statement that members of the opposition party “are not just worse for politics — they are downright evil.”The answers, published in January in a paper, “Lethal Mass Partisanship,” were startling, but maybe they shouldn’t have been.Just over 42 percent of the people in each party view the opposition as “downright evil.” In real numbers, this suggests that 48.8 million voters out of the 136.7 million who cast ballots in 2016 believe that members of opposition party are in league with the devil.The mass partisanship paper was written by Nathan P. Kalmoe and Lilliana Mason, political scientists at Louisiana State University and the University of Maryland.Kalmoe and Mason, taking the exploration of partisan animosity a step farther, found that nearly one out of five Republicans and Democrats agree with the statement that their political adversaries “lack the traits to be considered fully human — they behave like animals.”Their line of questioning did not stop there.How about: “Do you ever think: ‘we’d be better off as a country if large numbers of the opposing party in the public today just died’?”Some 20 percent of Democrats (that translates to 12.6 million voters) and 16 percent of Republicans (or 7.9 million voters) do think on occasion that the country would be better off if large numbers of the opposition died.We’re not finished: “What if the opposing party wins the 2020 presidential election. How much do you feel violence would be justified then?” 18.3 percent of Democrats and 13.8 percent of Republicans said violence would be justified on a scale ranging from “a little” to “a lot.”Kalmoe and Mason analyzed the data to see what kind of voter was likely to adopt extremely critical views of the opposition party: One personal trait stood out: “Aggression was the only factor that predicted all three types of lethal partisan attitudes.”Contrary to the expectation that the losers of elections might be more inclined to violence, the two authors determined that winning increases support for violence against the opposition.There was “significantly more support for partisan violence among strong partisans when told their party was more likely than not to win in 2020.”Overall, the authors wrote, “our evidence suggests that winning more than losing prompts strong partisans to feel less opposed to partisan violence.”As partisan hostility deepens, there is one group that might ordinarily be expected to help pull the electorate out of this morass — the most knowledgeable and sophisticated voters.According to a forthcoming study, however, it is just these voters who display the most uncritical acceptance of party orthodoxy, left or right. On both sides, the best informed voters are by far the most partisan.In “Understanding Partisan Cue Receptivity,” Bert N. Bakker and Yphtach Lelkes, professors at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research and the University of Pennsylvania, and Ariel Malka, a professor of psychology at Yeshiva University, find that knowledgeable, politically engaged voters are the most likely “to adopt issue attitudes that are cued as party-consistent in the political information environment.” In plain language, the most active voters — those notably “high in cognitive resources” — are the most willing to accept policy positions endorsed by their party, and they are doing so not out of principle, but to affirm their identity as a Democrat or Republican. They are expressing “the desire to reach conclusions that are consistent with a valued identity.”The authors call this process “identity expression” or a “tendency of partisans to adopt issue attitudes that are cued as party-consistent in the political information environment.”This willingness to adopt a policy position not out of conviction but out of a desire to conform to partisan priorities reflects an urge, they write, “to bolster and protect valued political identities by expressing and rationalizing the viewpoints cued to be consistent with these identities.”In an email, Lelkes wrote that he and his co-authors felt it important “to be careful about causal reasoning.” They concluded their article with this commentary:These two papers raise a set of basic questions about group identity: Why are partisan divisions sharpening now and are these conflicts likely to become more aggravated?Robert Kurzban, the author of “The Hidden Agenda of the Political Mind,” argues that domestic politics have taken on a moralistic, judgmental cast:Any deviation, Kurzban continued in an email, is likely to be severely punished: Steven Pinker, a professor of psychology at Harvard, argues that it is the activation of group identity — of the friend-enemy type, about which I have written before — that is driving hostile polarization:But, he continued,Instead, Pinker argued,Pinker cited the questions raised in the work of Kurzban and Peter DeScioli, a political scientist at Stony Brook, wonderingDeScioli provided some answers to the question in his replies to my queries:Moral condemnation, DeScioli wrote, is aMoral condemnation and approbation can both be useful to encourage productive cooperation within a group, but they can also be deeply destructive when used to demonize and humiliate outsiders.John Hibbing, a political scientist at the University of Nebraska, makes the case that polarization has intensified becauseWhile as recently as 30 years ago, there were a fair number of conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans who held views contrary to the majority of their respective parties, Hibbing wrote,Hibbing dismissed the argument that people have “become tribal because of changes in the media environment.” Instead, he wrote,Kevin Smith, who is also a political scientist at the University of Nebraska, argues that For much of the twentieth century, according to this line of thinking, the first world war, the Great Depression, the second world war and the Cold War filled much of the need for an in-group versus out-group configuration. During this period, Smith said, there were consensual “sources of information” and political parties “that were relatively nonideological” with many members “willing to cross the aisle to cut deals.”In recent years, “a lot of that has gone,” Smith told me. “Political parties are now deeply ideological,” which makes it easier toWhen, if ever, will things improve? Jonathan Haidt, a psychologist at N.Y.U., is not optimistic. He emailed:Why?Two of the most insightful people on evolved human behavior are Leda Cosmides and John Tooby, professors of psychology and anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara.Cosmides and Tooby explore the complexities and ambiguities of moral reasoning in their seminal essay “Groups in Mind: The Coalitional Roots of War and Morality,” which concludes on an appropriately ambiguous note:In a lengthy email that I cannot fully do justice to in this column, Tooby wrote that everybodyThis, in turn, encourages evolved mental programs that support self-advantageous information warfare: Of all the signals an individual hears, and out of all the spontaneous thoughts that teem in our minds, each individual filters, remembers, and broadcasts what benefits her in building up herself and her allies, and downgrades those who are her rivals.Tooby added: “I think we cannot begin to appreciate how immense and all-encompassing this process is.”Tooby pointed to group pressure to adopt down the line agreement on issues when there is, in fact, much room for dissent and disagreement:Even more important, he writes,Leda Cosmides expressed some of her ideas about the connection between us-and-them thinking and evil, the topic with which I began this column, in an interview that was originally published in a Chilean newspaper in 2001 and still resonates:She went on:This work is far from done."
47,"WASHINGTON — President Trump criticized Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras on Thursday for accepting monetary aid from the United States but doing nothing in return, a day after his homeland security secretary struck what she described as a historic agreement with three of those same countries to help strengthen security on the United States’ southwestern border.Mr. Trump also threatened to close the border, a move he has previously considered, which would have a significant economic impact by disrupting the flow of trade and labor.Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen met on Tuesday with Mexican officials in Miami and on Wednesday  with Central American officials in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, to discuss the humanitarian crisis and what the Trump administration considers a security emergency at the United States-Mexico border.“I’m pleased to announce the U.S. & our Northern Triangle allies have reached a HISTORIC agreement to confront the root causes of the crisis on our border,” Ms. Nielsen said on Twitter on Wednesday. “Working with Central American govts to increase security & prosperity in the region has been one of my greatest priorities.”The countries agreed to continue having conversations about ways to counter human trafficking, smuggling, organized crime and gangs, and to improve border security throughout the region.Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, said on Thursday that his country was in constant communication with the United States and would maintain “a very respectful relationship” with its neighbor.It was not immediately clear what caused Mr. Trump’s outrage early Thursday, and later he wrote that “Mexico, with the strongest immigration laws in the World, refuses to help with illegal immigration & drugs!” The remarks came on the heels of House Democrats’ refusal to sign off on a Defense Department request to redirect funds to be used to help build the president’s border wall.“Instead of focusing on readiness, hurricane recovery and other genuine issues, the administration continues to spend billions of dollars on an imaginary crisis,” Representative Adam Smith of Washington, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement on Tuesday.The Trump administration has long described the situation at the border as a national security emergency, but Democrats have disputed that characterization.The acting defense secretary, Patrick M. Shanahan, said on Wednesday that despite the objection from lawmakers, the Pentagon would move forward with the plan to reprogram funds to be used for the border wall.In February, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency on the southern border, providing for military funds to be shifted to help build the wall. The decision provoked outrage from Democratic and Republican lawmakers over the constitutional separation of powers. The president vetoed a resolution to block his declaration, and on Tuesday the House failed to overturn that veto.Defense Department officials have said they do not need congressional approval to divert funds and use them for the wall."
48,"To the Editor:Re “Mr. Trump’s Shutdown Was a Cruel Joke” (editorial, Jan. 26):While this editorial makes good points about the cruelty and folly of the shutdown, the negative tone misses an opportunity. President Trump made a courageous and mature decision Friday to reopen the government. In the best interest of the whole country, he dared the predictable avalanche of “caving” and “incompetence” insults from both the right and the left.So let’s give him the praise and appreciation he deserves. If even his “enemies” like us are fair to him now, in his next tight spot he may be encouraged to decide as wisely again.Betsy DurenTucsonTo the Editor:As a Democrat I’d like to let President Trump know that I hope his failure to bully Speaker Nancy Pelosi into paying for the wall is the beginning of the end of the bombast and incompetence he has shown in his first two years in office.

The wall debate has nothing to do with the actual merits or costs of constructing a wall. For Republicans, it’s a symbol of getting tough on illegal immigration. For Democrats, it’s a means of thwarting President Trump and gaining popularity among liberal and Latino voters. For the nation, it’s a symptom of politics trumping good government. William M.

49,"[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]ALBUQUERQUE — The Border Patrol is taking the unusual step of shutting down its interior checkpoints across New Mexico and a swath of West Texas as officials scramble to respond to a surge in families requesting asylum along the Southwest border.A spokesman for the Border Patrol said the temporary measure was intended to help provide “appropriate care” for migrants apprehended at the border. The closing of checkpoints — not at the border, but up to 100 miles inland — reflects the strain on border operations as the number of migrants entering the country, which in February reached an 11-year high, continues to climb.The authorities closed checkpoints across the Border Patrol’s El Paso sector, which includes 121,000 square miles in New Mexico and 4,500 square miles in Texas, in order to free more agents to work directly on the border.“To process and ensure appropriate care for those in custody, resources including personnel have been diverted from other border security priorities,” Customs and Border Protection officials said in a statement on the closings, first reported by Texas Monthly. “This is intended as a temporary measure. Checkpoints are integral to U.S.B.P.’s border security mission.”At some of the checkpoints on major highways, orange cones could be seen blocking off access to the roads along which motorists normally are funneled to checkpoints for queries about citizenship status and visual inspection of vehicles.Agents at the Border Patrol checkpoints arrest relatively few unauthorized migrants, and most of those who are seeking asylum quickly surrender to the authorities at the border. The agents at the checkpoints deal largely with seizures of marijuana and other drugs from motorists.The checkpoints have emerged as a source of contention with human rights groups, which have contended that Border Patrol agents routinely ignore their legal authority during the traffic stops to search people without warrants. By law, agents must have probable cause to search the interior of a vehicle, though an alert from a drug-sniffing dog “legitimately” alerts to the presence of drugs, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.The Border Patrol operates about 170 checkpoints throughout the country. Checkpoints outside the El Paso sector are thought to be operating normally.The influx of asylum seekers is placing stress on immigration officials, volunteer shelters and religious charities along much of the Southwest border, as they struggle to assist the migrants.Border Patrol agents in El Paso said last week that they had apprehended more than 400 unauthorized immigrants during a five-minute period. Most of them were unaccompanied youths or people traveling in family units, the agency said.“We do not have a way to care for the numbers who are coming,” the Homeland Security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, said during a visit to South Texas this month. “We don’t have the facilities, we don’t have the legal processes, we don’t have the laws that enable us to quickly process their claims to protect them.”Immigrants recently released by federal authorities in South Texas overflowed a respite center run by Catholic Charities this month, bathing their babies in sinks and waiting in long lines for food, bus tickets and medical attention. The immigrants, most fleeing poverty and gang violence in Central America, described the conditions they faced in custody as cold and crowded.“It was freezing,” Cecilio, a 31-year-old from Guatemala, said while sitting behind the respite center with his 7-year-old son. The Border Patrol’s processing centers, like the one in McAllen, Tex., where immigrants are housed temporarily after being apprehended, are known in the immigrant community as “las hieleras,” or iceboxes, because they are often kept so cold.The authorities in most cases are supposed to hold immigrants for no longer than 72 hours, yet five immigrants last week, interviewed by The New York Times, said they were held longer than that. One of them, Cecilio, who asked to be referred to by only his first name, said he and his son were in custody for eight days.President Trump has pointed to the influx of migrants as evidence of a crisis justifying his call for building a wall on the border.But elected officials in parts of the borderlands, including Representative Vicente Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat, say that the recent mass releases of migrants without plans for housing them amounts to a fabricated crisis aimed at mustering support for the administration’s plans.In any case, more migrant families are continuing to make their way toward the United States. A new caravan of about 1,200 migrants began moving toward the border over the weekend from southern Mexico."

But he demurred when asked whether he has briefed the White House on it.• The Justice Department inspector general expects to finish an examination of aspects of the Russia investigation by May or June, Mr. Barr revealed.• Mr. Barr has tried to keep the appropriations hearing focused on the department’s proposed $29.2 billion budget, which includes money for 100 new immigration judges as President Trump hardens his stance on immigration along the southwestern border.Mr. Barr, hit immediately with questions about his handling of the Mueller report by Democrats, reiterated his vow to be as transparent as possible and said that he will turn over a redacted version of the report to Congress and the public within a week.Mr. Barr went over the categories of information he says he must black out — like information that is subject to grand-jury secrecy rules — and said that whatever he censors in the report, he will identify the reason.“This process is going along very well and my original timetable of being able to release this by mid-April stands,” he said. “And so I think that from my standpoint, within a week I will be in a position to release the report to the public.”Representative José E. Serrano, Democrat of New York and the head of the appropriations subcommittee that covers the Justice Department, pressed Mr. Barr to say whether the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, or his staff had played any role in drafting or reviewing two letters that Mr. Barr sent to Congress late last month about the report. Mr. Barr said that the special counsel had not participated in writing those letters, nor seen them in advance, though he gave Mr. Mueller the chance to see his letter summarizing the investigation’s main findings.“The letter of the 24th, Mr. Mueller’s team did not play a role in drafting that document, although we offered him the opportunity to review it before we sent it out and he declined that,” Mr. Barr said. “The letter on the 29th, I don’t believe that that was reviewed by Mr. Mueller or that they participated in drafting that letter.”Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York and chairwoman of the full Appropriations Committee, pressed Mr. Barr to say whether the White House has seen or been briefed on the contents of the Mueller report beyond what was in his letters about it to Congress. But Mr. Barr refused to answer.“I’ve said what I’m going to say about the report today,” he said. “I’ve issued three letters about it. I was willing to discuss the historic information of how the report came to me and my decision on Sunday,” March 24, when he wrote a four-page letter to Congress laying out the special counsel’s top-line findings.“But I’ve already laid out the process that is going forward to release these reports hopefully within a week,” he added. “I’m not going to say anything more about it until the report is out and everyone has a chance to look at it.”In the past, Justice Department officials have said that Mr. Barr had not shown the White House any part of the Mueller report or briefed Mr. Trump’s team about its contents. His demurral on Tuesday raised the possibility that the situation has shifted and the White House knows more than the public or Congress about what Mr. Mueller said.Democrats who lead the House Appropriations Committee were eager to press Mr. Barr on what one called “the elephant in the room”: his handling of the highly anticipated special counsel’s report.“The American people have been left with many unanswered questions; serious concerns about the process by which you formulated your letter; and uncertainty about when we can expect to see the full report,” Mr. Serrano said in his opening remarks.“I think it would strike a serious blow to our system and yes to our democracy if that report is not fully seen,” he added.Democrats have criticized Mr. Barr’s decision to share Mr. Mueller’s top-line findings in a four-page letter that quoted sparingly from the report itself and his declaration that Mr. Trump had not committed an obstruction-of-justice offense after Mr. Mueller declined to make a prosecutorial judgment. They renewed their complaints after The New York Times revealed last week that some of Mr. Mueller’s investigators have complained that Mr. Barr failed to fully represent their findings and that they were more damaging for the president than the attorney general indicated.On Tuesday, they had their first chance to level criticism in person. Ms. Lowey called Mr. Barr’s handling of the Mueller report “unacceptable” and questioned how quickly he summarized the findings in his March 24 letter.“Even for someone who has done this job before,” she said, referring to Mr. Barr’s first stint as attorney general in the 1990s, “I would argue it is more suspicious than impressive.”Batting back Democrats’ criticism, Mr. Barr insisted that he had accurately delivered the “bottom-line” conclusions of the special counsel’s investigation in his letter to Congress and warned that attempting to quickly summarize the report more fully would have exposed him to a minefield of potential criticism.Asked about The Times’s reporting on frustrations among some of Mr. Mueller’s investigators about the narrow scope of his letter laying out their findings, Mr. Barr appeared unswayed.“I was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize,” Mr. Barr said, “because I think any summary, regardless of who prepares it, not only runs the risk of being under-inclusive or over-inclusive, but also would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once.”Each page of the report was marked that it might contain secret grand jury material and could not be readily released anyway, he said. He also said he had asked the intelligence community to review the report for any information that might compromise their sources and methods of intelligence-gathering and would thus need to be redacted.But he did not address his decision to step in and make a judgment on whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed justice after Mr. Mueller’s team conspicuously did not.Republicans tried to help Mr. Barr hammer home the report’s top-line findings.“The conclusions were simple: no collusion, no obstruction,” said Representative Tom Graves, Republican of Georgia, ignoring Mr. Mueller’s statement that the investigation did not “exonerate” Mr. Trump of obstruction and that it found no criminal conspiracy between any Trump associates and Russia’s election interference.Mr. Graves added, “Is there anything new you have seen that would change your conclusions?”Mr. Barr responded, “There is nothing to suggest to me” that the conclusions have changed. “The letter speaks for itself.”[Congress waits as Barr blacks out parts of the Mueller report.]One of the key reasons Mr. Barr has said he must black out portions of the Mueller report before showing it to Congress is a federal rule of criminal procedure that forbids Justice Department officials from disclosing grand-jury information to outsiders.On its face, that rule — known as 6(e) — makes no exception for Congress. There are exceptions to the rule, however, particularly if a judge issues an order permitting the material to be disclosed. That happened in 1974, when a judge overseeing the Watergate grand jury permitted the evidence it gathered to be sent to the House Judiciary Committee, which had opened an impeachment inquiry into President Nixon.But the executive branch in 1974 supported sending the evidence to Congress. Mr. Barr was asked whether his Justice Department would be willing to join a similar motion to allow Congress to see the grand-jury material that Mr. Mueller gathered.But Mr. Barr said he has no such intention. He said if House Judiciary Committee members want to see that material, they can ask the judge.“The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is free to go to court if he feels one of those exceptions is applicable,” Mr. Barr said, adding: “My intention is not to ask for it at this stage. I mean, if the chairman has a good explanation of why 6(e) does not apply and his need for the information, I’m willing to listen.”Under pressure to give Congress the entire text of the Mueller report, Mr. Barr repeatedly reminded his critics that he is operating under rules written by Clinton administration officials to prevent a repetition of the Whitewater-Monica Lewinsky scandal, where Ken Starr gave lawmakers a long report that contained detailed narrative description of the evidence, including lurid sexual details and extensive legal analysis of potential crimes by the president.Mr. Barr’s point seemed to be: If you have a problem with this process, blame the Clinton Democrats.“This whole mechanism for the special counsel, as I said, was established during the Clinton administration in the wake of Ken Starr’s report,” Mr. Barr said. “That’s why the current rule says the report should be kept confidential, because there was a lot of reaction against the publication of Ken Starr’s report and many of the people who are right now calling for release of this report were basically castigating Ken Starr and others for releasing the Starr report.”Mr. Starr, the independent counsel leading the Clinton investigation, was operating under a now-defunct law that gave him the authority to send a report directly to Congress. The Republican-controlled Congress promptly made the whole thing public.That experience helped persuade members of Congress of both parties that the independent counsel law should be permitted to lapse in 1999. But there was still a need for some kind of mechanism for prosecutors with a degree of independence to investigate potential high-level executive-branch wrongdoing.Under then-Attorney General Janet Reno, the Clinton administration issued the special counsel regulation that governed Mr. Mueller’s investigation. Among other things, it called for the special counsel to write a “confidential” report for the attorney general, who would then relay his own report to Congress saying the investigation was over. In short, those rules did not envision a lengthy report from Mr. Mueller going to Congress and being published for the public to read — in any form.“You will recognize that I’m operating under a regulation that was put together during the Clinton administration and does not provide for the publication of the report,” Mr. Barr said. “But I am relying on my own discretion to make as much public as I can.”Representative Matt Cartwright, Democrat of Pennsylvania, assailed Mr. Barr and the Justice Department for declining to defend the Affordable Care Act in federal court in Texas, where a judge recently struck down the sweeping health care law as unconstitutional.Mr. Cartwright accused Mr. Barr of putting the weight of the Justice Department behind a political effort to invalidate the law and warned that it could result in millions of people losing their health care coverage.Mr. Barr did not dispute that he had decided to no longer defend the law but told Mr. Cartwright that he had “nothing to worry about” if he thought that the department had taken “such an outrageous position” because the government was likely to lose the case in question. “Let the courts do their job,” Mr. Barr said.Republicans have challenged the law in various court cases since it was passed nine years ago. Late last year, a federal judge in Texas struck down the law on the grounds that its requirement that Americans buy health insurance was unconstitutional. The Justice Department had said last summer that it would no longer defend that mandate, and broadened its attack on the law last month, telling a federal appeals court that it believed the entire law should be invalidated.If the court accepts that argument, millions of people could lose health insurance. Mr. Barr declined to speculate about the impact of the Justice Department’s decision not to defend the law, though he acknowledged that it could end with no plan in place for those who depend on the law to maintain coverage.The exchange underscored Mr. Barr’s sweeping view of executive power and that the attorney general ultimately answers to the president. Though the Justice Department generally defends the law in any challenges to it, Mr. Barr indicated he was willing to make an exception in a case where the president asked for something different so long as it was legally defensible.Mr. Barr is requesting an additional $72.1 million for immigration enforcement — an amount that would fund 100 new immigration judges — at a time when Mr. Trump has hardened his stance against illegal immigration and asylum seekers. Over the past two days, he has purged top immigration and security leaders to accelerate that goal.While the additional judges will “provide some relief from a critical backlog in the immigration courts,” Mr. Barr said, he also said that an influx of cases “constrains our ability to manage the backlog of cases, and other reforms are necessary.”The Justice Department oversees the nation’s immigration judges, who are separate from the judicial branch.Mr. Barr also said that “attacking those transnational criminal organizations is a high priority” for the department and noted that the Justice Department is asking for more than $140 million in budget increases at the F.B.I., the Drug Enforcement Administration and elsewhere to address drug crimes.The Justice Department inspector general intends to complete by May or June his investigation into aspects of the Russia inquiry, including whether law enforcement officials abused their surveillance powers to spy on a Trump campaign aide, Mr. Barr said.The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, has been examining how the F.B.I. and Justice Department obtained a secret warrant in October 2016 to wiretap Carter Page, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. Republicans have accused law enforcement officials of improperly obtaining the warrant because they relied in part on Democratic-funded opposition research compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer who was also an F.B.I. informant, in seeking permission from the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to surveil Mr. Page.As part of his investigation, Mr. Horowitz is also scrutinizing the F.B.I.’s relationship with Mr. Steele.Mr. Barr also said he was studying the F.B.I.’s decision to begin investigating ties between Russia and Mr. Trump’s campaign during the 2016 election, Mr. Barr said. He said he was trying to get his “arms around all the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation.”"
52,"WASHINGTON — It would most likely resemble the aftermath of a major natural disaster: food shortages, skyrocketing prices, people out of work and a plummeting stock market.While President Trump sees shutting the border with Mexico as punishment for its failure to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants, economists warn that the move would effectively paralyze the United States economy given the huge volume of bluejeans, cars, flat-screen TVs, avocados and other goods that cross the border every day.Mr. Trump does not see it that way. In a series of tweets in recent days, the president has blasted Mexico’s immigration policies and erroneously claimed that shutting the southern border would save the United States money, given that the country buys more goods from Mexico than it sells to it.“Next step is to close the Border!” the president tweeted on Sunday. “This will also help us with stopping the Drug flow from Mexico!”“If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States through our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week,” the president wrote on Friday.While Mr. Trump has repeatedly frightened business leaders by threatening to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which facilitates trade around the continent by cutting tariffs and streamlining regulations, shutting the southern border entirely would be far more destructive.Nearly $1.7 billion of goods and services flow across the border daily, as well as nearly half a million legal workers, students, shoppers and tourists, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said on Monday.“Most of us in the trade business thought terminating Nafta would be quite a body blow, but what Trump is talking about now, shutting the southern border, would be catastrophic,” said Gary Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “It’s just absurd.”If Mr. Trump were to shut down the border, here is who would pay the biggest price:American industries including agriculture and autos rely on Mexico for trade, either by selling goods and services into Mexico or by using Mexican materials in their products. So one of the biggest victims of a border shutdown would be American manufacturing, a sector the president has promised to help.The United States imported $349.6 billion of goods from Mexico in 2018, and it sent $265 billion back across the border, according to statistics from the Union Nations’ International Trade Center, making Mexico the United States’ largest trading partner after China and Canada.Automakers, who have spread their supply chains across North America, would be among those most affected. Shutting the border would lead to sudden disruptions in the supply chains for auto parts, causing car production lines in South Carolina, Michigan, Indiana and Alabama to shutter. The change would begin to affect American auto production in less than one week, said Ann Wilson, the senior vice president for government affairs at the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, which represents auto parts makers.Other industries would be hard-hit as well. Many manufacturers of flat-screen TVs, computer hardware and medical devices are set up south of the border, while the apparel industry sources raw materials like cotton, buttons, zippers and threads from the United States and sews them into finished products in Mexico.Closings would also affect sectors outside manufacturing, including energy — the United States supplies much of Mexico’s natural gas through pipelines that run across the border — as well as the transportation sector, where hundreds of thousands of American jobs are tied to moving goods to and from Mexico through ports and by truck or train.Over all, some of the world’s biggest multinational companies would be affected — including Ford, Toyota, Boeing and Caterpillar — but so would countless small- and medium-size businesses that depend on trade to make and sell their products.The signing of Nafta prompted a huge reorganization in agriculture on both sides of the border. Now, consumers in the United States depend on Mexican farmers for fresh fruit and vegetables like avocados, tomatoes, strawberries, grapes and mangoes, as well as packaged foods and beer. Mexico relies heavily on American soybeans, corn, dairy products, chickens, beef and other goods.The development of refrigerated trucks and railroad cars means much of the industry depends on “just in time” deliveries. If the border were shut down, consumers would most likely see an immediate spike in food prices, and supplies of fresh food could dwindle from grocery store shelves in a matter of days. American farmers would lose a major market, causing a drop in prices for their crops and a potential buildup of their goods in factories, slaughterhouses and grain bins.Lance Jungmeyer, the president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, said that Mexico supplied more than 60 percent of all American produce in the winter and early spring, and that a shutdown could result in immediate and uncontrollable spikes in prices for items like bell peppers, squash, tomatoes, cucumbers, melons, eggplant — and yes, the beloved avocado. The rise in the popularity of the avocado would not have been possible without trade with Mexico, which supplies 80 percent of the avocados eaten in the United States.“If prices go up for fresh produce, people are going to have to choose between eating healthy or putting other food on their plates,” Mr. Jungmeyer said.Mr. Trump often credits his policies with economic growth, renewed business confidence and a rising stock market. But shuttering the border to legitimate commerce and travel could quickly undermine American growth and productivity, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a statement on Monday.“Closing the U.S.-Mexico border would inflict severe economic harm on American families, workers, farmers and manufacturers across the United States,” said Neil Bradley, the chamber’s executive vice president and chief policy officer.It is hard to imagine that such a measure would not prompt a drop in the stock market, which has seized up as the president threatened to withdraw from Nafta or put more extensive tariffs on China. That would dent the retirement savings of many Americans, as well as affect the ability of companies to raise money in the capital markets.“Once the president breaks the glass once, that casts a lot of uncertainty on the future,” said Scott Lincicome, an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute. “It would cast a cloud of uncertainty around a commercial relationship that for decades has been almost an afterthought.”Americans often take for granted the fact that Mexico is an ally, ready to work with the United States on a range of issues, including water use and drug trafficking. But before Nafta went into force in 1994, that future was by no means assured, said Phil Levy of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.If business ties and relations with Mexico are strained, border communities in the United States would most likely suffer, from both decreased economic activity and potentially higher costs from crime and migration.In McAllen, Tex., for example, Mexican shoppers make up nearly one-third of the roughly $3.2 billion worth of retail sales the city records annually, signaling a grim prospect for city coffers if Mr. Trump follows through on his threat to shut down the border.“We’re impacted at a very personal level in that the people in McAllen, some of them, work in Mexico,” McAllen’s city manager, Roel Rodriguez, said in an interview, adding that 30 percent is “a huge number.”La Plaza Mall, a Simon Malls property, is constantly full of shoppers on weekends, and the parking lots are often dotted with license plates from various Mexican states. The city and the Chamber of Commerce spend tens of thousands of dollars advertising McAllen in Mexico each year.“The more global concern would be how it would impact the whole country, because the goods and services that come through the ports of entry, they don’t just stay at the border,” Mr. Rodriguez said. “The produce, the equipment, the auto parts. So there’s a real danger for cities on the border, but it has a greater impact than just the cities on the border.”Salvador Contreras, who runs the Center for Border Economic Studies at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, said there was a big risk for large companies with plants in the Mexican border town of Reynosa, across the Rio Grande from McAllen, including Caterpillar, LG and Panasonic.“If you’re a multinational corporation who has, say, an operation in Reynosa, and your ability to operate is being impacted, you might question your desire to maintain that plant there,” Mr. Contreras said.Northern Mexican cities that depend on trade with the United States would be devastated by any extended border closing, leading to mass unemployment that could ironically prompt more attempts to cross the United States border. Under United States law, asylum seekers can request protections once they reach American soil — meaning border closings could actually encourage more desperate flights across the border.“If anything, it would promote more poverty in Mexico, which would then turn into more pressure on immigration in the U.S.,” Mr. Hufbauer said."
53,"MERIDA, Mexico — A meeting of U.S. and Mexican government and business leaders on Thursday aims to shore up investor confidence in Mexico and defuse U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to close their shared border if illegal immigration is not halted.Part of regular business forum the U.S.-Mexico CEO Dialogue, the talks in Mexico coincide with renewed tensions over trade and the border after two years of uncertainty sparked by Trump's push to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).They also give Mexico an opportunity to address investor concerns about how President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has run Latin America's No. 2 economy since taking office in December.""We want the American investors that visit our country to go back home feeling confident about their investments here,"" said Moises Kalach, a top executive in the CCE business lobby, which represented Mexico's private sector at the NAFTA talks.Lopez Obrador and officials including his foreign minister and energy minister, plus U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue, are scheduled to attend the two-day meeting in the city of Merida.Among investors due to attend is Larry Fink, chief executive of the world's largest asset manager BlackRock Inc.The leftist Lopez Obrador took power vowing to fight entrenched corruption, crime, inequality and poverty, scourges that cost Mexico billions of dollars every year.He has said he wants to boost both private and public investment, but some of his early decisions, such as canceling a partially-built $13 billion Mexico City airport and steps to rein in the autonomy of regulatory bodies, have spooked investors.Questions remain over the future of trade in the region because the deal agreed to replace NAFTA, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), has yet to be ratified.U.S. Democratic politicians say Mexico must approve a new labor law to strengthen its trade unions before they approve the USMCA, and Kalach said the implications of that legislation now in the Mexican Congress would be addressed.Time would also be given to how Mexico proposes to cope with a migrant surge which has led to Trump threatening to close the border, causing trade hold-ups at the frontier, he added.""So as to lower the pressure on this issue, which is a real issue and an important issue,"" Kalach said.Trump said on Wednesday he would have to mobilize more of the military at the U.S. border with Mexico.Cutting through the noise surrounding the issue of immigration, Mexico wants to ensure that the message goes out that both countries' private sectors keep working ""hand in hand"", said a Mexican official, who asked not to be named.Mexico is also eager to drum up interests in ""strategic projects"" in Mexico's southeast, and to ensure there is a good business climate in the country, the official said.Key among the projects is the planned $8 billion construction of a new Pemex refinery on Mexico's Gulf Coast, which American firms were recently invited to bid on.Other schemes the government wants to pitch to investors include a rail project across popular tourist areas of the Yucatan peninsula, known as the Mayan Train, development of border areas, and an alternative new Mexico City airport.

54,"WASHINGTON — Several names surfaced on Monday as possible successors to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who resigned on Sunday after 16 months managing President Donald Trump's turbulent immigration agenda.Amid a surge in the number of migrants at the border with Mexico, Nielsen stepped down and will be replaced temporarily by Kevin McAleenan, current head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.As Trump seeks a permanent nominee to send to the Republican-controlled Senate for confirmation, here are some possible successors whose names have already been floated by sources talking to Reuters and in media reports. None immediately responded to requests for comment.RICK PERRYTrump's energy secretary has kept a relatively low profile since winning confirmation by a vote of 62 to 37.As Texas governor from 2000 to 2015, Perry was on the front lines during a spike in migrants seeking asylum in 2014. He opposed building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border at the time, but now supports Trump's signature domestic policy. KEN CUCCINELLIThe former Virginia attorney general visited the White House last week amid reports that Trump was searching for an ""immigration czar"" to coordinate policy across the government.As attorney general and state senator, Cuccinelli developed a reputation as a conservative hard-liner on a range of issues, including immigration. He has called for denying citizenship to U.S.-born children whose parents are in the country illegally, and authorized law enforcement officials to investigate the immigration status of anyone they stopped. He lost a bid for governor in 2013, and recently has been involved with the Senate Conservatives Fund, a political group that supports right-leaning candidates.KRIS KOBACHThe former Kansas secretary of state has built a national reputation as an uncompromising opponent of illegal immigration.Since losing the Kansas governor's race last November, Kobach has been angling for a job in the Trump administration, telling Breitbart News over the weekend that he would be open to serving as a White House immigration ""czar."" He also proposed blocking illegal immigrants from sending money back to Mexico. Kobach could have a hard time winning Senate confirmation due to his hard-line views and unsuccessful 2018 campaign, where he lost to a Democrat in a heavily Republican state.FRAN TOWNSENDA former homeland security advisor to President George W. Bush, Townsend now is an analyst for CBS television. She says Trump considered her as a possible replacement for FBI Director James Comey after he was fired in 2017.KEVIN MCALEENANAs commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, McAleenan said last month that the immigration system was at a ""breaking point."" A career law enforcement official, McAleenan has served on and off in the division since its inception after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.McAleenan has won the respect of Republicans and Democrats and easily won confirmation to his current post in March 2018 by a vote of 77 to 19.He has pushed Congress to detain families seeking asylum until their cases are heard in court, rather than releasing them. However, he has not always lined up with Trump's aggressive approach to border security. He has praised the effectiveness of U.S. aid to Central America, which Trump has threatened to cut off.

55,"MILAN — Nationalist anti-immigration parties plan to join forces following next month's European Union parliamentary election, looking to create a new bloc to shake up the EU, officials from four groups said on Monday.The move shows growing confidence amongst far-right and sovereignist parties that for the first time since the EU was formed 60 years ago they can win enough seats in parliament to have a major say in how the continent is run.""We want to reform the European Union and the European parliament, without destroying them. We want to bring radical change,"" said Joerg Meuthen, the chairman of the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party (AfD).Meuthen told reporters the EU parliamentary bloc would be called the European Alliance for People and Nations. It will initially involve at least 10 parties drawn from the three groups that currently house various nationalist forces.Monday's event was organized by Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, who heads the right-wing League and has been the driving force in persuading like-minded politicians to ditch their previous divisions before the May 26 EU election.""We can propose a new Europe because we have never governed (in Brussels),"" Salvini said. ""Our goal is to be decisive, to nominate new commissioners in the new commission,"" he added, referring to the powerful body that oversees EU policy-making.However, it was not immediately clear if two of Europe's biggest national conservative forces -- Poland's governing Law and Justice party (PiS) and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party -- would be willing to join the group.Europe's myriad sovereignist parties share the broad goals of returning power to EU member states and further curbing immigration, but they often have very different economic and social policies, making it hard to create a coherent group within the EU parliament.DIVISIONSBesides the AfD, the conservative Finns Party and the rightist Danish People's Party have also pledged to support the initiative. Salvini said his current EU allies, including Marine Le Pen's National Rally in France, would take part, too.""If we succeed with the initiative we launched today, it will be an historic achievement,"" said Anders Vistisen, a European parliamentarian with the Danish People's Party.""The only powers who have been winning by us being divided into three different groups have been the europhiles of Brussels, the old establishment parties who worked toward a United States of Europe,"" he told reporters.Salvini said he planned to hold a rally in Milan on May 18 to bring together his new alliance.Although all the speakers on Monday confirmed they were united in supporting tougher border controls to prevent illegal immigration, there appeared to be little common cause on other issues, such as economic policy.The AfD has previously denounced the big-spending budget plans of Salvini and the Italian government. Other northern European nationalist groups have been highly critical of what they see as southern European fiscal profligacy.""It is clear that (our) parties have different approaches, but that doesn't matter right now. What is important is we need to protect Europe,"" said Finns Party official Olli Kotro.

56,"One clear lesson from the elections of 2016 and 2018 is that President Trump and his fellow Republican candidates win where white voters are losing ground.Take a look at the 2018 congressional results in the upper Midwest and Pennsylvania, states that provided the Electoral College votes crucial to Trump’s capture of the White House.John C. Austin, the director of the Michigan Economic Center and a senior fellow at Brookings, analyzed economic trends in 15 congressional districts that changed hands last year — 12 from Republican to Democrat, three from Democrat to Republican — in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota and Iowa.Austin found a striking pattern. In the majority of districts that went from Republican to Democrat:The accompanying graphic reveals the extent to which economic considerations shaped the outcome in these districts.The same general pattern emerged in state after state in the recent midterms.In September 2018, Siobhan Hughes and Dante Chinni of The Wall Street Journal took the 70 congressional races ranked as most competitive by the Cook Political Report. They then ranked the races on the basis of an “economic-health index created by the Institute of International Finance.”Of the ten districts ranked highest on economic health, eight were categorized “lean Republican” by the Cook Political Report, and two “lean Democrat.” Before the November election, nine of those 10 seats were held by Republicans.On Election Day, Democrats carried eight out of 10 of these districts.Mark Muro and Jacob Whiton, both of Brookings, worked with John Harwood of CNBC to analyze Democratic and Republican-held congressional districts in the aftermath of the 2018 election. Their conclusions reinforce the findings of Austin, Hughes and Chinni.The key result: the 20 most prosperous districts are now held by Democrats, while Republicans represent 16 of the 20 least prosperous, measured by share of G.D.P. The accompanying chart illustrates their analysis.The authors’ calculation of the contribution to the G.D.P. of every congressional district showed that Democratic districts produce $10.2 trillion of the nation’s goods and services and Republican districts $6.2 trillion.This trend creates a significant dilemma for Trump and the Republican Party. Candidates on the right do best during hard times and in recent elections, they have gained the most politically in regions experiencing the sharpest downturn. Electorally speaking, in other words, Republicans profit from economic stagnation and decline.Let’s return to John Austin of the Michigan Economic Center. In an email he describes this unusual situation succinctly: “A rising economic tide tends to sink the Trump tugboat,” adding“Certainly more people and communities that are feeling abandoned, not part of a vibrant economy means more fertile ground for the resentment politics and ‘blaming others’ for people’s woes (like immigrants and people of color) that fuel Trump’s supporters.”In June 2017, Austin demonstrated the importance of struggling white communities to the Republican Party. His study of the 2016 presidential results in the Midwest showed how strong turnout among voters in regions facing economic deterioration can help Republicans. In that earlier report, Austin wrote:This pattern is not limited to the United States. There are numerous studies demonstrating that European and British voters who are falling behind in the global economy, and who were hurt by the 2008 recession and the subsequent cuts to the welfare state, drove Brexit as well as the rise of right-wing populist parties.One paper, “Measuring the Effects of Economic Austerity on Pro-Sociality: Evidence from Greece,” by Nicholas Sambanis, Anna Schultz and Elena Nikolova, political scientists at Penn, Duke and University College London, found, for example,In a July 2018 paper, “Did Austerity Cause Brexit?” Thiemo Fetzer, an economist at the University of Warwick in Coventry, England, argues that austerity policies adopted in the wake of the 2008 financial collapse were crucial both to voter support for the right-wing populist party UKIP in Britain and to voter approval of Brexit.These political movements “are strongly and causally associated with an individual’s or an area’s exposure to austerity since 2010,” Fetzer writes. Examination of economic trends, welfare policy and polling data shows, according to Fetzer, thatThere are significant parallels between voting patterns for and against Brexit and the patterns in the 2016 and 2018 elections in this country.In a separate 2017 paper, “Who Voted For Brexit,” Fetzer and two fellow economists at the University of Warwick, Sascha O. Becker and Dennis Novy, found that “in particular, fiscal cuts in the context of the recent U.K. austerity program are strongly associated with a higher Vote Leave share.” This heldThe results here and in England reinforce the conclusion that the worse things get, the better the right does.As a rule, as economic conditions improve and voters begin to feel more secure, they become more generous and more liberal. In the United States, this means that voters move to the left; in Britain, it means voters are stronger in their support for staying in the European Union.In his forthcoming book, “Democratic Capitalism at the Crossroads: Technological Change and the Future of Politics” Carles Boix, a political scientist at Princeton, describes how postwar prosperity from 1945 to the mid-1970s led to a liberal international consensus:As global competition, outsourcing and later, automation, began to produce significant economic disruption, beginning in the 1970s, this liberal consensus frayed.Boix writes,In the United States, economic adversity helped produce Trump, whose inaugural speech (reportedly the handiwork of Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller) Boix cites as emblematic of the hostility emerging with the fall of liberalism:Together, the trends described above raise an intriguing question: If the Republican Party now depends on the votes of those who are falling behind, does the party have a vested interest in economic stagnation and decline?I asked scholars and officials at the Niskanen Center — a Washington think tank that recently received favorable coverage for its efforts to resolve contemporary ideological division — whether they thought the Republican Party has come to recognize that prosperity helps Democrats, while economic adversity engenders hostility to immigrants, resentment of liberal elites and animosity among rural voters toward urban America. Does this awareness give politicians on the right a motive to support policies and actions that foster government dysfunction and further impair sections of the country that are in decline?Jerry Taylor, president of Niskanen, replied to my inquiry by making the case that “as conservatives see it, the more visible government dysfunction is, the better. It provides civic education.”Working from this premise, Taylor argued that as far as conservatives go,Taylor disputed the suggestion that “Republicans consciously or unconsciously labor to frustrate economic growth in rural white America.” Instead, he said, they are ideologically committed to the belief that economic growth isWill Wilkinson, the center’s vice president for research, wrote back to me:But, in actual practice moving from campaigning to governing, Wilkinson continued, Trump’sWhat’s more, Wilkinson noted,This has put the Republican Party in a painful position, according to Wilkinson:Brink Lindsey, vice president for policy, replied to my queries from a somewhat different angle: “You don’t need conscious intent to produce dysfunction to explain Republican governance failures.”In Lindsey’s view,This is not, according to Lindsey,In addition to the Mueller investigation, there are two major factors that will determine the sustainability of the Republican Party’s “rotten equilibrium.”The first, of course, is Trump himself. His victory in 2016 was a charlatan’s ascent, and his presidency has served to sustain distrust in government — fuel, in one sense, for the continued success of charlatans. For the moment, though, his failure to win money for the border wall has punctured his viability as a governing force.Trump’s second, if less heralded, achievement has been to invigorate the Democratic opposition. He has inspired an immense, rambunctious, intensely motivated and exceptionally diverse pack of candidates — some prepared, some less so, to dislodge him from the White House."
57,"A 45-year-old Mexican migrant died on Monday in the custody of United States Customs and Border Protection, an event that was sure to intensify pressure on an agency overwhelmed by record numbers of migrant families crossing the border, while its health and safety standards have come under harsh public scrutiny.The migrant, who was not identified, had been apprehended on Feb. 2 by the police in Roma, Tex., near a port of entry into the United States, and requested medical attention. He was found to have cirrhosis of the liver and congestive heart failure, the agency said in a statement, and was hospitalized twice while in custody — the second time spending two weeks in the intensive care unit of the McAllen Medical Center. He died there around 9 a.m. Monday.The death came less than two months after 7-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquin and 8-year-old Felipe Gomez Alonzo also died in the agency’s custody, in December, amid three straight months of record-breaking numbers of migrant families entering the country. Both had shown symptoms of illness after they were taken into custody along the Southwest border, and their deaths prompted widespread condemnation from members of Congress and the public. The agency soon after announced new medical checks for children, and a temporary infusion of support from other federal agencies, including the Coast Guard and the United States Public Health Service.Kirstjen Nielsen, the Homeland Security secretary, has requested $800 million from Congress to address the influx of migrant children and families, calling it a “humanitarian crisis.” The money would go toward staffing, supplies and enhanced facilities, among other things.The migrant who died Monday was apprehended alone for “illegal re-entry,” meaning that he had entered the United States without authorization at least once in the past, according to Andrew Meehan, an assistant commissioner with the agency’s Office of Public Affairs.“This loss of life is tragic,” Mr. Meehan said in a statement. “Our condolences go out to the family and loved ones. C.B.P. remains committed to ensuring the safe and humane treatment of those within the care of our custody.”Many migrants who cross the Southwest border, hoping either to request asylum or sneak in illicitly, become injured or ill during their journey to the United States, while others arrive in need of care for chronic or longstanding conditions.The demographics of border crossers have evolved significantly in the last decade, putting a strain on C.B.P.’s resources. Once predominantly single, healthy men from Mexico who could be returned home within a few hours, a majority of current border crossers are Central Americans who cannot be turned back immediately because of legal provisions. Many of them request asylum, assuring an even longer stay in federal custody.More than 40 percent of migrants apprehended along the Southwest border enter through the Rio Grande Valley, where Roma is, and where local residents have become accustomed to a heavy presence of Border Patrol and newly arrived immigrants. Recently, though, higher numbers of migrants have been crossing in remote areas — in part as a result of harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration — where the lack of resources has been particularly acute.Encounters with migrants who have come to be in grave danger have also increased, the agency said, including 17 people who had to be rescued on Thursday after becoming stranded or overcome by swift currents as they tried to cross the Rio Grande. The rescues took place near Eagle Pass, Tex., about 200 miles northwest of Roma.C.B.P.’s Office of Professional Responsibility is reviewing the death that occurred on Monday, Mr. Meehan, the agency spokesman, said. The office is also reviewing the deaths of the two children that occurred in December. Jakelin Caal Maquin’s father has disputed the agency’s assertion that she had not eaten or had water for several days before they were apprehended."

If someone forwarded it to you, sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox.By Manny Fernandez in Los Indios, Tex.The border wall doesn’t get any shorter or stranger than this — giant, pointy-topped steel pillars that would seem imposing, if only there were more of them.This border fence has exactly 36 burgundy-colored beams. They stand alone on a grassy island in South Texas where two dirt roads intersect. It’s open on the left and open on the right. You can walk around the whole thing at a fast clip in 17.36 seconds, a quick lap around a pocket-sized piece of America’s border security.The line that is the border wall here is dotted. It zigs. It zags. It stops. It starts. It stops again. It has corners where it mimics the twists and turns of the Rio Grande. And it has doors. Sometimes, these doors are gates that open when a code is entered on a keypad. Sometimes, these doors are full-fledged openings — a road cuts into the fence, leaving a gap that essentially gives the Border Patrol one more thing to worry about.The mini-wall is the unusual product of two such openings. The fence line in the Texas border town of Los Indios spreads out north of the Los Indios International Bridge, about 20 miles northwest of Brownsville. The steel-slat wall traces a path parallel to Robertson Street, in a flat rural landscape of corn and grain sorghum fields. But at the point where Robertson Street intersects with Rio Grande Avenue, the border wall takes a hard left and flows to the west along Rio Grande Avenue.The fence designers created an opening on Robertson but also put another one at Rio Grande. So as the fence turns at this intersection, the two openings create a leftover morsel of wall in the middle: a lonely, taxpayer-funded gothic median.President Trump lamented the various doors in the border wall last week, during a border-security roundtable in Calexico, Calif. He talked about a stretch of fence along the Rio Grande that had been erected under previous administrations, saying it was “not a good-looking wall” because it had “36 doors that you can drive a truck through.”“So now we’re filling up those big, those big gaping wounds in this wall and it’s going to have a big effect,” Mr. Trump said.But it’s unclear if the president was aware of this Los Indios patch, which was built around 2009. Local and federal officials said the funding dried up to close the openings and install gates that would connect the grassy island with the rest of the fencing.Representative Filemon B. Vela Jr., a Democrat who represents Brownsville in Congress and whose district includes Los Indios, said the little piece of fence illustrated the pointlessness of a border wall, regardless of which administration built it.“I’ve voted against every single piece of border wall funding that’s ever come up, and I’m going to continue to do so,” Mr. Vela said. “Decisions are being made in Washington in terms of where to put fencing that don’t make any sense.”As the president suggested, this strange little spot’s days appear to be numbered. A Border Patrol official who oversees the Los Indios area, Henry Leo, the patrol agent in charge of the agency’s station in Harlingen, Tex., said plans are in the works to finally install the necessary gates in the next one to three years.“We did request additional fencing and gates in that area, so what you see right now is not the complete picture,” Mr. Leo said. “The plan is to connect to that piece of fencing and make it a continuous fence with gates.”Both Mr. Leo and the mayor of Los Indios, Rick Cavazos, defended the fence in the area, including the stand-alone section, saying that overall the fencing had helped decrease illegal crossings. “I saw a dramatic decline in crossings and apprehensions as a result of the barrier,” said Mr. Cavazos, who is a retired Border Patrol agent. “In 2004, 2005, 2006, this was a high crossing area. People would come up from the river. The numbers went down.”On a hot April afternoon, it was all quiet at the fence island. The loudest sound was the soil: the dry brush, dirt and grass crunches underfoot. The pillars of the fence are as rough as sandpaper, and leave little red flakes on your fingertips that resemble chili powder.Adding to the head-scratching quality of this fence is its location.On one side of the fence is America. But the other side is America, too. The fence runs inland, far from the river, the middle of which is the official boundary between Mexico and the United States. That means this 36-beam fence in one sense divides the country itself. In that sense, the openings in the fence are necessary: They allow property owners and ranchers to access their land that is north of the river but south of the fence, a region locals call a “no man’s land.”Here, as much as anywhere, the Border Patrol is watching. Walk around the spot, and it’s only a matter of minutes before two agents drive up in marked and unmarked vehicles.Manny is one of a team of New York Times journalists reporting on the border.

Shear, Miriam Jordan and Manny Fernandez explores years of warnings that the U.S. immigration system is broken, or on the verge of breaking, and how it got there:Read the full story here. By Caitlin Dickerson, New York Times national immigration reporterFirst came the news that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen had resigned, likely at the request of President Trump. Then, at least two other high ranking agency officials were pegged for dismissal — all of it happening days after the president had pulled back on his nominee to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with Mr. Trump telling reporters that he had decided to go in a “tougher direction.”It’s been a whirlwind week on the immigration front, with all signs suggesting that the president plans to triple down on his goal of securing the border. The unusually large number of heads rolling around Washington seemed to indicate that anyone with misgivings about the administration’s plans will be asked — if not forced — to leave.Mr. Trump is operating under mounting pressure from unauthorized border crossings that are steadily increasing. And he’s contending with the painful reality that after 14 months of harsh policies designed to discourage immigration, he, the president who was elected on a promise to crack down on border crossings, has not made a meaningful dent in them.To the contrary, whoever fills the now-open jobs in his administration will have to contend with record numbers of Central American families seeking asylum, all of whom are being processed through a decades-old system that is not equipped to handle them. And their efforts will be frustrated by the same set of laws and court settlements that have blocked many of the administration’s attempts thus far from going into effect.It was those laws that led to the downfall of Ms. Nielsen, who lost her job because the president felt that she was not hawkish enough. Though she became known during her tenure as the public face of many of Mr. Trump’s most controversial immigration policies, including family separation, in private, the two had often clashed when she cautioned him about the legal and logistical constraints that rendered his policy ideas untenable.Read earlier installments of Crossing the Border here.

59,"LOS ANGELES — Gov. Gavin Newsom of California announced Monday that he would withdraw nearly 400 of his state’s National Guard troops from deployment along the border with Mexico and assign them to other duties.The step to rescind state authorization for the border deployment is a sharp rebuke of President Trump’s continued warnings that undocumented migrants present a national security risk to the United States. It follows a similar move last week by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico.Under a “general order” that Mr. Newsom plans to sign, 110 California National Guard troops will be redirected to support the state’s central fire agency, Cal Fire, and another 100 will work on statewide “intelligence operations” aimed at international criminal drug gangs.Mr. Newsom is also seeking to expand the state’s Counterdrug Task Force with 150 National Guard troops, which would require funding from the Department of Defense.[This month, we’re launching a limited-run weekly newsletter about life on the border, far from the tug-of-war of Washington politics. Sign up here to receive the first issue of Crossing the Border when it launches.]Since his election in November, Mr. Newsom has emphasized a progressive vision for California and the country, pitching his state as a leader on issues like immigration, climate change and income inequality. He promised last month to “offer an alternative to the corruption and incompetence in the White House.”Mr. Newsom is expected to speak publicly about the redeployment during his State of the State address on Tuesday, with sharp criticism of the president’s immigration policies and rhetoric.The National Guard has had an expanded presence in California since April, when Mr. Newsom’s predecessor, Jerry Brown, agreed to add 400 troops to shore up border-related security at the request of the Trump administration.At the time, Mr. Brown stressed that the deployment, which was financed by the federal government, would support efforts to go after criminal gangs, human traffickers and drug smugglers. He said the troops would not be used to enforce federal immigration policies.“This will not be a mission to build a new wall,” Mr. Brown wrote in a letter to Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, and Jim Mattis, who was secretary of defense at the time.“It will not be a mission to round up women and children or detain people escaping violence and seeking a better life,” Mr. Brown wrote, adding, “There is no massive wave of migrants pouring into California. Overall immigrant apprehensions on the border last year were as low as they’ve been in nearly 50 years.”Mr. Newsom and Mr. Brown are both Democrats. So is Governor Grisham of New Mexico, though the predecessor whose deployment decision she reversed was a Republican.Before the April deployment, there were about 250 National Guard troops serving in California, and 55 of them were stationed at the border. Under federal law, the troops are paid by the federal government but are under the control of the governor. It was not clear whether federal financing for the troops would continue after Mr. Newsom’s redirection order.Mr. Brown’s letter authorizing the deployment was largely seen at the time as a denunciation of President Trump’s immigration policies, but many activists and elected officials in the state sharply criticized Mr. Brown for agreeing to any guard deployment at all.Last summer, Kevin De León, who was then the State Senate leader, urged Mr. Brown to “not be complicit” in the administration’s hard-line immigration priorities, which he called “driven by racial animus.” Mr. De Leon, a Democrat, drafted the state law limiting coordination between local authorities and immigration enforcement agents, known colloquially as the “sanctuary state” law, which Mr. Brown signed in 2017.Despite the criticism, Mr. Brown later extended state authorization for the National Guard presence at the border through March 2019.Mr. Trump initially thanked Mr. Brown for the deployment, which was part of a national deployment of up to 4,000 troops authorized by Mr. Mattis. But to the confusion of many Californians, Mr. Trump later blasted the governor for placing limits on what the troops could do.“Looks like Jerry Brown and California are not looking for safety and security along their very porous Border,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “He cannot come to terms for the National Guard to patrol and protect the Border. The high crime rate will only get higher.”Illegal border crossings have been sharply declining for years. Apprehensions of undocumented migrants by border patrol agents are near historic lows. And undetected crossings have fallen to 62,000 in 2016 from 851,000 in 2006, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Several studies indicate that crime rates are lower among immigrants than among native-born Americans."
60,"WASHINGTON — In recent months, Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, had become a regular presence eating dinner at the Trump International Hotel. She had been heckled and booed when dining out after becoming the face of some of President Trump’s most hard-line immigration policies, like family separations, and her affinity for the hotel, a gathering place for the president’s supporters, seemed like a sign that she felt safer on the inside.But her status inside the White House, where she was subject to dressing-downs from Mr. Trump during cabinet meetings and constant criticism by the president, was not much more secure.So when Ms. Nielsen went to the White House on Sunday night to meet with the president to discuss some grievances, she was also prepared to avoid a messy end by letting Mr. Trump, who is known for not personally firing people, off the hook. After Mr. Trump made it clear that he was looking for a change, Ms. Nielsen told him she would resign, ridding him of a cabinet secretary who had long disappointed him.Ms. Nielsen’s departure, announced Sunday night, was abrupt but hardly unforeseen, the latest in a long and growing conga line of senior officials who have left the administration unceremoniously because of their own frustrations with the president, or because of the president’s obvious disappointment in them. Usually, it is both.Mr. Trump has ripped into Ms. Nielsen, holding her personally responsible for the uptick in crossings at the southwestern border. And Ms. Nielsen wanted to tell Mr. Trump that she was upset not to have been notified beforehand about his sudden withdrawal of Ron Vitiello, the nominee to serve as Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, and that she was frustrated at being pulled from security meetings in Europe last week and ordered to appear by the president’s side on a trip to the border, according to someone close to Ms. Nielsen.The end for Ms. Nielsen was something that has become familiar in the Trump administration: a high-ranking official like Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general, or Rex Tillerson, the former secretary of state, leaving with a reputation in need of rehabilitation.“Normally, people just resign,” said Ronald A. Klain, who served as chief of staff to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “The president sends word through an intermediary that he’s unhappy, and you resign. The president says something nice about them and then they leave.“But here, quitting isn’t good enough.”Some exits have been more humiliating than others. Since the departure of Mr. Tillerson, Mr. Trump has referred to him as “dumb as a rock” and “lazy as hell.” After calling the departure of his defense secretary, Jim Mattis, a “retirement” and praising his service, Mr. Trump turned on him once he understood that the resignation was an affront to him. “What’s he done for me?” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Mattis. “How had he done in Afghanistan? Not too good.”After years of haranguing Mr. Sessions in public and in private, Mr. Trump sent John F. Kelly, his former chief of staff, to demand his resignation in November, and he has not let up on him since he left office. In a speech in front of the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, Mr. Trump mimicked Mr. Sessions’s southern accent while discussing his decision to recuse himself from the special counsel’s investigation into Russian meddling during the 2016 campaign.Mr. Kelly later suffered his own ignoble end. After he and Mr. Trump ironed out a departure plan at the end of last year, Mr. Kelly planned to make his own announcement at a senior staff dinner at the White House. But the president chose to break the news first, telling reporters that Mr. Kelly would be departing at the end of December.Although all involved tried to put the best face on the Sunday meeting between Mr. Trump and Ms. Nielsen — someone familiar with it said the president had even asked her if she would want to return in another position — the two competed afterward for how to spin its contents.Within minutes of the meeting’s end, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that Ms. Nielsen was “leaving her position,” making it sound as if she was the latest cabinet secretary he had ousted online. Ms. Nielsen then posted her resignation letter on Twitter, notably leaving out any mention or praise for Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump has yet to criticize her publicly since. But Ms. Nielsen has already absorbed more than her share of criticism for her role in implementing the president’s policies.Immigration and civil rights groups have been pressuring Fortune 500 companies to blacklist former Trump officials like Ms. Nielsen, who have promoted his immigration policies, writing that they “should not be allowed to seek refuge in your boardrooms or corner offices.” Many other former administration officials have not experienced the post-White House career bump that has become part of the payoff for putting in grueling hours on government salaries.With a few exceptions, like the smooth send-off for Nikki R. Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations, and a glowing farewell to Linda McMahon, the former administrator of the Small Business Administration, Mr. Trump’s top aides often find themselves damaged by their former boss in real time, or on delay.Even those who have managed to stay in Mr. Trump’s favor, like Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, have a sense of gallows humor about what might ultimately befall them.“I’ll be there until he tweets me out of the office,” Mr. Pompeo recently joked at an event in his home state of Kansas, when asked about his future in politics.For her part, Ms. Nielsen appears to be intent on trying to minimize the damage to her reputation, with surrogates out defending her record.“The so-called immigration hard-liners have flailed about since the beginning of the administration, giving bad advice to the president and misdirecting resources toward the wrong solutions to the wrong problems,” said Thad Bingel, who was a senior homeland security official in the Bush administration and served as an aide to Ms. Nielsen during her Senate confirmation.“They apparently don’t want anyone like a Secretary Nielsen or Secretary Kelly, who deals in reality, to tell them or the president any of this.”"
61,"MEXICO CITY — President Trump’s State of the Union speech hit hard on a topic that has dominated his term in office: defending the border with Mexico against what he described as migrants in “large organized caravans.”He also suggested that the Mexican authorities were encouraging the migrants to cross the border illegally.“We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection,” Mr. Trump said in his speech Tuesday night.Some aspects of Mr. Trump’s assertions are true but others are unsubstantiated or distorted. There is no evidence, for example, that the Mexican authorities are sending migrants to weak points along the border.Migrants have said they have banded together in large groups, called caravans, because such groups help keep them safe from robberies and other dangers along the trek north through Mexico. But their size has drawn the president’s anger and made them one of his frequent targets.As the migrants from Central America have moved north through Mexico, city and state governments have sometimes provided transport with help from churches and local aid groups.Some small-town mayors opt to do this because they have limited resources, and it is easier to arrange transport than to house and feed several thousand people at a time. Some state governments provided this type of aid along parts of the route migrants traveled last October and November on their way to Tijuana, a busy border crossing station with the United States.The stated purpose of the action is humanitarian, and women and children are given priority when space is short.Mr. Trump was most likely referring to recent action taken by the state government of Coahuila, across the border from Texas. On Monday, Coahuila officials, with help from local businesses, provided buses for 1,700 members of a migrant caravan that left Honduras on Jan. 14.The state government posted on Twitter photos of Coahuila Gov. Miguel Riquelme meeting with migrants the night before their journey and then visiting a temporary shelter set up to receive the migrants in Piedras Negras, just across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas.The migrants were driven five hours from Arteaga, in southern Coahuila, to Piedras Negras, which has a population of more than 150,000 and does not fit the definition of a remote unprotected border area.There is no indication that the transport provided by cities or states is deliberately targeted at areas lacking border protection. On the contrary, the Mexican authorities prefer to help migrants reach border cities with adequate shelter space.Mexico’s federal government is not providing transport of any sort to migrants.In a statement on Tuesday, Kirstjen M. Nielsen, Mr. Trump’s homeland security secretary, said that the government was prepared for the caravan’s arrival.“Illegal entry will not be tolerated, and we stand ready to prevent it,” she said. “The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been working with the departments of State, Defense and Justice to ensure all possible resources are available to address this lawless caravan.”Most of the migrants have said that they hope to apply for asylum in the United States through legal routes."
62,"She was 49, a recent immigrant and deeply in debt to a loan shark back home in China when she answered an employment ad three years ago that promised thousands of dollars a month, but offered no job description. She realized too late that she had been tricked into working at a massage parlor in Flushing, Queens, where besides kneading backs, she was expected to sexually service up to a dozen men a day.Some of the clients were violent, and the boss charged $10 a day for her to sleep on a sofa in a room at the parlor where rats nibbled on her food. “The customers were very terrible,” said the woman, who, ashamed of the stigma of her former profession, asked that her name not be used. “After you perform a service, they would find an excuse to take the money away.” They would, she said, “do even worse things.”In strip malls across the country, neon signs and brightly colored placards promise hot stones, acupuncture and shiatsu with photos of women or couples receiving relaxing shoulder rubs. But a traditionally Asian form of therapeutic relaxation with deep roots in big-city Chinatowns has spun off a different kind of massage parlor that has little to do with traditional remedies. It has exploded into a $3 billion-a-year sex industry that relies on pervasive secrecy, close-knit ownership rings and tens of thousands of mostly foreign women ensnared in a form of modern indentured servitude.[Read more about a thriving sex trafficking trade in Florida.]The frequently middle-aged women who work in parlors with names like Orchids of Asia and Rainbow Spa are often struggling to pay off high debts to family members, loan sharks, labor traffickers and lawyers who help them file phony asylum claims. In some cases, their passports are taken and their illegal immigration status keeps them further in the shadows, with some of them rotated every 10 days to two weeks between spas operated by the same owners. Forced to pay for their own supplies and even their own condoms, many women must sleep on the same massage tables where they service customers and cook on hot plates in cramped kitchens or on back steps.“We stopped thinking about just cages, bars and chains as the means of coercion,” said John Richmond, the State Department’s top anti-trafficking official. “They are using nonviolent forms of coercion.”The recent arrest warrant filed against Robert K. Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots — and the solicitation charges filed against nearly 300 men in multiple jurisdictions as part of the same case — riveted national attention to a stretch of Highway 1 along Florida’s Treasure Coast dotted with strip malls, gas stations and sapphire ocean views. Across the region, parlors were empty and many frequent clients were phoning their lawyers, wondering if more warrants were going to drop.Law enforcement officials said there were an estimated 9,000 illicit massage parlors across the country, from Orlando to Los Angeles. The epicenter of this national underground is the bustling Chinatown in Flushing, in the New York City borough of Queens. Women — typically Chinese, but also Korean, Thai and East European — arrive at Kennedy International Airport, learn the trade and are sent out to places like Virginia, Iowa, Texas and Florida. Women are recruited locally through ads in Chinese-language newspapers or over the social network WeChat.“Flushing is the center of this network,” said Lori Cohen, the director of Sanctuary for Families’ Anti-Trafficking Initiative, which has interviewed around 1,000 massage workers over the past five years and helped the 49-year-old immigrant who was sexually assaulted leave the business after she was arrested. “They are showing up in different parts of the country, but all of them have addresses in Flushing, Queens,” she said.[Read: An epic tragedy in the underground sex industry in Flushing.]The women are paid just a sliver of the $60 or more the client pays for an hourlong massage. Their real money — and chance at a better life — comes in the form of tips, which they are encouraged or forced to amplify through illegal means.A 60-year-old former massage worker from Taiwan, who agreed to be identified only by the nickname she commonly uses, Tina, said she was lured into working at a massage parlor in New York a decade ago by the travel agency broker who helped secure her visa to travel to the United States. “People come here and don’t have a place to live,” she said. “These places offer a place to live, and it seems like a nice idea. They say, ‘It’s not safe to keep your passport on hand,’ and they will ask to hold the passport.”She was arrested several times before getting out of the business, and feels comparatively lucky. One close friend was spirited to Texas by traffickers, she said, had her passport taken and was forced to see eight to 12 customers a day. One day the tearful calls she often received from her friend came to an abrupt halt.“A lot of the businesses that look like either nail salons or massage places, especially the places that offer massage, there are bad things happening there,” she said. “It’s 100 percent organized crime.”The ubiquity of the massage parlors offers an accessibility and sheen of normalcy not offered by traditional brothels. And as the massage parlors have expanded even into small-town America in recent years, meticulously detailed review sites like Rubmaps have served as the Yelp and Foursquare of the illicit parlor business, with graphic anatomical descriptions of the women and explicit breakdowns of the sexual services proffered.Even at illicit parlors, owners and managers can claim ignorance of the additional services offered by employees behind closed doors. The evidence gathered during raids and searches often tells a far different tale. The police say it is common to find ledgers tracking the number of “dates” women have had, as was found in a bust in Dallas in 2016. In one case in Kansas, a search of the premises yielded a notebook with handwritten Chinese-English translations that “included sexually explicit phrases such as ‘did you bring condom’ and ‘happy ending.’”A federal law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because this person is involved in active cases, said that the most common method for smuggling women from Asian countries was either a fraudulent tourist visa or a fraudulent work visa, such as for nursing work. Many came as students, then overstayed to work in the sex industry.Many women arrive in the United States from China bearing heavy debt burdens and try to find work in restaurants or nail salons. But the money isn’t good enough for the five-figure debts weighing them down. The massage jobs are presented as opportunities for fast, easy money.“They will talk about how they used to work in a restaurant and it was really hard physically and they couldn’t make that much money, and then they heard from somebody or saw an ad saying they could make a lot more money in a massage parlor,” said Leigh Latimer, a supervising attorney at the Legal Aid Society’s exploitation intervention project in New York.One reason the Asian massage parlors remain so poorly understood is the extreme reluctance of the women to speak with the police and even with their own lawyers.“Even though I’ve represented many, many women arrested in unlicensed massage parlors, because of the level of distrust of people working, almost all immigrants, almost all undocumented, they don’t trust even their attorneys enough to let them know what’s happened to them,” Ms. Latimer said.Some fear retaliation by traffickers to their families in China, and some feel morally indebted to those who helped find them a job, said Chris Muller, the director of training and external affairs at Restore NYC, an anti-sex-trafficking organization.“This is a powerful exploitation tactic,” he said. “Any favor is implied there is going to be a payment back. ‘Look at what I have done for you. I found you a job. I found you a place to live and this is how you repay me?’”Small networks of spas are also common, and their ownership structures are complex and opaque. “It’s rare that you have a mom-and-pop business where they’re just running one,” said Lt. Christopher Sharpe of the New York Police Department’s vice section. “Usually if they’re running one, they have a second or a third business.”Bradley Myles, chief executive of Polaris Project, a nonprofit that works to combat human trafficking, said that the madams arrested on big raids like the recent ones in Florida — known as “mamasans” — are often women in their 60s and 70s who have spent decades in the sex trade but are usually pretty far down in the organization.Above these site managers is usually a person who appears on paperwork as the massage parlor owner, but is often just a frontman running a shell company. The payouts from the shell company go to what is legally known as the “beneficial owner.”“Very little is known of the behind-the-scene owners,” Mr. Myles said. “They are hiding behind shell companies, hiding behind mamasans. They are hiding behind fake people.”In addition, the networks have groups of drivers that help move the women from place to place. Some networks are only two or three layers deep, others four or five.“I’ve certainly seen indicia of larger networks and indicia of powerful transporters,” said the federal law enforcement official.The Florida Department of Health disciplined 62 massage parlors or therapists last fiscal year, up from 14 the year before, records show. The agency receives upward of 300 complaints about unlicensed massage facilities each year.Department inspection reports described women inside the spas living in tight quarters cluttered with essentials, including rolling bath carts stuffed with toiletries, shelves lined with coffee mugs and cooking pots and stashes of assorted snacks. The women slept on individual cots and in some cases appeared to keep their belongings and blankets inside locked plastic trunks.Their IDs showed that several of them had addresses outside Florida, including in Flushing, N.Y.; Lilburn, Ga.; San Gabriel, Calif.; and Temple City, Calif.Those who are arrested are not necessarily left to their own resources. When sheriff’s deputies in Martin County, Fla., were interviewing Lixia Zhu, 48, one of the massage parlor employees arrested two weeks ago, it wasn’t long before a New York lawyer arrived and identified himself as her lawyer. The lawyer, Baya Harrison IV, told The New York Times that Ms. Zhu used to work in New York and that her friends had hired him to defend her.The county sheriff, William D. Snyder, said Ms. Zhu had tearfully told deputies and a public defender about how her passport was kept from her in a locked safe and how the woman she worked for once threatened her by brandishing a gun.One woman in the Florida sting has been charged with human trafficking, after police officers conducting surveillance saw her shuttling two other women carrying suitcases in and out of a spa in Vero Beach.Bob Houston, a former F.B.I. agent who now works as a consultant to combat trafficking, said that Thai traffickers often employ elaborate schemes to help women intended for the massage industry apply for tourist visas. The traffickers create false back stories, giving women the appearance of an established life at home, including a spouse and bank account, all to help them qualify for a tourist visa. They even produce fake diplomas from massage schools. The tab is usually $40,000 to $60,000, he said.“They owe a bunch of money to the people who recruited them,” he said.In December, 36 people in Minnesota were convicted for their roles in a Thai sex trafficking ring that shuttled hundreds of women from Bangkok to cities across the United States, including Phoenix, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Minneapolis.The women, referred to as “flowers” by the criminal organizations, were forced to work at massage parlors with no choice about where, when and with whom they performed sex acts until their debts were paid off. They were permitted to move around outside the parlors only with so-called runners working for the organization, evidence in the case showed.The decision by law enforcement in Florida to focus on patrons of the establishments in such a public way rather than the women working there has generated a lot of fear among clients.John Musca, a criminal defense lawyer with an office in Vero Beach whose website advertises sex crime defense, said he has received panicked phone calls from many men who frequented the establishments and are worried that the police are about to come knocking.“There are a great number of folks who are on pins and needles,” Mr. Musca said."
63,"Updated Feb. 4Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials took the rapper 21 Savage into custody on Sunday for being in the United States illegally, according to an agency spokesman.21 Savage, whose real name is Sha Yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, was arrested during an operation by federal and local law enforcement authorities in Atlanta, the spokesman, Bryan D. Cox, said in a statement.Mr. Abraham-Joseph is an “unlawfully present United Kingdom national” who legally entered the United States in 2005 but was supposed to leave the next year, according to the terms of his nonimmigrant visa, Mr. Cox said.[Is 21 Savage American? Our music critic weighs in.]In addition to being in the country unlawfully after 2006, Mr. Abraham-Joseph was convicted of felony drug charges in 2014 in Fulton County, Ga., the statement said.Mr. Abraham-Joseph faces deportation proceedings and was expected to appear before a federal immigration judge.“We are working diligently to get Mr. Abraham-Joseph out of detention while we work with the authorities to clear up any misunderstandings,” Dina LaPolt, Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s lawyer, said in a statement on Sunday night.In a statement on Monday, representatives of Mr. Abraham-Joseph said that he “has never hid his immigration status from the US government.”“As a minor, his family overstayed their work visas,” the statement said, and Mr. Abraham-Joseph “was left without legal status through no fault of his own.”His arrest came after he performed at the Super Bowl Music Fest at the State Farm Arena on Thursday.Mr. Abraham-Joseph has been nominated for a Grammy for Record of the Year for “Rockstar,” a song with the rapper Post Malone. Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s album “I Am > I Was” opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in January. He is known for his flat delivery and subdued rap style.Mr. Abraham-Joseph has long maintained that he was from Atlanta. In August, he gave backpacks and games to children in Atlanta during an annual drive called Issa Back 2 School Drive.“Mr. Abraham-Joseph is a role model to the young people in this country, especially in Atlanta,” Ms. LaPolt said. She added that Mr. Abraham-Joseph was “actively working in the community leading programs to help underprivileged youths in financial literacy.”In a 2016 interview with VladTV, an urban news YouTube channel, Mr. Abraham-Joseph was asked where he grew up and he listed all the neighborhoods in Atlanta he had previously lived in.“I grew up on the East Side, Glenwood, Decatur,” Mr. Abraham-Joseph says. “I done grew up in all Atlanta really, everybody know me. If you don’t, you ain’t from this city.”"
64,"A boat smuggling Haitian migrants has sunk off the Bahamas, leaving at least 28 dead and 17 others in police custody, officials said on Sunday.Chief Petty Officer Jonathan Rolle of the Royal Bahamas Defense Force said that residents of the island of Abaco had found four bodies and at least 15 survivors off the Bahamian coast on Saturday, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Rolle said the ship appeared to be an American vessel engaged in people-smuggling.By Sunday afternoon, local forces and the United States Coast Guard had found 28 bodies in and around a sunken ship, The A.P. said. The number of total rescued had risen to 17. The boat’s final destination was unclear.The American Embassy in Haiti described the accident in a tweet early on Monday morning as “another tragic loss of life” and said the vessel had been “trafficking people out of Haiti.”“No journey is worth risking lives,” the embassy said.The Bahamian authorities have apprehended about 300 Haitians for illegal entry this year, the Royal Bahamas Defense Force said in a statement on Saturday.In 2013, at least 30 Haitians who tried to sail to the United States were found drowned after their overloaded boat ran aground off the Bahamas and capsized. Fishermen had tipped off the local authorities about the 40-foot vessel days earlier, but the military was unable to conduct air searches because all three of its planes were out of service.Once the Coast Guard eventually deployed a helicopter, it found the boat in about an hour, about 20 miles from where the fishermen had first reported seeing it."
65,"Every day for over two and a half years, and sometimes twice a day, immigration agents arrived at several Motel 6 locations in Washington State and, without warrants, were able to obtain the names, birth dates, identification data, room assignments and license plate numbers of every guest.The agents, with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, or ICE, would sometimes circle the names of guests that sounded Latino before targeting them for questioning, detainment and deportation, according to a settlement agreement announced this week by the state’s attorney general, Bob Ferguson.Over the period in question, employees at seven motels gave information related to 80,000 guests to the agents, violating the company’s privacy policy, Mr. Ferguson’s office said on Thursday. To resolve a lawsuit the office filed against Motel 6 last year, the chain agreed to pay $12 million, much of it in damages to guests who were affected.Motel 6, which is owned by the private equity firm Blackstone Group and has 1,400 locations in North America, also signed a legally binding commitment to stop volunteering guest information absent a warrant anywhere in the United States.“Motel 6’s actions tore families apart and violated the privacy rights of tens of thousands of Washingtonians,” Mr. Ferguson said in a statement. The company owns and operates 26 motels in Washington, according to his office.Mr. Ferguson’s office began its investigation after seeing media reports about two Motel 6 locations in Phoenix cooperating with ICE in 2017, a practice the company acknowledged.In November, Motel 6 agreed to pay up to $8.9 million to settle a class-action lawsuit in Federal District Court in Arizona claiming that the two motels had invaded guests’ privacy and discriminated against them.In Washington, Mr. Ferguson’s office said, ICE agents received guest information from employees in Bellingham, North Everett, South Everett, South Seattle, South Tacoma and at two locations near the Seattle airport.Guest lists were often printed in advance of the agents’ visits, and new employees at some of the locations were trained to prepare forms for the agents to sign once the lists were handed over.The arrangement led to the detentions of at least nine Washington residents, Mr. Ferguson’s office said. One man, who was spending a night in a motel near the Seattle airport to wrap Christmas presents for his children, was approached by ICE agents in the parking lot and subsequently deported, according to the attorney general.Another man, who had lived in the United States since the age of 1, was detained for six days after ICE agents approached him as he was retrieving milk for his infant from his car, Mr. Ferguson’s office said. He was replaced by his employer and later struggled to find work.As part of the settlement agreement, Motel 6 agreed to train its employees to request authorization from the company’s legal department before providing personal information, unless guests were in danger.“The safety and security of our guests, which includes protecting guest information, is our top priority, and we are pleased to be able to reach resolution in this matter,” the company said in a statement.Officials at ICE could not be reached for comment.Over the summer, amid an uproar over the separation of migrant children from their parents as part of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy on illegal immigration, workers at several technology companies and management consulting firms urged their employers to cut ties with ICE.More than 100 Microsoft employees signed an open letter protesting a $19.4 million contract with immigration authorities. McKinsey & Company said in July that it had stopped working with the agency. Deloitte workers called for the firm to end its consulting projects with ICE, distributing a petition that cited “moral objections.”"
66,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Friday that his administration was “strongly” considering releasing migrants detained at the border into mostly Democratic “sanctuary cities,” suggesting that the idea should make liberals “very happy” because of their immigration policies.“We are looking at the possibility, strongly looking at it to be honest with you,” he said on Friday in response to a question about the proposal.“We might as well do what they always say they want,” Mr. Trump said if Democrats do not agree to new immigration policies. “We’ll bring them to sanctuary city areas and let that particular area take care of it,” he said, adding that California welcomed the idea of more people coming to the state.“We can give them a lot. We can give them an unlimited supply,” he said.The comments came a day after the administration said the policy proposal was never seriously considered. But after the president’s Twitter posts on Friday, a White House spokesman said Democrats should work with the administration to welcome migrants into their districts.“Democrats say we must have open borders and that illegal immigrants have a right to be in this country at all costs,” the spokesman, Hogan Gidley, said, adding, “so they should be working with the administration to find the best ways to transport those illegal aliens that are already set for release, into communities in their districts and states.”Democratic lawmakers do not want “open borders,” as the president has suggested. They favor improving border security, but they do not support many of Mr. Trump’s hard-line immigration policy proposals, such as building a wall along the southwestern border.Last year, Trump administration officials had floated the idea of transporting migrants to sanctuary cities, which do not strictly adhere to federal immigration laws, as a way to address the influx of migrants crossing the border with Mexico.One of the highest-profile sanctuary cities is San Francisco, home to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is one of the president’s top political rivals and a thorn in his efforts to change American immigration laws. The White House raised the proposal again in February, suggesting it could punish Democrats for rejecting budget requests for border security.Ms. Pelosi’s office condemned the Trump administration for the idea, which the Department of Homeland Security said on Thursday was ultimately rejected.But Mr. Trump’s tweets on Friday indicated it was not off the table, and the president appeared to revel in the Democratic outrage, saying, “The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy – so this should make them very happy!”Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, a state with several sanctuary cities, criticized the president’s proposal.“Trump’s plan to release migrants into ‘enemy’ cities as if they are some kind of contagion is reprehensible,” Mr. Markey tweeted. “Trump is obsessed with the border and sanctuary cities because he only wins by dividing people.”There has been an influx of migrant families crossing the southern border into the United States, exceeding the staffing and resources available for immigration enforcement. And with a shortage of space in shelters and detention centers, immigration officials have been releasing migrants into the country as they wait to appear before an immigration court. Those courts are so backlogged with cases that it can be months or years before the migrants are called to appear before a judge.A top immigration official at the Department of Homeland Security pushed back last year against the proposal to release migrants into sanctuary cities, and said it would create “an unnecessary operational burden” on Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Currently, these migrants are released into border towns. Transporting them to sanctuary cities, which are scattered across the country — with some as far away as Massachusetts and Vermont — would come at a great expense.Typically, reallocating homeland security funds intended for a specific purpose would require approval from House and Senate appropriators.Some immigration advocates saw Mr. Trump’s proposal as an attempt to stoke racial tensions across the country.George Gascón, the district attorney for San Francisco, said the proposal was “the clearest sign yet that the president fully intends to chart a path to re-election on the back of racist rhetoric and policies intended to divide us.”Janet Murguía, the president of UnidosUS, formerly the National Council of La Raza, called the proposal “reprehensible.”“It seems that not only is President Trump attempting to utilize human beings, who have already experienced a traumatic situation, as tools to get back at political foes, but as a vehicle to further divide communities by stoking racial tensions,” she said in a statement."
67,"On the night of Jan. 10, someone walked into a home tucked near the forests that blanket Nevada’s northwest border and fatally shot 56-year-old Connie Koontz, the authorities said. Three days later, again under the cover of darkness, someone walked into another Douglas County home about a mile up the road and shot and killed Sophia Renken, 74.Then, three days after that, Washoe County sheriff’s deputies searched a home about 40 miles farther north on La Guardia Lane. There, they found 81-year-old Gerald David and his wife, Sharon David, 80, both with gunshot wounds; they, too, were dead.For nine days, law enforcement officials from across the region banded together to both reassure and ready residents who had been shaken by what prosecutors would call “brutal murders.” Lock your doors and windows, the authorities said; turn on outdoor lights; keep your cellphones handy.By Sunday — the 10th day of regionwide panic — they were able to deliver some calming news: A suspect was in custody; they believed the man, who they have varyingly identified as Wilbur or Wilber Martinez-Guzman, was responsible for all four homicides.Mr. Martinez-Guzman, who is either 19 or 20 years old, had been arrested at a home on Saturday afternoon on felony burglary and immigration charges, Sheriff Ken Furlong of Carson City said, though prosecutors added that they intended to charge him with the murders. Law enforcement officials did not discuss the motive in the killings.Immigration officials, Sheriff Furlong said, had notified law enforcement that Mr. Martinez-Guzman had been in the Carson City area for about a year, but “was likely in the United States illegally and was detainable.” Jail records show that he is under a hold from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which Sheriff Furlong said prevented him from being released on bail.The agency said Wednesday that Mr. Martinez-Guzman “is a citizen of Guatemala who ICE believes is unlawfully present in the United States.” There were no prior criminal or immigration encounters noted in his history, officials said, while also confirming that they had placed a so-called detainer on him.“Four people in Nevada viciously robbed and killed by an illegal immigrant who should not have been in our Country,” President Trump said in a tweet on Monday. “We need a powerful Wall!”The disclosure that Mr. Martinez-Guzman may be in the United States illegally has thrust the case into a set of high-profile murders that Mr. Trump has leveraged to bolster his arguments about immigration and the need for a wall along the country’s southwest border. The dispute over funding for such a wall remains at the center of a government shutdown.The president has previously called attention to the murder of Mollie Tibbetts, a 20-year-old college student, who the police have said was killed by an undocumented immigrant from Mexico. (Her father has called on people to not exploit her death to promote a political agenda.) Mr. Trump also said it was “time to get tough on Border Security” after the authorities arrested a man in California in December who they said fatally shot a police officer and had entered the United States illegally.In the meantime, friends and family of the four Nevada victims — some of whom flanked the police at the Sunday news conference — were left to grieve.Eddie England, 70, who met Ms. Renken through the Carson Valley chapter of the Antique Automobile Club of America, said in an interview on Tuesday that four lives could have been saved if Mr. Martinez-Guzman had been expelled from the country.He described Ms. Renken as an independent and tough woman who drove a 1930s Ford Model A. Still, she moved to Gardnerville in Douglas County a few years ago to be closer to people — a situation she felt would be safer, Mr. England said.“And this,” he said, “is what happened to her.”“It’s hard to take.”Alan Squailia, a friend of Mr. David, described Gerald and his wife as “salt-of-the-earth people,” who were active community servants and animal lovers.“If you needed a friend, and needed someone to help you, it was this couple,” Mr. Squailia, 75, said.Looking at a photograph of Mr. Martinez-Guzman, Mr. Squailia said he could imagine that Mr. David would have invited the young man into his home if he had been looking for help.“The whole city of Reno is devastated over this,” he said. “We still can’t wrap our minds around it.”"
68,"MERIDA, Mexico — Mexican and U.S. business leaders on Friday pushed back against President Donald Trump's threats to close the U.S.-Mexico border and urged him to drop steel tariffs that have hindered the ratification of a trade deal brokered last year.At a meeting in the eastern Mexican city of Merida attended by government officials from both countries, business lobbies united to call on Trump to drop his threats to disrupt border trade after days of hold-ups on the frontier.Describing the U.S.-Mexico relationship as a top priority, U.S. Chamber of Commerce head Tom Donohue told a news conference the United States should exempt Mexico and Canada from steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by Trump last June before its Congress approves the deal struck to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement.""That is why we are the first out of the gate to warn against the disastrous consequences of closing the U.S.-Mexican border,"" Donohue said, sitting next to Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who warmly applauded his speech.Mexico is the United States' second biggest export market, and third biggest trading partner. U.S.-Mexico trade is worth about half a trillion dollars a year.Mexico and Canada want Trump to drop the metals tariffs before their lawmakers approve the deal agreed in September known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).Tensions over the border are further hindering the process.Following a surge in asylum seekers who mostly traveled through Mexico from Central American countries, Trump last month threatened to close the border if Mexico did not immediately halt illegal immigration. His government then redeployed border agents to police the frontier, sparking delays which have cost businesses on both sides millions of dollars.After Donohue spoke, Carlos Salazar, president of Mexico's powerful CCE business lobby, weighed in to say he hoped the U.S. government understood the need to keep the border open.""And let's not confuse migration problems with trade problems and industry problems,"" Salazar said, seated on the other side of Lopez Obrador, who again applauded the speech.Lopez Obrador himself, as he has for months, avoided any implicit or explicit criticism of Trump, instead offering thanks to the American president for ""being open to deal with our commercial, migratory and security matters with respect.""Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross looked on, seated next to Salazar, but did not address the news conference.The event was part of the latest iteration of a recurring business forum known as the U.S.-Mexico CEO Dialogue.On the sidelines, Mexican Economy Minister Graciela Marquez met Ross and again urged the United States to end the metals tariffs for Mexico, part of a set of national security measures Trump had ordered under the so-called ""Section 232"" mechanism.In addition, the minister asked that Ross push forward talks aimed at reaching a quick deal in a stop-start tomato dispute between Mexican and U.S. producers.Marquez was able to tout a workers' rights bill that Mexico's lower house of Congress approved late on Thursday, legislation that U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called for to win Democratic support for USMCA.U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette met Mexico's Energy Minister Rocio Nahle and later said she had indicated to him that her government did not plan to roll back an energy overhaul passed by the previous administration.The 2013-14 reform opened up oil production and exploration to private capital, drawing significant interest from U.S. investors. At the time, Lopez Obrador roundly attacked the reform. However, he has since said he will give private operators time to show that they can increase output.Lopez Obrador wants to revive state oil company Pemex and plans to build an $8 billion refinery in his home state of Tabasco. A U.S. embassy spokesman said that Mexican officials hoped to help fund the project by reducing tax evasion. (Reporting by Anthony Esposito and Dave Graham; Editing by Grant McCool)"

70,"Mr. Trump has escalated a misleading defense of his administration’s practice of breaking up families to outright revisionist history. There is no law that mandates family separation, let alone a law enacted under Mr. Obama. The practice is the result of a policy enacted by the Trump administration, and ended by Mr. Trump last June.Last year, as the Trump administration faced backlash over its policy, top officials countered that Mr. Trump’s predecessors had also separated families at the border. That was misleading. While previous administrations did break up families, it was rare — for example, in cases where there was doubt about the familial relationship between a child and an accompanying adult, according to former officials and immigration experts.Neither former Presidents George W. Bush nor Barack Obama had a policy that had the effect of widespread family separation, Sarah Pierce of the Migration Policy Institute told The Times last June. “Nothing like what the Trump administration is doing has occurred before,” she said.The Bush administration introduced a program in 2005 that also referred for prosecution immigrants illegally crossing the border, but it made an exception for parents with children. The Obama administration in 2014 detained families together, drawing its own criticisms and lawsuits.Under Mr. Trump, the Justice Department announced its “zero-tolerance policy” for illegally entering the United States in April 2018, describing it as “new” and in response to an increase in unauthorized border crossings that spring. The policy called for the criminal prosecution of everyone who enters the country illegally. As a result, nearly 3,000 children were forcibly separated from adult family members who were detained under the new policy that multiple top Trump officials have characterized as a deterrent.After widespread condemnation from lawmakers in both parties, immigration activists and the United Nations, Mr. Trump signed an executive order in June that attempted to end the practice of family separation. It did not rescind the “zero tolerance” approach toward prosecuting migrants, but said it is now the policy of the Trump administration to keep families together.At the White House on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that his administration would not revive family separation as a practice, but he added, “When you don’t do it, it brings a lot more people to the border.” Curious about the accuracy of a claim?

If someone forwarded it to you, sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox.By Kirk Semple in Ciudad Juárez, MexicoIn 1994, Franklin Pupo’s father fled Cuba by way of Central America and Mexico, before settling in Las Vegas.Now, 25 years later, Mr. Pupo is following roughly the same path.“Incredible,” said Mr. Pupo, 40, marveling at how his family’s history was repeating itself.I spoke with Mr. Pupo and his wife, Yaima García, 37, this week in an evangelical church that had been converted into a temporary migrant shelter. The building, a cinder block warehouse that previously served as a hardware store, was tucked in a scrappy, semi-industrial neighborhood of this border city in northern Mexico.The couple’s journey had come to an abrupt halt here a month ago when their quest for sanctuary in the United States ran up against the cold realities of the border. They are now among many thousands who are waiting in Ciudad Juárez and other border cities for their chance to apply for asylum in the United States.It’s a quirk of current migratory patterns that Mr. Pupo and Ms. García also find themselves among many other Cuban asylum-seekers in Ciudad Juárez. By the estimates of government officials, as many as 70 percent of the more than 3,000 migrants waiting here to apply for asylum across the border in El Paso, are Cuban.In other border cities, those waiting to cross are mostly Central Americans.“The Cuban always tries to be in a group,” Ms. García explained. “I see it as a form of protection”How Ciudad Juárez came to be the preferred crossing point for Cubans remains a mystery. But migrants say that it has the reputation for being safer for migrants and less crowded with asylum-seekers than other popular crossing points. Word traveled through the Cuban migrant grapevine — in WhatsApp messaging groups, by phone and on social media.While Cubans have been a common sight for years on the migrant trail through Mexico, their numbers rising and falling in response to events back home and shifts in American policy, the flow appeared to pick up in recent months.Officials here in Ciudad Juárez said they began registering a sharp increase in the number of Cuban asylum-seekers in late fall.The Cubans, by and large, say they are fleeing political repression in the Caribbean nation. Cubans seeking sanctuary used to get special treatment in the United States: Under a policy known as “wet foot, dry foot,” Cubans who made it to American soil were allowed to stay and eventually apply for permanent residency. But the Obama administration halted those privileges in January 2017, and since then Cuban asylum-seekers have been like everyone else.In Ciudad Juárez, they have run up against a Trump administration system that limits the daily number of asylum seekers allowed to present their cases at ports of entry. This practice has given rise to informal waiting lists in border towns.So, the Cubans and others are biding their time — in migrant shelters, in budget hotels and in cheap, rented rooms — and suppressing the impulse to hire a smuggler and cross illegally.Mr. Pupo and Ms. García left Cuba on Feb. 6, flew to Panama and traveled overland to Mexico, arriving in Ciudad Juárez on March 1 and finding their way to Solus Christus Church.The shelter is overseen by Lilia and Rodolfo Barraza, who opened its doors to migrants on Feb. 26 after local officials appealed for help in absorbing the flow of asylum-seekers into the city.Mr. Barraza, 65, a pastor, said that initially he had been inclined to say no, but he remembered a biblical passage that described the moral obligation to do good.“And when I thought of that biblical verse, I said, ‘Bring them,’” Mr. Barraza recalled. “And the next day they were here.”The couple has hosted as many as 74 migrants at one time, jammed into a space suitable for far less; there are currently 38, all but one of them Cubans. (The exception is a Venezuelan woman.)Ms. Barraza, 61, said that before they had opened their doors, she had never met a Cuban. “But now I think they’re beautiful,” she said. “We love them. They are our brothers and sisters.”The symbolic focus of the space is a white board on which is written the waiting-list number of the last migrant allowed to cross the border and present themselves to the American authorities. A migrant’s number in line has become almost as important as any other piece of data in their life.When a migrant’s number is called and they successfully cross, it’s a bittersweet moment for those who remain behind: They lose a traveling partner but move one step closer to their own appointment.“It could be a week, two weeks, a month,” Ms. García mused on a recent afternoon at the shelter.The number on the board was 6995. Her number is 7533. Mr. Pupo’s is 7534.For now, Mr. Pupo added, “this is our refuge.”Kirk is one of a team of New York Times journalists currently reporting from the border.

The processing center in the border city of McAllen has frequently exceeded its capacity, leading to mass releases of migrants that have overwhelmed nonprofit shelters.The building, known informally as Ursula because of its Ursula Avenue address, has been criticized by immigrant advocates for holding migrants in large pens made of chain-link fencing.  Manny Fernandez, the New York Times Houston bureau chief, spoke to Senator Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who spent more than an hour touring the Ursula facility last week.The following is an edited and condensed version of the conversation.Q: What was it like?A: I was there on Sunday (March 24). I’m not going to talk to you like most Democrats will talk to you. I’m going to tell you that, when I walked in there, it ripped your guts out. It made you cry. It did all those things that people say it did to you, because you had children and you had mothers. I looked at them as kids the same age as my grandkids. On the other side of the equation, there were a lot of people in a fairly small area, and the ventilation had to be pretty darn good because it didn’t stink.How many migrants were there at the time?Twenty-two hundred. And their capacity is 1,500.Did it feel overcrowded or just crowded?Gosh, you’re asking the wrong guy, because this is the first time I’ve been in that processing center. It felt crowded.Can you describe it?It’s a metal building that’s insulated. Each one of the holding areas had a bathroom and a sink. They’re held by sex, of course. And then the families were held in different steel cages, basically. Everybody had a blanket that wanted one, Mylar blankets. Most of them were laying down on mats. Some of them were standing up. Some of them were sitting on benches.What were Border Patrol officials saying about all this?They said they were processing them through as quick as they could. They said the manpower they were using here was manpower that they’d rather have on the border, but nonetheless they had to process these folks. Look, I mean, I don’t like prisons. I don’t like holding people up. But the bottom line is that I don’t have any better idea than the way they were doing it, and I asked them if they did and they didn’t either, although they were tasked with trying to find a better way to do it. They were providing food and water and baby formula, and were treating these folks as good as they could treat them, in the conditions that were there. I’m simply just not critical of Border Protection in this situation because I don’t know what the solution is.Some Democrats were calling the mass releases a manufactured attempt to fuel the crisis-at-the-border narrative. Do you agree?I don’t think I can agree with it. Look, I’m not a conspiracy theorist. I think I have to go with what I saw, and what I saw literally was a bunch of families in this facility and I think it is what it is right now. The direction I would take it is, what are the push factors in these countries that are pushing these families to our southern border?Was Border Patrol cooperative during the tour?They were absolutely cooperative. I’ve been on these trips before, and I know for a fact they show you want they want you to see. But they were very cooperative.Were the conditions horrible? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I guess. I don’t think they were horrible, but by the same token it was gut-wrenching to see mothers and children sitting there in cages.It sounds like it was packed but people still had some room.I don’t know how many square feet each person needs to determine whether it was overflowed or packed or beyond the pale. I just know as I looked there, there was some space and people could mill around, although it was very crowded. It would drive me crazy. My nearest neighbor is a mile away. It would drive me nuts.President Trump visited a portion of the border wall in California on Friday, a day after backing off a threat to close the border with Mexico.The president  floated the idea of closing the border last week — defending it repeatedly here and here — even as economic experts warned doing so could damage the economy.(The agricultural and manufacturing industries would have been especially hard-hit by a closing, including a potential avocado shortage.)Instead, on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he would give Mexico a “one-year warning” before closing the border.“If the drugs don’t stop or aren’t largely stopped, we’re going to put tariffs on Mexico and products, in particular cars — the whole ballgame is cars,” he said. “And if that doesn’t stop the drugs, we close the border.”Read earlier installments of Crossing the Border here.

72,"SAN ANTONIO — President Trump used the backdrop of a Texas fund-raiser on Wednesday to warn of the dangers and tragedy of migrants flowing across the Mexican border — an issue he predicted would play well for him in his 2020 re-election campaign.With high-dollar donors standing behind him, Mr. Trump said migrants pouring across the southwestern border were dying in great numbers while gang members arriving from Central America were marauding and threatening American ranchers. And he made clear that he was going to try to put the blame on Democrats.“I think they’re going to pay a very big price in 2020,” Mr. Trump said here, before heading to Houston for another fund-raiser. “I think the border is going to be an incredible issue. And they’re on the wrong side. They want to have open borders.”But Julián Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio and a Democratic candidate for president, fired back at Mr. Trump, accusing him of using such talk as a political tool to energize his voters with dark threats about immigrants.“It was predictable that he would start beating the drum of this again as he gets closer to re-election,” Mr. Castro said in an interview. “What I’ve noticed is that any time he gets into political hot water, he goes back to the issue of immigration to drum up support.”Mr. Castro, who served as housing secretary in the Obama administration, is uniquely positioned to take on Mr. Trump on the immigration issue. The grandson of a Mexican immigrant, he is the only Latino candidate in the race for the Democratic nomination.As the sun set Wednesday evening, Mr. Castro held an immigration-focused rally of his own in San Antonio. His campaign had billed the event as an opportunity for the city, with its significant Mexican-American population, to show its resistance to Mr. Trump’s immigration policy.Before a modest crowd, Mr. Castro denounced Mr. Trump’s anti-immigrant message in no uncertain terms, calling the president’s policies “downright stupid.”“When it comes to immigration,” Mr. Castro said, “this president and his policies have been an absolute failure for our country.”The president’s decision to weigh in on the border was a clear signal that he did not intend to let the issue fade. At the fund-raiser, he told reporters that he wanted to call attention to a situation that he said has been ignored in the news media: the plight of migrants who cross illegally into the United States and then die of thirst or hunger.“This doesn’t come out in the fake news,” Mr. Trump said as he recounted the stories about migrants that about a dozen donors told him. At Mr. Trump’s urging, several of the donors described finding the bodies of migrants — including pregnant women and children — in the vast brush of their property.The president said he had never heard such stories of migrants dying, even from his top immigration and border patrol officials. In fact, immigrant advocates have for years documented the grim fate of some migrants who grow sick and die trying to make it into the United States. The advocates say Mr. Trump’s policies have made the problem worse by limiting the number of migrants who can legally claim asylum at ports of entry, pushing more to cross at remote areas of the border.Several of the donors also told of how afraid they had felt when migrants from Central America, dressed in black, turned up at their homes.“Dangerous people are coming here, and the good people are dying,” Mr. Trump said, adding that the donors had all told him that the answer to the problem was to build the wall that has become the symbol of his approach to immigration.The president, who was joined at the round table with donors by Brad Parscale, his 2020 campaign manager, denied that the unscheduled remarks to reporters about the border were part of a campaign message. But immigration and border security has been a defining issue of his presidency. And Mr. Trump is betting that portraying the crisis that he says now exists on the Mexican border will be just as effective in his re-election campaign as the issue was in 2016.In the past several days, Mr. Trump has forced out Kirstjen Nielsen, his homeland security secretary, and several other top immigration officials for being too timid about shutting down the border and changing asylum rules to deny entry to migrants seeking protection in the United States.One of those officials, Ronald D. Vitiello, the acting chief of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, resigned on Wednesday after Mr. Trump pulled back his nomination for the permanent position, saying he wanted someone tougher. In a statement issued on her last day in office, Ms. Nielsen called Mr. Vitiello “an unwavering advocate for the dedicated men and women who enforce our immigration laws.”A top administration official said Tuesday that the staffing changes were meant to make way for more aggressive immigration actions.[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]But the president faces challenges of his own. His campaign promises have mostly gone unfulfilled. He has largely failed to build the “big beautiful wall” along the southwestern border as he promised. And the recent surge of migrant families from Central America is a vivid demonstration of his inability to stop what he has called an “invasion.”There was also significant evidence during the 2018 midterm elections that the president’s immigration attacks backfired in some Republican districts around the country. For example, several House Republicans, including some of the party’s leaders in Congress, complained to Mr. Trump that his announcement right before the election that he was considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship might have cost several moderate Republicans their seats.And as he sets out for the re-election campaign, Mr. Trump is certain to face several challengers among the Democrats who are determined to make the president’s immigration agenda a key part of their reason for running. In February, Beto O’Rourke, a former congressman from El Paso who has since declared his own candidacy for president, outlined his opposition to Mr. Trump’s immigration policies at a rally held at the same time the president spoke in that Texas border city.“We are not safe because of walls but in spite of walls,” Mr. O’Rourke told supporters even as Mr. Trump was pressing to “finish the wall.”The dual candidacies of Mr. Castro and Mr. O’Rourke are almost certain to place Texas squarely at the center of the increasingly heated immigration debate.“Texas is a Latino state, and we have two Texans on the ballot who are going to be turning out and galvanizing people from Texas,” said Mayra Macias, a vice president of the Latino Victory Project. “But it’s also helping galvanize people, Latinos in particular, across the country because they are seeing these candidates talk about issues that affect us.”But if immigration is at once a key campaign issue in Texas and other states, including California and Arizona, Republicans are betting that Mr. Trump’s anti-immigrant message will also resonate far from the border."
73,"Kevin K. McAleenan, the commissioner of United States Customs and Border Protection, will become the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, President Trump said in a tweet on Sunday.The announcement came shortly after Mr. Trump said Kirstjen Nielsen was leaving the position, ending a tumultuous tenure in charge of the agency, which oversees border security, among other duties. She had taken the job in late 2017.Mr. McAleenan, 47, will oversee an agency that has at times been a target of the president’s dissatisfaction over an increase of migrants illegally entering the United States at the southwestern border.“I have confidence that Kevin will do a great job!” Mr. Trump said in his tweet.In her resignation letter, Ms. Nielsen said she hoped the incoming secretary would “have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America’s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation’s discourse.”Mr. McAleenan has a law degree from the University of Chicago and practiced law in California before he worked for the government. He held a variety of positions at the border protection agency before becoming its deputy commissioner in 2014 under the Obama administration. He won the country’s highest civil service honor, the Presidential Rank Award, in 2015.Mr. McAleenan became the acting commissioner of the agency in January 2017 and was formally sworn in as commissioner in March 2018. He focused on counterterrorism, border security and trade enforcement, oversaw about 60,000 employees and managed a budget of over $13 billion, according to the agency.As the nation’s top border enforcement officer, Mr. McAleenan also helped carry out the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy to prosecute parents caught crossing the border illegally, which led to family separations. That policy was reversed, but the effects remain. In court documents filed on Friday, the government said it might take federal officials two years to identify what could be thousands of immigrant children who were separated from their families at the border.In an interview in August, Mr. McAleenan said that “a better system would allow us to keep families together for the entirety of the immigration proceeding, which takes an average of 45 days.”He added that there should be a penalty for crossing the border illegally.“It’s not a victimless crime,” he said. “Not only are the people at risk, so are our agents who need to apprehend or rescue them. It’s also a diversionary tactic for smugglers who use family groups to tie down our agents while drugs are moved behind them.”Mr. McAleenan said his job as the agency’s commissioner was to enforce laws, not make them.Last month, Mr. McAleenan was the public face of new government data showing that unauthorized entries at the southwestern border were reaching record-breaking numbers; more than 76,000 migrants crossed the border without authorization in February, an 11-year high.“The system is well beyond capacity, and remains at the breaking point,” he told reporters, adding that “this is clearly both a border security and a humanitarian crisis.”At a Senate hearing last month, he suggested ways to address that crisis: The United States government should support governments in Central America to improve economic opportunities there, he said, and work with the Mexican authorities to clamp down on transnational criminal organizations that prey on migrants.“And we must invest in border security,” he said. “A modern border barrier system, additional agents and officers, additional technology at and between ports of entry, and air and marine support. And we must also have a whole-of-U.S.-government approach to address children’s unique medical needs and the undeniable humanitarian challenges we are facing.”"
74,"Federal officials charged a Florida man on Friday with leaving threatening phone messages laced with racist slurs at the offices of Senator Cory Booker and two House members, including Representative Rashida Tlaib.The man, John J. Kless, 49, made three phone calls within 30 minutes, starting at 7 a.m. on Tuesday, according to court records. Mr. Kless, of Tamarac, Fla., about 15 miles northwest of Fort Lauderdale, was charged with interstate transmission of threats, according to court papers.In the first call, to the office of Representative Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat who is running for president, Mr. Kless said that “the day you come after our guns” would be the day “you’ll be dead,” court papers said.About nine minutes later, in a voice mail message to the office of Ms. Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, he began with, “Hey, Taliban.” Mr. Kless, referring to Representative Ilhan Omar, the freshman Democrat from Minnesota and one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, then said, “Tell your Taliban friend” to stay silent about the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, court records said.President Trump in a tweet last week targeted Ms. Omar for remarks she made during a speech on civil rights and Muslims in America. He used a graphic video featuring the burning World Trade Center towers and other images from the attacks in the tweet. Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked House officials last week to review security measures intended to protect Ms. Omar after the president’s tweet.Mr. Kless said in the voice mail to Ms. Tlaib’s office that “this ain’t Trump’s fault,” court records said, adding, “It’s all your people’s fault.”Mr. Kless said that “the day when the bell tolls” and “this country comes to a war, there will be no more threats,” court records said. He also said, “There’s people like me out there, millions and millions of us, who hate you” for the 2001 attacks.Mr. Kless’s arrest came after a 55-year-old New York man was charged this month with threatening Ms. Omar. Federal agents charged that man, Patrick W. Carlineo Jr., after he reportedly called her office, described her as “a terrorist” and promised, in an expletive-laden threat, to “put a bullet in her skull.”In the message left at Mr. Booker’s office on Tuesday, Mr. Kless referred to the senator, a Democrat from New Jersey who is running for president, as a “disgrace.”“Don’t you worry, you government officials will be in the graves” where they belong, he said, according to court records.Based on the threatening nature of the calls and that Ms. Tlaib was scheduled to speak in Florida on April 20 and 21, law enforcement officials contacted a cellphone company to gain customer information for the phone number where the calls originated, Lacey Evans, a special agent of the United States Capitol Police, said in an affidavit.Information provided by the company revealed Mr. Kless’s address, details of outgoing calls, location updates and current GPS coordinates.Mr. Kless was involved in making harassing calls to Ms. Pelosi’s office in Washington in February, according to court papers. It was not immediately clear what actions, if any, were taken by law enforcement in that case.“This early 2019 case included voice messages by Kless concerning taking away his guns, abortion, illegal immigration and Muslims in Congress,” Agent Evans wrote.Marlene Fernandez-Karavetsos, special counsel to the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida, said one gun was seized from a backpack of Mr. Kless’s and others from a gun safe at his home. Ammunition was also recovered. Information about the kinds of weapons was not immediately available.United States Magistrate Judge Barry S. Seltzer ordered Friday that bond be set at $25,000. Mr. Kless has until Monday afternoon to post 10 percent of the bond amount, Ms. Fernandez-Karavetsos said. Until then, the judge ordered him released with a GPS monitor. The judge also imposed a curfew and ordered Mr. Kless not to have contact with the officials.Mr. Kless could not be reached on Friday night. Court records indicated he was hiring his own lawyer, but it was not immediately clear who that was.Representatives for Ms. Tlaib and Mr. Booker could not be immediately reached on Friday night. On Twitter, Mr. Swalwell thanked the Capitol Police and Florida law enforcement “for protecting my staff and constituents.”"
75,"MAPASTEPEC, Mexico — So many migrants have stopped in the southern Mexican town of Mapastepec in recent months that longstanding public sympathy for Central Americans traveling northward is starting to wane.Hundreds of migrants have been camped out for weeks in Mapastepec, where locals say six migrant caravans have arrived since last Easter. By far the biggest was a group of thousands in October that drew the anger of U.S. President Donald Trump.Ana Gabriela Galvan, a local resident who helped to provide food to migrants in the October caravan, told Reuters the small town in the impoverished state of Chiapas, which borders Guatemala, felt overwhelmed by the number of Central Americans.""It's really bad, because they're pouring onto our land,"" she said, noting that some locals were reluctant to leave their homes. ""They ask for money, and if you offer food, they don't want it; they want money and sometimes you don't have any.""Following a surge in apprehensions of Central Americans trying to enter the United States, Trump last month threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border if the Mexican government did not stop illegal immigration right away.The administration of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has stepped up migrant detentions and tightened access to humanitarian visas, slowing the flow of caravans north and leaving hundreds of people in Mapastepec.The humanitarian visas allow migrants to stay temporarily and get jobs. The documents also make it easier for them to travel through the country or seek longer residence.According to government social development agency Coneval, Chiapas in 2015 had the highest poverty rate of Mexico's 32 regions, at 72.5 percent. Some 20,000 people live in Mapastepec, the seat of a municipality of the same name where poverty levels were fractionally higher than the state average in 2015.A month ago, a large knot of migrants began forming in Mapastepec when the National Migration Institute closed its main office in the nearby city of Tapachula. The closure prompted hundreds to travel north to the sweltering town on the Pacific coast where the agency has a smaller outpost.Since then, bedraggled groups of men, women and children have been staying in and around a local sports stadium, hoping to be issued humanitarian visas.Central Americans today make up the bulk of undocumented migrants arrested on the U.S. border.Southern Mexico has long sent thousands of migrants north and support for them has traditionally been strong there. Concentrations of Central American migrants on Mexico's northern border caused tensions in the city of Tijuana when caravans arrived late last year.CONCERNED MEXICANSRecent studies show that while Mexicans still have sympathy for migrants, many are concerned that Mexico will not be able to cope with the arrival of thousands of people from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador fleeing violence and poverty at home.A survey of around 500 adults in February by the Center of Public Opinion at the University of the Valley of Mexico (UVM) found that 83 percent of respondents believed the Central American migrants could cause problems for Mexico.Rising crime, increased poverty and a decline in social services were the top risks identified by the poll.Offered a binary choice on what should be done, 62 percent of those polled said Mexico should be stricter with migrants entering its territory. The other 38 percent said Mexico should help to develop Central America, as Lopez Obrador argues.The study did not publish a margin of error.Jesus Salvador Quintana, a senior official at the National Human Rights Commission, said in Mapastepec the body had noticed a decrease in assistance from the public but urged people to keep helping the migrants on their often arduous journeys.""There are children, pregnant women, whole families that sometimes need this humanitarian aid,"" he told Reuters.Anabel Quintero, a young Honduran mother in Mapastepec, said when her caravan passed through the nearby town of Huixtla some shops closed rather than sell to migrants seeking medicine for sick children.""It's a bad feeling,"" she said. ""They told us they didn't want us sleeping in the park, and we had to leave.""Residents of Mapastepec are also running out of patience.Street vendor Brenda Marisol Ballesteros told Reuters it was time for authorities to move the migrants onward.""Why?,"" she said. ""Because things are in a real mess."" (Additional reporting by Roberto Ramirez in Huixtla; Editing by Dave Graham and Cynthia Osterman)"
76,"It may take federal officials two years to identify what could be thousands of immigrant children who were separated from their families at the southern United States border, the government said in court documents filed on Friday.A federal judge had asked for a plan to identify these children and their families after a report from government inspectors in January revealed that the Trump administration most likely separated thousands more children from their parents than was previously believed.These families were separated before the administration unveiled its “zero-tolerance” immigration policy in the spring of 2018, when nearly all adults entering the country illegally were prosecuted and any children accompanying them were put into shelters or foster care.To identify these families, the government said it would apply a statistical analysis to about 47,000 children who were referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement and subsequently discharged, according to the court filing. From there, the government said it would manually review the case records of the children who appeared to have the highest probability of being part of the separated families.Officials estimated that the process would take at least one year and potentially two. In explaining the reason for such an arduous process, the government said United States Customs and Border Protection did not collect specific data on migrant family separations before April 2018.Lawyers representing the Office of Refugee Resettlement did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday.In a court filing for the government, Jonathan White, a commander with the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, wrote that identifying this group of children presented new challenges because they were already discharged from the Office of Refugee Resettlement, meaning the government “lacks access” to them.The statistical analysis was required because manually reviewing the cases of nearly 50,000 children would “overwhelm” the office’s resources, he wrote.The government’s proposed plan arose from a class-action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. In June, Judge Dana M. Sabraw ordered the reunification of children and parents who had been separated under the Trump administration policy. President Trump rescinded the policy that same month.About 2,800 children have been reunified with their families or situated according to their parents’ wishes, said Lee Gelernt, who challenged the policy in court on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union.The January report, by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, revealed that a group of separated families was unaccounted for because the government lacked an effective tracking system. In March, Judge Sabraw ruled that those families should be included in the litigation.Mr. Gelernt said this identification process should take months, not years. “If the government believed finding these children was a priority, they could do it quicker than two years,” Mr. Gelernt said.The families the government may now be tasked with locating are those who entered the United States on or after July 1, 2017, the earliest known date that families were separated; were detained by immigration officials; and have a child who was detained and then released to a sponsor, such as a relative, before the judge’s reunification order on June 26, 2018.When the government previously identified children for reunification, it included only the children who were detained at the time of the reunification order.Judge Sabraw wrote in his March 8 order that because all of these families had been subjected to the same policies and had been separated under “questionable circumstances,” they should have the same opportunity for relief. Although identifying the families may be burdensome, as the government argued, “it clearly can be done,” the judge wrote.According to the government’s proposed plan, officials would update the A.C.L.U. about the families’ information after completing the analysis and reviewing the children’s cases. The organization would then use that information to help reunify parents and children.Mr. Gelernt said a two-year wait to reunite families would be devastating. The longer these children remained separated from their families, he said, the more psychological trauma they would endure. He said the A.C.L.U. planned to argue against the proposed plan in court.The family separations were a central part of the Trump administration’s effort to deter migrant families from trying to enter the United States through its southern border with Mexico.Data released last month suggested that the administration’s immigration measures — including the separation policy and attempts to beef up border security and limit who qualified for asylum — failed to deter tens of thousands of migrants traveling to the United States, most of whom were escaping violence and poverty in Central America."
77,"WASHINGTON — Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, said on Monday that cyberthreats against the United States were a national security crisis that she described as her top priority — not the situation for which President Trump last month declared a national emergency.“On top of my list of threats, that many of you can guess, the word ‘cyber’ is circled, highlighted and underlined,” Ms. Nielsen said in a speech outlining her department’s focus in the coming year. “The cyberdomain is a target, a weapon and a threat vector all at the same time.”Mr. Trump has called the increasing flow of immigrants to the southern border one of the most urgent national security issues threatening the United States. Last week, issuing his first veto against legislation that would have blocked him from diverting Defense Department funds to build a border wall, the president described a recent spike in migrants crossing the border as an “invasion.”The Department of Homeland Security oversees customs officers and immigration agents who are on the front lines of the Trump administration’s campaign to close the border to illegal immigration.Ms. Nielsen did dedicate a portion of her speech on Monday to what she called a “humanitarian and security catastrophe” of Central American families traveling to the border. She also noted that the projected number of migrants who may be apprehended at the southern border this month was expected to rise to 100,000, up from 76,000 in February.But mentions of digital threats were dispersed throughout her approximately 35-minute address to an auditorium of various Department of Homeland Security officials.Among global jihadists and transnational criminals, Ms. Nielsen listed “cyberthugs and hackers and resurgent nation-state rivals” as an emerging threat to the United States. She asked two cybersecurity officials who helped safeguard the 2018 elections to stand for a round of applause.Ms. Nielsen also assailed President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the Kremlin “for a concerted effort to undermine our elections and our democratic process using cyberenabled means.” And she said the average American citizen or company was “no match” for virtual threats from Russia, China, North Korea and Iran.“I am more worried about the ability of bad guys to hijack our networks than their ability to hijack our flights,” Ms. Nielsen said. “I am concerned about them holding our infrastructure hostage, stealing our money and secrets, exploiting children online and even hacking our democracy.”John Cohen, a former acting under secretary for intelligence during the Obama administration, said law enforcement could no longer look at the threats in the digital world and the physical world as separate issues. Extremist groups now circulate videos on the internet to inspire terrorist attacks, and drug traffickers are using the dark web — something Ms. Nielsen also highlighted in her speech.Mr. Cohen said he remained unclear on how Ms. Nielsen proposed combating cybersecurity threats.“There is an incredible amount of talent at D.H.S.,” said Mr. Cohen, also a senior adviser at the agency during the George W. Bush administration. “My concern is that talent and those capabilities are being underutilized, because in the eyes of many at the White House, the sole purpose for D.H.S. is to conduct its immigrant and border security activities.”Ms. Nielsen said the department was focused on increasing collaboration with the private sector, citing a summit meeting held in New York last year for industry and government officials. She said she expected the cooperation between various homeland security agencies to improve when the department consolidates at a former mental hospital next month.She praised the department’s work in defending the integrity of the 2018 midterm elections and said she was confident in her department’s ability to secure the 2020 presidential vote. Ms. Nielsen also said homeland security would continue to pursue prosecutions against foreign entities that hack the American digital infrastructure.“What worries me, though, is not what these threat actors have done,” Ms. Nielsen said, “but what they have the capability to do.”"
78,"CALEXICO, Calif. — President Trump traveled to this small border town two hours east of San Diego on Friday to highlight what he and his aides say is an out-of-control crisis caused by a surge of Central American families who have overwhelmed law enforcement facilities at the border.Just a day after retreating from his threat to shut down the entire border with Mexico, Mr. Trump accepted a plaque from border agents and sheriffs in front of a 30-foot-tall section of border wall — the physical embodiment of his immigration agenda — and met with border officials, lawmakers and administration officials at the Border Patrol station here.“We’re really making progress at letting people know this is an emergency,” the president said. “It’s a colossal surge and it’s overwhelming our immigration system and we can’t let that happen.”Critics argue that the wall is not a solution to the surge of families that have arrived in recent months since most of the families are not trying to sneak into the country undetected. On the contrary, most are seeking Border Patrol agents to turn themselves in, either at the ports of entry or between them.But Mr. Trump insisted on Friday that his efforts to seal off the border from undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers was necessary because “we don’t have room. That means you can’t take ‘em.”“I don’t think anyone has ever expressed it like that but I am expressing it like that,” Mr. Trump added. “When it’s full, it’s full.”Asked on Thursday night why the president was not using the national emergency he recently declared to seek funds to provide humanitarian relief to the families who have been apprehended recently, Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, conceded that the focus on the wall is, partly, a stunt.“Well, I think part of that is just a — it’s an optic,” she told Chris Cuomo, the host of “Cuomo Prime Time” on CNN. “To have the president stand in front of the wall indicates immediately to any viewer that he’s at the border. But I think his message will be about the dual crisis and how we need Congress to act, to give us the authorities to address.”Mr. Trump, however, hailed what he called the “tremendous impact” of the wall in Calexico and said that his administration expected to build 400 miles’ worth of wall in the next two years.In fact, the small section of wall that Mr. Trump stood in front of — next to a field of solar panels — is not evidence that the president is building the wall he repeatedly called for during his 2016 presidential campaign but merely an upgrade to an existing section of fencing. The two-mile section was completed in October.[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]Weeks after declaring a national emergency at the border because Congress refused to fund construction of his border wall, Mr. Trump recently threatened to close the legal ports of entry between Mexico and the United States — potentially disrupting billions of dollars’ worth of trade and halting the travel of a half-million people each day.But on the eve of his trip here, Mr. Trump backed down in the face of hard criticism from the business community and top officials in his own party. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, predicted that a complete border shutdown would have a “potentially catastrophic economic impact” on the country.Mr. Trump responded on Thursday by initially saying he would give Mexico a year to stop Central American migrants from traversing Mexico on their way to the United States. He added that if Mexico did not do its part, he would first impose tariffs on Mexican cars before shutting down the border.Later in the day, Mr. Trump denied that he had put off a border shutdown for a year, saying that it could still happen if he decided that Mexico was not doing enough to keep migrants from traveling to the United States.“We’ll start with the tariffs and see what happens,” he said.In his visit here, Mr. Trump thanked Mexico for deporting migrants at its southern border, which he said “they have never done before” in three decades, and suggested he had delayed closing the border because of their heightened efforts.But it is false that Mexico only recently began enforcing its southern border at Mr. Trump’s urging, according to data, experts and the Mexican government. Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico’s foreign minister, told reporters on Tuesday that Mexico had been consistent in its immigration policies.It deported 40,000 to 190,000 migrants every year from 2011 to 2016, data from Segob, Mexico’s internal affairs agency, shows. In 2016, Mexico deported nearly 150,000 migrants from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala compared with 107,000 deportations of migrants from those three countries in 2018. In the first two months of 2019, Mexico deported more than 13,000 migrants from the countries.Contrary to Mr. Trump’s repeated claims this week, Mexico’s immigration laws are not harsher or “stronger” than the United States; illegal crossing are decriminalized in Mexico and considered a minor offense. Experts said they were not aware of any changes in the laws or enforcement practices.“On the contrary, the discourse of President López Obrador has been more humanitarian than that of the former president, granting work permits and making efforts to find last-minute shelters,” said Karla A. Valenzuela, a professor at Ibero-American University in Mexico City who specializes in migration.Dr. Valenzuela said an uptick in detentions and removals in recent weeks was not necessarily indicative of intensified enforcement, but rather more linked to increased flows from Central America.Meanwhile, the president’s re-election campaign released a video on Friday blasting Democrats for their position on the border, a clear indication that Mr. Trump intends to use the issue of border security for his political benefit, no matter the facts on the ground.The video shows leading Democratic presidential candidates, including Beto O’Rourke, Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Elizabeth Warren, mocking the idea of a wall at the border.“We do not need any walls,” Mr. O’Rourke is shown saying. The headline in the video says, bluntly: “Democrats do not want to keep Americans safe” and adds: “It’s time for Democrats to stop playing political games with national security.”A response from the Democratic National Committee assailed the president’s visit as nothing more than a photo opportunity “to try and build nonexistent support for his unnecessary and ineffective border wall.”“Instead of doing anything to address the issues that matter most to the people of Calexico, Trump is actually making things worse,” the committee said."

Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]Federal immigration officials appear to have cleared out an enclosure under a bridge in El Paso where they were detaining hundreds of families of asylum seekers, following an outcry over the conditions at the site.But authorities appeared to have shifted some processing of migrants to another site on the other side of the bridge, using a military-style tent near an existing processing facility operated by Customs and Border Protection. A smaller number of migrants could be seen at that site late Sunday afternoon.Separately, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection said on Sunday that the agency was “in the process of transferring all of the illegal aliens being held temporarily” at the original enclosure under the bridge to a processing station in northeast El Paso. The spokesman said that the decision was made “to relocate to a location with more space and more shelter capability.”The border agency contended last week that it had no choice but to hold the migrants in the outdoor location, surrounded by fencing and razor wire, because of overcrowding at processing facilities in El Paso brought on by a surge in Central American migrants applying for asylum.Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, addressed journalists last Wednesday near the enclosure when he claimed that the country’s immigration enforcement system was at a “breaking point.”Criticism over the bridge enclosure had been building all week, with reports of children sleeping on trash-strewn gravel at the site under the Paso del Norte bridge. Some migrant families stayed inside a military tent set up at the site; others remained outside even as nighttime temperatures dipped into the 40s.The American Civil Liberties Union said on Sunday that the detention of migrants in outdoor pens was “an unprecedented and extreme violation.”Citing interviews with families held under the bridge, the A.C.L.U. said it had received reports that agents had verbally and physically harmed migrants, forced them to stand for prolonged periods and deprived them of sleep and access to medical care, and had failed to provide the migrants with adequate food and water.Some families were detained under the bridge for as long as four days, the A.C.L.U. said, adding that families with infant children were told to sleep on the ground and were not provided with any bedding, mats or chairs.“We are demanding an immediate investigation by the inspector general into abuses inflicted on asylum seekers by Border Patrol agents in the outdoor facilities,” said Shaw Drake, policy counsel for the A.C.L.U.’s border rights center.Migrants have since been transferred to undisclosed locations, he said, adding that “the agency has not told us or members of Congress where migrants are now being held and under what conditions.”Local political leaders and human rights groups said that a sharp increase in asylum seekers should have been foreseeable, as part of an annual surge in border crossings before the arrival of the deadly summer heat.Immigration officials were already scrambling to respond to a shifting profile of migrants arriving at the border with Mexico. Border Patrol apprehensions remain well below their peak of 1.6 million in the 2000 fiscal year, but they have been climbing lately, reaching 467,000 in the 2018 calendar year, the highest figure in six years. And more of them are now Central American families seeking asylum rather than single men from Mexico.Federal immigration officials claim that legal rulings have created loopholes that make it more attractive for Central Americans to apply for asylum in the United States.“This status quo is not an option,” Andrew Meehan, assistant commissioner for public affairs at Customs and Border Protection, said in a statement on Saturday. “The legal framework must be addressed,” he said, repeating the administration’s calls for Congress to address asylum laws. “The only remedy to this crisis is congressional action.”Advocates for immigrants said the federal government was obligated by law to humanely process asylum requests, and could have avoided the need for migrant families to spend days on end in the holding pen.“If they wanted to prepare for this, they could have done so,” said Fernando Garcia, director of the Border Network for Human Rights, an organization in El Paso. “The administration could have redirected resources, assigned more asylum agents, looked at what was happening on the ground.”Immigration authorities in El Paso have asserted that detention facilities were overwhelmed in the city, as in other places along the border. Mr. McAleenan said that the Border Patrol was temporarily reassigning about 750 inspectors to care for newly arrived Central American families.In its complaint to the inspector general, the A.C.L.U. questioned why the Border Parol was resorting to holding migrants under the bridge when its budget had grown to $16.7 billion in 2019 from $7.1 billion in 2006. The Border Patrol’s work force has also expanded, the civil liberties union said, reaching 19,555 in 2018, compared with 9,212 in 2000."
80,"Once more, President Trump stands ready to dazzle with his willingness to sacrifice the national interest on the altar of his political whims.For days, the president has been indulging in one of his made-for-TV teasers by threatening to shut down the United States-Mexico border. Not beef up the Border Patrol. Not tighten security at ports of entry. Just hang up a “Closed” sign and call it a day.As the White House tells it, the failures of Mexico and congressional Democrats to stop illegal crossings have left the president no choice: The influx of drugs, criminals and other undesirables has reached the point where drastic action is required.Mr. Trump is nothing if not a man of drastic action, or at least ominous vows of drastic action.Dismayed critics have rushed to object that shutting the border will do nothing to solve the humanitarian strains caused by the flood of migrant families from Central America — that such a move will, in fact, make things only worse by disrupting the legal flow of people and commerce, wreaking social and economic havoc.Such warnings are spot on. They also miss the point. In threatening to shut down the border, Mr. Trump isn’t looking to solve a crisis. His primary aim is to make life unpleasant for those who have crossed him — or simply had the misfortune to get in his way.In politics, as in life, there are Fixers and there are Punishers. Fixers shine a light on problems or injustices and work to find ways to resolve them. Theirs is a constructive vision, one that values cooperation and pragmatism and getting stuff done.Punishers, too, are about spotlighting problems, a skill at which they may excel even more than Fixers. But Punishers aren’t looking to make things right so much as to find someone to blame — and chasten — for the perceived wrongs.Neither party holds a monopoly on either category. Charlie Baker, the Republican governor of Massachusetts, is a Fixer. Ilhan Omar, the freshman Democratic House member from Minnesota, is fast establishing herself as a Punisher. President Barack Obama was a Fixer, while the entire House Freedom Caucus sprang from the conviction that anyone willing to work with Mr. Obama should be cast into the abyss. Punished with extreme prejudice, as it were.Punishers have their charms and their purpose, and whether you see them as avenging angels or vengeful demagogues often depends on whether you share their particular worldview. But every now and again, along comes a Punisher so wanton that he rattles even members of his own team. Mr. Trump is one of this rare breed.The desire to crush those who displease him is a defining characteristic of this president. When challenged, his impulse is to lash out — preferably with personal, degrading insults. This has been on most vivid display with the myriad investigations into sketchy presidential behavior, but it also has been a hallmark of Mr. Trump’s approach to key policy issues. Border security, health care, trade — you name the debate, Mr. Trump’s answer is to stake out his position, vowing pain and regret for those who do not embrace it.On Sunday, the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, went on television to rub Democrats’ noses in the growing border tumult and defend the president’s closure threat. “We hate to say we told you so,” he said. “We need border security, and we’re going to do the best we can with what we have.”He also dismissed questions about the wisdom of Mr. Trump’s plan to end financial aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Complaining about the troubled nations’ failure to stop their people from fleeing north, Mr. Mulvaney brushed off administration experts who have cautioned that cutting aid would further destabilize the countries, likely worsening the migrant crisis.Translation: Fine. No one will give us a border wall. We’ll show you the meaning of chaos.The president’s fans cheer his pugilism, as though he was bravely defending himself — and them — against big, bad bullies. But all too often, the price is paid by the innocent and vulnerable: migrant children snatched from their parents at the border, federal workers thrown into financial turmoil by the government shutdown, farm workers and manufacturers caught up in the trade war, the millions of Americans who stand to lose their health insurance if the administration keeps laboring to kill Obamacare. For Mr. Trump, anyone who stands between him and his objective becomes collateral damage. And pity those considered part of an unfriendly demographic, such as the people of Puerto Rico, whom the president dismisses as a tool of the Democratic Party and mistreats accordingly. As the Senate has worked this week to hash out a comprehensive disaster-relief package, Mr. Trump’s contribution has been to fire off a series of obnoxious, dishonest tweets charging that “corrupt or incompetent” island officials have wasted epic levels of relief funding and are now hot for Democrats “to give them more, taking dollars away from our Farmers and so many others. Disgraceful!” A White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley, subsequently appeared on TV with a spirited defense of his boss’s broadside against “that country.” As for those who actively defy the president, the goal is not simply to punish them for a single transgression but to discourage them from future rebellions. Deliver a painful enough lesson, and everyone will fall into line. "
81,"PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump said on Friday that there would be a “very good likelihood” that he would seal off the United States border with Mexico next week, even as he moved to punish Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador for migrant caravans by cutting off all foreign aid to the countries.The moves escalated a sustained berating of countries he blames for being unable to stop the flow of migrants trying to make their way north.“I will close the border if Mexico doesn’t get with it,” Mr. Trump said to reporters who had gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his winter retreat in Florida. “If Mexico doesn’t stop it.”At Mr. Trump’s direction, the State Department on Friday began the process of informing Congress that it intended to end the foreign aid. A person with knowledge of the decision said that Mr. Trump met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday, after which diplomats were directed to begin the process of cutting off the funds by drafting letters to lawmakers. Mr. Trump publicly said as much on Friday in comments to reporters.“No money goes there anymore,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re giving them tremendous aid. We stopped payment.”The State Department issued a statement late on Friday saying: “At the secretary’s instruction, we are carrying out the president’s direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle. We will be engaging Congress as part of this process.”Mr. Trump has threatened to close off the border and cut off aid to the three countries — known as the Northern Triangle — several times before and has not followed through.But his comments on Friday signaled a new escalation and a diplomatic assault on America’s neighbors in the hemisphere as his administration confirmed that it would review ways to reshuffle Border Patrol agents, shut down traffic lanes and close ports of entry at the southwest border. He began the day with a morning tweet saying that he would close the border “next week,” and then told reporters that he was prepared to close off trade and commercial ports of entry.A full or partial sealing of the border would effectively close off the United States from one of its largest trading partners, but it could leave American citizens who cross back and forth with a sluggish or potentially nonexistent system of returning to the United States.“I’m not playing games,” Mr. Trump said on Friday, as he threatened to close the border with Mexico.[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]The president has been emboldened since the release of a report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, found that his campaign had not cooperated with the Russian government. And a partisan upholding of his national emergency declaration over a wall along the southwestern border has prompted Mr. Trump to ratchet up harsh words against immigration as he seeks to galvanize supporters ahead of the 2020 presidential election.As he engaged in multiple photo opportunities throughout the day, Mr. Trump’s actions and comments indicated that his mind was not on the scenes at hand but on immigration.“How are we doing at the border?” he asked a military official on a tour of Lake Okeechobee, the site of a restoration project in the central part of the state. During a meeting at Mar-a-Lago to announce that Linda McMahon, who has led the Small Business Administration, had resigned, he again turned to immigration.“We have the most laughed-at immigration laws of anywhere in the world,” Mr. Trump said to reporters as he and Ms. McMahon sat in the ornate front room of the club. “They’re the Democrats’ laws, and I got stuck with them.”Mr. Trump’s decision to end the aid to the Central American countries is likely to anger members of Congress from both parties, who have supported spending money to try to address the root causes of the violence that has caused migrants to flee those countries to come to the United States.Currently, the United States spends about $620 million a year for gang prevention programs and other initiatives aimed at helping support civil society in the three countries. Advocates say that cutting the funds will only accelerate the migrant flows into the United States.But the president has repeatedly expressed anger that the United States sends money to the countries even as caravans of migrants make their way to the border.In an email from the director of the Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources on Friday night, senior State Department and United States Agency for International Development officials were instructed to “redirect” all 2018 assistance “away from these countries” and to “cease and desist” all 2017 spending already started.The email sent State Department officials scrambling to carry out the president’s order. It was unclear how quickly the funding would cease since the governments had not yet been notified formally of the decision.It is also unclear whether the department can redirect all of the money to other parts of the world. Some of the money meant for the 2017 fiscal year has already been allocated to specific contracts, so it might not be able to be withdrawn, according to a person familiar with the effort.Mr. Trump told reporters that he would consider shutting down ports along the border, a decision that could imperil the transit of goods between the United States and Mexico. According to government figures, Mexico is the United States’ third-largest goods trading partner, with $557.6 billion worth of products flowing across the border in both directions.A move by Mr. Trump to shut down or drastically curb trade with Mexico would pose significant risks to the American economy. It would also represent a stunning reversal in trade relations between the two countries, which last August put their differences aside to renegotiate their portion of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The new deal, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, still needs to be approved by Congress.The president lamented that Mexico was making a “fortune” off the United States, and said Mexico’s immigration laws were the “strongest immigration laws of anywhere in the world.” (Mexico is much weaker than the United States at enforcing its border laws.) Mr. Trump also again invoked migrant caravans — including one containing hundreds of people heading to the United States — as a reason Mexico needed to act.“Mexico is tough,” Mr. Trump said. “If they don’t stop them, we’re closing the border.”Americans would feel the effects in other ways. Border control agencies are already reviewing ways to slow down immigration processing at the border. A senior homeland security official confirmed on Friday that shutting down ports of entry along the southwest border was “on the table” to handle the surge in migrants seeking asylum.Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, said in a statement that she had asked volunteers to add more support at the border, and suggested that American citizens may encounter difficulty getting through as a result.“Make no mistake: Americans may feel effects from this emergency,” Ms. Nielsen said. “As personnel are reallocated to join the crisis-response effort, there may be commercial delays, higher vehicle wait times at the border and longer pedestrian lines.”She added that “despite these impacts, we cannot shirk our responsibility to the American people to do everything possible to secure our country while also upholding our humanitarian values.”Stephen H. Legomsky, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said there were a few options available to Mr. Trump if he wanted to move to stop the flow of people at the border, including slowing down processing at ports of entry. The administration has already limited the number of migrants who can apply for asylum each day.“He could pretend that this was necessary in the interest of national security,” Mr. Legomsky said, “and it could be that the courts would be hesitant to second guess a national security claim by a president.”Mr. Legomsky said putting up trade roadblocks and slowing down the processing of people would have harmful effects, both on American citizens who could find themselves “marooned” in Mexico and on families, including groups of women and children, who are fleeing violence and poverty.“There’s a huge humanitarian concern,” Mr. Legomsky said. “So many of the people are these Central American mothers and children fleeing from high levels of violence. They would be effectively stuck in the border areas which are also extremely dangerous.”On Thursday, the president said that he did not share concern over the plight of people in danger. In front of supporters at a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., he used harsh language to describe the thousands of people who have tried to flee violence and poverty, calling the problem an “invasion” and referring to asylum seekers as a “big fat con job.”In a news conference in El Paso on Wednesday, Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said that an influx of migrants had reached a “breaking point.”In February, there were 76,000 crossings at the border, which marked an 11-year high and signaled that the Trump administration’s harsher policies have not stopped the flow of people trying to enter the country.The threat to close the border is one that Mr. Trump has made previously but not carried out. But he has not yet attached a deadline by which he would take such a drastic measure, and did not respond to reporters who asked on Friday whether he would set one.The homeland security official said the Trump administration had not yet decided to shut down a major port, but that the department had been forced to divert agents from ports of entries and interior checkpoints to handle large groups of migrants trying to illegally come into the United States, including families."
82,"EL PASO — Beto O’Rourke officially kicked off his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination Saturday morning, quoting the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., raising populist themes and praising the way immigration has enriched El Paso and the nation.Speaking at a downtown rally near the border with Mexico, Mr. O’Rourke said that his hometown, El Paso, its embrace of immigration and its rich ties with Mexico represented the best of the American experience, adding that the challenges facing the country presented “a moment of truth.”Quoting Dr. King, he said El Paso and its Mexican neighbor of Ciudad Juárez were “caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.”He added, “This is a campaign for America, for everyone in America.”[Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.]His words and the setting on the street that connects El Paso with Ciudad Juárez symbolized what his campaign said would be one of Mr. O’Rourke’s themes — a “unifying vision for bridging divides” to unite Americans from all walks of life.But the speech by Mr. O’Rourke, a former three-term member of Congress, comes at a time of extraordinary discord over immigration, with a surge of migrants trying to enter the United States and President Trump threatening to seal off the border next week.El Paso has been a flash point for much of that unrest, with hundreds of migrants now being held in a makeshift encampment under a bridge near where Mr. O’Rourke was speaking.The encampment, where immigration officials are detaining people behind razor wire with little hot food, was set up last week when El Paso’s main border processing center reached overflow capacity following the largest influx of migrants in years.Acknowledging the plight of the migrants, Mr. O’Rourke said, “Let us remember that every single one of us, including those who are just three or four blocks from here detained under the international bridge — behind chain-link fence and barbed wire — they are our fellow human beings and deserve to be treated like our fellow human beings.”Mr. O’Rourke, who also held rallies Saturday in Houston and outside the state’s capitol in Austin, stressed not only immigration but also health care, education, climate change, criminal justice reform, the economy, voting rights and racial inequality. All are topics that have emerged as major issues in the effort by Democrats to unseat Mr. Trump in 2020.[Check out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field.]“This is our moment of truth and we cannot be found wanting,” he told the enthusiastic crowd. “The challenges before us are the greatest of our lifetimes. An economy that works too well for too few and not at all for too many more. A health care system where millions are unable to see a doctor or be well enough to live to their full potential and the last, best hope of averting the catastrophe that will follow climate change, fading before our very inaction. We must overcome these challenges.”Mr. O’Rourke was introduced by his wife, Amy O’Rourke, an educator. The couple’s three children also attended.Mr. O’Rourke has been campaigning for two weeks, often in impromptu sessions in cafes or intimate town halls. But this was billed as his first major public event and opportunity to present the broad themes of his campaign.Speaking extemporaneously for 34 minutes, gesticulating as he walked around a stage set in the middle of the street, Mr. O’Rourke hit particularly hard on access to health care and prescription drug costs.“When one of the largest providers of mental health care services is a county jail system, and in a nation that is in the midst of a maternal mortality crisis — three times as deadly for women of color — let us ensure that universal health care means we can see a primary care provider, all of us can get mental health care, and that universal health care means that every woman makes her own decisions about her own body,” he said.He also called for better pay for teachers — “let’s pay them what they’re worth” — and a “world-class public school system from pre-K to 12.”The crowd of several thousand supporters included Marta Lopez, 71, a retired state worker from El Paso, who had come wearing a black-and-white BETO T-shirt.“We’ve lived here all our lives, and I feel we don’t need a wall,” said Ms. Lopez, adding that she admires Mr. O’Rourke’s positions on immigration as well as his pledge not to accept PAC money.Several supporters of Mr. O’Rourke said they were intimidated by a gantlet of pro-Trump protesters blocking their way to the rally.“They were just very confrontational and yelling scary stuff at us,’’ said Thelma Ramos, 38, of El Paso, who came with her 13-year-old daughter.Mr. O’Rourke, 46, grew up in this Texas border city, the son of a local political figure and a furniture store operator. He had little name recognition until last year, when he became a national figure during his unsuccessful effort to unseat Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican.With a progressive sheen and grass-roots appeal, Mr. O’Rourke set fund-raising records in that Senate campaign. He continued that record-setting pace in the 24 hours after announcing his White House ambitions two weeks ago, raising more than $6.1 million online in one day. That outpaced the $5.9 million collected by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in his first day.Some recent polls place Mr. O’Rourke third in popularity among Democrats expected to be in the race, behind former Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced his intentions, and Mr. Sanders.And if his style is entirely different from Mr. Sanders, he hit many similar themes.“For too long in this country, the powerful have maintained their privilege at the expense of the powerless,” he said. “They have used fears and division in the same way that our current president uses fear and division.”"
83,"There are two countries that I’ve been professionally, emotionally and intellectually involved with my entire journalism career — the United States and Israel. I’ve never been more worried about both, because President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are essentially the same person, and they pose the same threat to their respective nations.They are both men utterly without shame, backed by parties utterly without spine, protected by big media outlets utterly without integrity. They are both funded by a Las Vegas casino magnate, Sheldon Adelson. They are both making support for Israel a “Republican’’ cause — no longer a bipartisan one. And they each could shoot an innocent man in broad daylight in the middle of Fifth Avenue and their supporters would say the victim had it coming.As a result, they are each free to cross red lines that their predecessors never dared to. Which is why I believe that four more years of Netanyahu, which is almost certain after Israel’s election on Tuesday, and six more years of Trump, which is a real possibility, will hasten the emergence of an America and an Israel where respect for civility, democracy, an independent judiciary and independent media are no longer examples for others to follow. Instead, both countries will be cautionary tales of how precious are the norms and institutions that bind a democracy, and how easily they can be undermined by leaders who will tell any lie, smear any competitor and wink at any extremist to stay in power.Netanyahu’s first order of business will be to strike an agreement with his potential coalition partners, most of them far-right, pro-settler parties, in which, as Haaretz reported, those parties will agree to create legislation that gets rid of the multiple indictments for corruption looming in Bibi’s future — and in return he will agree to annex West Bank settlements to Israel. And Trump will somehow go along, maybe as part of his own peace plan. It is going to be a dirty business, for sure.But what else could we expect? The parallels between Trump and Netanyahu are now deep and broad.Bibi has openly embraced a racist, anti-Arab Israeli party and racist, anti-Arab rhetoric, unlike any previous Israeli prime minister. At the same time, he has steadily been erasing the Green Line that separated Israel from the West Bank and its 2.5 million Palestinians — with the help of Trump’s ambassador to Israel — making it increasingly unlikely that Israel will ever separate itself from that area and increasingly likely that it will become a binational state in which Jews will enjoy rights that Palestinians will be denied.Meanwhile, Trump is increasingly turning America into a banana republic, firing cabinet officials and senior bureaucrats who refuse to carry out his impulsive orders, which are often illegal and mostly related to preventing legal and illegal immigration or asylum requests along the Mexico-United States border. Trump prefers to govern through “acting’’ cabinet secretaries — he has fired their bosses and not replaced them — who are much more vulnerable to his whims and more accepting of his more than 10,000 lies and falsehoods since taking office.Bibi, for his part, prefers to simply hold multiple portfolios: For a good chunk of his last term he was prime minister, defense minister, foreign minister and health minister.Both men have no close friends. The one major difference between them is that Bibi is very smart, an avid reader and a deft tactician in managing relations with Israel’s neighbors and big powers, such as America, Russia, India and China. Trump is clever but probably has not read a book in years. He gets his information from Fox News and other right-wing media, and rather than playing Vladimir Putin, has been played by him.Both Trump and Netanyahu are being investigated for serious financial improprieties. Israel’s attorney general has recommended that Netanyahu be indicted on charges of fraud, bribery and breach of trust in three corruption cases.Trump has been cleared by the special counsel on charges of collusion with Russia in the 2016 election, but he remains under investigation, as Reuters noted, on “issues including his businesses and financial dealings, personal conduct, charitable foundation and inaugural committee.’’ Five close Trump aides have already admitted to crimes, mostly financial, or been convicted.Neither man is interested in being a leader for all their people. Each has chosen to rule by dividing his people, not uniting them. They each just want to win by 50.01 percent, by using fear of the outsider and drawing cultural or religious distinctions between their citizens to garner just enough votes to squeak by.Bibi’s strategy was to demonize Israeli Arabs, and Trump’s was to demonize Muslims and Mexicans and immigrants from what he called “shithole’’ countries. Both men have rebuilt their parties around themselves and their personal politics, and both believe that as long as they can hold their bases by stoking enough fear and cultural division, they can win — and they’re willing to sacrifice any values or norms to do so.Neither man is entirely wrong about the world around him. America does have an illegal immigration problem that Democrats have not taken seriously enough. Israel has real enemies like Iran and its proxies. But Israel’s external enemies are well deterred. The existential threat to Israel is internal — that it will annex the West Bank with its Palestinian population and look to the world as an apartheidlike South Africa.My critique of both men is that they consistently try to use these real threats for political gain — to feed fears, rather than to think creatively about how to defuse them. Because for Bibi to think imaginatively about how to separate from the West Bank and for Trump to think creatively about how to defuse our immigration problem with a coherent national strategy would require each to disappoint or confront the extreme ultranationalists who form the core bases of their support. Neither has the courage or the desire to do so.Indeed, Netanyahu has gone so deep into the gutter that in this last election he agreed to partner with a small, racist, anti-Arab Israeli party — a party so vile that the Israeli Supreme Court barred its leader from running. In response, Netanyahu’s allies immediately threatened to gut the Supreme Court if they win. I don’t have to tell you where Trump has gone in indulging white supremacists.Bibi will go down in history as the Israeli leader who concretized the distinction between “Israelis’’ and “Jews,’’ noted Bernard Avishai in a smart essay in The New Yorker: “The menace, Netanyahu has implied, is not just the Arabs but what might be termed Israeliness — a legal and cultural identity available to any citizen who participates in Hebrew-speaking civil society, including the 20 percent who are Arab.’’While Benny Gantz, Bibi’s opponent in the recent election, has argued that, broadly defined, “Israeli identity is increasingly plausible for, among others, young, middle-class Arabs, who accounted for more than 16 percent of students in bachelor’s degree programs in 2017,’’ that is not Netanyahu’s view.“Netanyahu’s version, in contrast,’’ Avishai explained, “is a state essentially reserved for Jews, including those in the diaspora, who can prove their Jewishness by either rabbinical certification or maternal descent — one that is democratic only in the sense that Jews constitute the majority, the general will of Jews necessarily prevails, and non-Jews are in the state by sufferance, not really by right.’’That is why Netanyahu passed the recent Nation-State Law, which stipulated that Israel is “the national home of the Jewish people, in which it fulfills its natural, cultural, religious and historical right to self-determination.” However much American Jews — and traditional, secular American Jewish supporters of Israel — “may try to shield Netanyahu, it is increasingly clear that he is at odds with their democratic standards, which are already under assault,’’ Avishai concluded. “American Jews, like Israeli voters, have choices to make.’’ Is Israel a state for Jews or for all its citizens?Trump has dabbled in the same kind of tropes. He may not say it explicitly, but his whole worldview, evident from his dog whistles, is that real Americans are primarily white Judeo-Christians — certainly not Muslims — and that all black or brown immigrants are suspect.Finally, both Trump and Bibi worship only one thing — raw, naked power, and they are not afraid to exercise it. Bibi is convinced that if Israel is strong militarily, economically and technologically, the world will bend to its will and beat a path to its door. The Palestinians will surrender; the Arabs will deal with Israel under the table; and China, India and Russia will all come to buy Israeli software. And so far he has been right. Bibi is convinced that liberal American Jews are worthless, that they’ll soon disappear via intermarriage and that the country’s Orthodox Jews and evangelical Christians will be powerful enough to do Israel’s bidding in Washington.Trump too has an obsession with raw power; his favorite insult is to call someone “weak.’’ He lives by the credo: Never apologize, no matter how foul your actions or how big your lie. Just stand firm and everyone will eventually bend your way. It has worked for him too. But at what long-term costs for both societies?Trump is replacing the entire logic of American foreign policy since World War II — that more global integration and stronger global rules and institutions will make for a more prosperous world, and if America pays a little more than others for that we will reap far more benefits because we are the world’s biggest economy — with a philosophy of competitive nationalism.For Trump, all the global institutions built after World War II — NATO, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, the United Nations — are just tools for small countries to rip off America or stick it to Israel. Trump actually wants the European Union to crack up, because he thinks that if the United States just negotiates with every nation bilaterally, it will be able to impose asymmetrical trade agreements on them.So have no doubts: Four more years of Netanyahu and six more years of Trump won’t just change America and Israel. It will change the world — and not for the better."
84,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has ordered a shake-up of the leadership of the Department of Homeland Security, the head of the U.S. Secret Service said on Monday, after the White House said the official would be soon be leaving his post.The Secret Service said Randolph ""Tex"" Alles would depart his job next month. The announcement came a day after Trump ousted Alles' boss, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, with whom he had clashed over immigration issues.""No doubt you have seen media reports regarding my 'firing.' I assure you that this is not the case, and in fact was told weeks ago by the administration that transitions in leadership should be expected across the Department of Homeland Security,"" Alles said in a message to Secret Service agents.Neither Trump nor the White House has explained the overhaul of DHS, but the president's anger over a recent surge in migrants from Central America has been well documented. The DHS oversees immigration and border security.The Republican president made stopping illegal immigration a centerpiece in his run for office in 2016, promising to build a wall on the southern border with Mexico. Trump has said he will make border security a key part of his campaign for re-election in 2020.Senior senators from both parties said they were concerned about a vacuum in leadership at the agency, which also oversees the Secret Service, the Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration, among other critical functions.Ron Johnson, the Republican chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement that he was ""concerned with a growing leadership void within the department tasked with addressing some of the most significant problems facing the nation.""Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said at least 10 top positions in the department were being filled with acting officials. ""The purge of senior leadership at the Department of Homeland Security is unprecedented and a threat to our national security,"" Feinstein said in a statement. The Secret Service, which is responsible for protecting senior U.S. officials including the president and vice president, former presidents and visiting heads of state, came under scrutiny last week after a Chinese woman carrying electronic devices was charged with bluffing her way through security checks at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said James Murray, a career Secret Service agent, would take over the agency in May.Alles had run the Secret Service for two years and served in the U.S. Marine Corps for 35 years before retiring as a major general in 2011.LONG LIST OF DEPARTURESAlles was the latest in a long list of senior officials to leave the Trump administration, including the secretaries of state, defense, homeland security, interior, veterans affairs and health and human services, the attorney general and numerous senior White House aides.The first sign of Trump's overhaul of Homeland Security came late on Thursday, when he abruptly pulled his nomination of Ron Vitiello as director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, part of DHS.Trump addressed the decision perfunctorily to reporters as part of a policy change ""going in a tougher direction.""It was followed by the resignation of Nielsen on Sunday. A senior administration official said Trump asked Nielsen to step down. On Twitter, Trump said Kevin McAleenan, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection commissioner, would become acting DHS secretary.CNN reported that L. Francis Cissna, director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency, and department General Counsel John Mitnick were also expected to leave their positions soon. The White House and DHS did not respond to requests for comment.Trump in recent weeks empowered his hard-line conservative aide Stephen Miller to lead the administration's border policies, CNN said.Nielsen had been a trusted aide to John Kelly, Trump's first DHS secretary and later his chief of staff, with whom he had an often-difficult relationship.Nielsen and Trump had often clashed over immigration issues during her 16 months in the job. Her departure had been long rumored particularly after criticism of the administration's 2018 family separation policy at the border with Mexico and as U.S. border officials estimated that 100,000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border in March, the highest level in a decade.Trump was so frustrated about the surge in migrants that he announced he would cut off U.S. aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

85,"MEXICO CITY/OTTAWA — More than six months after the United States, Mexico and Canada agreed a new deal to govern more than $1 trillion in regional trade, the chances of the countries ratifying the pact this year are receding.The three countries struck the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA) on Sept. 30, ending a year of difficult negotiations after U.S. President Donald Trump demanded the preceding trade pact be renegotiated or scrapped.But the deal has not ended trade tensions in North America. If ratification is delayed much longer, it could become hostage to electoral politics.The United States has its next presidential contest in 2020, and Canada holds a federal election in October.The delay means businesses are still uncertain about the framework that will govern future investments in the region. ""The USMCA is in trouble,"" said Andres Rozental, a former Mexican deputy foreign minister for North America.Though he believed the deal would ultimately be approved, Rozental said opposition from U.S. Democrats and unions to labor provisions in the deal, as well as bickering over tariffs, made its passage in the next few months highly unlikely.Canada's Parliament must also ratify the treaty and officials say the timetable is very tight. Current legislators only have a few weeks work left before the start of the summer recess in June, and members of the new Parliament would have little chance to address ratification until 2020.Trump, a Republican, has shown frustration with the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives for failing to sign off on the USMCA. He has threatened to pull out of the old pact, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), if Congress does not hurry up.If Trump did dump NAFTA, the three nations would revert to trade rules in place before it came into effect in 1994.TARIFFSCanada and Mexico are seeking exemption from U.S. tariffs on global metal imports imposed last year.The metals tariffs were not included in the USMCA and Mexico and Canada are impatient to resolve the issue. Mexico has repeatedly threatened to target new U.S. products by the end of April in retribution if tariffs are imposed.Meanwhile, Trump on Thursday threatened to slap tariffs on Mexican auto exports unless Mexico does more to stop drug traffickers and illegal immigration.Mexico's government is in the final stages of completing a new list of potential U.S. imports to be targeted, said Luz Maria de la Mora, a Mexican deputy economy minister.""There's going to be a bit of everything,"" she told Reuters, declining to give details of how the list - originally encompassing products such as bourbon, cheese, motor boats, pork legs, steel and apples - could be modified.De la Mora would not be drawn on whether Mexico could refuse to ratify USMCA if steel tariffs are not withdrawn, saying only: ""All options are on the table.""In Ottawa, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said this week her government was ""constantly"" looking at its own retaliation list, noting that Trump's tariffs left the country over C$16 billion worth of space to strike back.Freeland did not say when that list could change, and a government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it might not be necessary. Still, Freeland said Canada was coordinating with Mexico about its options.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who faces a tough re-election battle, on Thursday rejected accepting quotas on Canadian steel and aluminum in exchange for U.S. tariffs being dropped.Trudeau was criticized during the USMCA negotiations for giving ground to Trump on access to Canada's dairy sector.WORKERSU.S. Democrats have threatened to block the USMCA unless Mexico passes legislation to improve workers' rights, a demand shared by the Canadian government.A bill already in Mexico's Congress to strengthen trade unions should be approved this month, the government says.Trump blamed NAFTA for millions of job losses in the United States as companies moved south to employ cheaper Mexican labor. Trump is running for re-election in 2020, and his 'America First' policy will likely feature prominently in the campaign.Forcing Mexico and Canada to rework NAFTA was one of Trump's signature pledges during his shock win in 2016, and Democrats are pulling out the stops to avoid losing again.""The closer the election gets, the harder it will be for Democrats to grant Trump a victory"" by ratifying the USMCA, said Sergio Alcocer, a former deputy Mexican foreign minister.Some Democrats are pushing to change the deal - an idea that both Canadian and Mexican officials resist.""People need to be very careful around opening up what could really be a Pandora's box,"" Freeland said on Thursday.Canadian officials say they fear that if one part of the treaty were reopened, it could spark clamor for other sections to be renegotiated as well.

86,"The former White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, on Wednesday declined to answer questions about the existence of a memo he wrote saying that President Trump had ordered officials to give his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a security clearance in May 2018.Mr. Kelly also broke with Mr. Trump on key aspects of his approach to immigration and the NATO alliance, and said that his top concern about decisions made by the president was whether they were objectively right for the country when divorced from political concerns.Mr. Kelly, who kept his voice level during a 90-minute question-and-answer session at Duke University, would not specifically address Mr. Kushner’s clearance being ordered by Mr. Trump, which The New York Times reported last week.“I couldn’t — and I’m not dodging — I couldn’t comment on that for a couple of reasons,” Mr. Kelly said, citing clearances being among the things that he could not discuss, and that conversations with the president “at that level would certainly” be kept confidential under executive privilege.Asked specifically about whether he had ever created memos for the record, Mr. Kelly said, “I’d prefer not to talk about that.”Mr. Trump ordered the chief of staff to get Mr. Kushner a clearance after it stalled for most of the first half of the president’s term over concerns from the F.B.I. and career security officials about Mr. Kushner’s personal foreign contacts, as well as those related to his family’s real-estate business.Mr. Trump has the legal authority to overrule recommendations from security clearance officials. But his action added to ongoing questions about how people obtained them, and it contradicted a statement at the time from Mr. Kushner’s lawyer that his clearance went through a normal process. And the president himself asserted to The Times in an Oval Office interview in January that he had not directed Mr. Kelly or anyone else to grant a clearance.In his conversation at Duke with Professor Peter Feaver, Mr. Kelly said that his 18 months as the chief of staff were the “least” favorite job he had held, but the most important. He acknowledged that his colleagues in the Marine Corps, where he served as a four-star general, might not like hearing that.However, Mr. Kelly said, during that time, Mr. Trump “went from a guy who didn’t know how the system works” to one “who understands how it works.”Mr. Kelly, who left at the end of December, also made clear he did not consider himself working for Mr. Trump, but doing his civic duty to serve. If Hillary Clinton had won, he said, he probably would have worked for her as well.Mr. Kelly defended the utility of the NATO alliance, which Mr. Trump has often criticized as an unfair financial drain on the United States.On a wall at the border with Mexico, Mr. Kelly said that there were specific areas where it could be effective but constructing one “from sea to shining sea” was a “waste of money.”The issuance of the zero-tolerance policy for border crossings that resulted in family separations “came as a surprise” to him and to other officials, Mr. Kelly said, defending his replacement as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, from criticism. He appeared to place most of the blame on the former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who announced the policy.Of people crossing the border who are apprehended, Mr. Kelly contradicted the president. “They’re overwhelmingly not criminals — they’re people coming up here for economic” purposes. Mr. Trump has regularly portrayed immigrants crossing at the southern border as dangerous lawbreakers.He also joked wryly about the advice he gave his successor, Mick Mulvaney: “Run for it,” Mr. Kelly said, to laughter. On a serious note, he said, he told him the chief of staff’s job was to tell the president “what he needs to hear.”"
87,"WASHINGTON — President Trump plans to use his State of the Union address on Tuesday night to outline a bipartisan and optimistic vision of the country, a senior administration official said on Friday.It could be a difficult sell.In the past few weeks, as he has tried to navigate his way out of a political standoff with Democrats, Mr. Trump has ramped up his anti-immigration messaging, stormed out of meetings with Democratic leaders and refused to accept any compromise that does not ultimately include funding for a border wall.And while the White House said on Friday that the goal of the speech was to bring together a divided government and a divided nation, the official said immigration would emerge as the main theme.Mr. Trump is also expected to make an appeal to his evangelical anti-abortion base by talking about the “fundamental importance and respect for human life,” the official said. And he will focus a large portion of his remarks on the importance of ending illegal immigration.But the official, who refused to be identified according to the ground rules of the briefing, framed the speech as an opportunity to change the tone of the current political debate.“Together we can break decades of political stalemate,” Mr. Trump is expected to say, according to an excerpt from the speech shared by the official. “We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future. The decision is ours to make.”The overarching theme of the speech, the official said, will be “Choosing Greatness,” and it will focus on issues where there is a possibility of bipartisan consensus: infrastructure, lowering health care and prescription drug costs, protecting American workers affected by what he described as “decades of flawed trade deals” and safeguarding national security.The president will also call on Congress to replace what he described as the “Nafta disaster” with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and discuss the trading relationship with China.In his first State of the Union address last year, Mr. Trump also sought to strike a unifying tone that was a contrast to the political attacks and divisive messaging that he is better known for. But the promises in last year’s speech, including bringing Democrats and Republicans together behind a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan, have not materialized, while the more contentious policies of his presidency have continued.This year, Mr. Trump will address the nation after a 35-day government shutdown caused by his insistence that Congress approve funding for the border wall. And although the president agreed to three weeks of negotiations to end the impasse, he said on Thursday that the talks are “a waste of time” and strongly hinted that he would declare a national emergency to bypass Congress and obtain wall funding.Mr. Trump suggested on Friday that he would announce his decision on declaring a national emergency during the State of the Union speech.“I don’t want to say,” he told reporters when asked if he was planning to do so. “You’ll hear the State of the Union and let’s see what happens,” he said.White House officials have been warning him against the action, but they also view it as a potential last-ditch exit ramp if they cannot find another face-saving solution.Last month, in the midst of the shutdown, Speaker Nancy Pelosi told the president she wanted to postpone the address, initially scheduled for Jan. 29, until after the government reopened, and suggested he deliver the speech in writing.Mr. Trump retaliated by grounding the military plane that was supposed to take Ms. Pelosi and other lawmakers on a fact-finding trip to Afghanistan. Then, when Mr. Trump pressed ahead, insisting he wanted to give the speech, Ms. Pelosi disinvited him. But this week she and the president agreed he would give the speech on Feb. 5."
88,"The video for “A Lot,” 21 Savage’s elegiac single, takes place at a formal dinner and party in a cloud-high mansion, a lavish and exuberant celebration of black wealth. But there’s a moving sequence midway through that suggests trouble just beneath the surface.The cuts are quick — warm shots of confident guests at the dinner table interspersed with darker scenes in which they’re suffering: poor health, financial hardship, criminal past, abuse, death of a loved one. The message of the video isn’t exactly that nothing is as it seems, but more that where you end up may be far from where you came from, and that success doesn’t cure all obstacles.When 21 Savage first emerged in 2015, he was a cold brutalist of a rapper whose verses verged on the dead-eyed. But just a few years on, he’s taken a turn to the reflective. Later in the video, he added a ruminative new verse to the song, rapping, “Went through some things, but I couldn’t imagine my kids stuck at the border,” directly addressing the current administration’s divisive immigration policies.[Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.]On Sunday, just a couple of days after that video’s release, 21 Savage was arrested by agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which said he was in this country illegally and placed him into deportation proceedings. As of Wednesday afternoon, he remained in ICE custody.Is 21 Savage American? By any measurement other than citizenship, yes. He was born She’yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph in England in 1992. According to Charles Kuck, one of his immigration attorneys, he came to the United States at age 7 and has been here continuously ever since, apart from a one-month period in 2005. He then re-entered the country on an H-4 visa, which expired in 2006, leaving him without legal status.But the events of the last few days underscore the ways in which the hard power of government authority and soft power of online conversation can align in peculiar and insidious ways. As news began to spread on social media of 21 Savage’s arrest on Sunday, the meme and joke ecosystem that uses trauma as oxygen went into overdrive, reacting with special intensity to the revelation that 21 Savage — one of the titans of Atlanta’s rap scene — was in fact British. As the government put his relationship with this country in peril, thousands of people chirped in online to poke at the unlikeliness, and precariousness, of his situation.That 21 Savage is in fact a British national is, ultimately, not particularly revelatory, or even meaningful. Foreign-born residents made up 13.7 percent of the United States population in 2017, according to the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, published last year (which includes those in the country legally and illegally). Most of the humor turned on a high-society caricature understanding of England, and the dissonance of locating someone like 21 Savage — a seen-it-all stoicist with a dagger tattooed on his forehead — inside it. By and large, those people overlooked, or didn’t think as far as, the more odious association: that of empire and colonization. (His mother’s family hails from Dominica, a former British colony in the West Indies.)His success, however, is especially American. Growing up in some of Atlanta’s poorest communities, 21 Savage had a troubled childhood. He’s said that he dropped out of school to sell drugs, and has spoken in interviews of a youth marked by violence and crime. But after losing a close friend and a brother to gun violence, he turned to rapping. And within a year, he was one of Atlanta’s most promising prospects.He’s since worked with Drake, Cardi B and Post Malone. His 2017 debut album, “Issa Album,” went gold, and his second studio album, “I Am > I Was,” released in December, debuted at the top of the Billboard album chart. At this Sunday’s Grammy Awards, 21 Savage is nominated in two categories.He has also been maturing in the public eye — advocating for gun control, donating money to educate young people in Atlanta on financial literacy (an announcement made on Ellen DeGeneres’s show, of all places), even walking alongside then-girlfriend Amber Rose in 2017 at her SlutWalk, a women’s empowerment event, carrying a sign that read “I’m a Hoe Too.”This is the American promise, no? To start from nothing and turn it into a bounty. To receive a cruel hand and still emerge victorious.And yet there is this other American promise, or threat, which is that all that comfort can be easily ripped away if it isn’t achieved in the correct fashion.In the case of 21 Savage, whose public image was built on a kind of impenetrable toughness mixed with weary resilience, this moment of vulnerability was destabilizing. Even in his most intimate music, he never presents as anything other than an agent of control.But the immigration system is beyond his jurisdiction, even though, since becoming a public figure, he has taken steps to address his status. According to a statement released by his attorneys on Tuesday, in 2017 he applied for a U visa, which, according to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, can be issued by the government to crime victims “who have suffered mental or physical abuse and are helpful to law enforcement or government officials in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity.” 21 Savage has said he was shot in 2013. The statement did not specify whether he cooperated with authorities.The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that 21 Savage was arrested at the same time DeKalb County police arrested another rapper, Young Nudy, on unrelated charges. But 21 Savage was detained directly by ICE, Kuck said. 21 Savage also was convicted on felony drug charges in 2014. The conviction record was expunged in September 2018 as part of Georgia’s first-offender program and the files have been sealed, according to Jacoby Hudson, who represented 21 Savage in the matter.(Though expunged convictions have been used in deportation proceedings, 21 Savage would be eligible for removal simply for the overstayed visa.)21 Savage is now among the highest-profile immigration detainees, his situation instantly becoming a flash point in national conversations about people living in this country without legal status, and in dialogues about the ways in which immigrants contribute to American society. A petition asking for his release started by Black Lives Matter has amassed over 200,000 signatures.A star who built his own success, 21 Savage has in one fell swoop re-emerged as someone in need of protection. But in his recent music and public life, his identity was already becoming more complex and nuanced, delivering tales about the horrors of life at the bottom salted with a fresh understanding of just how slippery it can be at the top."
89,"There’s no reason to mourn Kirstjen Nielsen’s departure from the Department of Homeland Security. She was an immigration hard-liner working aggressively to carry out President Trump’s restrictionist agenda. She spearheaded efforts to crack down on migrants and asylum seekers. She requested military assistance at the border. She limited the number of people who can legally present for asylum at ports of entry. And she vastly increased the number of immigrants in detention.She also carried out the president’s “zero tolerance” policy, resulting in the separation of thousands of families at our border with Mexico. Many parents are still searching for their children.But there were limits to Nielsen’s embrace of Trump’s immigration policies. She pushed back on his demands to break the law to stop migrants from entering the country, according to The Times, and repeatedly reminded the president of “the limitations imposed on her department by federal laws, court settlements and international obligations.”In almost any other administration, this would be unremarkable. It simply means Nielsen took her job and its legal obligations seriously — what we would expect from any civil servant. But Trump is unusual among modern presidents for his routine elevation of people who lack that basic sense of public ethics. If regular pressure to break the law was part of Nielsen’s decision to leave the administration, then her departure illustrates how any belief in the public good, no matter how slight, is incompatible with working for this president, even if you share his views.[Join Jamelle Bouie as he shines a light on overlooked writing, culture and ideas from around the internet. For exclusive thoughts, photos and reading recommendations, sign up for his newsletter.]This was evident from previous resignations and firings. Rex Tillerson, Trump’s first secretary of state, seemed to share the president’s skepticism of the department, carrying out an agenda meant to shrink its influence. But when Trump wanted to break the law — which, Tillerson said in an interview after leaving the administration, was “often” — Tillerson would push back, unwilling to completely subordinate himself to the president’s will. “I would have to say to him, ‘Mr. President, I understand what you want to do, but you can’t do it that way. It violates the law.’”The president’s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, faced similar pressures after he recused himself from any investigations related to the prospect of Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election. Sessions took that step after The Washington Post revealed his meetings with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, during the campaign — the kind of contact he had denied during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.Trump was furious, which grew into rage after the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, appointed Robert Mueller special counsel. Trump reportedly berated Sessions in the Oval Office — which the attorney general called his “most humiliating experience in decades of public life” — and complained that the recusal was “unfair.”Trump wanted Sessions to derail the Russia investigation and protect him from scrutiny, essentially making himself above the law. And he spent much of 2018 pressuring the attorney general to do just that, either attacking him in public or cajoling him in private. Sessions, who shared Trump’s politics but not his complete contempt for the rule of law, wouldn’t budge. “As long as I am the attorney general, I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor, and this department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution,” he said in a February 2018 statement. This stalemate resolved itself after the midterm elections, when a frustrated and weakened Trump finally fired Sessions, replacing him temporarily with Matthew Whitaker, a loyalist who served as Sessions’s chief of staff, and permanently with William Barr, who served as attorney general under George H.W. Bush, shielding him from the fallout of the Iran-contra scandal.The overall pattern is clear. Trump wants to act with impunity, breaking the law if he needs or even just wants to. His appointees, who share his goals but not his methods, resist. He scolds and attacks them until they resign, replacing them with loyalists who may actually bend to his will.Rex Tillerson was replaced by Mike Pompeo, then serving as director of the C.I.A. Unlike Tillerson, who attempted to contain Trump’s worst instincts, Pompeo has been willing to say or do nearly anything to stay in Trump’s favor. It’s why he would echo the president’s widely criticized flattery of Kim Jong-un and the North Korean government.Trump says that Kevin McAleenan, until now the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, will take over for Nielsen as acting secretary of Homeland Security. Like Nielsen, McAleenan backs the president’s harsh border policies. He defended border patrol agents after they used tear gas on hundreds of migrants, including women and children, who tried to enter the United States near Tijuana, Mexico. Some attorneys say it’s unclear if Trump can elevate McAleenan, since the laws regarding succession point to under secretary for management Claire Grady as next-in-line as acting director.For a more permanent replacement, Trump is reportedly considering Ken Cuccinelli, the former Virginia attorney general turned conservative television personality, and Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state notorious for his aggressively anti-immigrant policies.With either choice, Trump would affirm the pattern of his administration so far, jettisoning people who act as if they were accountable to the public and replacing them with people who above all are loyal to Trump, willing to go in the “tougher” — and possibly illegal — direction he demands."
90,"ROME — An Italian school bus driver took 51 seventh-graders hostage in northern Italy on Wednesday, pouring gasoline on the bus floor and later setting it afire.After someone on the bus made an emergency call, Italian carabinieri, or military police, reached the bus and safely rescued all the children, as well as two teachers and a janitor aboard, as it burst into flames.The driver, Osseynou Sy, an Italian of Senegalese origin, said that “he wanted to vindicate the dead of the Mediterranean,” according to Warrant Officer Marco Palmieri, a spokesman for Milan’s provincial branch of the carabinieri, Italy’s military police.Mr. Sy, he said, was referring to the large number of migrants who lose their lives each year during the perilous crossing of the Mediterranean from North Africa to Europe. The International Organization for Migration estimates that 282 people have drowned that way this year.A promise to curb migration from North Africa was a key factor in the election of Italy’s populist national government a year ago. Since then, the country — once a principal hub for migrants crossing the Mediterranean — has closed its ports to nongovernmental rescue vessels, to force other European countries to bear the burden of migrant landings.The Italian interior ministry announced on Sunday that migrant arrivals were down 94 percent this year, compared to 2018.Mr. Sy was arrested and treated at a Milanese hospital for burns on his hand. He was expected to be charged with kidnapping; arson; resisting arrest; intention to commit mass murder, because some students were still on the bus when it burst into flames; and terrorism as an aggravating factor, because he “created panic and threatened Italian institutions,” said Alberto Nobili, one of the Milanese prosecutors assigned to the case.Mr. Sy told prosecutors that he had acted alone and that he intended to send a message to African immigrants “not to come to Europe, but at the same time to punish Europe for what he saw as its unacceptable migration policies,” Mr. Nobili said at a news conference in Milan on Wednesday night.The students, who attend a middle school in Crema, a city some 50 kilometers, or almost 32 miles, east of Milan, were returning from gym class when Mr. Sy, a regular driver on the route, poured gasoline down the bus’s center aisle and announced that he was hijacking it and taking them to Linate Airport in Milan, investigators said.He then gave zip ties to the three adults, ordering them to tie each child’s wrists together as he drove. As they went back the rows of seats, the adults left the zip ties progressively looser, another prosecutor, Francesco Greco, said.Police in two carabinieri cars, tipped off by the phone call, forced the bus to stop on the Paullese provincial highway, but Mr. Sy rammed the cars again and again. While some officers tried to speak to him, others from a third military police car forced the bus’s side door open and broke the windows at the back to allow the passengers to flee.At that point, Mr. Sy apparently ignited a lighter he was holding, officers said, and the bus caught fire as the hostages were escaping.Italian television stations showed images of the charred skeleton of the bus, completely destroyed.Asked why the adults did not try to overpower the driver, Warrant Officer Palmieri said that he could not speak for them, but that “the threat was very real.”Mr. Sy was born in Senegal in 1972, investigators said, and became an Italian citizen in 2004. His wife, from whom he is separated, is Italian, and the couple have two children.Mr. Sy had been working for the Autoguidovie bus company for 15 years, a company official, Corrado Bianchessi, said. He “never gave any particular signal” to indicate what he had planned, Mr. Bianchessi told the Italian channel of Sky News. “We are amazed,” he said.Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, who is also Italy’s interior minister and a major opponent of illegal immigration, posted a tweet in which he said that Mr. Sy had a police record for driving under the influence and sexual assault.“Why was someone with such record driving a bus for school children?” he asked. But prosecutors said the offenses were relatively minor.Mr. Nobili said Mr. Sy had made a video explaining his actions on Tuesday. “He wanted the world to speak of this event,” he said, adding that prosecutors had no sense the episode was tied to “radicalized terrorism.”He said Mr. Sy told investigators he wanted to board a plane to Senegal from Linate Airport, but it was unclear how he could do that or what he intended to do with the students, who were around 12 years old.Mr. Sy told prosecutors he never wanted to hurt anyone, but Mr. Greco wasn’t buying it. “If we’re not crying over the death” of dozens of schoolchildren, he said, “it is thanks to the courage and rapid response of the carabinieri.”“It could have been a massacre,” he told the Ansa news agency."
91,"Lawyers for the Britain-born rapper 21 Savage say he will be released on bond on Wednesday after spending more than a week in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which said it had arrested him for being in the United States illegally.Kuck Baxter Immigration, the law firm representing the rapper, whose legal name is She’yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, posted news of his pending release on its Facebook page on Tuesday afternoon.“In the last 24 hours, in the wake of the Grammy Awards at which he was scheduled to attend and perform, we received notice that She’yaa was granted an expedited hearing,” the post said. “Today, 21 Savage was granted a release on bond. He won his freedom.”Mr. Abraham-Joseph, 26, was arrested in the early hours of Feb. 3 during an operation by federal and local law enforcement authorities in Atlanta, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said at the time.The agency said in a statement at the time that he was a British national who had entered the United States on a nonimmigrant visa in 2005 and was supposed to leave the following year.The agency also said that Mr. Abraham-Joseph was convicted of felony drug charges in Fulton County, Ga., in 2014. One of Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s lawyers, Charles Kuck, said that conviction was vacated and the charges were dismissed by prosecutors in 2018.A member of the rapper’s legal team, Dina LaPolt, said in a statement after his arrest that he had been “left without legal status through no fault of his own” because “as a minor, his family overstayed their work visas.” Mr. Kuck said his client was 12 when his immigration status expired.Mr. Abraham-Joseph was nominated for a Grammy Award for record of the year for “Rockstar,” a song with the rapper Post Malone, but did not win at the awards ceremony on Sunday. Known for his flat delivery and subdued rap style, his album “I Am > I Was” opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in January.Charles Kuck, another member of Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s legal team, said Tuesday that the rapper had been granted release but would have to spend one more night in custody.“We actually can’t get him out today because ICE stops taking money at 2 o’clock and the judge’s decision came down at around 2:15,” Mr. Kuck said. “He’ll be released in the morning.”Mr. Kuck declined to say what bail had been set at or where his client was being detained, but he said Mr. Abraham-Joseph had been treated well.“The facility where he has been held has been extraordinarily gracious to him, his legal team and his family,” Mr. Kuck said. “They have treated him well and we are grateful for their hospitality, as best as that can be in a jail cell.”A spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s next date in immigration court is set for April 11, Mr. Kuck said.The Facebook post from Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s lawyers on Tuesday said that he wanted to draw attention to immigration detainees who are not as well known as he is.“He will not forget this ordeal or any of the other fathers, sons, family members, and faceless people he was locked up with or that remain unjustly incarcerated across the country,” the post said. “And he asks for your hearts and minds to be with them.”"
92,"The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau chief. Sign up to get it by email.___Parliament approved a bill this week to allow medical evacuation for asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus over the opposition of Prime Minister Scott Morrison, throwing Australia into another visceral debate over immigration.In the coming months, with an election approaching, we can expect to hear all kinds of intense and moralistic rhetoric.Mr. Morrison and his supporters are already arguing that opening the door even a little to settlement in Australia will encourage a flood of migrants and deaths at sea. Labor, the Greens and others on the left are maintaining that immigration is a net positive for Australia and that cruelty must be restrained.This is all part of a broader conversation across the West about migration and national identity; the White House announced just today that President Trump will declare a state of emergency to build a border wall.And it’s a conversation that matters. These disputes, however they end up, will shape many countries, and the world, for decades.But for me, there’s a certain familiarity to the discussion, not just in Washington but also in Canberra.I’ve written about immigration for nearly 20 years, from various countries, from the neighborhoods and towns where immigrants cluster to the halls of power where decisions are made.Along the way, there are a few things I’ve learned to look out for.The Hero Vs. Villain TrapIn heated moments like this one, immigrants and the nuances of their lives and motivations tend to be reduced to the most simplistic of archetypes.Either they are criminals (the worst of the worst, rapists, murders, pedophiles) or they are blameless hard-working heroes (say, doctors or professional basketball players from Australia in the N.B.A.).The reality — and this should be obvious, but often gets overlooked — is that most migrants are in the messy middle with the rest of us. They’re good and bad, they’re parents and workers, and they’re mostly just trying to make life a little bit better for themselves and their loved ones.This idea that they are somehow different and more extreme reflects little more than the political need for narrative and division. Beware of the packaging of simplicity.“It’s a Fact-Free Zone”When I was reporting a series of stories back in 2012 — the first to show that the era of mass Mexican migration was over — an expert I talked to warned that policymakers would ignore my findings.Immigration, he said, is an issue driven by emotion. “It’s a fact-free zone,” he said. And he was right.No matter how many cold hard facts get put into the public domain in the next few months — and I hope there are a lot of them — don’t expect the politicians to adjust their arguments. They’re appealing less to the head than the heart.And look out for what’s missing too.You probably won’t hear anyone, for example, pointing out that the decision to migrate is typically a long-term bet, calculated and paid for over several years, which rarely responds to immediate policy changes in predictable ways.There are both push (from a country) and pull (to a country) factors and, according to sociologists and demographers, it is often impossible to make sweeping cause-and-effect conclusions based on one element alone.Every immigrant has a story all their own. People move and flee for reasons that often have very little to do with what policymakers do to deter or assist them.Interaction WinsDuring a long road trip from the Mexican to the Canadian border, for a project exploring immigration in Middle America, I met dozens of Americans with all kinds of views about immigration.But there are two people, both older white women, who I still think about.One was in Farmers Branch, Texas, an area that had tried, but failed, to push out immigrants who might not be documented with a series of strict residential rental rules and policing. She told me through her locked screen door that she wanted tougher enforcement; she was afraid.Another was in Wichita, in Kansas, in an area that had gone from a declining white, working-class community to one that was reviving but more mixed in terms of ethnicity and origin.The woman’s name was Francene Sharp. You can read her full story here, but what stuck with me was her reaction to a break in at her home by some local Mexican teenagers.She had cause to be angry. But because she’d spent years getting to know many of her other immigrant neighbors — including a friend who she called for help right after the break in — her response and her views were tempered and calm.What she had (that the woman in Texas did not) was real-life interaction, enough of it to prevent her from making sweeping judgments about people or policy.She relied on her own deep experience and a remarkable openness to combat the “fact-free zone” and the “hero/villain trap.”Border policy was on her radar; she was no supporter of “open borders.” But she was far more interested in why those teenagers who broke in were not at home studying. Integration and community mattered more to her than border walls.Which brings me to what I’ll be looking for in this year’s Australian (and American) immigration debate.Will there be people pushing the conversation beyond border enforcement and detention?Who, if anyone, will be asking: How can immigration be studied, discussed and shaped in conjunction with immigrants to ensure that Australia (the country that often calls itself “the world’s most successful multicultural nation”) lives up to that promise?Now for a few stories of the week (plus a few surprising recommendations from Paul Krugman).As always, you can share your thoughts in our NYT Australia Facebook group.

93,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who oversaw President Donald Trump's bitterly contested immigration policies during her tumultuous 16-month tenure, resigned on Sunday amid a surge in the number of migrants at the border with Mexico.A senior administration official said Trump asked for Nielsen's resignation and she gave it. Trump, who has recently expressed growing anger about the situation at the border, said on Twitter: ""Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service.""In another tweet, Trump said Kevin McAleenan, the current U.S. Customs and Border Protection commissioner, would become acting DHS secretary.In a tweet late Sunday, Nielsen said that she would stay on until Wednesday.""I have agreed to stay on as Secretary through Wednesday, April 10th to assist with an orderly transition and ensure that key DHS missions are not impacted,"" she said.Nielsen's departure was first reported by CBS News. Nielsen, 46, had been DHS secretary since December 2017. Her departure had been repeatedly rumored over the past year, particularly after a wave of anger over the administration's 2018 family separation policy at the border with Mexico and most recently as U.S. border officials estimated that 100,000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border in March, the highest level in a decade.Another senior administration official said Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, after a blowup with Nielsen late last year, also recommended to Trump that she should go.Trump has made a clampdown on illegal immigration a centerpiece of his two-year-old presidency, leading chants of ""Build that wall"" at his rallies as he has sought to cut back on the number of newcomers entering the United States without proper documentation.Many of the migrants picked up last month were Central Americans seeking U.S. asylum.Trump was so frustrated about the increase that he announced he would cut off U.S. aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. He also threatened to close the border with Mexico, although he later backed off that proposal with a threat to impose tariffs on auto imports.In her resignation letter, Nielsen asked for more from Congress and the courts, which have opposed such Trump administration initiatives as his effort to limit immigration from Muslim nations and the border wall.""I hope that the next Secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America's borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation's discourse,"" she wrote to Trump.Trump also took aim at Congress in another tweet later on Sunday, saying: ""Country is FULL,"" and saying Democrats in Congress must ""fix loopholes"" and repeating his threats to close the border or impose tariffs if Mexico does not do more. Nielsen's resignation was the latest high-profile departure from the Trump administration, and leaves just four women in his Cabinet. Among others, Trump currently lacks a permanent secretary of defense or chief of staff.LIGHTNING RODNielsen's departure was announced two days after the Republican president abruptly said on Friday he was dumping his nominee to be the top official at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Ronald Vitiello, saying he wanted someone ""tougher.""ICE is under the jurisdiction of DHS, which was formed following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington.Repeatedly subjected to tough questioning by Democrats at congressional hearings, Nielsen became a lightning rod for criticism of Trump's policies. She was confronted by protesters last year at a Mexican restaurant in Washington.Last year, Nielsen came under increasing pressure by critics to step aside after the Trump administration adopted the policy of separating migrant children from their parents as part of its ""zero tolerance"" approach intended to deter families from leaving home in the hope of entering the United States.After criticism as pictures of children in cages were spread across the world, Trump signed an executive order in June ending family separations and requiring that families be held together in federal custody while the adults awaited prosecution for illegally crossing the border.But the government reported that at least 245 children were taken from their families between that time and the first months of 2019.Trump insists that the arrival of immigrants across the southern U.S. border constitutes a national emergency so important that he sidestepped Congress' refusal to provide him with billions of dollars he requested to build the border wall.Representative Bennie Thompson, the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee, said Nielsen's tenure at DHS ""was a disaster from the start.""He said in a statement, however, that she should not serve as a scapegoat, blasting Trump for ""terrible and cruel policies."" Noting that the department now has neither a permanent secretary nor deputy secretary, Thompson called on the administration to work with Congress ""in good faith.""Before she was nominated as secretary, Nielsen worked as a deputy to former Marine General John Kelly, who headed DHS before becoming White House chief of staff. Kelly resigned as chief of staff on Jan. 2 amid reports of a strained relationship with Trump. (Reporting by Diane Bartz and Patricia Zengerle; Additional reporting by Jeff Mason and Sarah N.

94,"Here’s your roundup of the top news in business and tech, plus all you need to know for the week ahead. Even if your March Madness bracket was a flop, at least you can feel good about your news I.Q.Boeing’s grounded fleet of 737 Max jets probably won’t be back in the air anytime soon. A preliminary report on what caused one of the aircraft to crash in Ethiopia last month determined that the pilots followed all of Boeing’s safety protocols. While investigators stopped short of blaming the company for the plane crash, the report does put more pressure on the manufacturer and aviation authorities to figure out what happened — and to make sure it won’t again. Boeing has already lost one order of its 737 planes from Indonesia’s national airline, and the longer it takes to get the jets cleared for flight, the more customers (and money) it stands to lose. President Trump said on Thursday that he planned to give Mexico a “one-year warning” to stop drug smuggling and illegal immigration or he’ll close the southern border. This was a big step back from a threat he had made the week before, when he said he’d close the border in the next few days. His initial statement was followed by widespread panic. A border closing would seriously harm the American economy, halting the daily flow of $1.7 billion of goods and services between the two countries. This would cause food shortages (where would we get our avocados?) and price spikes. It would also hurt the 500,000 legal workers, students, shoppers and tourists who cross the border each day. If you’re getting tired of Facebook’s user data — particularly your own — showing up in places it shouldn’t, you’re in good company. A cybersecurity firm reported this past week that it had stumbled upon a huge cache of Facebook user information on one of Amazon’s cloud computing servers. The information included millions of Facebook users’ passwords, comments, and account names, and all of it could be downloaded by anyone who found it online. The database was closed after Facebook learned about its contents, but considering the rash of similar cases in the past year, this won’t be the last breach of its kind. Mr. Trump escalated his sniping at the Federal Reserve on Friday, calling on the organization to cut interest rates and use other means to boost economic growth. He also continued to accuse the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, of throwing water on the economy by raising interest rates last year. It’s unusual for a president to so openly attempt to exert influence over the central bank, but Mr. Trump is taking his efforts a step further by announcing plans to nominate two of his longtime supporters for seats on the Fed’s board. One is his “friend,” the former pizza executive and 2012 presidential hopeful Herman Cain, and the other is Stephen Moore, a conservative economist and adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Powell will surely be asked about all of this on Wednesday, after the Fed releases the minutes of its March meeting. European Union leaders will hold a last-minute summit on Wednesday to discuss the fate of Brexit, which has now dragged on past the point of absurdity. Britain is now slated to withdraw from the bloc on April 12 with or without a concrete plan, unless Prime Minister Theresa May can win Parliament’s agreement for another deadline extension. There has been much hand-wringing over the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, which could be disastrous for the British economy as well as its trade partners. To prepare, many businesses have staged their own reverse Brexit, moving operations elsewhere and holding off on investing in British companies. It’s a lose-lose for Britain, and prolonging the process isn’t likely to improve matters. A trade deal with China may finally be nigh. But then again, who really knows? On Thursday, Mr. Trump gathered with the Chinese delegation, which was in Washington for the umpteenth round of negotiations, to say that he’s anticipating an “epic” trade agreement in about four weeks. He was also expected to announce a presidential summit with Xi Jinping of China, presumably to sign that deal, but he stopped short of doing so. “If we have a deal, then we’ll have a summit,” Mr. Trump said. He is under mounting pressure to make good on the lofty promises he made to American businesses about an agreement, but the clock is ticking on the economic damage that trade tensions are wreaking around the world. Jeff and Mackenzie Bezos have finalized the details of their divorce. He will keep 75 percent of their joint shares in Amazon, leaving her with a $36 billion stake — which makes her one of the richest women in the world. Speaking of wealthy people, Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, is still battling with the Securities and Exchange Commission over his ill-advised (and unadvised) tweets about his company. A New York judge gave both parties two weeks to sort out their differences, and recommended that they put on their “reasonableness pants” to do so — a tall order, in this case."
95,"EL PASO — I have a suggestion for President Trump. Instead of fanning fear during your visit to this city on Monday night, stroll across the Paso del Norte Bridge into Ciudad Júarez. Join the 70,000 people crossing four bridges who daily form the human tissue linking the United States and Mexico. They work, they study, they eat, they shop, all part of what Dee Margo, the mayor of El Paso, calls “one region, one culture.”I crossed the bridge. Things slow down, as they do when you move from the developed to the developing world. Secondhand clothes for sale hang on simple brightly painted homes, the poorest made of pallets and corrugated iron roofs. Júarez, home to many of the foreign-owned assembly plants known as “maquiladoras,” has a violent history and big social problems, but in the dusty streets and cafes serving steaming bowls of tripe-and-bean soup I discerned no tension.“It’s simple,” Julián Cardona, a photographer, told me. “Everyone here knows Trump hates brown people. We call him ‘Trompudo,’ or ‘big mouth.’”From that mouth seeps the sinister specter of an “invasion.” Thousands of active-duty troops are dispatched to the border. Concertina wire spreads. The government shutdown that ended on Jan. 25 could be followed soon by Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to build his wall. Presidential powers include the power to manufacture a threat where none exists.“From my vantage point in El Paso there is no crisis,” Margo, the mayor, told me. “You look south and you can’t tell where El Paso merges into Júarez.”Bridges, in other words, trump walls.At one of the shelters run by the nonprofit Annunciation House, I met Iris Galindo Maldonado, an undocumented 43-year-old woman from Guerrero State, in southwestern Mexico, who entered the United States on Jan. 15 with her 10-year-old daughter to request asylum. Her husband was killed seven years ago by drug dealers angered by his refusal to cooperate with them. She said they have threatened her in turn for refusing to help them smuggle cocaine.“I’ve already lived,” she told me. “I hope the American authorities support me for my daughter, so she’s not in danger, she’s not menaced, and gets educated. I told her, even if we stay one week, two weeks, however long it is, use the opportunity to learn English. She’s already in school, and I pray to God a lot.”Galindo, aged 43, has been processed by ICE, fitted with an ankle bracelet, and let go to face a long wait in American limbo, along with several hundred thousand others, before her day in immigration court. She has no family in the United States.“Trump calls us killers, delinquents and drug dealers,” she told me. “In fact that is exactly what we are fleeing from!”Annunciation House took her in. Ruben Garcia, the director of the organization, says he is finding beds these days for more than 2,000 people a week. If nothing else, Trump’s rhetoric and policy swerves have helped feed chaos.“For Trump, to be a refugee is to be a murderer and a rapist,” Garcia told me. “This is what he ran on. He has a can of paint filled with a certain ideology and paints everything with it. To supporters of the wall, I ask: Is it time to take down the Statue of Liberty?”Representative Veronica Escobar, the successor to Beto O’Rourke, now a possible Democratic presidential candidate, took me down to the spot, near a stretch of existing wall, where border agents detained an 8-year-old Guatemalan boy, Felipe Gómez Alonzo, in December. He later died in United States custody.The spot is over the Rio Grande, in the United States, but just short of the wall, raising the question of the barrier’s usefulness. That is a question the president has refused to address with any seriousness. His wall is much less about security than macho symbolism — “a monument to bigotry,” in Escobar’s words.I got talking to an agent who stopped us as we stepped south of the wall. He said agents in that area detained “300 bodies a day.” He said the “bodies” were jumping the line. He said by the time their cases came before an immigration judge, “the bodies are somewhere else so they get to stay.” So, he concluded, “we really have no authority to enforce the law.”Bodies, I noted, is a term generally used for dead people. Would it not be better to call them people or human beings, as this is what they are? The agent said he didn’t mean that they are dead, but that “bodies” was the favored term.I was subsequently advised not to read too much into this “law enforcement vernacular.” Border agents are under a lot of pressure. Their gestures of humanity — a birthday cake, a soccer ball — tend to go unrecorded. Still, if you talk about bodies you are liable to see bodies: that is to say, people stripped of their humanity, their agonizing choices, their humble ambitions and their hopes. It is then easier to treat them with callous harshness, to forget what we Americans are and where we came from.When I walked back across the bridge, a United States passport control officer pored over my passport for several minutes: the Iranian visa, the Iraqi visa, the Chinese visa, the Indian visa. She asked what I do, whether I’d crossed the bridge before, why I’d entered Mexico. She was hostile.“This guy’s from The New York Times,” she said, turning to the agent next to her. “What should I do with him?”He looked me over. “Let him go,” he said. I thanked her for the warm welcome home. “Just doing my job,” she said.Trump’s rhetoric is not innocuous."
96,"EL PASO — Ahead of President Trump’s scheduled rally in this West Texas city aimed at building support for his proposed wall on the border with Mexico, people from across the ideological spectrum in El Paso had a message for him on Sunday: Don’t speak for us.“The president is just wrong about the wall and wrong about El Paso,” said Jon Barela, a lifelong Republican and chief executive of the Borderplex Alliance, an organization promoting economic development in a cross-border industrial hub with a combined population of more than 2.7 million, taking in the cities of El Paso, Ciudad Juárez and Las Cruces.Mr. Barela disputed Mr. Trump’s widely discredited assertion that border fencing had cut violent crime in El Paso, pointing to F.B.I. data showing that the city has ranked for decades among the safest urban areas its size in the United States — long before American authorities started building some fencing along the border about a decade ago.“As a fiscally conservative Republican, I just don’t understand how spending $25 billion on a wall with limited effectiveness is a good idea,” Mr. Barela said in an interview. “Mexico is an economic and strategic ally of the United States, and an antiquated effort to place a barrier between us just won’t work.”[This month, we’re launching a limited-run weekly newsletter about life on the border, far from the tug-of-war of Washington politics. Sign up here to receive the first issue of Crossing the Border when it launches.]Dee Margo, the Republican mayor of El Paso, voiced similar criticism of Mr. Trump’s description of El Paso, in his State of the Union address, as “one of the nation’s most dangerous cities” before the barrier went up on the border. Representative Veronica Escobar, a Democrat recently elected to Congress to represent El Paso, is asking Mr. Trump to apologize and meet with migrant families seeking asylum in the United States.The tension surrounding Mr. Trump’s planned visit to El Paso on Monday is revealing political fissures. A Democratic bastion in a state where Republicans have long wielded dominance in statewide politics, El Paso is also home to Beto O’Rourke, the former local congressman who is a star of the Democratic Party and a potential challenger to Mr. Trump in the 2020 presidential election.At the same time Mr. Trump is scheduled to speak before about 6,000 people at the El Paso County Coliseum, Mr. O’Rourke will speak at another rally a mile away. Mr. O’Rourke said in an essay on Medium that Mr. Trump “will promise a wall and will repeat his lies about the dangers that immigrants pose.”El Paso, where Hispanics account for about 80 percent of the population, was already hostile ground for Mr. Trump. In the 2016 election, he took only about 26 percent of the vote in El Paso County.[Read our latest story on Trump and Beto’s rallies in El Paso.]Still, the president shouldn’t have a problem filling the venue. Some of his supporters in the city remain eager to hear what Mr. Trump has to say.“I’d like to see a wall go up along the entire border,” said Joshua Ascencio, 21, a cavalry scout in the United States Army who has plans to become an agent with the Border Patrol when he leaves the military. Mr. Ascencio said he was looking forward to Mr. Trump’s rally.“I’m a supporter of the president and I think it’s important to be there for him,” said Mr. Ascencio. “I want to hear him on border security.”Still, for many others in this city of immigrants the mere idea of Mr. Trump coming to El Paso to promote his administration’s crackdown on immigration raises hackles.“The president of the United States is, disgracefully, nothing more than a racist,” said Mayra Cabral, 37, an immigrant who grew up across the border in Ciudad Juárez and now cleans tables at a restaurant in El Paso, where she has lived for the last 19 years after marrying an American citizen.Ms. Cabral laughed out loud when asked about Mr. Trump’s claims that Hispanic immigrants bring crime to the United States. She said that El Paso is normally so calm that it’s “boring here sometimes.” Ms. Cabral added that she and her family were not getting waylaid by talk of the president’s visit; on Saturday night, they hosted a quinceañera for her 15-year-old daughter attended by about 300 people.“I was able to do this for my daughter because I work at a job that people born in the United States won’t do,” Ms. Cabral said. “Trump likes to call us criminals, but what about all the Americans in the country who commit violent crimes? Why doesn’t he talk about them for once?”Mr. Trump appears to have homed in on El Paso after meeting with Republican officials from Texas in January in McAllen, a city affected by a large influx of migrant families traveling through the Rio Grande Valley. At that meeting, Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas told Mr. Trump that the construction of border fencing in El Paso caused crime to fall in the city.But while El Paso has long been relatively safer than other American cities its size, the violent crime rate in the city actually climbed briefly just before and in the two years after authorities installed fencing on the border as part of an effort to improve border security during the administration of George W. Bush.Mr. Paxton tried to back up his assertion that a border wall in El Paso had cut crime rates by referring to a “131-mile fence that was completed in 2010.” PolitiFact, the nonpartisan fact-checking website owned by the Poynter Institute, questioned Mr. Paxton’s claim, pointing out that while Texas does have 131 miles of fencing not all of it is even in El Paso.The contested assertions of a senior state official comes at a time of ratcheting tension in Texas over the treatment of Latino voters by Republican state officials, who in January called into question the citizenship status of nearly 100,000 voters. County officials found that the list of voters, which was referred to by Mr. Paxton in a campaign fund-raising email with the headline “VOTER FRAUD ALERT,” actually included scores of naturalized citizens.The Mexican American Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit this month against Mr. Paxton, Gov. Greg Abbott and Secretary of State David Whitley of Texas, arguing that they conspired to purge Latinos from voter rolls following a surge in turnout by Latino voters in the midterm elections.Governor Abbott and United States Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican who narrowly defeated Mr. O’Rourke to hold on to his seat in November, are among the Republican officials from around the state who are expected to attend the rally on Monday in support of Mr. Trump.But elsewhere along the border, there has been rising opposition among state and local officials to the president’s security strategies.[Read: Butterflies, Bulldozers and Barbed Wire Rally Border Wall Opponents]New Mexico’s governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, announced last week that she had ordered a partial withdrawal of National Guard troops from her state. “New Mexico will not take part in the president’s charade of border fear-mongering by misusing our diligent National Guard troops,” Ms. Grisham, a Democrat, said in a statement.Early Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California announced that his state, too, would withdraw National Guard troops sent earlier to help the federal government boost security at the border.In Nogales, Ariz., the City Council on Wednesday passed a resolution condemning the recent installation of new barbed wire along the existing border wall in that city, calling it an “indiscriminate use of lethal force” that is “typically only found in a war, battlefield or prison setting.”Gaining public support for the idea of a wall at an event such as the rally in El Paso will be important for Mr. Trump, as talks for a bipartisan agreement on border security appeared to have stalled on Sunday amid lingering disagreement over how much should be spent on a border barrier. President Trump, who initially proposed spending $25 billion on a wall, now is looking for $5.7 billion. Democratic lawmakers have talked about a figure closer to $1.3 billion to $2 billion.A second government shutdown could be in the works if no agreement is reached.Bob Giles, a car dealer from Lafayette, La., who is building a new Volvo dealership in El Paso, said that he understood how Mr. Trump’s proposed wall could seem like a good idea from an “outside perspective.”“But when you spend time in El Paso and talk to people, it’s clear they take offense that a wall made a difference in the city,” said Mr. Giles. While Mr. Trump often speaks of a crisis on the border, Mr. Giles said he hasn’t seen one.“That’s not the word I would choose,” he said. His own hope is to sell cars not just to Americans, but also to business executives from Juárez who have homes in El Paso. “This is an incredibly vibrant market with lots of construction going on,” he said. “It makes a difference when you see it with your own eyes.”"
97,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration proposed a rule on Wednesday night intended to prevent undocumented immigrants from receiving federal housing assistance, the latest step in its efforts to ramp up enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws.The proposal, according to an administration official, is intended to overturn what the official described as a Clinton-era loophole that allowed some undocumented immigrants to obtain public housing without revealing their citizenship status. The rule would ensure that the social safety net is awarded only to verified American citizens and legal residents.The long waiting lists for public housing prompted the crackdown, the official said, adding that the rule would affect about 25,000 households.The Department of Housing and Urban Development, which proposed the rule, would require expanded use of the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program, known as SAVE, a program administered by the Department of Homeland Security.SAVE is meant to help federal and local government agencies quickly verify a person’s immigration and citizenship status, and determine whether people are eligible for benefits. It was not immediately clear whether HUD was also targeting undocumented immigrants who might live in public housing with a spouse or a family member who is an American citizen.A spokesman for HUD, Raffi Williams, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security declined to comment.Julián Castro, the former housing secretary under President Barack Obama and a current Democratic presidential candidate, criticized the proposal.“Once again, the Trump administration is using the immigrant community as a punching bag to distract his base from his own political troubles,” he said. “The bottom line is that our government is terrorizing families — first with ICE raids, now with evictions.”The rule was delivered to Congress on Wednesday night for a 15-day review period. After that, there will be 60 days for public comment. If the rule goes into effect, undocumented immigrants living in public housing would not be immediately removed, the official said. They would be given up to 18 months, through three six-month waivers, to relocate.The move is not the first time the Trump administration has sought to crack down on immigrants using the public safety net. For months, Stephen Miller, one of President Trump’s top advisers and the architect of his immigration agenda, has pushed the administration to complete a new regulation that would penalize legal immigrants who rely on public benefits like Section 8 housing vouchers or food assistance. The regulation would give officials more power to declare an immigrant who uses welfare benefits to be a “public charge,” making him or her ineligible for permanent legal status.Like the administration’s other efforts to crack down on immigrants, the public housing rule also fits Mr. Trump’s message to his core supporters as he begins his 2020 re-election campaign.The president and his top political advisers believe that no issue better symbolizes their commitment to keeping the United States safe and prosperous than Mr. Trump’s pledge to rid the country of undocumented immigrants and drastically reduce the flow of legal immigrants into the country.In addition to a crackdown at the southwestern border, where Mr. Trump has sought to toughen asylum policies, the White House has freed immigration officers around the country to round up and deport undocumented immigrants, regardless of whether they have committed serious crimes.The administration has also moved to limit the highly skilled immigrants whom technology companies bring to the United States and to subject them to much tougher vetting. A recent proposal would also deny the spouses of such immigrants the ability to legally work in the country, a change that could lead many couples to leave.During the 2018 midterm elections, Mr. Trump campaigned on little else, to the dismay of some Republican lawmakers, who argued that the president should have focused more on the booming economy and the passage of a major tax cut during his first two years.But Mr. Miller and Mr. Trump have shown little interest in pulling back on the immigration agenda."
98,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]President Trump, who has frequently pointed to the violent MS-13 street gang to justify his immigration policy, could not have choreographed a better political talking point if he had tried. Two days before Tuesday’s State of the Union address, a deadly shooting on a Queens subway platform catapulted the gang’s brutality back onto the national stage.The police have said the man charged with the killing, Ramiro Gutierrez, is a member of MS-13, a transnational gang founded in Los Angeles with ties to El Salvador. The slaying featured prominently in Mr. Trump’s address.Mr. Gutierrez, 26, was in the country without documentation and had a long arrest record, the authorities said. He is accused of firing six shots at close range into a rival gang member’s head in front of horrified straphangers. At the time, Mr. Gutierrez was out on $2,500 bail after being arrested in a gang takedown last December.But missing from Mr. Trump’s speech was an important nuance: The shooting does not signal a recent rise of the gang in Queens, experts said. Neither MS-13, nor its rival, the 18th Street gang, is new to New York City. They have been a violent presence in the city for two decades, despite repeated prosecutions, and the shooting on Sunday was just the latest incident in a complicated history between the two gangs.Around 12:45 p.m. on Sunday, a fight broke out between four men on a Manhattan-bound 7 train. When the train pulled into the 90th Street-Elmhurst Avenue Station, the brawl spilled out onto the platform.In a bystander’s video, a man the police later identified as Mr. Gutierrez is shown extricating himself from the melee and standing up, grasping what appears to be a small revolver. Mr. Gutierrez, who is from El Salvador, can then be seen pointing the gun at a man on the ground wearing a Mets jersey — later identified as Abel Mosso.Six shots rang out, as bystanders screamed and ran for cover on the stalled train. Mr. Mosso was struck several times in the face and died on the platform. The police arrested Mr. Gutierrez on Monday on charges of murder and gang assault.Mr. Mosso, a Mexican citizen, was a purported member of the 18th Street Gang. Both men, according to immigration officials, were in the United States without documentation.Though both gangs began in Southern California in the mid-1980s and quickly became archrivals, MS-13 and 18th Street had established a presence in eastern Queens, and neighboring Nassau and Suffolk Counties by the mid-1990s.Lou Savelli, a former sergeant and head of the Police Department’s first citywide gang unit, said MS-13 and 18th Street have been active in New York City and the surrounding region ever since. Mr. Savelli, who retired from the department in 2004, first encountered MS-13 while working gang cases in the 109th precinct in Flushing.During MS-13’s early years in New York, the gang would sometimes be targeted by the squad for acts of violence, he said. “We did some short-term things on machete cases where they chopped up one guy, shot and killed another guy, and another case where they ran an auto-theft ring,” Mr. Savelli said.The rival 18th Street gang was less organized, Mr. Savelli said.Raphael Ramos, a former sergeant in the Queens gang squad, said the 18th Street gang controls the lucrative trade in forged documents along Roosevelt Avenue between 90th Street and 82nd Street.“Historically, that’s been their territory, and they’re known as M-18,” Mr. Ramos said.The Queens district attorney and the United States attorney’s office in Brooklyn have filed dozens of criminal cases against MS-13 members over the past decade, with charges including racketeering, conspiracy, murder, fraud and robbery.Aided by statements like Mr. Trump’s in his State of the Union address, MS-13 has achieved an almost mythic level of infamy in the world of street gangs. Their notoriously gruesome killings — members have been known to cut the hearts out of victims or hack people to death with machetes — began surfacing in New York and Long Island as far back as the mid-1990s.The gang has plagued Long Island and Queens in recent years with a series of brutal slayings. In 2016, the gang killed two teenage girls in Brentwood — Nisa Mickens, 15, and her best friend Kayla Cuevas, 16 — in a case that drew national attention and landed the victims’ parents an invitation to Mr. Trump’s first State of the Union address.Last summer, 15-year-old Angel Soler was found in a Long Island field, hacked to death by a machete, a murder law enforcement officials attributed to MS-13. And in December, a 23-year-old man was found dead in a Queens bird sanctuary after MS-13 members lured him there, prosecutors said.Beyond murder and assault, the MS-13 gang has also been linked to drug and gun trafficking, as well as extortion and racketeering schemes; the 18th Street gang is better known for prostitution, protection rackets and selling forged documents.Still, the gangs exist in pockets of the city, and the violence they generate is seldom random, law enforcement officials said. Often, it involves turf wars and other immigrants. Other gangs — the Bloods, the Crips, the Latin Kings, the Trinitarios — are a higher priority for the New York Police Department.“I wouldn’t put them at the top of the pecking order of what we see day in and day out,” said Chief Dermot Shea, who runs the department’s detective bureau.It took years for law enforcement to sketch out MS-13’s inner workings, and to recognize its hierarchy. It was far more organized than most street gangs, almost akin to the Mafia, prosecutors said.That learning curve helped MS-13 survive.“The guys who get caught with the gun at the murder scene, they’re going to be replaced,” said James Trusty, a former prosecutor who led the Justice Department’s Organized Crime Division. “The only way you’re going to actually dent the organization as a whole has got to be holistic.”As MS-13 established its foothold in the mid-2000s, approaches to crackdowns varied between the three major American metropolises where the gang existed — New York, Los Angeles and Washington.Prosecutors in Los Angeles and outside the capital built complicated conspiracy cases, taking out MS-13 leaders, but in New York prosecutors favored striking fast, arresting two or three people at a time after murders and robberies.Long Island prosecutors changed their tactics after a spike in MS-13 violence in 2016 and 2017 led to at least 22 killings. Madeline Singas, the Nassau district attorney, indicted 17 MS-13 members in January 2018, including the man believed to be the highest-ranking member in the Northeast.“It’s tough for the organization to bounce back from that,” Ms. Singas said.Still, Ms. Singas said she does not believe that Long Island’s crackdown pushed the gang west into Queens.“They were in Queens before, too,” she said. “It’s not like they moved there because Nassau became inhospitable to them.”"
99,"LONDON — Ordering landlords to check prospective tenants’ immigration status leads to racial discrimination and breaches human rights, Britain’s High Court has ruled, in a judgment that deals a blow to migration control measures championed by Prime Minister Theresa May.The mandatory checks are one plank in what has become known as the government’s “hostile environment” policy, which aims to force people in the country illegally to leave by blocking their access to jobs, bank accounts and free medical care, among other things.The policy has been criticized as imposing heavy burdens on legal immigrants and British citizens who are not white but are obliged to prove their status repeatedly. It has brought particularly harsh consequences for the “Windrush generation” of migrants encouraged to move from the Caribbean after World War II to help with Britain’s reconstruction, many of whom never had — or previously needed — the sort of documents demanded.Landlords said the mandatory checks made them “unwilling border police” and discouraged them from renting to anyone whose migration status might not be straightforward.The judgment does not strike down the 2014 legislation that imposed document checks on tenants in England. But it asks Parliament to reconsider how the law is applied and blocks plans to extend the checks to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.A report commissioned by the Residential Landlords Association — which backed the legal challenge brought by an immigrant rights group and decided by the High Court on Friday — found that close to half of landlords were less likely to rent to someone without a British passport.“The measures have a disproportionately discriminatory effect,” Justice Martin Spencer said in his judgment. Even if the checks had been shown to be effective in controlling migration, he added, he “would have found that this was significantly outweighed by the discriminatory effect.”Evidence submitted to the court showed that the government had failed to measure whether the checks resulted in discrimination, or even whether they helped detect and remove people who were in the country illegally.According to the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, forced removals and voluntary departures from Britain have declined since 2013.“The net has been cast too wide and the effect of the scheme has been to cause landlords to commit nationality and/or race discrimination against those who are perfectly entitled to rent, with the result that they are less able to find homes than (white) British citizens,” the judge said, citing claims from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which brought the case to court.Mrs. May, who was Britain’s home secretary for six years before becoming prime minister in 2016, has been closely identified with moves to tighten the country’s migration policies. She promised to create “a really hostile environment” for illegal immigration in a 2012 interview with The Daily Telegraph, although her government now prefers to speak of a “compliant environment.”Measures to achieve that included a poster campaign, with billboards driven on vans across London’s suburbs in the summer of 2013, urging those in the country illegally to “Go home or face arrest.”The billboards drew widespread criticism and quickly disappeared. But they were followed by the legislation mandating document checks at many key points in daily life, a cultural shift for Britain, which has no mandatory identity card system, unlike many European countries, and has long considered its relative lack of official paperwork a point of national pride.Criticism of the measures reached a peak last year, when the government had to apologize to Windrush migrants — the name refers to the Empire Windrush, the liner that brought the first large postwar group of arrivals from the West Indies — who had lived legally in Britain for decades but lost their jobs, were denied medical care and even faced the threat of deportation.Friday’s judgment was “another nail in the coffin for the government’s misguided, discriminatory and unworkable hostile environment policy,” Lara ten Caten, a solicitor with Liberty, a group that campaigns for civil liberties and supported the court challenge, told the BBC.“While effective immigration control is a legitimate aim for any government, the Home Office must stop outsourcing its discriminatory policies to third parties who are ill-equipped to enforce them but may be slapped with heavy fines and even end up in prison if they don’t,” she added.The Residential Landlords Association called on the government to scrap the checks and stop relying on landlords to “do the job of the Home Office.”“We have warned all along that turning landlords into untrained and unwilling border police would lead to the exact form of discrimination the court has found,” it said in a statement on Friday.In an emailed statement, the Home Office said it was disappointed with the judgment and that it had been granted permission to appeal.“In the meantime, we are giving careful consideration to the judge’s comments,” the statement said."
100,"Malta said Saturday that four European Union nations would accept 64 migrants rescued at sea off Libya 10 days ago.In a statement, Malta’s government said that the migrants will be sent to Germany, France, Portugal and Luxembourg. The migrants are being transferred to Maltese vessels and brought to port after days of uncertainty.However, Malta said the German-flagged aid ship, named Alan Kurdi after a young Syrian boy who drowned during the crossing from Turkey to Greece in 2015, will not be allowed to enter its ports, and none of the migrants will remain in Malta.“Once again, the smallest member of the European Union was put under unnecessary pressure, being asked to resolve a case which was neither its responsibility nor its remit,” the government said. “A solution was found in order not to let the situation deteriorate further while making it clear Malta cannot keep shouldering this burden.”The transfer of migrants from the Alan Kurdi to Maltese Army boats was conducted at sea and the Maltese Army was expected to return to dock by Saturday afternoon.Malta has argued it cannot open its ports to humanitarian rescue ships because their activities off Libya encourage human traffickers.The German NGO Sea-Eye had detailed worsening conditions aboard the ship for the 64 migrants. Two have been evacuated in recent days because of health issues. On Friday night, a member of the ship’s crew was also airlifted off the vessel. In recent days, Sea-Eye had documented the deteriorating conditions on the ship, posting video on social media of dozens of people, including women and children, sleeping on a cramped deck.The organization criticized the decision from Malta to block the ship from entering port while the negotiations over the fate of the migrants onboard were underway.“It is simply unexplainable why it was necessary for people to stay on board during the long negotiations, while governments negotiated over 64 individual fates,” Gorden Isler, the chairman of Sea-Eye said in a statement. “What about the pressure that has been put on our crew and 64 rescued people for 11 days?”Italy’s Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who has repeatedly rejected calls to allow the ship to enter Italian ports, hailed the deal.“Excellent news!” he tweeted, soon after the deal was announced. He praised Malta for “doing the right thing by denouncing the dangerous and undue pressures exerted by the NGOs.”"
101,"To the Editor:Re “Trump the Punisher” (Editorial Observer, April 3):Michelle Cottle’s description of President Trump as a “punisher” does not capture the essence.No one hates as effectively as President Trump. It is his gift. The question is why his gift for hatred is so appealing to so many. The answer lies in how many Americans identify with his “black or white,” “all or none,” “the ends justify the means” way of thinking. It can be extremely tempting to ally with someone who intensely guarantees a black or white solution to a complex and perplexing problem. Mr. Trump may be the master of such a mode of hateful thinking, but he is not a rarity, just a more skilled salesman. His method of hating particularly galvanizes people who feel victimized. It places responsibility for problems upon the vilified and hated “other.”The more desperate somebody feels and the more victimized he may feel, the more enticing the temptation to hate. The desire to punish is just one expression. One antidote is to comprehend and tolerate complexity. Appreciating this requires sensitivity and self-knowledge, not hatred, binary thinking and overreaction.Davis A. SuskindSan Diego"
102,"WASHINGTON — William P. Barr, President Trump’s nominee for attorney general, promised on Monday that he would allow the special counsel to continue his investigation, seeking to allay Democrats’ fears that he might shut down the inquiry.“It is in the best interest of everyone — the president, Congress, and, most importantly, the American people — that this matter be resolved by allowing the special counsel to complete his work,” Mr. Barr said in written testimony that he plans to deliver on Tuesday at the start of his two-day confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.“The country needs a credible resolution of these issues,” he added. “If confirmed, I will not permit partisan politics, personal interests, or any other improper consideration to interfere with this or any other investigation.”But Mr. Barr’s written statement also included a subtle caveat, limiting his assurances about the investigation to issues under his control: “I can assure you that, where judgments are to be made by me, I will make those judgments based solely on the law and will let no personal, political, or other improper interests influence my decision,” he wrote.That qualification could be important because Mr. Barr has long advanced a philosophy of strong executive powers under which almost any executive branch decision is ultimately the president’s to make and the president is the nation’s top law-enforcement official, not the attorney general.After Mr. Barr was nominated last month, an unsolicited memo emerged that he had sent to Justice Department officials and the president’s lawyers last year criticizing a focus of the inquiry: whether the president obstructed justice by firing James B. Comey as F.B.I. director in a possible effort to impede the inquiry itself.“Obviously, the president and any other official can commit obstruction in this classic sense of sabotaging a proceeding’s truth-finding function,” Mr. Barr wrote, noting that the president is not exempt from the law.The memo prompted concerns among congressional Democrats that Mr. Barr might stop the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, if Mr. Trump ordered him to do so. The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the leading Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, have called on Mr. Trump in recent days to rescind Mr. Barr’s nomination, saying that his memo disqualifies him to lead the department.In his planned remarks, Mr. Barr said that his memo addressed only the single obstruction-of-justice issue and that he did not argue that a president can never obstruct justice.“The memo did not address — or in any way question — the special counsel’s core investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election,” Mr. Barr planned to say. “I wrote it myself, on my own initiative, without assistance, and based solely on public information.”In his prepared testimony, Mr. Barr also said he would follow the rules governing Mr. Mueller’s appointment and work to allow him to finish the investigation into Russia’s 2016 election interference and whether any Trump associates conspired with it.“I will follow the special counsel regulations scrupulously and in good faith, and on my watch, Bob will be allowed to complete his work,” Mr. Barr planned to say, according to the prepared remarks.Nonetheless, senators still plan to press Mr. Barr about the memo. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the leading Democrat on the Judiciary committee, said in a letter to Mr. Barr that she plans to ask him why he wrote the memo, who he conferred with in writing it, and exactly who he shared it with.Mr. Barr also said that he would provide as much information to the public as the law allowed about the results of the inquiry.Noting that they worked together at the Justice Department under President George Bush, Mr. Barr planned to say that he has known and respected Mr. Mueller as a colleague and friend for 30 years and that he had confidence that Mr. Mueller would handle the special counsel inquiry properly.Mr. Barr said in his prepared testimony that he reluctantly accepted the nomination out of a sense of civic duty, and that Mr. Trump “has sought no assurances, promises, or commitments from me of any kind, either express or implied.”In a letter of support for Mr. Barr’s nomination, former Justice Department officials including former Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey and James M. Cole, an Obama administration deputy attorney general, wrote that Mr. Barr, who was attorney general under Mr. Bush, served without “regard to favor or politics.”Mr. Barr will lay out his other priorities at the hearing including clamping down on illegal immigration and ensuring the integrity of elections, according to his prepared remarks. “The attorney general must ensure that the administration of justice — the enforcement of the law — is above and away from politics,” Mr. Barr planned to say."
103,"PALM BEACH, Fla. — Behind the clipped hedges of President Trump’s sumptuous private clubs in South Florida, including his Mar-a-Lago estate where he has spent many getaway weekends, there has long been a built-in contradiction to the policy the president has repeatedly described as “America First.”Many of his employees have foreign passports.Romanians serve dinner in lavish banquet halls. South Africans tend to guests at the spa. Britons bake elegant pastries. Most are young people hired as guest workers on special visas, living over the winter high season in a gated community with a sand volleyball pit and a movie theater. In the mornings, they dress in trim uniforms and are chauffeured by van over a bridge to the luxury compound six miles away in Palm Beach.But that’s only part of the Trump resort work force in South Florida.Alongside the foreign guest workers and the sizable American staff is another category of employees, mostly those who work on the pair of lush golf courses near Mar-a-Lago. Not offered apartments, they have been picked up by Trump contractors from groups of undocumented laborers at the side of the road; hired through staffing companies that assume responsibility for checking their immigration status; or brought onto the payroll with little apparent scrutiny of their Social Security cards and green cards, some of which are fake.That second pool of immigrant labor is an embarrassing reality for a president who has railed against undocumented immigrants, one his company is scrambling to erase.Mr. Trump has long acknowledged that running the hospitality industry on a tight supply of American labor is extraordinarily difficult — the reason Mar-a-Lago has frequently turned to legal guest workers for jobs that typically span only, in the case of Florida, the pleasant winter months. “It’s very, very hard to get people,” he explained during the 2016 campaign. “But other hotels do the exact same thing.”In the case of the Trump Organization, the hiring of some immigrant labor may be about to change: Facing growing questions about its employment of undocumented workers, the company has quietly begun to take steps to eliminate any remaining undocumented workers from its labor pool in South Florida.In March, seven veteran maintenance workers at Trump National Jupiter, the golf club 18 miles north of Mar-a-Lago that Mr. Trump bought in 2012, were informed that the work force was being reorganized. Workers had until March 22 to provide proof that they were legally eligible to work in the United States, they were told.One by one, the workers — from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico — began to depart. Only one of the seven was a legal resident.“They got rid of me after so many years of hard work because I don’t have papers,” said Doroteo Hernández, 42, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who worked for 10 years on the maintenance crew at Jupiter, one of Mr. Trump’s favorite golfing spots on his weekends at Mar-a-Lago.Mr. Hernández, a diminutive man with a weather-beaten face and workman’s hands, said that in late March he handed over 11 well-worn, button-down shirts embroidered with his name and the name of the club, 11 pairs of khakis and a club cap to his supervisor, who praised him and gave him a farewell hug.“I’m battling on,” said Mr. Hernández, who supports his parents and siblings in Mexico. “Everyone just wants to take care of their family.”Similar scenes have played out at a number of Trump Organization golf properties since The New York Times first reported that two undocumented housekeepers had for several years worked in proximity to Mr. Trump at his golf property in Bedminster, N.J. Additional laborers working without legal authorization came forward at other Trump golf properties, some of them deliberately kept off the lists of workers vetted by the Secret Service.The undocumented workers raise questions not only about the Trump Organization’s hiring practices, but also about security at Mar-a-Lago and the luxurious golf properties that surround it — recently subject to scrutiny after a woman carrying two Chinese passports and a thumb drive containing malicious software was detained on March 30 at Mar-a-Lago.Though maintenance workers, drivers and painters from Mexico and Central America would not normally be thought of as security threats, the presence of workers with fraudulent identity documents poses additional complications in vetting those who may be in proximity to the president at his leisure properties in Florida and elsewhere.In Palm Beach County, home to dozens of hotels, golf resorts and residential communities, there is a steady demand for menial labor, some of it performed by foreigners who come in on H-2B guest worker visas. The Trump Florida properties requested 148 of these immigrant workers for the 2018-19 season, an increase over most past years. This is one area of immigration that the Trump administration has pushed to expand.Meanwhile, across the county, immigrant enclaves have grown in the shadows of multimillion-dollar homes — places where the streets are lined with much humbler homes, butcher shops called carnicerías, and money-order offices where on Fridays immigrants wire money home to relatives. Unlike those living in the gated complex, the immigrants here are mainly Central American, Mexican and Haitian.A number of staffing company offices — discreet, sometimes with mirrored glass windows — are tucked into strip malls. Here, workers can submit applications to be placed on job sites, sometimes the same day.Staffing companies were originally intended to serve as external human resource departments, supplying temporary workers and handling their paperwork, according to Richard Celler, an employment lawyer in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. But now, Mr. Celler said, “it’s morphed.” He said employers had come to run their regular workers through the companies to cut the cost of workers’ compensation insurance and to narrow their liability.“It’s the outsourcing of labor,” he said.There is another important advantage.Greg Schell, a lawyer based in Lake Worth, Fla., who represents farmworkers and other migrant workers, said that as employers have faced increased scrutiny from federal authorities over hiring undocumented labor, they have turned to staffing companies, some of which engage in careful immigration verification, some of which do not. These companies enable many Florida farms and golf resorts, which can have difficulty finding legal workers, to maintain large work crews without assuming legal responsibility for their immigration status, Mr. Schell said.“The whole concept is to have someone else bear the responsibility,” he said.Not long ago, groundskeepers and golf maintenance workers were directly employed at the Trump properties in Florida and frequently moved between them, according to former employees. However, in recent years, the organization transferred the work crews at Mar-a-Lago and nearby golf courses over to Barnett Management, a staffing company with headquarters in West Palm Beach that specializes in supplying golf maintenance, landscaping, farm and nursery workers, as well as setup staff for events and banquets.In late February, Jeff Payer, the Jupiter club’s golf course superintendent, called in Mr. Hernández and the six other maintenance workers who were still on the payroll of another staffing company, Ryvor Golf, the immigrant workers said. Mr. Payer informed them that they would be transferred to Barnett, which was already handling the majority of the club’s roughly three dozen golf maintenance workers and groundskeepers, they said.“He told us, ‘You can keep working, we trust you and know your work,’” recalled Roberto Carlos Méndez, 29, a Guatemalan. Mr. Payer declined to be interviewed and did not respond to questions.But in early March, several of the former workers said, a Barnett representative who visited the club said they could not stay on, telling them that only workers with legal immigration papers would be allowed to transfer to Barnett’s payroll.“I spoke personally to the Barnett guy. He told me that, unfortunately, I didn’t qualify to stay at the club,” said Mr. Méndez, who had worked at the Jupiter property since sneaking across the border nearly four years ago.In separate interviews, five of the workers offered the same account. All said they were in the country illegally and had been hired despite having phony identification cards and Social Security numbers and as recently as two-and-a-half years ago, during the 2016 presidential campaign. Florida law does not require employers to use the E-Verify electronic verification system to check employees’ documents, though some companies, including Barnett, use it voluntarily.No one from the management at the Jupiter club, or at any of the Florida Trump properties, responded to interview requests for this article, nor did officials from the Trump Organization. But none of the immigrants doubted that club managers were aware all along that they were undocumented, and were disappointed to see them go.“They knew immigrants working there are here illegally,” said Giovanni Velásquez, a 23-year-old from Guatemala who said he had been allowed to continue working as long as he did because he was needed. “The know-how that I have, the work I do, can’t be easily replaced. No American wants to do it.”Mr. Méndez said that he spent 10 minutes with the Barnett representative trying to ascertain why the Ryvor workers were being let go while workers already on Barnett’s payroll, some of whom he believed were also undocumented, were untouched.“I told him, ‘I don’t understand,’” he said. “He responded that going forward, they will not take people without papers.”This transition to a greater reliance on staffing companies appeared to begin around 2016, former workers said, though it is not clear if there was any connection to Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign.Barnett officials declined to discuss the recent staff moves at Jupiter, or any other matters. “Barnett Management complies with all federal laws and regulations with respect to the hiring of employees,” Corey Witzel, the general counsel for Barnett’s parent company, MVP Staffing, said in an email.In addition to the workers who recently lost their jobs at the Jupiter club, around a dozen other undocumented workers at local pickup spots and a resource center for day laborers told The Times that they had worked stints at the golf club, brought in by contractors to install irrigation plumbing, spray insecticide and paint houses. One of them said he had worked there for years.A man who gave only his first name, Santos, 31, said that “they give us a permisito” — a pass — “so we could go in.” He said he had worked nearly three years painting houses at the golf club starting in 2012.A 24-year-old who also gave only his first name, Alfonso, said that he, too, worked at the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter as part of a painting crew, and was allowed to continue there even after Mr. Trump became president. “Nothing changed with the election,” he said.As the deadline approached for the undocumented maintenance workers at the Jupiter club to leave their jobs, many pondered their futures. Mr. Méndez, one of the Guatemalan immigrants, said that he was offered maintenance work at other golf clubs, but for less than the $11 hourly wage he made at Jupiter. “If we take a job at a golf club for less, we are moving backward instead of advancing,” he said.Daniel Federico Gómez, 23, said he had not found a job, either, though he had started to train the replacements who would be taking the workers’ places at Jupiter.Two days before the March 22 deadline, Mr. Gómez and Mr. Méndez were the last of the undocumented group still on the job.Mr. Velásquez had found work at an Italian restaurant washing dishes for $10 an hour. “I have to start all over,” he said. “All my experience is on the golf course.”As for Mr. Hernández, a friend found him a landscaping job. Sitting in his neat apartment after his second day of work, he was still not sure about his salary. Mr. Payer, the golf superintendent, had found work for him and his co-workers at another golf course, Mr. Hernández said, but it was too far away for someone like him, who cannot obtain a Florida driver’s license because he has no proof of legal residence.On his last day at Jupiter, he returned every part of his tattered Trump uniform. “They cannot say I took a single thing that didn’t belong to me,” he said.His boss, however, had insisted he keep the cap with the club logo."

105,"On Sunday evening, news broke that Kirstjen Nielsen was leaving her job as head of the Department of Homeland Security. The New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman tweeted that according to people close to Nielsen, one reason she hung on as long as she did was because “she was aware how awful life would/will be for her on the outside,” given her role in defending Donald Trump’s policies.Let’s make it so.Nielsen did not create Trump’s monstrous policy of separating migrant families, but she should be known forever as the person who carried it out. She put babies in cages, traumatized children for life, and then appears to have lied to Congress about what she had done. She did this evil work with either blithe incompetence or malicious sloppiness, failing to create a system to properly track kids who were ripped from their families. On Friday, the Trump administration said it could take up to two years to identify thousands of separated migrant children.[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] Now Trump is gearing up to do it again. According to NBC News, for months the president has “urged his administration to reinstate large-scale separation of migrant families crossing the border.” Nielsen reportedly resisted, citing court rulings and Trump’s own 2018 executive order ending his administration’s family separation policy. Trump’s choice for acting homeland security secretary, Kevin McAleenan, apparently is more open to the idea.Should this happen, Congress and some judges will try to intervene. But Trump is growing ever more lawless and autocratic. “There is a near-systematic purge happening at the nation’s second-largest national security agency,” a senior administration official told CNN on Monday, speaking of D.H.S. The president is filling positions with acting officials, circumventing Senate confirmation. Some senior members of the administration, like Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, are flatly refusing to cooperate with congressional oversight. CNN reported that Trump told border agents to ignore judges when taking steps to keep migrants out. We should not assume that government institutions will restrain the president before he visits anguish and terror on thousands more of the world’s most vulnerable children.What happens to Nielsen now can serve as an example to other people in the administration as they decide whether to just follow orders. By this, I don’t mean that people should scream at Nielsen in restaurants. Rather, those horrified by family separation should do whatever they can to deny Nielsen the sort of cushy corporate landing or prestigious academic appointment once customary for ex-administration officials. The fact that she evidently didn’t go as far as an erratic and out-of-control Trump wanted is immaterial; she should be a pariah for going as far as she did.Coincidentally, the day before Nielsen resigned, a coalition of progressive groups signed on to a petition asking corporate America to blacklist senior people in the Trump administration, including Nielsen, who took part in crafting, enacting or defending family separation. “Allowing her to seek refuge in a corporate corner office or a boardroom, university, speaking agency or elsewhere poses a significant reputational risk for those involved,” said Karl Frisch, a spokesman for Restore Public Trust, the group organizing the campaign.How much of a risk will depend on decent Trump-hating Americans. The Resistance has been flagging recently, even if abhorrence of Trump’s degenerate administration has not. Many people, having worked frantically to deliver the House to Democrats in the midterms, are exhausted. The crackup of the Women’s March, and the resulting tensions between some black and Jewish activists, has been deeply dispiriting. The beginning of the Democratic presidential primary has reanimated old intra-left animosities. And relentless outrage is hard to sustain, no matter how justified.But with the possible return of family separation, the Resistance needs to regroup, and demanding a boycott of Trump officials tainted by baby-snatching is a good place to begin. Such a boycott would take advantage of one of the central asymmetries in American life. Rural voters, who tend to be conservative, have disproportionate political power; it’s why Trump, who lost the popular vote, is president in the first place. But cosmopolitan progressives have disproportionate economic and cultural power, which is why we have the faintly absurd phenomenon of woke capitalism. That power should be deployed to force the sort of accountability Nielsen reportedly fears, and to serve as a warning to others that the Trump stink never washes off.On Monday, Henry Farrell, a professor at George Washington University, wrote that he will boycott any university or think tank that employs Nielsen, and refuse to be on panels with anyone from such an institution. He invited others to join him. It’s a small start, but a start. Nielsen should not be permitted to launder her reputation through a fellowship at Harvard, like Corey Lewandowski or Sean Spicer did. She should not get to follow H.R. McMaster to Stanford.There are plenty of places that will hire a disgraced child-torturer — private prisons, which often hold undocumented immigrants, are a big business. And Henry Kissinger’s storied social life shows that America’s elite is far from inhospitable to ghouls. But as the country hurtles into a dangerous new phase of unbound Trumpism, those who want to say no need to muster whatever leverage they can, including public shame and economic sanctions. Either the leaders of corporate America and academia want to be associated with terrorizing toddlers, or not."
106,"WASHINGTON — Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, resigned on Sunday after meeting with President Trump, ending a tumultuous tenure in charge of the border security agency that had made her the target of the president’s criticism.“I have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside,” Ms. Nielsen said in a resignation letter. “I hope that the next secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America’s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation’s discourse.”Ms. Nielsen had requested the meeting to plan “a way forward” at the border, in part thinking she could have a reasoned conversation with Mr. Trump about the role, according to three people familiar with the meeting. She came prepared with a list of things that needed to change to improve the relationship with the president.Mr. Trump in recent weeks had asked Ms. Nielsen to close the ports of entry along the border and to stop accepting asylum seekers, which Ms. Nielsen found ineffective and inappropriate. While the 30-minute meeting was cordial, Mr. Trump was determined to ask for her resignation. After the meeting, she submitted it.The move comes just two days after Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly expressed anger at a rise in migrants at the southwestern border, withdrew his nominee to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement because he wanted the agency to go in a “tougher” direction.Mr. Trump has ratcheted up his anti-immigration message in recent months as he seeks to galvanize supporters before the 2020 election, shutting down the government and then declaring a national emergency to secure funding to build a border wall, cutting aid to Central American countries and repeatedly denouncing what he believes is a crisis of migrants trying to enter the country.He took aim again Sunday night after announcing Ms. Nielsen’s departure, tweeting, “Our Country is FULL!”Ms. Nielsen said she planned “to stay on as secretary through Wednesday” in order “to assist with an orderly transition.” The abruptness was unusual because the Department of Homeland Security currently does not have a deputy secretary, who would normally take the reins.The president said in a tweet that Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, would take over as the acting replacement for Ms. Nielsen, who became the sixth secretary to lead the agency in late 2017. But by law, the under secretary for management, Claire Grady, who is currently serving as acting deputy secretary, is next in line to be acting secretary. The White House will have to fire her to make Mr. McAleenan acting secretary, people familiar with the transition said. Ms. Grady has told colleagues that she has no intention of resigning to make way for Mr. McAleenan.[Read about Kevin McAleenan, the new acting homeland security secretary.]Among the possible replacements for Ms. Nielsen in the long term is Ken Cuccinelli, the former Virginia attorney general who is a favorite among conservative activists and who fits the profile that Mr. Trump wants the next homeland secretary to have, people familiar with the discussions said.Ms. Nielsen had been pressured by Mr. Trump to be more aggressive in stemming the influx of migrant crossings at the border, people familiar with their discussions in recent months said.Her entire time in the job was spent batting back suspicion from the president, even as he told people he liked how she performed on television and enjoyed dealing with her personally. He initially was skeptical because of Ms. Nielsen’s previous service in the George W. Bush administration, and then because she was close to John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump’s former chief of staff.The president called Ms. Nielsen at home early in the mornings to demand that she take action to stop migrants from entering the country, including doing things that were clearly illegal, such as blocking all migrants from seeking asylum. She repeatedly noted the limitations imposed on her department by federal laws, court settlements and international obligations.Those responses only infuriated Mr. Trump further. The president’s fury erupted in the spring of 2018 as Ms. Nielsen hesitated for weeks about whether to sign a memo ordering the routine separation of migrant children from their families so that the parents could be detained.In a cabinet meeting surrounded by her peers, Mr. Trump castigated her repeatedly, leading her to draft a resignation letter and to tell colleagues that there was no reason for her to lead the department any longer. By the end of the week, she had reconsidered and remained in her position, becoming an increasingly fierce supporter of his policies, including the family separations.Mr. Trump and Stephen Miller, the president’s top immigration adviser, have privately but regularly complained about Ms. Nielsen. Lou Dobbs, a Fox News host who is one of the president’s favorite sounding boards, has also encouraged Mr. Trump’s negative views of her handling of the migrant crisis.Ms. Nielsen lost a powerful protector when Mr. Kelly, her mentor, left his job as White House chief of staff at the beginning of the year. Mr. Kelly was the Trump administration’s first homeland security secretary and lobbied for Ms. Nielsen to replace him.Multiple White House officials said she had grown deeply paranoid in recent months, after numerous stories about her job being on the line. She also had supported the Immigration and Customs Enforcement nominee Mr. Trump withdrew, Ronald D. Vitiello, and her support for him was described as problematic for her with the president. Mr. Trump felt Mr. Vitiello did not favor closing the border, as the president threatened again to do in a tweet on Sunday night.In early 2019, as the number of migrant families from Central American countries surged, the president’s fury at Ms. Nielsen did, too. He repeatedly demanded that she cut off foreign aid to Central American countries even though the funding was the responsibility of the State Department. She repeatedly deflected his demands.One day after Ms. Nielsen traveled to Honduras to sign a regional compact with officials from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, Mr. Trump cut State Department funding for the countries. And in recent days, the president made public moves to undercut her authority, leaking news that he might nominate an “immigration czar” to assume oversight of the issue at the heart of Ms. Nielsen’s department.Still, Ms. Nielsen embraced the president’s “crisis” language as apprehensions of migrants at the border shot up to thousands per day. On Friday, Mr. Trump traveled with Ms. Nielsen and Mr. McAleenan to Calexico, Calif., to highlight the issue.While the number of border crossings is not as high as in the early 2000s, the demographic of migrants has shifted largely from individual Mexicans looking for jobs — who could easily be deported — to Central American families, overwhelming detention facilities and prompting mass releases of migrants into cities along the border.Ms. Nielsen estimated last month that border officials had stopped as many as 100,000 migrants in March.But despite the trip and several stories about how much better her relationship with Mr. Trump was, Ms. Nielsen never learned how to manage him, people familiar with their discussions said. He often felt lectured to by Ms. Nielsen, the people familiar with the discussions said.And his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was not an admirer of Ms. Nielsen, several administration officials said. That came to a head recently as Mr. Kushner had inserted himself into immigration discussions.While Mr. Trump often blamed Ms. Nielsen for the surge in migrant crossings, she will be remembered for leading the department during the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy along the southwestern border, which initially resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant children from their families.An intense backlash ensued, and the Department of Homeland Security was unprepared to deal with separating nearly 3,000 children from their parents.“Hampered by misstep after misstep, Kirstjen Nielsen’s tenure at the Department of Homeland Security was a disaster from the start,” said Representative Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat and the chairman of the House’s committee on Homeland Security. “It is clearer now than ever that the Trump administration’s border security and immigration policies — that she enacted and helped craft — have been an abysmal failure and have helped create the humanitarian crisis at the border.”Mr. Trump eventually moved to halt the family separations, though the government struggled in some cases to reunite those it had already separated.By naming Mr. McAleenan acting secretary, Mr. Trump is installing another veteran of previous administrations, not a loyal foot soldier of Mr. Trump’s campaign.Married to a Salvadoran immigrant, Mr. McAleenan is a lawyer who wrote an honors thesis at Amherst College on marriage equality and applied at the F.B.I. after the Sept. 11 attacks.Described by colleagues as a savvy political operator, Mr. McAleenan worked cooperatively with Obama administration officials but later embraced Mr. Trump’s agenda, which included unshackling Border Patrol agents from restrictions that the previous administration had imposed.Mr. McAleenan was also one of three Department of Homeland Security officials who had urged Ms. Nielsen to sign the memo authorizing the routine separation of migrant families at the border.The department, which has a budget of more than $40 billion and more than 240,000 employees, is an amalgam of 22 government agencies that was created after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. It is responsible for everything from protecting the nation from cyberattacks to responding to natural disasters.At 46, Ms. Nielsen was the youngest person to lead the sprawling department, and an unlikely choice for the job.In the months immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks, she helped set up the Transportation Security Administration, now an agency within the department. She also worked as a special assistant to President George W. Bush on natural disaster response while serving on the White House Homeland Security Council.When Mr. Trump moved Mr. Kelly to the White House in July 2017, Ms. Nielsen moved with him. As the principal deputy chief of staff, she enforced Mr. Kelly’s attempts to regulate access to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, including the president’s schedule — irritating White House staff members, who complained she was uncompromising.Mr. Kelly later backed Ms. Nielsen to succeed him at the Homeland Security Department, though she was criticized as too inexperienced for the job by Democrats and anti-immigration groups. Mr. Trump, however, said she was “ready on Day 1.”“There will be no on-the-job training for Kirstjen,” Mr. Trump said in October 2017, announcing her nomination for the post.But by the following spring, Ms. Nielsen was telling associates she was miserable in the job."
107,"Time finally ran out for Kirstjen Nielsen, President Trump’s beleaguered secretary of homeland security.The terms of Ms. Nielsen’s departure are unclear. She met with the president on Sunday evening to discuss continuing problems at the southern border. At the conclusion of the meeting, Mr. Trump announced on Twitter that Ms. Nielsen “will be leaving her position” and he thanked her for her service, implying he had asked her to step down. Ms. Nielsen issued a formal letter of resignation, saying it was the “right time for me to step aside.” Considering the long-simmering tensions between the president and Ms. Nielsen, the most surprising thing about her departure may be that it didn’t happen months ago.She was said to have become increasingly insecure in her job in recent weeks, as Mr. Trump repeatedly railed about the chaos at the border and pushed for dramatic action, including reinstating his policy of separating migrant families at the border and closing legal ports of entry. The president grew impatient with Ms. Nielsen’s insistence that federal law and international obligations limited her actions. In recent days, including in the hours immediately after the secretary’s resignation, he repeatedly fumed that “our country is full.” It’s no secret that Mr. Trump had a problem with Ms. Nielsen, whom he considered “weak” on matters of border security. The president and Stephen Miller, his hard-line immigration adviser, have long grumbled privately about the secretary’s insufficiently brutal approach to the surge in migrant families across the border. Last May, stories surfaced about Mr. Trump berating her in front of the entire cabinet for failing to stop the crossings. In her letter released on Sunday, Ms. Nielsen noted, “For more than two years of service beginning during the Presidential Transition, I have worked tirelessly to advance the goals and missions of the Department.”This is hardly something to brag about. Whatever the secretary’s personal views, and no matter how impossible her job, she was the face of some of the administration’s most poorly conceived and gratuitously callous policies. At best, she was complicit and, yes, rather weak.Ms. Nielsen’s response to her boss’s displeasure and abuse was often both morally anemic and strategically incoherent. Last summer, as Republicans and Democrats — and much of the American public — protested the administration’s practice of tearing migrant children from their parents at the border, Ms. Nielsen rushed to defend the policy. Scratch that. She insisted, repeatedly and bizarrely, that the administration had no such policy, even as her agency was enforcing and justifying it. “We do not have a policy of separating families at the border,” she said on Twitter in June. “Period.” She repeated as much to Congress as recently as March. But the grim repercussions of this nonpolicy are still being felt. Just on Friday, in a court filing, federal officials said it could take up to two years to identify possibly thousands of migrant children taken from their families beginning in July 2017.Not that immigration was the only issue on which Ms. Nielsen floundered. On the critical question of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 elections, she was even less lucid. At times, she seemed to support the intelligence community’s findings that the Kremlin had been up to no good. Other times, she supported the view that Russia had not favored Mr. Trump in the election. Her every utterance seemed intended to obfuscate rather than to clarify.Ms. Nielsen’s departure is part of a broader purging in her department. Two days before meeting with the secretary, the president withdrew his nomination for the next head of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, saying that he wanted to go in a “tougher direction.” On Monday, the White House confirmed that Randolph Alles, the head of the Secret Service, was on his way out as well. The general counsel for Homeland Security, John Mitnick, and the head of Citizenship and Immigration Services, L. Francis Cissna, are expected to soon follow. For now, Ms. Nielsen’s acting replacement will be Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection. This leaves Homeland Security without a top official at either of its critical immigration agencies. It comes as the swell of migrant families across the border pushes the system toward collapse. Possible successors being discussed include Rick Perry, the secretary of energy, and Ken Cuccinelli, the former attorney general of Virginia.Whoever takes Ms. Nielsen’s place, it seems likely that greater influence will be exerted by Mr. Miller, who inspires and reinforces Mr. Trump’s harshest impulses on immigrants and immigration. As the president becomes increasingly agitated about the border situation, Mr. Miller is said to be aggressively pushing to stock the administration with like-minded hard-liners. In addition to being a longtime critic of Ms. Nielsen, Mr. Miller is thought to have played a role in the withdrawal of the nomination of Ron Vitiello to lead ICE and the impending departure of Mr. Cissna. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said of Ms. Nielsen’s departure, “It is deeply alarming that the Trump administration official who put children in cages is reportedly resigning because she is not extreme enough for the White House’s liking.”The plan is for Ms. Nielsen to continue through Wednesday to help with an “orderly transition.” “I share the president’s goal of securing the border,” she said Monday morning. “I will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis on the border.”If Ms. Nielsen is inclined to perform one last act of public service, she should come clean about the costs of the policies she enforced over the past year and a half, not only to the desperate migrants seeking a better life in the United States, but also to the thousands of employees of her department charged with carrying out an inhumane and ineffective agenda. "
108,"For eight years, it seemed to Margarita Cruz that the management at the Trump Organization’s golf club in Westchester County, N.Y., did not notice — or did not care — that the green card and Social Security card she had used to get hired were fake, purchased in Queens for about $120.Ms. Cruz, a housekeeper, said she cleaned guest rooms, offices and shops at the club. She laundered sheets and pool towels. But that all ended this month, she said.Ms. Cruz and about a dozen other employees — housekeepers, landscapers and a head chef — at the club, Trump National Golf Club, were fired Jan. 18 because they were in the country illegally, according to interviews with Ms. Cruz and the former workers’ lawyer.The firings were first reported on Saturday by The Washington Post.The New York Times reported in December that undocumented immigrants had been employed at another club owned by the Trump Organization, the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., and that they were kept on the payroll for years even though management there had some knowledge of their fraudulent papers.Several workers deemed ineligible to work in the country had already been fired at the Bedminster club, according to people familiar with the matter.The employment of undocumented workers at Trump Organization properties runs counter to President Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric, which he has made central to his campaign and his presidency. He is currently in a heated political battle to build a wall along the border with Mexico, which he claims would stop drugs and crime. Evidence does not support Mr. Trump’s thesis.There is nothing to indicate that Mr. Trump or Trump Organization executives knew about the workers’ immigration status at either golf club. But Ms. Cruz, 44, said she believed that management at the Westchester club knew about her immigration status before January.Her papers were requested again two years ago, she said, not just when she was hired. Anibal Romero, who represents Ms. Cruz and 14 other former workers at the golf club, the majority of whom were fired Jan. 18, was stronger in his wording.“I’m not buying that they didn’t know,” Mr. Romero said.Neither Ms. Cruz nor the other former workers received benefits like health insurance or a pension, as other golf club employees did, Mr. Romero said. Most of his clients came into the country through Mexico, Mr. Romero said, and were originally from countries such as Mexico, Ecuador and Honduras.“This was a two-tiered system,” he said. “The people who were legal and the people who are undocumented.”He said the workers were fired by being individually called into a room by an executive, who read their names off a list.The White House referred questions to the Trump Organization on Saturday. The Trump Organization and the Westchester golf club did not respond to requests for comment.In a statement to The Post, Eric Trump, who manages the Trump Organization with his brother Donald Jr., said: “We are making a broad effort to identify any employee who has given false and fraudulent documents to unlawfully gain employment. Where identified, any individual will be terminated immediately.”Ms. Cruz entered the United States in 2009 near Piedras Negras, Mexico, on the Texas border, she said, with a 12-year-old daughter and a 9-year-old son. Her parents had paid a coyote $11,000 for the trip.She said that in Mexico she earned about $40 a week working at a restaurant. She started at $11 per hour at the golf club, and then got a raise to $14 per hour. She said she did not have any savings when she was fired because she had been paying back her parents.Mr. Trump’s political rhetoric has been surprising, she said, because he would regularly come by the golf club before his election and give the workers $50 tips in cash.“He would come over and say hello, ask your name and how long you had worked at the club,” Ms. Cruz said. “He would ask you how you liked the rug, or a picture on the wall, things like that.”She added, “If he really did hate Latinos so much, why did he come over to talk to us?”She said some of her colleagues had worked at the golf club for 18 years.“I couldn’t understand why he started talking like that about Latinos now and why he fired us,” she said.Mr. Romero said he is seeking federal and state investigations of the golf club to see if it had been exploiting the undocumented workers."
109,"CIUDAD JUÁREZ, Mexico — From her home in Honduras, Maria Magdalena Ferrufino Nuñez learned that Mexico’s new president was helping the migrants who were heading north in search of a better life.“I heard that he was welcoming the caravans,” said Ms. Ferrufino Nuñez, 55, who traveled with her son toward Ciudad Juárez, where she is waiting in a shelter for a chance to apply for asylum in the United States.The spring months usually see an upswell in migration in the region as Central Americans — fleeing poverty and violence or seeking to reunite with family members in the United States — take advantage of the temperate weather to travel north. But this year, a record number of migrant families is overwhelming officials and facilities on not only on the American side of the Mexico-United States border, infuriating Trump administration officials, but also on the Mexican side.The backup of migrants in Mexico has been commonly blamed on restrictions the Trump administration has imposed on the American asylum process. But this crisis appears to be also, in part, of the Mexican president’s making.According to migrants, local officials and migration scholars, this increase in northward migration has been partly spurred by the policies of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, who had campaigned as a defender of the poor and the downtrodden, and took office in December.[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]During his tenure, he has sought to strike a contrast with his predecessors by presenting a kinder, gentler face toward migrants. Deportations have plummeted under his watch, and his administration has sought to incorporate more migrants into Mexican society by being more generous with humanitarian visas and work permits.At the same time, he has also helped the Trump administration’s efforts to impede people seeking asylum in the United States.With more migrants moving north, and greater restrictions on entry into the United States, the number of migrants waiting along the Mexican side of the border has swelled. From Tijuana, on the western end of the border, to Matamoros on the eastern end, thousands of migrants have overflowed shelters, drawn down the emergency resources of local governments and civil society and tested the generosity and patience of residents.In Ciudad Juárez, northbound migrants — from Central America, the Caribbean and elsewhere — started arriving en masse late last year. The city’s two longtime shelters quickly overflowed. Churches pushed aside pews to make room for mattresses, and a public school gymnasium was converted to a dormitory. There are now nine shelters — still not enough to house newly arriving migrants, who are pouring in at a rate of more than 100 a day, local and state officials said.“Nobody knows where this is going to go, how many people are going to come, how many more people we’re going to help,” said Rogelio Pinal Castellanos, the director of human rights in Ciudad Juárez.And the situation would only get worse should Mr. Trump follow through on his threat to close the border in retaliation for what he says has been an inadequate effort by the Mexican government to stem unauthorized migration.The surge of migrants winding up in Ciudad Juárez and other border cities corresponds to a rise in the number of undocumented migrants trying to enter the United States.American officials say about 76,000 migrants without authorization were intercepted, or surrendered, along the southwest border in February — a 31 percent increase over January’s number. Interdictions of undocumented immigrants, most of them from Central America, were on pace to surpass 100,000 last month, the Trump administration claims, and could reach one million by the end of September. These are levels not seen since the early 2000s.The surge in undocumented migrants has come despite a series of aggressive policies by the Trump administration designed to discourage migration, including the constricting of the asylum process.For years, migrants seeking asylum only needed to present themselves at a port of entry into the United States to begin the process. But the Trump administration has begun to use a system known as “metering,” which limits the daily number of asylum seekers allowed to present their cases at certain ports of entry.The practice has given rise to informal waiting lists managed by the Mexican authorities, or even by the migrants themselves. There are currently more than 3,300 asylum seekers on the list in Ciudad Juárez. The number that can formally cross each day ranges from several dozen to none, and the wait can stretch for months. On Sunday only 10 were allowed to cross. The day before, zero.In a trend that began during the Obama administration, an increasing percentage of migrants are traveling in family units with children. Some say they bring their children in part because they know they will have a better chance of being released from American detention more quickly.“We heard in Guatemala that if you were traveling with children, it was much easier to cross,” said a woman, 30, who has been staying with her 5-year-old son at a Juárez shelter waiting for her turn to apply for asylum in neighboring El Paso. She gave her surname as Ramirez, but asked that her full name not be published because she did not want to imperil her case. She said she was fleeing a violent gang in Guatemala.While President López Obrador has chosen, in some ways, to help the United States carry out its immigration agenda, he has also sent a message to potential migrants that they are now more welcome than ever in Mexico.In the first three months of the López Obrador administration, there were 44 percent fewer deportations than during the last three months of President Enrique Peña Nieto’s administration.Mr. López Obrador has also talked repeatedly about  incorporating more migrants into the Mexican work force.In January, the Mexican immigration agency set up a special task force on the southern border to expedite the issuing of yearlong, renewable humanitarian visas for Central Americans approaching as part of a large migrant caravan.But after more than 13,000 migrants applied for the visa in two weeks, the government abruptly ended the program.Many migrants who had applied for the visa said they intended to use it to ease their passage to the northern border, and then cross into the United States, either legally or illegally.“I heard that they were giving an excellent entry permit, and because of that we came with the idea of making it to the United States,” said Donald Tejada, 28, a coffee plantation worker from Honduras who applied for the special visa in late January.And though the migrant caravans account for only a small, albeit high-profile, fraction of the total number of migrants who traverse Mexico, the López Obrador administration has largely allowed them to move unimpeded across Mexican territory.At least two large migrant caravans — one numbering about 2,000 people and the other about 800 — are currently traveling through southern Mexico toward the United States, according to local news reports. Yet another left San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador, on Saturday, also heading north.On Sunday, the Mexican migration agency said it would resume issuing humanitarian visas on Monday to migrants “in a limited manner” in the southern state of Chiapas, giving priority to women, children and people older than 65. The agency also said it would start issuing the visas through Mexican Consulates in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras beginning in May.But the López Obrador administration has been under considerable pressure from President Trump to help curb illegal migration into the United States. And following a meeting last week with Trump administration officials, Mexico’s interior minister, Olga Sánchez Cordero, said security forces would be deployed to form a containment cordon across southern Mexico to help control migration.The López Obrador administration is also under pressure from the northern border cities and states that have been shouldering the burden of care for the thousands of migrants.Officials in the state of Chihuahua, which includes Ciudad Juárez, said they have repeatedly lobbied their federal counterparts for money to help support the migrants waiting to cross into the United States, arguing that their presence is partly a result of inconsistent national migration policy.But they have received little assistance.“We don’t have the capacity to receive so many people for so much time,” said Enrique Valenzuela, the coordinator of the Chihuahua government’s population council, which oversees migrant issues for the state. “Facing a situation that we didn’t cause, the costs have been high and are increasing.”Part of Mr. Valenzuela’s work is to urge patience among the migrants waiting to apply for asylum. But, he cautions, the longer they have to wait, the more likely they will be to try to cross illegally.And the more that people cross illegally, the more that the Trump administration will reassign personnel from the legal border crossings, causing slowdowns at ports of entry, further limiting the procession of asylum seekers and fueling a vicious cycle.Andrew Selee, the president of the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, said that both the Trump and López Obrador administrations are learning the limits of their own political rhetoric.“The great irony here is that you have one administration north of the border that rhetorically thinks only in terms of enforcement and one south of the border that rhetorically thinks in terms of getting rid of enforcement,” he said. “And neither one is possible.”"
110,"President Trump said last week that he would cut off aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, the home countries of most of the migrants arriving at the United States’ southern border to seek asylum.The Trump administration has already taken the first step to act on the president’s directive, notifying Congress that it wanted to divert the $450 million allocated to the region. By Monday, though, the administration had not offered details about whether any aid — such as military aid or support to combat drug trafficking — might be exempt from the order.If the aid withdrawal does go ahead, aid advocates say, it would probably affect the region’s most vulnerable people, including small farmers struggling to adapt to climate change and teenagers pressured to join gangs in a region that is a major drug transit route, according to State Department estimates. Advocates say that, should these threats to lives and livelihoods grow, many more people will take their chances on the road and leave for the United States.The decision to end aid is likely to provoke anger in Congress, where lawmakers in both parties have supported efforts to address the root causes of migration. If the money is ultimately withheld, it would affect a wide range of programs designed to improve citizen security, promote economic development and encourage accountable government.Mr. Trump has complained that the governments of the three countries have done too little to halt immigration, and portrayed the withdrawal of aid as punishment for their leaders.A vast majority of the aid, however, goes to nongovernmental organizations, churches, charities and private contractors that carry out projects for the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development. According to the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights research group, the largest portion of aid has gone to improving security and justice systems, and to preventing violence.Aid varies from country to country to address their different needs. In El Salvador, where the United States has helped support a broad antiviolence program, 57 percent of the $149 million in aid allocated in 2017 went to projects intended to prevent violence, improve security and community policing, and train judges, prosecutors and public defenders.In Honduras, where aid reached almost $182 million in 2017, the highest percentage of funds — some 44 percent — went to support programs that improved justice and security, with an additional 30 percent allocated for antipoverty programs among the country’s rural poor.The aid also supports anticorruption measures by providing funds for international prosecutors who have been investigating graft in Honduras and Guatemala, and a special anticorruption unit in the Salvadoran attorney general’s office. In advance of Guatemala’s elections in June, the United States has also helped finance the country’s electoral agency.The United States also supported border security and efforts to combat drug trafficking, though those funds accounted for a smaller percentage of the overall aid. The Pentagon set aside millions to improve drug interdiction and to supply equipment and training to counter trafficking in Honduras.In Guatemala, poverty, rather than violence, is the main driver of migration. More than half of the $178 million in 2017 aid went to programs to alleviate poverty, particularly in the country’s western highlands, where many children suffer from chronic malnutrition.Economic aid is the next largest block of American support in Central America, after security and related programs. The funds support small businesses in Guatemala, schools in Honduras and job training for at-risk youth in El Salvador, among other projects. Some of the programs are broader, such as an effort to bring down high power costs by connecting electrical grids and financing new infrastructure.In 2017, $18 million was allocated to help farmers in Honduras diversify their crops and improve productivity, to reduce extreme hunger and poverty; and $14.5 million to help small-business owners, including funds to help create a sustainable system for cacao production.In Guatemala that year, more than $10 million was designated to help communities adapt to climate change’s effects — such as increased drought and coffee-destroying fungus — and $6.3 million to help the Health Ministry prevent maternal and infant deaths, and prevent H.I.V. infections.Until a large wave of unaccompanied minors from Central America arrived at the Texas border in 2014, American aid to the region focused on economic growth and law enforcement. But the surge of child migrants, which was in part spurred by the high murder rates in the Northern Triangle, prompted the Obama administration to request more money from Congress for a broader approach to the region.As a result, aid increased to $750 million in 2016 before beginning to drop under the Trump administration. Over all, Congress allocated almost $2.1 billion to Central America from 2016 to 2018, most of it for the Northern Triangle countries, though agencies have been slow to spend all the money.Murder rates have fallen in all three countries but poverty remains as entrenched as ever — and it remains difficult to assess how effective the aid has been, particularly over such a short period. Advocates argue that programs need years to take effect.The Trump administration has also redirected its emphasis toward security and away from the focus on ethical governance. That shift has taken pressure off Central American governments to become more accountable, and both the Guatemalan and Honduran governments have recently pushed back against anticorruption efforts."
111,"By threatening to close the border with Mexico and moving to cut off aid to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala — the so-called Northern Triangle countries, from which many migrants headed to the United States are coming — President Trump is effectively shooting America in the foot, to paraphrase one expert.Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of United States Customs and Border Protection, noted last week that the near-record number of migrant families with children seeking asylum both at and in between official ports of entry on the southern border was stretching his agency to a “breaking point.” This was made startlingly clear as photos of hundreds of migrants, including many small children, confined behind razor wire in a makeshift enclosure beneath a bridge in El Paso, spread quickly across the internet. The agency has since closed the holding area.C.B.P. and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, both of which operate under the Department of Homeland Security, have taken steps to grapple with the increased flow of migrants, a vast majority of them families with children seeking asylum. The agencies have diverted resources and personnel to process and care for the migrants, even agreeing to release some families to American cities far from the border.“We are doing everything we can to simply avoid a tragedy in a C.B.P. facility,” Mr. McAleenan said. “But with these numbers, with the types of illnesses we’re seeing at the border, I fear that it’s just a matter of time.”In an attempt to ease the problem, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, signed a compact with officials from the Northern Triangle last week to help curb the complex drivers of irregular migration — including crime and gang violence in the region. Mr. Trump, less than a day later, announced he was ending aid to those countries. Nonsensically, Mr. Trump has insisted that the real problem is Mexico, which he suggested is doing “nothing” to help stop the tide of migrants. That’s despite the efforts by Mexican leaders to intercept migrant groups, providing temporary visas to asylum seekers and allowing some making the trek north to remain in Mexico while they await court hearings in the United States.As with the president’s wall, which would do little to discourage unauthorized migration, let alone illegal drug trafficking, no one with a working knowledge of immigration policy believes that closing the border is a solution to the recent surge. The economic disruption for border communities and the impact on trade would be disastrous. Plus, closing the border won’t stop migrants from stepping onto United States soil and claiming asylum, as many of the groups surrendering to border agents in recent months have done in between ports of entry.What would help much more is action to address the root causes of the surge in border crossings, from reforming federal immigration laws to aid to improve economic conditions in Central America. And most urgently, Congress needs to come up with a more nimble legal framework to address the glut of asylum claims and more funding for log-jammed immigration courts to process them. This moment calls for proactive measures — not incendiary policies that are destined to backfire."
112,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.[Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.]He’s running!Julián Castro, the former housing secretary and former mayor of San Antonio, Tex., said on Saturday that he will run for president. The first major Latino candidate to make a 2020 bid, Mr. Castro, 44, advocated for a fairly progressive platform in his announcement speech.Here at On Politics, we’re trying to talk to all the 2020 candidates as they enter the race, and Mr. Castro agreed to be our first subject. We spoke late Sunday afternoon, shortly after he landed in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he planed to speak to a group of political activists and tour a hurricane recovery zone. (As usual, our conversation has been condensed for clarity.)Lisa: Hi. Thanks for chatting with us. As you well know, you’re one of the first of what’s likely to be quite a number of Democrats running for president. How can you distinguish yourself?Castro: I have a track record of getting things done as mayor of San Antonio and as secretary of housing. I have a strong vision for the country’s future. And I’ve lived a life that I believe lets me understand people all along the scale of experience in our country. I had a modest upbringing and I can understand people that are striving to reach their dreams. I’ve also reached my dreams and can understand folks who have had a lot of success.You’re in Puerto Rico right now. That’s pretty far from Iowa. Why start your campaign there?I want everybody to understand that everybody counts in this country. The most basic tenet of government is protection. And this administration failed our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico by not protecting them after Hurricane Maria. I’m going to highlight that, and then we’ll let folks know that in the years to come everybody is going to count in this country, including the people of Puerto Rico.President Trump has said there’s a massive crisis on the border. Do you agree?Not at all. The crisis that exists is a crisis of leadership. This president has failed. He promised all of us that if Americans could just be cruel enough to separate babies from their parents at the border, that it would deter more families from coming over there. Now we’ve seen that more families are coming over. So he has failed with his policies, and he’s failed in trying to convince the American people that he’s not to blame for this shutdown. And the best thing that he can do now is to set aside his political ploy of the wall.You may be the only Latino in a crowded race. How do you think that will impact the contest?I’ve got to be myself, and I’m confident that I can appeal to a broad cross-section of Americans. At the same time, of course, there’s significance to the Latino community because I believe a lot of Latinos feel targeted right now by this administration. For me, personally, I can relate to many of today’s immigrants because my grandmother that I grew up with came over from Mexico, and I grew up in San Antonio, just a few hours away from the border. So I’ve seen the positive value that immigrants add to this country in a very direct way. And I know that these cities along the border are some of the safest cities in the United States.Any Democrats who runs will have to answer the question of how to challenge Mr. Trump. What’s your philosophy?The way I see it is that, above all else, people want to know what you stand for. I’m going to give people a strong positive vision for our country’s future. Of course, I’m going to point out where I differ with the president. But my first priority is to let you know, if you elect me, what I’m going to do for you or for your family.Do you think a Democrat will end up running against Mr. Trump? Like, do you think he’ll still be in office next year? That’s probably the best question out there now. You know, it’s hard to tell what’s going to happen. My hope is that these investigations will proceed thoroughly and Congress will act once the investigation is finished appropriately. So right now, I’m prepared to face President Trump in November of 2020. If there’s somebody else who’s up for the Republicans, then I’ll face them.Mr. Trump is known for giving nicknames to his opponents. What do you think yours will be? Who knows and who cares. You know, the thing about magic tricks is that even magic tricks get old. And his tricks are getting old.[Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox.]____________________Talks between the White House and congressional Democrats to end the longest government shutdown in history remained stalled on Monday. That’s more bad news for government employees, who don’t know when they’ll get their next paycheck.Last week we spoke to Júlia Quintanilla, a contract janitor at the Department of Agriculture, who was worried about buying groceries. Today, we’re bringing you the story of T.S.A. agents Daniel and Jennifer Young. The couple met on the job at Huntsville Municipal Airport in Alabama, where they’ve both worked for over a decade. They stagger their shifts, with Ms. Young leaving the house around 3:30 a.m., so they can care for their 5-year-old twin daughters.Deemed essential for national security, T.S.A. agents are required to work during the shutdown. But they’re not getting paid. Many live paycheck to paycheck, making an average salary of $35,000, according to officials at the American Federation of Government Employees.High numbers are calling in sick and resigning, a situation that’s forced airports in Miami, Houston and Washington to close some screening lines. And on Sunday night, the T.S.A. confirmed that a passenger with a gun passed through a checkpoint in the Atlanta airport and flew to Tokyo. The agency denied any connection with the shutdown, but the incident sparked speculation.To ease some of the stress, David P. Pekoske, the T.S.A. administrator, announced that employees would receive a day’s pay if they worked Dec. 22 and that uniformed officers will get a $500 bonus on Tuesday.So far, the Youngs have been able to stretch their finances to cover their expenses. But if the shutdown continues into next month, the couple said they will have to make some “really hard choices” about which bills to pay.“We had a screw in our tire, and I had to go and figure out how we’re going to pay for it to get fixed,” said Mr. Young, 36, a Marine Corps veteran. “That increases your stress level. You can’t stop life when you’re not getting paid. You still have to go to work.”“I can’t pay my electric bill with an i.o.u. I can’t pay my mortgage with an i.o.u.,” Mr. Young added. “All my decisions are based on the fact that I have no idea when I’m going to get paid or how I’m paying for this. I will be pretty much living off credit cards in February.”“Kids sense a lot,” said Ms. Young, 34, “but I feel like they don’t need to know. It’s my job to take care of them. It’s my job to provide for them. Even if I have to make tough choices. At least there’s food in their bellies.”Have you been personally affected by the shutdown?

113,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's administration stepped up pressure on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Tuesday, raising the likelihood that he might fire more senior officials as the agency struggles with a surge of immigrants on the U.S.-Mexico border.Two days after Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced her departure, a senior administration official said others at DHS were not doing enough to enact Trump's promised immigration crackdown, a top priority for him since he announced his candidacy for the White House four years ago.DHS acting Deputy Secretary Claire Grady offered her resignation to Trump, effective Wednesday, after a 28-year career at the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, Nielsen said in a tweet late on Tuesday.Several other DHS officials could be forced out soon, said an official familiar with the matter.Among them were the department's general counsel, John Mitnick, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director Francis Cissna, the source said. A DHS spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on the officials' expected tenure.Trump denied that he was overhauling DHS and said his administration was fighting ""bad laws"" on immigration and a court system that ""never ever rules for us"" - a frequent refrain of his as a succession of policies to curb entry to the United States has been met with legal challenges by civil rights advocates.""Nobody ever said I was cleaning house,"" Trump told reporters at the White House.Nielsen announced her resignation on Sunday after a meeting with Trump in which the two disagreed on the best way to handle border security. The personnel changes could further destabilize the U.S. domestic security agency as it tries to stem rising numbers of immigrants arriving at the border, many of them families fleeing violence and poverty in Central America. DHS said it arrested or denied entry to more than 103,000 people along the border last month, more than double the March 2018 figure. The U.S. Secret Service said on Monday that its chief, Randolph ""Tex"" Alles, would depart his job next month. Trump last Friday withdrew the nomination of Ronald Vitiello to serve as director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Several top DHS jobs are either vacant or filled on an acting basis, including positions responsible for disaster response, immigration enforcement, finance, policy, and science and technology.""It's not good to have all these people performing in an acting position,"" said Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, a Republican.FRUSTRATIONSTrump has grown increasingly frustrated as DHS officials have told him that the dramatic immigration changes they seek are not possible under current law and would require the cooperation of Congress, several sources say.Trump repeatedly pressed Nielsen over recent weeks to bring back last year's controversial policy of separating migrant children from their parents, one source said. Trump abandoned that policy last year in the face of widespread public outrage, and it was subsequently struck down in court.Trump denied on Tuesday that he was reviving the separation policy. Johnson said that policy would have ""no support"" in Congress.A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said one option may be to give migrant families a choice of staying in long-term detention together while they await a court hearing or splitting up, an idea known as ""binary choice."" The administration may also move to detain migrant children for longer than the 20-day maximum set by a court ruling, to spur a legal challenge that could overturn that limit, the official said. The official said DHS has been too slow in drafting new rules that would tighten immigration.The official singled out USCIS, saying it had not moved quickly enough to tighten H-1B visas for skilled workers and has granted an ""astronomical"" number of asylum claims.Asylum officers found that applicants had a ""credible fear"" of persecution in their home countries in 78 percent of the cases they decided between October and February, according to USCIS data.The White House could anger allies in Congress if it fires USCIS head Cissna, who previously worked with Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said on Twitter that Cissna was ""doing what voters asked4 w PresTrump election.""Any move to fire Cissna or other DHS leaders would likely complicate the department's leadership woes.U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan is due to take Nielsen's place on a temporary basis, starting on Wednesday, leaving DHS without a permanent leader on the front lines of the border crisis.DHS's acting deputy secretary Grady was legally supposed to take over after Nielsen's departure, so Grady's resignation on Tuesday cleared the way for McAleenan to take the agency's reins.Trump has interviewed several candidates for the top job over the past week and a half, including former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli, and former acting Immigrations and Customs Enforcement head Thomas Homan. All three have expressed hard-line views on illegal immigration, and could have difficulty winning confirmation in the U.S. Senate, which Trump's Republicans control by a 53-47 margin.Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said Congress needed to set aside its differences to overhaul immigration laws, which it has repeatedly failed to do over the past 15 years.

114,"[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]A 7-year-old Guatemalan girl who died in United States custody last December was suffering from a bacterial infection that was so advanced she probably would have been visibly sick for many hours, said several physicians who reviewed a newly released autopsy report of her death.By the time the girl, Jakelin Caal Maquin, arrived at a children’s hospital in El Paso with seizures and difficulty breathing, she already had severe blood abnormalities, according to a part of the report that summarized her condition in the emergency room of the Children’s Hospital at the Hospitals of Providence Memorial Campus.The new findings were released on Friday by the El Paso County Office of the Medical Examiner. Customs and Border Protection officials and lawyers for the girl’s family have sparred over whether the severity of her infection — with a common streptococcus bacteria — should have been recognized and whether she should have been taken for medical care more quickly.“Something like that takes hours to progress,” said Dr. Lee Sanders, the chief of general pediatrics at Stanford University.Jakelin and her father, Nery Gilberto Caal Cruz, spent about eight hours in a remote area of the New Mexico border after they were apprehended by Border Patrol agents for crossing illegally into the United States as part of a group of 163 migrants. They were not placed on the first bus departing for the Lordsburg Border Patrol Station, according to a timeline released last December by Customs and Border Protection.Officials said that Mr. Caal signed a form after he was apprehended that certified his child was healthy. However, lawyers representing Mr. Caal have said the form was in English, which Mr. Caal did not speak.Many migrants interviewed in recent weeks after being released from Border Patrol custody said they or their children had been sick but they had not revealed the illnesses, for reasons ranging from fear that it would slow their processing to a lack of knowledge that medical care would be available. Pediatricians said that it would be difficult for Border Patrol agents with little or no medical training to judge how sick a child was.Congressman Raul Ruiz, a Democrat from California who is an emergency physician, said in an interview that the new report highlighted the need for standardized medical checks at the border.“Clearly there was no meaningful observation or evaluation of this child,” he said. “It is the legal responsibility of C.B.P. to provide for the humanitarian needs and the health needs of the children under their custody while being detained.”That duty is made more challenging by the fact that migrants are crossing in difficult to reach areas, where medical resources, including ambulances, are in short supply.The agency said Mr. Caal notified border patrol agents that his daughter was sick and vomiting only immediately before their departure from the remote region. Still, the girl did not receive medical attention until the bus arrived at the station, roughly an hour and a half later, where Border Patrol agents trained as emergency medical technicians examined her and called for an ambulance. She was then flown to the El Paso hospital.Jakelin’s death, and then the death just weeks later of another Guatemalan child, Felipe Gómez Alonzo, led the federal agency to  begin making improvements in evaluating children for medical problems and increase staffing of medical professionals. Congress has earmarked funds for that this year.Lawyers for the girl’s family have called for an independent investigation, and said in a statement Friday that while the autopsy report “sheds some light on Jakelin’s cause of death, it still leaves many questions that require further review.”“The report’s findings suggest that Jakelin’s chances of surviving would have been improved with earlier medical intervention,” they said in the statement. According to the autopsy, Jakelin’s death resulted from streptococcal sepsis, a life-threatening response to infection.Mr. Caal said Friday evening that although he had been informed about the release of the autopsy report, he had not yet seen it.“I wanted to know what happened,” he said, speaking by phone from Philadelphia where he is staying with relatives. He had been concerned that the report might in some way affect his immigration case.The agency, which has defended its handling of the case, did not offer a comment on the new report.At a news conference on Wednesday announcing further increases in illegal border crossings, Kevin K. McAleenan, the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, warned that dangers remained.“With 55,000 families, including 40,000 children expected to enter the process this month, we are doing everything we can to simply avoid a tragedy in a C.B.P. facility,” he said. “But with these numbers, with the types of illnesses we’re seeing in the border, I fear that it’s just a matter of time.”"
115,"Twenty-two days into the longest government shutdown ever, President Trump continued to press his case for a border wall. His tweet on Saturday was crammed with statistics that were either exaggerated or omitted important context. Immigrant prison populationMr. Trump’s figure for the percentage of unauthorized immigrants in federal prisons is exaggerated.Out of the Bureau of Prisons’ total inmate population of 183,058 in the first quarter of the 2018 fiscal year, 21 percent were immigrants, both legal and undocumented, according to a government report. At least 13 percent of the total population, or 23,826 inmates, were in the country unlawfully. The immigration status of another 11,698 inmates was under investigation, while 2,608 inmates were lawful immigrants or had received relief from deportation.The most common crimes committed by these immigrants were drug-related offenses (46 percent) and immigration offenses (29 percent). It’s worth noting, too, that about half of the arrests made by the federal government are for immigration-related offenses, perhaps explaining the high proportion of immigrants in federal prisons. The report acknowledges that it does not include data from state and local prisons, which house 90 percent of all inmates in the United States.Border arrestsMr. Trump did not give a time frame for his 240 percent figure, nor did he specify what the number referred to, which may give the misleading impression that border crossings overall have increased threefold. The figure instead refers to a surge in families attempting to cross at the southwest border. The number of family units apprehended at the border more than tripled from 8,120 in December 2017 to 27,518 in December 2018, overwhelming immigration officials and creating a new humanitarian crisis.Overall, illegal border crossings have been declining for nearly two decades, and in the 2017 fiscal year, border crossing apprehensions were at their lowest point since 1971. In the 2018 fiscal year, however, annual apprehensions did increase by 30 percent from the previous fiscal year.Immigrant criminals in TexasMr. Trump’s figures are accurate, but they need context. The Texas Department of Public Safety did report that the 186,000 unauthorized immigrants booked into local jails from 2011 to 2018 faced 292,000 charges.The caveats: These offenses did not necessarily occur during that eight-year time frame. More than half of these charges were uncategorized. And the charges Mr. Trump singled out did not always result in convictions (238 for homicide, 13,559 for assault, 1,689 for sexual assault and 1,280 for weapons).For comparison, data from the Texas Department of Public Safety shows that some 7.5 million arrests were made from 2010 to 2017 (data for 2018 was not yet available), including 6,161 for murder, 177,000 for aggravated assault, 14,000 for rape and nearly 89,000 for weapons charges. A 2018 study from the libertarian Cato Institute found that in Texas, conviction and arrest rates for illegal immigrants were lower than those for native-born Americans for most crimes."
116,"The 90-minute drive from Tucson to Rancho de la Osa, a recently reopened dude ranch on the border with Mexico, is a lonely one. Turning onto Highway 286, your car may be the only southbound vehicle for 44 miles while the occasional U.S. Border Patrol van trolls north. The road runs directly to the border fence, here made up of eerie metal posts spaced less than a foot apart, at the town of Sasabe. Minutes before reaching it, a right turn onto a dirt road delivers you to the historic adobe ranch, painted a warm terra cotta, with a porch lined with turquoise Adirondack chairs.“You got the right place, and we got the right horse,” said a cowboy in the driveway, when I pulled in last winter, fully living up to wrangler stereotype with a handlebar mustache and weathered 10-gallon hat.Once, the border fence was such a strong deterrent to visitors that it helped drive the 1920s dude ranch out of business. But, if anything, President Trump’s campaign for a border wall has helped revive interest in a region that already has a barrier at the border.“Like Trump or hate Trump, now the border is an attraction,” said Russell True, who with partners, bought Rancho de la Osa at auction complete with its vintage western furnishings and period art in late 2016. They don’t publicize the ranch’s proximity to the border fence and had hoped the border would be a neutral feature of the ranch. Instead, Mr. True said it has piqued the interest of guests. “The first thing they want to do is see the wall,” he said. “We could not have planned for the political shift and that it would become interesting.”Originally opened in the 1920s, Rancho de la Osa drew many celebrated guests, including Joan Crawford, Cesar Romero and John Wayne, for whom three of the 18 bedrooms are named (double room rates from $235 a person, all inclusive). The cowboy actor of the silent film era, Tom Mix, made one of his many films here. Authors checked in too, including the western novelist Zane Grey and Margaret Mitchell. Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson led the political A-list along with William Clayton, who drafted the Marshall Plan to aid European countries after World War II in a two-bedroom house on the property.More current events also helped drive the ranch out of business, according to Mr. True, who also co-owns White Stallion Ranch near Tucson. In 2010, Jan Brewer then the governor of Arizona, decried beheadings in the desert she said were linked to illegal immigration and drug trafficking, allegations that were never corroborated and that she later called an error on her part. “We just had an absolute, possibly even slightly irrational need to save it,” Mr. True told me as we sat in the main lodge, where the adobe walls are washed in orange, red and yellow hues and an antique leather sofa is embossed with an image of a saddle. “Somebody else would have bought it, but nobody else was going to run it as a dude ranch.”As a dude ranch, the 590-acre Rancho de la Osa, restored and reopened in 2017, offers more than vintage charm. Beyond the central compound, which includes an outdoor swimming pool and a bar in a building dating back to 1720, lies some of the lushest areas of the Sonoran Desert, at about a 3,500-foot elevation, and the distinctive Baboquivari Peak, which is considered sacred to the indigenous Tohono O’odham people.Horseback riding is the main activity here but the new owners have expanded activities to include fat-tire electric mountain biking, off-road vehicle tours, clay-pigeon shooting and bird-watching trips to the neighboring Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, a 117,500-acre preserve with grasslands that resemble the savannas of Africa.In addition to exploring the desert, morning and afternoon rides introduce guests to the ranch’s veteran wranglers Ross and Lynne Knox. The couple’s stories, including his close brushes with death running pack-mule trains in the Grand Canyon, conjured a western past that doesn’t seem so distant here in some of the more desolate parts of the southern border.“If you’re not living on the edge,” he said with a chuckle about his daring cowboy lifestyle, “then you’re taking up too much space.”Of course, the degree to which the desert is deserted is up for debate, and on my first ride I spotted the well-patrolled fence -— mostly out of sight from the ranch dwellings — that undulates east with the hills as far as the eye can see.It abruptly stops at the nearby territory of the Tohono O’odham people who have prevented the fence, erected in 2007, from crossing tribal land. When the Knoxes drove me and four fellow guests in an off-road cart to see it, we took turns walking around to the Mexican side of the border and posing for photos. A few foot paths snaked into the hills on the American side staked with spiky ocotillo cactus.Still, it was easy to forget about politics in a place where a juvenile great horned owl, flying low at dusk, roosted in a tree just 10 feet from my patio seat, and where cozy rooms with original fireplaces came stocked with mesquite wood. Mr. Knox, a celebrated cowboy poet, recited some of his work after dinner, concluding “when the memories come calling, you still can’t help but pray/Lord, please make me a cowboy again for a day.”"
117,"MCALLEN, Tex. — Border Patrol detention centers in Texas’s Rio Grande Valley have soared well past their capacity in recent days, prompting mass releases of migrants onto the streets as local leaders scramble to house and feed hundreds of new arrivals daily.“They’re as stressed as we are,” Jim Darling, mayor of the South Texas border city of McAllen, said of Border Patrol officials. The officials have released more than 2,200 people from government processing facilities in the Rio Grande Valley since Monday, setting aside once again the Trump administration’s vow to end what it calls “catch and release” of those who cross the border without authorization.“We’re trying to determine how many sites we have to have. The last thing we want is people walking our streets and having to sleep in doorways,” Mr. Darling said.The primary migrant-services facility in the region, a former nursing home in McAllen now used by Catholic Charities as an immigrant respite center, is already reaching capacity, with nearly every inch of the low-slung red-brick building occupied.[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]The air was thick with the smell of sweat Tuesday evening, with dozens of people waiting for assistance at the front of the building. Two government buses pulled up outside to drop off even more: 54 in one bus and 57 in the second. On Wednesday, migrants slept on blue padded mats on the floors of small crowded rooms as they waited for rides to the downtown bus station.In El Paso, the sudden release of about 150 migrants on Tuesday set in motion a flurry to try to accommodate them. A network of shelters run by the nonprofit Annunciation House had no more space, so city officials converted a public park into a staging area, until space for the migrants was found at local hotels.Unauthorized border crossings have spiked in recent months, with more than 76,000 migrants apprehended on the southwest border in February, an 11-year high. Processing facilities in El Paso and in the Rio Grande Valley region in South Texas have swelled with migrant families in recent days. Early Tuesday, Border Patrol agents at the border fence in El Paso apprehended a group of 194 men, women and children traveling together. About five minutes later, agents in another part of the city took in a second group of 252 migrants.Last week, agents in the McAllen area encountered a group of nearly 300 migrants walking toward a river levee, the largest such group seen this year. In a single 24-hour period, agents in that region had apprehended more than 1,000 migrants, most of them voluntarily turning themselves in and seeking protection under asylum laws.The unusually large numbers are what caused agents in the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector this week to release some migrant families at an early stage, the agency said. The releases bypassed the usual procedure in which newly arrived migrants are handed over after initial processing to another federal agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which may detain them or release them with some requirement that they will show up for future court appearances.Instead, migrants traveling in families are being released directly by Customs and Border Protection, the Border Patrol’s parent agency, after being given papers instructing them to show up at a later date in immigration court. Local officials were told that Border Patrol facilities in the area were over capacity by about 2,100 migrants.The Border Patrol said in a statement that the recent increase in apprehensions led to a “limited availability of space” at the agency’s facilities in the Rio Grande Valley sector. Out of concern for the safety of officers and migrants, the agency said it had begun to release families after giving them a notice to appear in immigration court.“R.G.V. Sector will continue to coordinate with state and local stakeholders and nongovernmental organizations while these temporary measures are in place,” the agency said.The recent releases resembled a similar series of unannounced mass releases of migrants late last year in El Paso and San Diego. This time, however, federal immigration agencies appeared to be coordinating more closely with local officials, who in December had been caught off guard.The mass release in McAllen has caused a ripple effect along the Texas border. Officials in Brownsville, 60 miles east of McAllen, were told by Border Patrol officials to expect releases there in the coming days as well. It appeared that the Border Patrol intended to ease pressure on the McAllen shelter network by putting migrants on buses and dropping them off in Brownsville.Tony Martinez, the mayor of Brownsville, said the city was prepared to open the downtown bus station for 24 hours to accommodate migrants. After their release, many migrants board buses to join their relatives already living elsewhere in the United States.“At this particular point, we are having meetings on a daily basis so that we can monitor the numbers,” Mr. Martinez said.The scramble comes as Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, was scheduled to visit McAllen on Thursday. Some immigrant advocates and elected officials were skeptical of the timing of the releases, suggesting they were part of a Trump administration effort to justify the president’s descriptions of a border in crisis and his declaration of a national emergency. Border Patrol officials deny such claims.Representative Vicente Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat whose district includes McAllen, criticized the mass release of migrants “without processing, without proper plans for housing and with no course of reasonable action” and questioned the administration’s motives.“President Trump, Secretary Nielsen, and the entire administration have been presented with the truth — there is no crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border,” he said in the statement. “Their response? Create one.”The nonprofit Texas Civil Rights Project, which has been conducting legal interviews with migrants released from Border Patrol custody in the Rio Grande Valley, said it appeared that the government was deliberately releasing them hundreds at a time. Some of those released recently reported that they had been detained for up to eight days, the group said. Normally, Customs and Border Protection holds newly detained migrants for about 72 hours.Also raising suspicion was a recent drop in the number of migrants prosecuted for illegal border crossings at the federal courthouse in McAllen. Prosecutions during January and February ranged from about 400 to 700 per week. But the number of migrants brought to the courthouse dropped sharply last week, with only 176 prosecuted, and 88 had been charged during the first three days of this week, even though overall apprehensions remained high.“Families should never be detained, but this practice must be met with skepticism,” Astrid Dominguez of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Border Rights Center said in a statement.On Tuesday, Sister Norma Pimentel, the executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, posted an urgent plea for assistance on Facebook, asking for volunteers in both McAllen and Brownsville, as well chicken and vegetables to make soup, and cereal and bananas for breakfast.Sister Pimentel later stood outside the respite center in a light rain to help newly arrived migrants off a bus. The respite center received more than 800 migrants on Monday, another 800 on Tuesday and more than 600 by Wednesday afternoon. Sister Pimentel said she was told by Border Patrol to expect up to 800 a day for an unspecified amount of time. In recent months, the most that Catholic Charities had assisted in one day was about 400.“It’s not typical at all,” she said amid a crowd of migrants in the front lobby. “We were not expecting this. The numbers are very high. They just simply said they’re apprehending big numbers and they’re over capacity, and they need to create the space for those that are just arriving.”She said city officials had identified two additional sites that can be used to house migrants if the numbers warrant. If those are not enough, the group plans to charter buses to Houston and possibly San Antonio, she said.As crowded as the respite center was, the conditions in the Border Patrol facilities were even more congested, some migrants who had just been released said.“There were so many people,” said Albertina, a 29-year-old Honduran mother who had just left the central processing center in McAllen. Albertina, who asked to be identified only by her first name, stood in line at the respite center holding her infant daughter, and said she was going to take a bus to join her family in Tennessee.A 45-year-old man from Honduras who identified himself as David said he had arrived with his 15-year-old son at a Border Patrol facility on Saturday. It was packed, he said.“Two thousand?” he called out to a friend. “What do you think?”“Yes, must have been,” the friend said."
118,"WASHINGTON — House Democrats issued subpoenas late Tuesday to three cabinet officials, in a sharp escalation of their battle over the administration’s policy of separating migrant families at the southern border.Administration officials did not immediately say if the cabinet officials — the homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen; the attorney general, William P. Barr; and the health and human services secretary, Alex M. Azar II — would comply. But Ms. Nielsen has previously refused to appear before the House Homeland Security committee to answer similar inquiries, and the Justice Department suggested Mr. Barr would not turn over documents requested by the committee.Earlier in the day, the House Oversight and Reform Committee easily passed a measure authorizing the subpoenas that called for the officials to turn over documents pertaining to the detention policies, as two Republicans — Representative Justin Amash of Michigan and Representative Chip Roy of Texas — voted with Democrats to authorize the subpoenas. Moments later, the House Judiciary Committee held its first hearing on a child separation policy that the panel’s Democratic chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, described as “indefensible,” “inhumane” and “immoral” in his opening statement.[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]Mr. Nadler and other Democrats complained about the pace and quality of the data administration officials had provided them before the hearings. On Monday night, administration officials sent a trove of data that committee Democrats had requested months earlier, including a report documenting hundreds of allegations of sexual abuse reported by minors at detention facilities over the past several years.More than 2,700 children were separated from their parents at the border under President Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy of prosecuting anyone caught crossing the border illegally, even those with families seeking asylum on humanitarian grounds.The subpoenas are part of a larger effort, led by Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the oversight panel, and other Democratic committee chairmen to compel public testimony on a range of issues from officials with the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Health and Human Services.While the subpoenas do not initially call for the secretaries to testify, congressional aides said they had not ruled out that possibility.Caitlin B. Oakley, a spokeswoman for Mr. Azar, would not say if he intended to comply. The Health and Human Services Department “understands and appreciates the important role of congressional oversight,” she said in a statement.Kerri Kupec, a spokeswoman for Mr. Barr, suggested the committee should receive the documents from the other two departments. “The documents requested by the House Oversight Committee should be obtained from the originating agencies — here, H.H.S. and D.H.S,” she said, referring to the Departments of Health and Human Services and Homeland Security. “The Department of Justice is currently representing H.H.S. and D.H.S. in litigation and the information requested was obtained in the course of that representation.”Aides to Ms. Nielsen did not immediately return requests for comment.Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the committee’s top Republican, asked Mr. Cummings in a letter this week to reconsider the wide issuance of subpoenas.The Trump policy of prosecuting all adults crossing the border led to the practice of separating families and caring for the children in licensed facilities while trying to place them with a relative, because a previous court settlement had restricted the detention of children. The Department of Homeland Security struggled to track families and their children after the policy was put in place last spring — and did not create a comprehensive family reunification policy until a federal judge intervened.Mr. Trump eventually relented on the family separations, and a federal judge in California halted them in June. But in January, the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services reported that thousands more families might have been separated than previously reported.Democrats, whose questions were largely ignored by the administration before they took control of the House in January, leveled their sharpest questions on Tuesday at Scott Lloyd, who until recently oversaw the Department of Health and Human Services’ refugee resettlement program, which oversees the carrying out of the policy.Mr. Lloyd spoke so softly that committee members craned over the rostrum to hear his answers. He struggled to explain why his agency initially failed to track migrant families separated as part of the policy.When Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrat of Texas, asked about a report that Mr. Lloyd had instructed department staff members to stop maintaining a database used to track separated children and families, Mr. Lloyd responded by saying the report was “incorrect,” but offered no further explanation.In prepared remarks, Mr. Lloyd, an anti-abortion activist who had no prior experience administering refugee programs before being placed in his former post, laid some of the blame on the Homeland Security Department, saying that “D.H.S. had not consistently adhered” to “processes” used to identify and track migrant families.Sitting next to Mr. Lloyd at the witness table was Cmdr. Jonathan White of the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, a career federal official who repeatedly warned him last year that the family separation policy could cause permanent trauma to young children.Commander White said that he raised his opposition to the policy “in every conversation we had about family separation” and that he “raised those concerns” with Mr. Lloyd’s staff and other top officials at the Department of Health and Human Services last summer, when detention facilities were overwhelmed by families detained at the border.Research showed that the policy “had very significant and lifelong psychological impacts” on the children who were detained, he added.In an extraordinary exchange, Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, asked Mr. Lloyd if he had heeded Commander White’s warnings by intensifying efforts to create a comprehensive plan for tracking and reuniting families.“I did not direct anybody to not plan,” Mr. Lloyd responded.When Ms. Jayapal asked him if he informed “anyone above you” that the detention policy could harm children, Mr. Lloyd replied, “I did not.”In another heated exchange, Commander White bristled when Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida, sharply questioned him about new data, provided by the Department of Health and Human Services to the committee late Monday, that documented thousands of allegations of sexual abuse at detention facilities overseen by the department.The report, compiled by the Justice Department, showed that there were 1,226 allegations of sexual abuse made to the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the Department of Health and Human Services in 2018, which was largely in keeping with the number of reports filed in the previous three years; 348 of them were deemed serious enough to warrant a Justice Department investigation. Fifty-six involved staff members at detention centers.“That is false!” Commander White shouted, as Mr. Deutch read the numbers.Later, he apologized for his outburst and said that the “vast majority of allegations proved to be unfounded” and that he was not aware of any accusations against staff members that were found to have merit."
119,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday adopted a strict interpretation of a federal immigration law, saying it required the detention of immigrants facing deportation without the possibility of bail if they had committed crimes, including minor ones, no matter how long ago they had been released from criminal custody.The vote was 5 to 4, with the court’s more conservative justices in the majority. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing for the majority, said the plain language of a federal law required the result.Justice Stephen G. Breyer summarized his dissent from the bench, a sign of profound disagreement. He said the majority had violated the nation’s basic values.“The greater importance of the case,” he said, “lies in the power that the majority’s interpretation grants the government. It is a power to detain persons who committed a minor crime many years before. And it is a power to hold those persons, perhaps for many months, without an opportunity to obtain bail.”Justice Alito said the law may be subject to constitutional challenges in individual cases, a subject that was not before the justices. It was clear, he wrote, that Congress had required the secretary of Homeland Security to take into custody immigrants released from criminal custody even if years had passed in the meantime.“An official’s crucial duties are better carried out late than never,” Justice Alito wrote.Cecillia Wang, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the immigrants challenging the law, said the decision was part of a worrisome trend.“For two terms in a row now,” she said, “the Supreme Court has endorsed the most extreme interpretation of immigration detention statutes, allowing mass incarceration of people without any hearing, simply because they are defending themselves against a deportation charge.”The case concerned a law, enacted in 1996, which included a contested phrase. It said federal authorities “shall take into custody any alien” convicted of certain crimes, some serious and some minor, “when the alien is released.” The key word was “when.”Immigrants’ rights advocates said the law required prompt detention. Lawyers for the federal government said immigrants convicted of crimes may be detained years after their release.The difference matters, for hundreds and perhaps thousands of immigrants, because people detained under the law are not entitled to a bail hearing to determine whether they are dangerous or pose a flight risk.The plaintiffs included people who entered the country illegally, tourists or students who overstayed their visas and lawful permanent residents. Among them were immigrants who arrived in the United States legally as infants, committed minor crimes like possessing marijuana and were detained years after completing their sentences.The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, concluded that the law requires mandatory detention only if the federal authorities take immigrants into custody soon after they are released.“Because Congress’s use of the word ‘when’ conveys immediacy,” Jacqueline H. Nguyen wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel, “we conclude that the immigration detention must occur promptly upon the aliens’ release from criminal custody.”Justice Alito wrote that such a strict deadline could allow local authorities opposed to federal immigration policy to frustrate the goals of the federal law.“State and local officials sometimes rebuff the government’s request that they give notice when a criminal alien will be released,” he wrote. He cited statistics indicating that there were tens of thousand of such refusals in 48 states from January 2014 to September 2016.“Under these circumstances, it is hard to believe that Congress made the secretary’s mandatory-detention authority vanish at the stroke of midnight after an alien’s release,” he wrote.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh joined all or most of the majority opinion.In a concurring opinion, Justice Kavanaugh wrote that the question before the court was a narrow one.He said it was beyond dispute that the government can deport immigrants convicted of some crimes and that it can detain them during deportation proceedings.The question the court decided, he wrote, was merely whether “the executive branch’s mandatory duty to detain a particular noncitizen when the noncitizen is released from criminal custody remains mandatory if the executive branch fails to immediately detain the noncitizen when the noncitizen is released from criminal custody.”It would be odd, he wrote, for that requirement to change, for example, “if the executive branch fails to immediately detain the noncitizen because of resource constraints or because the executive branch cannot immediately locate and apprehend the individual in question.”In dissent, Justice Breyer wrote that the case was neither narrow nor technical.“Under the government’s view,” he wrote, “the aliens subject to detention without a bail hearing may have been released from criminal custody years earlier, and may have established families and put down roots in a community.”“These aliens,” Justice Breyer wrote, “may then be detained for months, sometimes years, without the possibility of release; they may have been convicted of only minor crimes — for example, minor drug offenses, or crimes of ‘moral turpitude’ such as illegally downloading music or possessing stolen bus transfers; and they sometimes may be innocent spouses or children of a suspect person.”Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined the dissent in the case, Nielsen v. Preap, No. 16-1363."
120,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court added eight cases to its docket on Friday, including ones on how gun laws apply to undocumented immigrants and whether the police may have blood drawn from unconscious motorists suspected of drunken driving.The court took no action on an unusually large number of pending petitions on significant issues, including President Trump’s efforts to shut down a program that shields some 700,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation and to bar most transgender people from military service.Other petitions under consideration concern an Indiana abortion law, a New York City gun control ordinance, a New Jersey ruling barring government grants to repair churches and whether a federal civil rights law prohibits job discrimination against gay, lesbian and transgender workers.If the court is to hear any of those cases this term, it will have to act soon. If it does not grant review by next week, the court’s past practices indicate that any cases it does eventually agree to hear will not be argued until its next term starts in October.The case concerning immigrants and guns involves Hamid M. Rehaif, who came to the United States from the United Arab Emirates to study at the Florida Institute of Technology on a student visa. He was dismissed for academic reasons after three semesters but stayed in the United States.About a year after he left school, Mr. Rehaif went to a shooting range, rented a gun and bought ammunition. Six days later, a worker at a hotel where was staying told the authorities that he had been acting suspiciously. When he was questioned by an F.B.I. agent, Mr. Rehaif admitted to visiting the firing range. He allowed a search of his room, which turned up the remaining ammunition.Mr. Rehaif was charged with violating a federal law that makes it a crime for people “illegally or unlawfully in the United States” to possess “any firearm or ammunition.” Another provision of the law says that violations of it must be made knowingly. Mr. Rehaif was convicted and sentenced to a 18 months in prison.The question in the case, Rehaif v. United States, No. 17-9560, was whether prosecutors had to prove not only that Mr. Rehaif knew he possessed a gun or ammunition, but also that he knew he was in the United States unlawfully.The United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit affirmed his conviction, ruling that a trial judge had properly instructed the jury that “the government is not required to prove that the defendant knew that he was illegally or unlawfully in the United States.”In urging the Supreme Court to hear the case, Mr. Rehaif relied on a 2012 concurrence from Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, who at the time was a federal appeals court judge in Denver. Judge Gorsuch wrote that logic and the rules of grammar required proof that every element of the crime in question had been committed knowingly. “It makes no sense,” he wrote, “to read the word ‘knowingly’ as so modest that it might blush in the face of the very first element only to regain its composure and reappear at the second.”The case on drawing blood from motorists, Mitchell v. Wisconsin, No. 18-6210, concerns Gerald P. Mitchell, a Wisconsin man arrested on suspicion of drunken driving. A police officer took him to a hospital, where he was slumped over and unresponsive. The officer instructed medical personnel to draw blood from Mr. Mitchell, and they found that his blood alcohol concentration was 0.22, which is above the legal limit for driving.It was Mr. Mitchell’s seventh offense for driving under the influence. He was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison, and he challenged his conviction on Fourth Amendment grounds.A splintered Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected that argument, relying on a state law that presumes drivers have consented to blood tests and punishes them if they decline to cooperate by revoking their driver’s licenses. The law says unconscious motorists are “presumed not to have withdrawn consent” to having their blood drawn.Twenty-eight states have similar laws, according to Mr. Mitchell’s petition seeking Supreme Court review, but some of them have been struck down after two recent Supreme Court decisions.In 2013, the court ruled that a warrant is ordinarily needed before drawing blood in drunken-driving investigations. In 2016, the court added that “motorists cannot be deemed to have consented to submit to a blood test on pain of committing a criminal offense.” In Mr. Mitchell’s case, the penalty of losing a driver’s license is a civil one.In urging the Supreme Court to deny review, lawyers for the state said Mr. Mitchell should not benefit because he “got so drunk that, after driving while under the influence, he passed out and became unconscious.”Mr. Mitchell should not, the state’s brief said, receive “the windfall of avoiding the lawful civil choice, which other drunk drivers must face, of having their blood drawn or losing their license.”"
121,"Like many stories of its kind — migrants fleeing unbearable lives — this one begins at sea, with 60 people jammed like livestock headed to market in a dinghy best suited for six.What makes the journey of these immigrants from the Middle East and Northern Africa different from others is not the dangers they braved before a Spanish rescue crew spotted them last summer in the Mediterranean. Every day, migrants risk everything when they set sail for Europe — drowning, starvation, suffocation and, if they reach land, rejection, detention, even enslavement by traffickers.What makes this story unique is its happy ending, almost as if in a fairy tale.It began on June 30, when Proactiva Open Arms, a search-and-rescue nongovernmental organization in Spain, spotted the dinghy in waters near Libya. Denied a dock by Italy and Malta — most of Europe has cracked down on migrants crossing the Mediterranean — Proactiva Open Arms secured a port of entry in Barcelona.Olmo Calvo, a Madrid-based photographer who has spent more than a decade documenting migrants, was with Proactiva Open Arms when it found the migrants and photographed the rescue, as he has others. From the beginning, Mr. Calvo said, this group was charmed.They were afforded opportunities most migrants rescued at sea never receive, he said, including living quarters and help in seeking asylum. The usual end to migrants’ dreams, Mr. Calvo said, is “they are deported or live irregular lives for many years. What is sure is that they all have a very hard time trying to obtain residency and constructing a life with minimal dignity in Europe.”This group, which included five women and four children, was immediately assured acceptance. They were relocated to an immigrant reception center approximately 70 miles, or a little more than 110 kilometers, away from Barcelona, in a picturesque city called Reus. For six months, the refugees have had language classes in the morning and workshops in the afternoon to help them prepare to work and live independently.At a time when “illegal immigration” has become a political buzz saw — when the United States president is demanding $5.7 billion for a border wall and European states have agreed to reject migrants — Reus has replaced hostility with humanity.In a move that underscored the commitment to the newest residents, city officials were convinced by a social media campaign to invite several of the migrants to join their largest annual celebration, the Festival of the Three Kings, on Jan. 6, or Epiphany.That’s where Edu Bayer, a Barcelona-based freelance photographer, found this story’s extraordinary next chapter.Reus invited an African immigrant to play Balthazar, one of the three kings, or Magi, who took gifts to baby Jesus in the manger, and others to play his assistants. Balthazar, considered by Western church tradition to be the King of Arabia, and a Moor, has traditionally been played in blackface in Spain.“In Spain, it is a big honor to be invited to be a king in the Three Kings Parade,” said Mr. Bayer, who knew he wanted to document this occasion. “Nowadays, it is a multitudinous tradition and deeply rooted throughout Spain. Inviting recently arrived African refugees is a unique case in a major town in Spain.”The festival, as his photos show, was a joyous crush of celebrants. The Africans, Mr. Bayer said, “were ecstatic and told me they wanted to do it again next year.”When Mr. Calvo, a friend, showed him photos from the Open Arms rescue six months earlier, Mr. Bayer was struck by one man: Honoré Becha, a father of four from Cameroon who left for work in 2014, only to be kidnapped, tortured and enslaved for four years before he managed to escape. He was the same man chosen to play Balthazar.Mr. Bayer said he saw Mr. Becha “acting as a leader in a small rubber boat in the middle of the ocean. That vision was crazy, to see how a person’s character makes its way into such opposite situations.”Two weeks after the Three Kings celebration, the Spanish government seized the boat used to rescue the 60 migrants. It grounded the boat for not taking rescued migrants to ports closer to their rescue point, Italy or Malta, though both countries have refused to let the boat dock.Mr. Bayer said he wanted to document a positive immigration story entwined with Spain’s most hallowed holiday.“For me,” he said, “seeing that and remembering the situation in the rescue mission was a revelation of the incredible plot twists that life may have.”Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

122,"WASHINGTON — As he makes his case for building a border wall, President Trump says that his predecessors have secretly confided in him that they should have done it themselves. The only problem: All of the living presidents say that’s not true.Former President Jimmy Carter said on Monday that he never had such a conversation with Mr. Trump, making him the last of the veterans of the Oval Office to dispute the assertion. “I have not discussed the border wall with President Trump and do not support him on the issue,” Mr. Carter said in a statement.Aides to the other living presidents — Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama — have all likewise denied Mr. Trump’s claim. Former President George Bush, who died in November, was in failing health throughout Mr. Trump’s administration and did not have any discussion with the current president about substantive issues, according to people close to him.This would not be the first time Mr. Trump has bragged about conversations that never happened. In 2017, he publicly claimed that the head of the Boy Scouts called him to praise a speech as the best ever given to the organization. He also asserted that the president of Mexico had called him to say that Mr. Trump’s enforcement efforts at the border were deterring Central Americans from crossing into Mexico because they knew they could no longer get into the United States.After both the Boy Scouts leader and President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico denied making such calls, the White House acknowledged that they never happened. But the president’s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, insisted that Boy Scouts leaders and Mr. Peña Nieto had said things like that in person, just not on the telephone.The White House did not respond to requests on Friday or Monday to explain the president’s latest statement. A senior administration official, who insisted on anonymity to address the matter, said Mr. Trump might have been referring to public comments made by previous presidents on behalf of border security, though not the wall specifically or directly to Mr. Trump.In an interview with “Today” on NBC aired Tuesday morning, Vice President Mike Pence defended the president’s comments while suggesting that they were not based on actual conversations with his predecessors.“I know the president has said that that was his impression from previous administrations, previous presidents,” Mr. Pence said. “I know I’ve seen clips of previous presidents talking about the importance of border security, the importance of addressing the issue of illegal immigration.”The issue came up on Friday when Mr. Trump held an expansive news conference in the Rose Garden about his standoff with Congress over funding for a wall. “This should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me,” he said. “And they all know it. Some of them have told me that we should have done it.”While in office, the younger Mr. Bush signed legislation authorizing 700 miles of fencing. But he has said that stronger border enforcement should be paired with an overhaul of rules making it possible for some of the millions of immigrants in the country illegally to stay. A spokesman said Mr. Bush had not discussed the issue with Mr. Trump. Mr. Clinton, Mr. Obama and Mr. Carter are on record opposing Mr. Trump’s wall.Mr. Trump has not interacted with any of his predecessors in any meaningful way since his inauguration. None of the five former presidents alive when Mr. Trump was elected in 2016 voted for him, even the Republicans. The elder Mr. Bush voted for Hillary Clinton, and the younger Mr. Bush told the author Mark K. Updegrove that he voted for “none of the above.”Mr. Trump has not met with any of his predecessors in two years in office. He called the younger Mr. Bush to offer condolences when his father died, and the first time he saw any of the former presidents since taking office was at the funeral a few days later. He shook Mr. Obama’s hand and Mr. Bush came over to shake his, but none of the former presidents had any extended words with the incumbent."

None of the five former presidents alive when Mr. Trump was elected in 2016 voted for him, even the Republicans. The elder Mr. Bush voted for Hillary Clinton, and the younger Mr. Bush told the author Mark K. Updegrove that he voted for “none of the above.”Mr. Trump has not met with any of his predecessors in two years in office. He called the younger Mr. Bush to offer condolences when his father died, and the first time he saw any of the former presidents since taking office was at the funeral a few days later. He shook Mr. Obama’s hand and Mr. Bush came over to shake his, but none of the former presidents had any extended words with the incumbent."
124,"By many measures, America is thriving. The economy is humming, and unemployment is at 4 percent. High-school graduation rates are at an all-time high, and teenage pregnancy rates are at an all-time low. The crime rate is way down, and illegal immigration has been declining for over a decade.And yet: Polls show that three in five Americans think the country is on the wrong track. A majority expect things to get worse in the coming year. The president’s job approval numbers are underwater; Congress’s even more so.As President Trump prepares to deliver his delayed State of the Union address on Tuesday, he might want to ask himself why people are so unsettled.Our dysfunctional political system is surely taking a toll. Witness the recent partial government shutdown over the president’s demand for $5.7 billion in border-wall funding: For 35 days, a quarter of the federal government was derailed and 800,000 workers stripped of their livelihood, at an estimated loss of $3 billion in economic activity. All in service of nothing but a presidential tempest.One certainty: There was not — and is not — a border emergency meriting the infliction of such pain and damage, or the waste of billions on a futile wall. Mr. Trump has said that his big speech on Tuesday will “cover a lot of territory” and emphasize unity. Considering that he pledged the same last year, it’s wise to remain skeptical. But if he is interested in assuring the public that he can see beyond his narrow politicking on immigration to tackle truly urgent problems, here’s a starter list of possibilities:Health care. “We’re going to have insurance for everybody,” Mr. Trump promised. Instead, after laboring to gut the Affordable Care Act, he has so far produced only higher premiums and, according to a recent Gallup survey, seven million more uninsured Americans.Opioids. Mr. Trump was on the right track when, in October 2017, he declared opioid abuse a public health emergency. Yet almost 50,000 Americans died of opioid overdoses in 2017, more than were ever killed by guns or H.I.V. in a single year. Economic inequality. “In many ways this is the greatest economy in the HISTORY of America and the best time EVER to look for a job!” the president tweeted last June. Not for all Americans. Real wages have barely budged for decades; the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour has not risen in nearly 10 years. Though oversimplified, Bernie Sanders’s claim that the top 0.1 percent control almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent is basically correct. Before falling silent on the question, Trump once vowed to eliminate a tax loophole that benefits wealthy hedge fund managers and private equity executives; that might be one proposal on which he could team up with the newly Democratic House.Infrastructure. The president once sought $1.5 trillion in new spending on infrastructure, but Congress allocated only $21.2 billion — or slightly more than 1 percent of Mr. Trump’s pledge. One-quarter of bridges in the United States are structurally deficient or not designed to handle the current traffic, the Department of Transportation estimates. The lead contamination in the water system of Flint, Mich., shocked America, but it was one of many examples of lead-poisoned water around the country. New York’s subways and public housing have fallen into decrepitude. Schools in Baltimore went without heat during last winter.Foreign policy. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump pledged a Middle East peace plan. Where is it? Meanwhile, we are spending roughly $700 billion annually on the military. Our troops have been fighting in Afghanistan for 17 years. Thousands more troops remain in Iraq. The high price of higher ed. Student-loan debt has topped $1.5 trillion and now constitutes the second-largest category of consumer debt, behind only mortgages. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who recently declared the debt load a “crisis in higher education,” has proposed no credible plan to address it.Gun safety. “We’ve seen too much of it, and we’re going to stop it,” Mr. Trump said in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting last February. Yet in 2017, more people were killed by guns than in any other of the past 50 years and at the highest rate since the crack epidemic of the mid-1990s. Climate change. Most scientists — and nations — see it as the mother of all crises. Mr. Trump’s approach thus far: champion fossil fuels and, when the weather gets chilly, tweet a joke about how the nation could use more global warming. Compromise on how to address the climate crisis will be hard to come by. But if the nation’s leaders are going to have a showdown, can’t it at least be over a real problem? "
125,"ALPHARETTA, Ga. — For the last four years, 21 Savage has been one of the stalwarts of Atlanta rap, a rising star who has collaborated with Drake and Cardi B, among many others, and become one of the signature voices in the city. His December album “I Am > I Was” spent two weeks at the top of the Billboard chart, and his collaboration with Post Malone, “Rockstar,” was nominated for two Grammys.With that success has come more visibility. In late January, he performed his single “A Lot” on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” adding a new verse in which he rapped about children being separated from their parents at the border.A few days later, early in the morning on Super Bowl Sunday, Feb. 3, 21 Savage (born She’yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph) was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who said he was an “unlawfully present United Kingdom national” who had overstayed his visa.He remained in ICE custody at the Irwin County Detention Center in South Georgia until Feb. 13, when he was released on $100,000 bond. The next day, he was in a hotel room in a suburb north of Atlanta, surrounded by several members of his legal team. Dressed in somber all-black, he spoke at length about his childhood, his time in detention, the Grammy Awards ceremony he missed and how growing up without legal status shaped the person he became. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.Do you remember first arriving here when you were young?Yeah, everything was like, bigger. I come from the poor side of London. My grandma house is real skinny. So when we first moved here, we was living in the hood still, but it was, like, way bigger. The toilet size, the bathroom size, it was just different. But I fell in love with it. It’s all I know.Did you have a British accent?Yeah, I had a accent, ’cause my first day of school they was making fun of me so I beat somebody up, and they was calling me “taekwondo kid.” My mama whupped me, she made me stay in the house. So I know I had a accent, but I been here 20 years — I don’t know what happened to it.Do you remember when you became aware that your status wasn’t settled?Probably like the age when you start to get your driver’s license. I couldn’t never take driver’s ed, I couldn’t never go get a job. About that age.Was it something you wanted to get taken care of?It felt impossible. It got to the point where I just learned to live without it. ’Cause I still ain’t got it, I’m 26, and I’m rich. So, just learned to live without it.Like a lot of other immigrants.We struggled but we couldn’t get food stamps, we couldn’t get government assistance. I learned how to live without. You know in school, when you get to a certain age, your clothes make you popular? I learned how to be popular without that. People respected me just for me.Do you think the situation taught you to carry yourself a certain way?It made me who I am. I wouldn’t write it no other way if I had the choice. If they said, “Hey, you could start your life over and make yourself a citizen,” I wouldn’t have never did it. I still want to go through this right here ’cause it made me who I am, it made me strong.Were you aware that there was a possibility that at some point you might not be able to stay in the country?Yeah, for sure. It’s like my worst nightmare. That’s why it’s always been trying to get corrected. Even if you got money, it ain’t easy. It ain’t no favoritism, and I respect it, I honestly respect it. It would be kind of messed up if they treated rich immigrants better than poor immigrants, I think.How draining was it being in detention, especially with the uncertainty of how long it was going to last?It really wasn’t jail, it was the possibility of me not being able to live in this country no more that I’ve been living in my whole life. All that just going through your head, like, “Damn, I love my house, I ain’t gonna be able to go in my house no more? I ain’t gonna be able to go to my favorite restaurant that I been going to for 20 years straight?” That’s the most important thing. If you tell me, “I’ll give you 20 million to go stay somewhere you ain’t never stayed,” I’d rather be broke. I’ll sit in jail to fight to live where I’ve been living my whole life.I’m sure you were spending a lot of time in your head.I could have made myself go crazy. I think they really try to break you. It’s like we gonna put you in jail and we gonna make you fight your case the slowest you can fight it so that you just want to go home. Nobody want to sit in jail, especially if they don’t have the money to fight it and they ain’t been to court in three months.What do you think has happened in your life that gave you a different perspective?It was what was at stake. It’s like, I got three kids, my mama, everything that I know is here in Atlanta. I’m not leaving Atlanta without a fight. We gon’ fight all the way till the last day even if that mean I sit in jail for 10 years.Were you upset about missing the Grammys?Nah, I was stressed about getting out. The Grammys is the Grammys, but when you in jail, the Grammys is nothing. I got to watch it. By that time they had put a TV in my room.Was the original plan that you’d be part of the Post Malone performance?Yeah I was supposed to perform. He wore the 21 Savage shirt, so I felt like I was there. I don’t care what nobody say — everybody in that building who’s connected to this culture, I was on their mind in some type of way. That’s all that mattered. They didn’t have to say it ’cause everybody knew it. It was in the air. All the people that was there, they said the words in other places and that matter just as much. All the big artists was vocal about the situation, so I was appreciative. Even the memes.They didn’t stress you out?Some of them was funny — I ain’t gonna lie. I was appreciative of that. I coulda been another person who just, “He locked up? Damn,” and nobody said nothing. Some people, I see why they was mad. It ain’t about the meme, it’s about the bigger picture. But I done been through way worse things in my life than somebody putting me on a meme. I been shot — what is a meme? A meme is nothing. That’s something on the internet that I can do like this [turns over phone] and never see again. I look at bullet scars every day, so it’s like, a meme, bro?Do you feel a responsibility to speak up about your circumstances?Yeah, I feel a responsibility. My situation is important ’cause I represent poor black Americans and I represent poor immigrant Americans. You gotta think about all the millions of people that ain’t 21 Savage that’s in 21 Savage shoes.Do you feel an urge to put some of this experience into music?Not right now, ’cause I feel like me putting it into music got me in this situation, kind of."

127,"OXON HILL, Md. — President Trump said on Saturday that he planned to issue an executive order that would help guarantee free speech at colleges and universities by putting their federal aid at risk if they do not protect the viewpoints of students of all political stripes.The president made the announcement during a rambling two-hour speech to activists at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, but he did not provide any details about the possible executive order. Several White House officials did not respond to emails or telephone calls seeking additional information.The White House did not respond to questions about when the president might sign the order.The issue of free speech on college campuses has for years been a cause célèbre among young conservative activists, who point to instances around the country in which conservative voices have been shunned by liberal students and professors.The crowd, which included many college-age conservatives, welcomed Mr. Trump’s announcement, leaping to their feet when he pledged to hold school administrators accountable for ensuring that conservatives were permitted to express their views on campuses, often places where liberals outnumber them.The president cited the case of Hayden Williams, a young activist who was beaten up last month as he was recruiting for a conservative organization at the University of California, Berkeley — long one of the leading centers of liberal academic thought.“If they want our dollars, and we give it to them by the billions, they’ve got to allow people like Hayden and many great young people, and old people, to speak,” Mr. Trump said, drawing huge applause.Mr. Trump invited Mr. Williams, who was in the audience, to address the crowd briefly, calling him strong and urging him to sue the university because of the episode. Mr. Williams thanked the president for supporting young conservatives such as himself.Floyd Abrams, a leading First Amendment lawyer, expressed concern about the president’s proposed executive order.“The visage of the most congenitally anti-free-speech administration in American history making a series of decisions as to which campus conduct is pro- or anti-free speech is more than alarming,” Mr. Abrams said in an email Saturday afternoon.The president has raised a similar threat before, implying he would withhold federal funds from Berkeley after it canceled a speech by Milo Yiannopoulos, a conservative speaker and professional provocateur.Students at multiple campuses threatened to boycott events where Mr. Yiannopoulos was to speak, forcing them to cancel the appearances.In 2017, at Claremont McKenna College, a private liberal arts school in Southern California, about 250 people blocked entrances to an auditorium where Heather Mac Donald, a conservative writer who has criticized the Black Lives Matter movement, was speaking.That same year, students at Middlebury College in Vermont disrupted a speech by Charles Murray, a scholar known for his 1994 book, “The Bell Curve,” which links socioeconomic status with race and intelligence. Protesters chanted, “racist, sexist, anti-gay, Charles Murray, go away!”It is unclear how Mr. Trump’s executive order would change that dynamic, though he hinted that universities and colleges would have to do more to prevent such demonstrations or risk the loss of grant money that the institutions receive from the federal government to support research.He said the executive order would “require colleges to support free speech if they want federal research” funding.It is not clear how long the idea has been under consideration at the White House or whether the president decided to pursue an executive order because of the episode involving Mr. Williams, which Fox News and other conservative outlets covered extensively.It is also unclear how much the president can withhold federal aid to colleges without congressional action. Previous discussions of that issue in conservative circles have focused on passing legislation to change the requirements for colleges to request grant funding from the federal government.Mr. Trump made the announcement during one of the longest speeches he has ever delivered, speaking for more than two hours to the thousands of activists at the conclusion of the three-day annual convention.The campaign-like speech touched on dozens of hot-button issues, including illegal immigration. The president accused “open border” Democrats of letting murderers, rapists and drug dealers into the country.“They give us some very bad people — people with big, long crime records,” he said of Central American countries including Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. “Murderers. Killers. Drug dealers. Human traffickers. It’s so sad to see how stupid we have been.”More than two years after he took office, Mr. Trump once again insisted that his inaugural crowd was larger than his critics have admitted. He bragged about the state of the economy and denounced Democrats who he said supported socialism.He denigrated the trade deals made by previous politicians and boasted about the tariffs that the United States had imposed on China and other countries. And he repeatedly mocked the “new green deal” offered by some Democrats, saying it would destroy the economy and take away people’s cars and airplanes.“Somebody described it as a high school term paper, written by a poor student,” he joked."
128,"American border officers sent tear gas into Mexico early Tuesday to drive away about 150 migrants trying to cross the border into the United States, the authorities said.In a statement, the Customs and Border Protection agency said that the migrants tried to climb over and crawl under the border fence near San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico — the same area where American officers fired tear gas across the border late last year and where Mexico is struggling to handle thousands of migrants who have fled violence and poverty in Central America.Early Tuesday, as migrants gathered at the border fence there, several teenagers with heavy jackets, blankets and rubber mats tried to cross or cover concertina wire at the barrier. Others began throwing rocks over the fence at the American officers, according to the statement.The American officers also saw members of the group try “to lift toddler-sized children up and over the concertina wire,” dangerously so, it said.At this point, the agency said, its officers used smoke, pepper spray and tear gas “upwind of the rock throwers and south of the border fence” and not toward migrants already in the United States or trying to cross at the fence line.The officers used tear gas “only after there were rocks and there were kids involved,” said a spokesman for the agency, Andrew Meehan. “Then it became an issue of safety for the officers and frankly safety of the migrants.”At least three volleys of tear gas were sent across the border, according to The Associated Press, which said the gas affected women and children.In its account, Customs and Border Protection said that “no agents witnessed any of the migrants at the fence line, including children, experiencing effects of the chemical agents, which were targeted at the rock throwers.”After the tear gas was deployed, most of the migrants fled back under the fence and away from the border, Mr. Meehan said.Twenty-five migrants were detained, including two teenagers, the agency said.The Trump administration’s Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Customs and Border Protection, has come under intense scrutiny for how it has treated migrants at the border and in the United States.Rights experts have questioned whether the firing of tear gas across the border is justifiable or legal; the number of detained migrant children has soared to the highest ever recorded; and at least two children have died in United States custody.Mr. Meehan could not immediately provide data about how often border officers use tear gas or pepper spray, citing the government shutdown’s effect on resources, and said the agency would review the incident as it does all uses of force.“The use of those types of nonlethals is fairly common in law enforcement organizations,” he said, “but the number of uses of force for C.B.P. has been historically down year over year, in large part because of the way we review and improve our policies.”"
129,"[Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.]Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman who just joined the Democratic presidential race, gained an instant following last year when he came within three points of unseating Senator Ted Cruz.But while he was able to stand out in his Senate campaign with a broadly liberal message and no signature policy issue, that broad message is not likely to be enough in a ballooning Democratic field.This time, the specifics are going to be crucial. Here’s a look at where Mr. O’Rourke stands on some major issues.As President Trump’s proposed border wall has become one of the biggest issues in American politics, Mr. O’Rourke has made immigration the centerpiece of his speeches.In addition to supporting the Dream Act and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, he has called for the closing of private immigrant detention centers, denounced the “militarization” of immigration enforcement and spoken out against the wall.[Beto O’Rourke announces candidacy, joins field filled with committed progressives]“We are not safe because of walls but in spite of walls,” he said at a rally in El Paso last month  held at the same time Mr. Trump was holding his own rally nearby. Far from extending a barrier across the entire border, he has said, he would like to remove the existing fencing in El Paso — one of the country’s largest border cities, and Mr. O’Rourke’s hometown.In his State of the Union address, Mr. Trump held up El Paso as an example of the need for a wall, claiming that the city had been one of the most dangerous in the United States until a border fence was built there.But the crime rate in El Paso actually fell long before the fence was built and rose afterward, and Mr. O’Rourke is holding up the city as an example of the lack of need for a wall.Mr. O’Rourke arguably first made his name when, after the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016, he live-streamed the sit-in he and other Democratic representatives were holding on the House floor in support of stricter gun laws.The Republican-controlled Congress did not pass any gun control legislation then, but Mr. O’Rourke continues to support similar policies, including universal background checks, magazine size limits and restrictions on some semiautomatic weapons.He also opposes concealed carry reciprocity, which would make concealed carry permits granted in any state valid nationwide, forcing states with strict licensing requirements to recognize permits from states with looser standards. It is one of the National Rifle Association’s legislative priorities.While Mr. O’Rourke supports universal health care — increasingly a litmus-test position for Democratic candidates — he hasn’t committed to a specific way to get there. During his Senate campaign, he suggested that universal health care could take the form of a single-payer system or “a dual system,” in which a government-run program would coexist with private insurance.He has given conflicting messages on the most prominent proposal, “Medicare for all.”In 2017, during his time in the House, he said unequivocally, “A single-payer ‘Medicare for all’ program is the best way to ensure all Americans get the health care they need.” But during his Senate campaign, he carefully avoided those words, calling instead for “universal, guaranteed, high-quality health care for all.”He does support expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and has urged Texas to do so. Other points in his 2018 platform included allowing the government to negotiate prescription drug prices with manufacturers and creating incentives for insurers to participate in the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges.When it comes to proposals for mitigating climate change, opponents frequently cite the potential costs of those plans. But Mr. O’Rourke has emphasized the financial impact of climate change itself. Billions of dollars that are spent on steps like sea walls, which would be critical if climate change continues unchecked, is money not spent on other priorities, he noted at a town-hall event with Columbia University students last month.At that event, Mr. O’Rourke spoke positively about the Green New Deal, calling it technically and logistically doable. As for its political prospects, “I don’t know,” he said. “That’s up to all of us, right?”He supports the Paris climate accords, and has also made a point of emphasizing effects that climate change is having: more storms like Hurricane Harvey, for instance, which devastated Texas.Mr. O’Rourke emphasized criminal justice in his 2018 campaign, focusing in particular on racial and economic inequities. In an op-ed in The Houston Chronicle, he described his own criminal record — he was arrested once for attempted forcible entry and once for drunken driving when he was in his 20s; both charges were dismissed — and argued that his success since then had been possible because of his race and economic status.“The chance that I had, and which I have made the most of, is denied to too many of our fellow Texans, particularly those who don’t look like me or have access to the same opportunities that I did,” he wrote.He called for closing private and for-profit prisons, decriminalizing marijuana and expunging the records of people previously convicted of possessing it, eliminating mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent crimes, and reforming the bail system so people charged with misdemeanors would not be incarcerated because of their inability to pay.He also emphasized rehabilitation for offenders released from prison, including the restoration of voting rights. Currently, those rights vary drastically by state.Like many of the Democratic candidates, Mr. O’Rourke has criticized Mr. Trump’s trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, which have hurt some farmers and blue-collar workers. In his Senate campaign, he emphasized the needs of farmers, calling for a stronger crop insurance program and federal investments in rural infrastructure, including high-speed internet, roads and schools.He has also drawn connections between agricultural policy and immigration policy, noting that immigrants — many of them undocumented — make up a large share of farm laborers. On that basis, he has cast immigration reform as an economic issue as well as a social one.“We should treat these individuals with dignity and respect,” he wrote on his website last year, “because they are a critical component of our agriculture communities.”"

131,"The number of migrant families crossing the southwest border has once again broken records, with unauthorized entries nearly double what they were a year ago, suggesting that the Trump administration’s aggressive policies have not discouraged new migration to the United States.More than 76,000 migrants crossed the border without authorization in February, an 11-year high and a strong sign that stepped-up prosecutions, new controls on asylum and harsher detention policies have not reversed what remains a powerful lure for thousands of families fleeing violence and poverty.“The system is well beyond capacity, and remains at the breaking point,” Kevin K. McAleenan, commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, told reporters in announcing the new data on Tuesday.The nation’s top border enforcement officer painted a picture of processing centers filled to capacity, border agents struggling to meet medical needs and thousands of exhausted members of migrant families crammed into a detention system that was not built to house them — all while newcomers continue to arrive, sometimes by the busload, at the rate of 2,200 a day.“This is clearly both a border security and a humanitarian crisis,” Mr. McAleenan said.[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]President Trump has used the escalating numbers to justify his plan to build an expanded wall along the 1,900-mile border with Mexico. But a wall would do little to slow migration, most immigration analysts say. While the exact numbers are not known, many of those apprehended along the southern border, including the thousands who present themselves at legal ports of entry, surrender voluntarily to Border Patrol agents and eventually submit legal asylum claims.The main problem is not one of uncontrolled masses scaling the fences, but a humanitarian challenge created as thousands of migrant families surge into remote areas where the administration has so far failed to devote sufficient resources to care for them, as is required under the law.The latest numbers stung an administration that has over the past two years introduced a rash of aggressive policies intended to deter migrants from journeying to the United States, including separating families, limiting entries at official ports and requiring some asylum seekers to wait in Mexico through the duration of their immigration cases.More than 50,000 adults are currently in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, the highest number ever.Despite targeted successes in certain areas — about 2,000 migrants who traveled in a caravan from Central America last year appeared to have given up their cause as of last month after being discouraged by long delays in Tijuana — migrants seem only to have adjusted their routes rather than turn back. Indeed, they are traveling in even larger numbers than before.[Read more about why more migrants are crossing the border.]Arrests along the southern border have increased 97 percent since last year, the Border Patrol said, with a 434 percent increase in the El Paso sector, which covers the state of New Mexico and the two westernmost counties of Texas. Families, mainly from Central America, continue to arrive in ever-larger groups in remote parts of the southwest.At least 70 such groups of 100 or more people have turned themselves in at Border Patrol stations that typically are staffed by only a handful of agents, often hours away from civilization. By comparison, only 13 such groups arrived in the last fiscal year, and two in the year before.Understanding what is happening on the border is difficult because, while the numbers are currently higher than they have been in several years, they are nowhere near the historic levels of migration seen across the southwest border. Arrests for illegally crossing the border reached up to 1.64 million in 2000, under President Clinton. In the 2018 fiscal year, they reached 396,579. For the first five months of the current fiscal year, 268,044 have been apprehended.The difference is that the nature of immigration has changed, and the demographics of those arriving now are proving more taxing for border officials to accommodate. Most of those entering the country in earlier years were single men, most of them from Mexico, coming to look for work. If they were arrested, they could quickly be deported.Now, the majority of border crossers are not single men but families — fathers from Honduras with adolescent boys they are pulling away from gang violence, mothers with toddlers from Guatemala whose farms have been lost to drought. While they may not have a good case to remain in the United States permanently, it is not so easy to speedily deport them if they arrive with children and claim protection under the asylum laws.Families with children can be held in detention for no longer than 20 days, under a much-debated court ruling, and since there are a limited number of detention centers certified to hold families, the practical effect is that most families are released into the country to await their hearings in immigration court. The courts are so backlogged that it could take months or years for cases to be decided. Some people never show up for court at all.Finally, detaining families even for the first few days after their arrival in the United States, while they are undergoing initial processing, is also a challenging job.Often arriving exhausted, dehydrated, and some of them requiring urgent medical care, the families need food, diapers, infant formula and space to play. They can often spend days inside cramped concrete cells that were built to house the previous generation of border crossers — young, single men who would likely be there only a few hours.As part of the announcements on Tuesday, Mr. McAleenan also said the agency is making sweeping changes to procedures for guaranteeing adequate medical care for migrants — an overhaul brought on by the deaths of two migrant children in the agency’s custody in December. The measures, which include comprehensive health screenings for all migrant children and a new processing center in El Paso that would help provide better shelter and medical care for migrant families, are an attempt to fix years of health care inadequacies that have left many at risk.The agency will also expand medical contracts to place health care practitioners — largely registered nurses and nurse practitioners — in “high-risk” and high-traffic locations along the border. It will also dedicate more money for translation services to meet increasing demand from Central Americans, many of whom speak indigenous languages and dialects and may not be able to communicate their needs in English or Spanish.[Read: Border Patrol Facilities Put Detainees With Medical Conditions at Risk]“These solutions are temporary and this situation is not sustainable,” Mr. McAleenan said.Mr. McAleenan said the authorities believe that the large numbers of families are coming because smugglers have effectively communicated across Central America that adults who travel with children will be allowed to enter and stay in the United States.Brian Hastings, the agency’s chief of law enforcement operations, said that since April 2018, border agents had detected nearly 2,400 “false families,” including cases in which migrants had falsely claimed to be related when they were not, or untruthfully claimed to be younger than 18.The throngs of new families are also affecting communities on the American side of the border. In El Paso, a volunteer network that temporarily houses the migrants after they are released from custody has had to expand to 20 facilities, compared with only three during the same period last year. Migrants are now being housed in churches, a converted nursing home and about 125 hotel rooms that are being paid for with donations.“We had never seen these kinds of numbers,” said Ruben Garcia, the director of the organization, called Annunciation House. He said that during one week in February, immigration authorities had released more than 3,600 migrants to his organization, the highest number in any single week since the group’s founding in 1978.For the most part, Mr. Garcia said that his staff and volunteer workers had been able to keep up with the surge, often making frantic calls to churches to request access to more space for housing families on short notice. But sometimes their best efforts were upended, he said, including on one day last week, when the authorities dropped off 150 more migrants than planned.“We just didn’t have the space,” Mr. Garcia said."
132,"Good morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)How Californians get power has been in the news a lot lately, between Pacific Gas & Electric’s  woes and Mayor Eric Garcetti’s recent announcement that the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power would phase out three natural gas power plants on its way toward 100 percent renewable energy sources.“We have an obligation to end dependence on fossil fuels, embrace the technologies of tomorrow, and prioritize renewable energy,” Mr. Garcetti said in a statement to The Times this week.The question now is how to do that.Today, the residential solar power provider Sunrun released a report with what its leaders said could be the answer: a mass deployment of residential solar panels, along with batteries, that collectively form a kind of virtual power plant operated by a utility.“If one of the challenges is that we want to decommission three of these gas plants, we believe that with rooftop solar and storage, we could pretty easily replace one of them by 2030,” said Lynn Jurich, Sunrun’s chief executive and co-founder.According to the report, although L.A. already has 36,000 homes with rooftop solar units, as a percentage, it’s fractional: 2.5 percent of residential customers, compared with San Diego’s 11 percent, or 139,000 homeowners.Expanding L.A.’s total to 75,000 homes and apartment buildings, with batteries, could provide enough power to replace one of the retiring plants and cost $60 million less, the report says.The batteries, Ms. Jurich said, would give customers a backup power source when it’s less sunny, addressing a primary concern about solar.[Read about Sunrun’s challenge to Tesla.]The report suggests a virtual power plant could also counter another concern about residential solar power: that upfront costs make it too expensive for many would-be customers.“You can contract with the utility, so you can use that credit,” she said.Sunrun, however, has an interest in promoting solar power. So how realistic is its suggestion?I put that question to Bill Powers, an engineer in San Diego who serves as an expert witness on behalf of consumers before utility regulators across the country.“What Sunrun is proposing is absolutely doable — it is the future and it will happen,” he told me. From a technological and cost standpoint, it would be straightforward to make the transition.“The problem,” he said, “is that it is so diametrically counter to the way investor-owned utilities and even large publicly owned utilities have made money and done business historically.”But, Mr. Powers said, as pushback against the investor-owned Pacific Gas & Electric has built up, large-scale solar power in L.A. could be a model for cities like San Francisco, which is exploring creating city-owned utilities.“What’s happening in the state is a general grass-roots fatigue with investor-owned utilities,” he said.Aura Vasquez, a commissioner for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said she thought that, ultimately, rooftop solar will be a big, cost-effective source of the city’s power in the future. But getting there will be the tough part.“Staff are excited and they want to do it,” she said, “but I don’t know if we really have the knowledge.”(We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

If someone forwarded it to you, sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox.Floating above the cactus-pear cocktails and gourmet tacos, a green mosaic rises above the plaza just on the Mexico side of the Tijuana border: ESTACION FEDERAL. There are Edison-bulb patio lights and metal fire pits. Textures of reclaimed wood and concrete and succulents. In the back, a food truck doubles as a southwestern mural, a blur of orange and yellow and purple.This Instagram-ready commons in chaotic Tijuana is the brainchild of Miguel Marshall, a cross-border entrepreneur whose vision of a binational border between Mexico and the United States has grown even more resolute in the era of President Trump. He is the chief executive of Centro Ventures, a Tijuana-based real estate development company that is creating work-and-living spaces like this, with carefully curated food, coffee, co-working units and even Airbnb lofts.Mr. Marshall’s entrepreneurial work has earned him cachet among business leaders in Mexico and the United States. He has been designated as one of Tijuana’s “global shapers” by the World Economic Forum, which holds the annual gathering of world economic leaders in Davos, Switzerland.Estacion Federal is just a five-minute walk from Mexico’s El Chaparral border crossing, “a little south of south San Diego, a little north of north Tijuana,” as the spot is promoted online. Mr. Marshall sees it as a prototype for rejuvenating the Mexican border city — part artistic community, part commuter waypoint and part gastro-utopia.His vision is to bring Americans and Mexicans together for good food, drinks and conversation.This project is partly grounded in his biography. Mr. Marshall was born in San Diego but grew up in Tijuana. He was named after his father, Michael Marshall, but his parents gave him the Spanish-language version of the name so he would not be bullied in Mexican schools.“I’m a border baby,” he said with a laugh.For several years, the border across the Southwest has been in the midst of an economic boom, with new businesses and stores springing up to serve middle-class Mexican customers who have permission to cross into the United States on day trips. The problem Mr. Marshall sees is that much of the investment along the border, at least in California, has happened on the American side.In San Ysidro — San Diego’s border district, on the American side — visitors can find hundreds of businesses, from big outlet malls to small family shops.On the Mexican side, by contrast, there are miles of run-down homes and parking garages. The neighborhood does little to show visitors Tijuana’s vibrant culture, Mr. Marshall said, or to entice Americans to venture south.“First impressions matter,” said Mr. Marshall, who slips repeatedly between Spanish and English when he talks. “The cross-border lifestyle, we’re trying to brand that as a way of living.”The small Estacion Federal plaza offers vegetarian tacos, pizza, carefully sourced coffee and a cocktail bar. It is all highly curated.On a recent Friday evening at the Cereus Bar, patrons from both sides of the border wore skinny jeans and leather jackets. The aesthetic was familiar — classic American hipsterdom by way of a CB2 catalog — augmented by the sounds and smells and tastes of gourmet Mexico. One of the signature cocktails is a prickly-pear drink made from the juice of cactus fruit — known as “tuna” in Spanish — sourced at Mercado Hidalgo, the famed farmers’ market in Tijuana. It is the most expensive item on the menu: 130 pesos, or a little less than $7.Mr. Marshall said he hoped to draw an American clientele to his plaza, but he also wants Cereus to be a neighborhood bar. He envisions young people leaving work in San Diego and stopping at the pizza and taco shops before a night out in Tijuana’s nightclub district.“The best of both worlds,” he said.—JOSE A. DEL REAL in San Ysidro, Calif., and Tijuana, MexicoJose is one of a team of Times journalists currently deployed along the border.

Or feedback about this newsletter? Email us at: crossingtheborder@nytimes.com.Some 76,000 migrants crossed the border without authorization in February, according to data released by the United States government on Tuesday.It was the fourth time in five months that the number of migrant families crossing the southwest border has broken records, border enforcement authorities said. The number was more than double the same period last year. Read the full story here, from Caitlin Dickerson, a Times immigration reporter.Miriam Jordan, a Times immigration correspondent, dived into those numbers and explained why, despite President Trump’s efforts to halt the arrival of undocumented migrants, they have continued to rise. The short version? More people from impoverished areas of Central America, and more families instead of single men, are choosing to make the journey. Read that story here. The border has been in the headlines in Washington this week. Here’s how to catch up, and go deeper.• On Wednesday, House Democrats grilled Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, over a host of border issues, including the deaths of migrant children in federal custody and last year’s policy of separating families at the border. She was defiant in the face of criticism of the administration, and defended President Trump’s claim that the situation at the border was a national emergency. Read the story here, and go here for clips of Ms. Nielsen’s testimony.• Ms. Nielsen was questioned about the care migrants receive in custody. A Times investigation found shortfalls in health care provided to migrants, who sometimes arrive with serious illness and injury.

135,"DENVER — Just hours stood between Jorge Zaldivar and his meeting with immigration officials, and so once again his family gathered to say goodbye.Nearly a million people in the United States have received deportation orders but have managed to stay in the country anyway, often hanging on through postponements granted to them at check-ins with immigration officials. For years, those appointments were largely routine, and most people went in expecting to receive another temporary reprieve.That changed when the Trump administration said it would expand deportation priorities to include anyone who had crossed the border illegally. And in the last two years, in households across the country, the dinner before a check-in has turned into a grim ritual, with families never sure whether or not this meal is the last they share together.[Read about a mother and daughter who were seeking asylum — they both have H.I.V. but only one was allowed entry.]The Zaldivar children — Francysco, 8, Aanahny, 10, Dyego, 14, Yolanda, 20, and Josefyna, 23 — all United States citizens, have lived in a cycle of check-ins and court dates for most of their lives. Their father crossed into the country illegally in 1997 and has been trying to gain legal residency through his wife, Christina, also a citizen, for more than a decade.That has failed, and the Zaldivars said goodbye to their father on June 7, 2017, on July 5, 2017, and on Jan. 10, 2018, and then four more times last year. In late February, The New York Times followed them on the night before Mr. Zaldivar’s latest immigration appointment.Ms. Zaldivar, 39, who is of Navajo and Southern Ute descent, never expected to be in this position. She married her husband in 2005, when she was a single mother of three. At the time, it did not occur to her to think much about his immigration status.“You don’t fall in love and say: ‘Hi, nice to meet you, do you have papers?’” she said. “I didn’t care if he had papers or not. He treated me right after an abusive marriage.”Mostly, she said, she experiences guilt and anger over what all this has done to her children. Her oldest daughter skipped college to help pay her father’s legal fees. Her middle son has started lashing out at teachers, unable to explain to them what is happening at home.At dinner, the house filled with relatives.When everyone had a plate of chicken and rice, Ms. Zaldivar called for silence.She had received an email earlier that day from a congressional aide helping with their case. The aide had heard from immigration officials.“Dad’s stay was denied,” Ms. Zaldivar said, looking at her children. “Tomorrow when he goes in to check in, they’re not going to let him come out.”In the morning, at the breakfast table, Ms. Zaldivar hauled out a blue tote she had prepared for her husband, with a list of medications and hotel-size toiletries, meant to help him if or when he arrived in Mexico.Mr. Zaldivar took out his wallet and removed his driver’s license, his worker’s permit and a piece of paper bearing his social security number.He handed them to his wife for safekeeping, and slipped $100 into the billfold.Then he went into his youngest daughter’s room, where he began to clean, packing her toys into the dollhouse, organizing the stacks of Girl Scout cookies.“I’m stressed,” he said. “I want to this to be over.”“Let’s go,” Ms. Zaldivar called.Mr. Zaldivar took the wheel of the family truck, and everyone climbed inside.Across town, on the yellowed grass outside the federal immigration building, a few activists had arrived to show their support.Mr. Zaldivar’s wife took his arm.“Ready?” he said quietly.Together they crossed the road, Ms. Zaldivar gripping the blue tote, and then disappeared.His children watched.Then, not 20 minutes in, a shout went up from one of the activists.The Zaldivars, both of them, were walking out the building’s glass doors.Ms. Zaldivar approached her children, her voice unsteady. Her husband had been granted one more monthlong postponement, she said, but this time “he has to come back with a ticket — a bus ticket, a plane ticket, something showing he is going to exit in 30 days.”"
136,"LOS ANGELES — In an attempt to determine who was behind the caravans that were bringing large numbers of migrants from Central America to the southwest border, the Trump administration created a list of activists and journalists whom they subjected to additional scrutiny when they entered the United States last year.Federal immigration authorities faced criticism on Thursday after an internal government document, obtained by NBC 7 San Diego, suggested that immigration activists and journalists were specifically singled out for extra screening at border entry points by the United States and Mexican governments.Many of those on the list had traveled with the migrant caravans as they arrived in Mexican border cities from Central America to seek asylum. Others on the list, according to lawyers representing them, had provided legal assistance or aid to migrants, but had not traveled with the caravans at all.Customs and Border Protection officials said they had identified people because they may have had information in connection to assaults against Border Patrol agents that took place last November and in January, but said that gathering this type of information was standard.“C.B.P. does not target journalists for inspection based on their occupation or their reporting,” Andrew Meehan, the agency’s assistant commissioner of public affairs, said in a statement, adding that C.B.P. “has policies in place that prohibit discrimination against arriving travelers and has specific provisions regarding encounters with journalists.”Nonetheless, the inspector general for the Homeland Security Department opened an inquiry last month, with C.B.P., “to ensure that all appropriate policies and practices were followed.”In Washington, lawmakers on the House Homeland Security Committee sent a letter on Thursday to Customs and Border Protection criticizing the list and said it raised serious legal and constitutional questions.Esha Bhandari, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, said that targeting reporters or advocates for secondary screening and extended detention on the basis of their work was a violation of their rights. Ms. Bhandari said the A.C.L.U. was monitoring developments in the cases and exploring all legal options.“The implications of this are really disturbing,” she said. “It is unconstitutional for the government to target people for punishment or retaliation solely based on their first amendment protected activity.”[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]Go Nakamura, a freelance photographer whose work has appeared in The New York Times and who was on the list, said he had suspected for several months that his name had been flagged to immigration officials.In an interview Thursday, he recalled being stopped by Mexican authorities in late December while he was near the border fence in Tijuana to take photographs of migrants. The officers asked to see Mr. Nakamura’s passport, something he had not experienced during other lengthy assignments on the border, he said. He thought it was strange when the officers took photos of his passport on cellphones.Mr. Nakamura, an American citizen, tried to re-enter the United States several days later, and initially faced routine questions. He was asked about his background, where he lived, where he went to school. He was also asked about when he began working as a photojournalist.But the questioning began to alarm Mr. Nakamura when an officer pulled out a document with pictures of about 10 to 14 faces and asked him to identify them.“They asked me if I recognized any of the faces,” Mr. Nakamura said. “I didn’t, so I said no. The officer who showed me the papers, she was asking me if I was connected with the organizers of the caravan. She was like, have you met the organizers or do I know the organizers?”“I felt like they thought I was a spy or something,” Mr. Nakamura said.Kitra Cahana, a freelance photographer on the list whose work has also appeared in The Times, said she was barred from entering Mexico on Jan. 17 while she was en route to photograph another caravan of migrants traveling through the country. As she was about to board a flight from Montreal to Detroit, she scanned her passport at a pre-clearance machine, which printed out a picture with an “X over my face.” She was taken into secondary questioning in Montreal, but was ultimately allowed to board her flight.In Mexico City, she was again detained. That time she was held for about 13 hours, she said, before being officially denied entry to Mexico.Mexican authorities confiscated her American passport and cellphone during that period. She was escorted to a flight back to Detroit. Later that month, on Jan. 26, she said she tried to cross into Mexico from Guatemala, and was denied entry.Ms. Bhandari said there were specific rules outlined by the Justice Department that the government must follow when questioning journalists, which, she said, Customs and Border Protection may have violated.“The existence of these dossiers can have a real chilling effect,” Ms. Bhandari said. “It can suggest to other journalists that if they dare to report on activities that are embarrassing to the United States government, you too can be singled out for this harsh treatment.”"
137,"Welcome to Crossing the Border, a limited-run weekly newsletter from The New York Times. Like what you see? Send this to a friend. If someone forwarded it to you, sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox.For weeks, President Trump has been criticized for exaggerating the brutality experienced by migrant women on the border as he makes his case for a wall.A Rose Garden address in January was only one of the times when Mr. Trump has made the claim:If the president was suggesting that such savagery occurs daily on America’s southern border, then he was indeed exaggerating. News organizations and immigrant advocate groups were quick to express skepticism. Trafficking experts told the news media they had not heard of such an episode.But there is some truth to the president’s descriptions of the threat of sexual assault and of women who have been duct-taped and bound.Undocumented women have been duct-taped and tied up before, during and after their migration to the United States, The Times discovered while reporting this story. Maybe not frequently, but it has happened.“Because I didn’t want to let them, they tied my feet together and my hands behind my back,” a 45-year-old Honduran woman told us in an interview. She said she was raped after her smugglers forced her into prostitution shortly after she illegally crossed the border in Texas. The woman, who now lives in Austin and who asked to be identified by her first name, Lucy, was held captive in a makeshift brothel in the South Texas city of McAllen.Human smuggling has grown more and more violent, as border security tightens and as the smuggling of people and drugs becomes costlier and riskier. In this particular kind of border crossing, the smugglers are paid thousands of dollars by the migrants, but the relationship resembles not seller and buyer but prisoner and warden.The smugglers are called coyotes, and the migrants are called pollos, or chickens, and these terms very much reflect the dehumanized nature of a migrant’s journey through the borderlands. Clients are sometimes forced to take off their shoes or strip to their underwear to prevent them from fleeing. The coyotes control when and what the migrants eat, and where they sleep. They decide when their debt can be considered paid.In one trailer home in Carrizo Springs, Tex., smugglers raped a Salvadoran woman and tortured two men — covering the men’s hands with plastic bags, putting their hands on a stool and pounding their fingers with a hammer — all because their relatives failed to pay the fees.And the smugglers are not the only culprits.In 2000, a Border Patrol agent in Arizona, Dennis M. Johnson, was charged with sexual assault and kidnapping after he forced a 21-year-old migrant from El Salvador to disrobe and perform oral sex on him while she was handcuffed with her hands behind her back.In 2014 near McAllen, three Honduran migrants — a woman, her daughter and her daughter’s 14-year-old friend — crossed the Rio Grande and came across a uniformed Border Patrol agent. The agent, Esteban Manzanares, bound them with plastic police restraints, put silver duct-tape on their mouths and kidnapped them, driving them around in the back of his Border Patrol truck.“I thought he was going to harm us, because from the moment that he duct-taped our mouths, I felt that that was not normal anymore,” said the woman, 40, who asked to be identified by her initials, M.G.Mr. Manzanares tried to kill M.G. and her daughter, and then handcuffed the 14-year-old girl to a tree, her mouth still taped. He finished his shift, returned to the tree for the girl, drove her to his apartment and tied her to a bunk-bed, where he repeatedly sexually assaulted her. Her ordeal ended only many hours later, when law enforcement agents closed in on the apartment, and Mr. Manzanares, facing imminent capture, took his own life.— MANNY FERNANDEZ, reporting from McAllen, Tex.Manny is one of a team of New York Times journalists currently deployed along the border.

Or feedback about this newsletter? Email us at: crossingtheborder@nytimes.com.It’s hard to find one number that encapsulates the myths versus the realities of living in a border city. This one comes pretty close.It starts with a question about crime. How many murders occurred last year in the South Texas border city of McAllen, the center of the busiest Border Patrol sector and the release point for thousands of asylum seekers from Central America?Zero.That’s right — McAllen had zero homicides in 2018, down from seven in 2017, three in 2016 and two in 2015.How did it happen?There is cartel-fueled drug violence directly across the border in parts of Mexico, but it largely fails to spillover into McAllen. Undocumented immigrants and drugs are smuggled through McAllen, but the city is largely a crossing point for that flow of people and drugs, not a destination point. Last year’s zero homicides were part of an overall low-crime pattern in the city, which has a population of 142,000. In 1991, about 2,150 cars were stolen in McAllen. Last year, there were 55.“Right now we have the lowest crime rate in McAllen in a 34-year period,” said the city’s chief of police, Victor Rodriguez. “The crisis is not at the border. The crisis is at the destination points. That’s what gets lost all the time.”— MANNY FERNANDEZ, reporting from McAllen, Tex.A woman in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody gave birth to a stillborn baby.

138,"Mark Doss, a supervising lawyer at the International Refugee Assistance Project, pulled an all-nighter on Jan. 27, 2017, and his work life has not been the same since. On that day two years ago, his client Hameed Darweesh, an Iraqi who had worked primarily as an interpreter on behalf of the United States government for 10 years, was the first person detained at Kennedy Airport under President Trump’s executive order barring immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq.Images of immigration lawyers huddled together over laptops on airport floors across the country made global news. Nineteen hours and a habeas corpus petition titled Darweesh v. Trump later, Mr. Darweesh was the first detainee to be released. Mr. Doss was able to comfort his weeping client at baggage claim. When you’re an immigrant to the United States, you come to rely on a selection of people you never expected to need as guides. The co-worker who explains that aluminum is both spelled and pronounced incorrectly here, the waitress who advises against ordering that second cold brew and, crucially, the immigration lawyer who can push open the door to a new life, a whole country. I moved here five years ago in a relatively straightforward way, but one that still involved much paperwork, expense and anxiety. Amanda Gupta, who specializes in visas for artists and entertainers, was my lawyer. It’s because of her I get to live my own peculiar American dream, which is to have a comedy career and drink as much cold brew as I can before my heart explodes.That first travel ban, and each subsequent one, made my stomach lurch, as I imagined not being allowed back into the place I belong. And since that chaotic weekend two years ago, I have wondered what life has been like for immigration lawyers — people whose livelihoods depend on getting others through a door that was only ever ajar and is now in danger of slamming shut.As the administration hacks away at immigrants’ rights and rains down policy changes, immigration requests that would usually have been approved are denied, many lawyers told me. They are receiving requests for further evidence that are baffling, with precedents continuously blurring. “Any way the government can have a moment of ‘gotcha’ they do and they will,” Ms. Gupta said. “If they can get you out of the country, they will.” John Khosravi, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles, agrees. “These past two years it’s like someone is running around sticking their finger in people’s eyes and I’m an eye doctor,” he said. “Sure, business is good, but those aren’t the injuries I want to treat.” On his podcast “The Immigration Lawyers Podcast,” he urges his colleagues to have a Plan B and to save their money for a rainy day. Mr. Khosravi is Iranian-American, and when he started practicing nearly a decade ago, all of his clients were Iranian. Since then, he has diversified and now has clients from around the world. “Had I just been starting out when the ban came down, that would have been lights out, just no way,” he said.For Lauren Blodgett, a staff lawyer at Safe Passage Project, the past two years have seen her definition of success change. She has represented children seeking asylum who were separated from a parent at the border, per the policy put in place by this administration last year. She said that even if her clients are denied a chance to stay in the United States, it’s crucial to her to help them feel heard and even loved throughout the process. “They will remember their case for the rest of their lives,” she said, adding that it’s a privilege to get to do this kind of difficult work. She has sometimes had to tell 8- or 9-year-olds that she honestly has no idea whether they will see their parents again.What, I asked, could one possibly do to unwind after a workday that involved those conversations? Twice a month, Ms. Blodgett goes to a dance party that takes place from 6 to 9 a.m. “We dance and then, some days, I go to straight to court,” she said. “I bring my suit and change in the bathroom.”At the end of our conversation, I asked her whether she ever feels hopeless, and she looked at me surprised, the same way I looked at her when she told me she voluntarily goes to early-morning raves. “This work is an opportunity to turn your rage and anger and disgust into action,” she said.Mr. Doss married last year and spent the days before his wedding finalizing a waiver application for a woman stranded in Yemen because of the travel ban to be reunited with her children in the United States. His wife’s brother, a graphic designer in Jordan, was denied a visitor’s visa, so he could not be with them on their wedding day. “It’s heartbreaking,” he told me, particularly for his new in-laws, but his perspective quickly broadened. “For my clients from Syria or Yemen or Libya who are trying to reunite with their loved ones in the United States, they’re indefinitely banned.” He worries that these separated families have been forgotten about, lost in the mix of everything else that has happened in the past two years.The number of globally displaced people has hit a record high, and last year the Trump administration set the lowest cap on the number of refugees who can be resettled in the United States since Congress passed the Refugee Act in 1980. I asked Mr. Doss what his clients, refugees who have made it through, feel about arriving in a country run by people who do not seem to want them here. “They are often fleeing from governments that have persecuted them, but they have a deep love for the country,” he explained. “So they’re able to separate the government from the people. Most Americans, when they’re face to face, are kind and caring.” The phone line went quiet for a second and I worried we had been disconnected, until he cleared his throat and added, “I think.”"

140,"The campaign for the votes of 900 million Indians in the continuing national elections — being conducted in seven phases from April 11 to May 23 — has taken a rancorous and religiously polarized tenor, which is unprecedented even for India.Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, is leading the campaign for his governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. He remains the focus of much of the campaign for his party as well as for the opposition parties challenging his re-election bid.Mr. Modi is not seeking to persuade the Indian voters to vote for him and his party on the basis of his record while governing India for the past five years or by presenting compelling ideas for India’s future. Mr. Modi is seeking votes by doing what he does best: raising and stoking fear among the Hindu majority of the potential dangers posed by the presence of a large Muslim minority in India. Since he first consolidated power and built his political capital on the back of religious violence against Muslims in Gujarat in 2002 under his watch as chief minister, Mr. Modi has mastered the art of linking the threat of terrorism, Muslims and Pakistan. His strategy has worked in every election he has deployed it in.His current campaign is taking place in the wake of the Feb. 14 suicide attack in Pulwama district of Indian-administered Kashmir, which killed 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers. The attack was followed by a few weeks of intense escalation and cross-border airstrikes by India and Pakistan.Mr. Modi has made the Pulwama attack the basis of his most recent recasting of the theme of a terrorism-Pakistan-Muslim threat. On April 9, at a campaign rally, Mr. Modi directed his attention toward young Indians voting for the first time: “Can your first vote be dedicated to the valiant soldiers who carried out the airstrike in Pakistan? Can your first vote be dedicated to the brave martyrs of Pulwama?”Mr. Modi proceeded to blame the Indian National Congress, the leading opposition party, for the creation of Pakistan in 1947 and claimed that the Congress party’s electoral manifesto speaks the same language as Pakistan.More than 70 years after independence, Indian governments — mostly led by the Congress party and now by the B.J.P. — have refused to repeal several draconian laws introduced by British colonial rulers, including a particularly egregious law that defines what constitutes sedition or treason.In its manifesto, the Congress party promised to remove the sedition law, which has been much abused and is seen as a relic of a colonial state. “The Congress has said it wants to do away with the sedition laws,” Mr. Modi said “Pakistan too wants this. It wants a free hand for those who want to work against India.” The prime minister was raising the nationalist pitch and repeating what he has honed in his five years in power: branding all dissent and disagreement with his views as a bid to weaken the nation.[Follow coverage of the Indian elections in The New York Times.] A tactic that Mr. Modi and his party have used in the hope of getting Indians to shed their argumentative nature and conform to their interpretation of militant nationalism is an unprecedented exaltation of the Indian armed forces. They seem to have taken a leaf out of the Iranian playbook by seeking to create a cult of martyrdom by constant references to slain Indian soldiers as martyrs. The usage has been amplified by a largely compliant mass media.Last week, Yogi Adityanath, who was appointed as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, the most populous Indian state, in 2017 by Mr. Modi, described the Indian Army as Modi’s army. Mr. Adityanath, a firebrand Hindu ascetic, who faces many accusations of stoking and participating in religious violence, was only crudely stating what his leader had already conveyed in a calibrated and effective manner.A few days after his “Modi’s army” remark, Mr. Adityanath continued with the strategy of religious polarization by painting India’s leading opposition parties as Muslim parties that were fighting his Hindu party. The Samajwadi Party has significant support among lower-castes and Muslims in Uttar Pradesh, and the Bahujan Samaj Party has serious support among India’s Dalits and is headed by Kumari Mayawati, the first Dalit woman to be a chief minister in India. The two parties have formed a coalition to fight Mr. Modi’s B.J.P. in these elections.Ms. Mayawati responded by calling upon India’s Muslims — about 15 percent of the population — not to split their votes among various parties, as that would benefit the B.J.P. Both Mr. Adityanath and Ms. Mayawati have been temporarily barred from campaigning by the Election Commission of India, which conducts the elections, for directly calling upon Hindus and Muslims for their votes. The Hindu nationalists frame the “threat” posed by the Muslim minority by associating them with Pakistan and by raising the specter of an increased Muslim population with illegal immigration of Muslim migrants from Bangladesh, who are described as “infiltrators.”This fear of immigrants is the staple of right-wing populists from President Trump to Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary. But nowhere is the fear more imaginary than in India, where the Hindu majority of 965 million dwarfs the Muslim minority of about 170 million, and where the two communities have lived together for over 1,000 years. But for a man with Mr. Modi’s rhetorical skill, facts are easy to set aside.Amit Shah, the president of Mr. Modi’s B.J.P. and his closest associate from his Gujarat days, declared that if re-elected, their government will throw out every illegal immigrant who is not a Buddhist, a Hindu or a Sikh. That left Muslims and Christians.And yet again on campaign trail, Mr. Modi, whom nobody would accuse of being bothered about minority rights, sought to use the persecution of Hindu and Sikh minorities in Pakistan to whip up passions of Hindu voters. “The fundamentalists tortured our brothers and sisters in Pakistan. Is Congress not a culprit for this?” Mr. Modi said. “Our daughters are being tortured in Pakistan even now,” he added.For Mr. Modi and his party, such rhetoric is the path to one more election victory, but the changes it sets in motion are not easy to reverse. The antipathy between Hindus and Muslims that he stoked in 2014 was manifest in the low-grade violence and bigotry against the Muslim minority over the next five years. The more permanent this antipathy becomes, the more it is likely to challenge the very fundamentals of India’s democratic polity, which, however awkwardly, has so far managed to accommodate its diversity."
141,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]Everything Haya Konte had ever dreamed of for herself and for her family in America perished in a matter of minutes on April 13, 2016.That day, Ms. Konte, a young undocumented immigrant, stepped out of an apartment in the Butler Houses, a public housing complex in the Bronx, to get her two toddlers ice cream and to put clothes in the dryer at a laundromat across the street. She left the girls — aged 2 and 18 months — home alone with incense burning. She was under the mistaken impression a roommate was in the home at the time, she said.A fire tore through the apartment while she was out, killing both children. Ms. Konte was charged with criminally negligent homicide.“It’s a feeling I can’t forget,” Ms. Konte said, speaking publicly for the first time about her daughters’ deaths and the criminal charges that followed. “It’s something I will deal with for the rest of my life.”On Feb. 7, inside a third-floor courtroom at the Bronx Hall of Justice, Ms. Konte stood at the defense table flanked by her lawyer and an interpreter. Her head was dropped. Her shoulders were slumped forward. She tried to fight back tears, but failed.Between sobs, Ms. Konte, 29, pleaded guilty to two counts of criminally negligent homicide in the deaths of her daughters Jainabu Jabbie, 2, and Adama Jabbie, 18 months. As part of the no-prison plea deal, she also agreed to voluntarily leave the country. The guilty plea had taken more than two years to negotiate.The deaths of Jainabu and Adama rattled the city, but struck a particular nerve with a segment of working-class New Yorkers familiar with the challenges of juggling parenthood, work and routine responsibilities.The case also fed into a wider national debate over what constitutes negligence in the era of helicopter parenting. Some states, for instance, have passed laws making it illegal to leave a child alone at home or in a car. But others have pushed back, passing “free-range parenting” laws that set the bar higher for charging parents with neglect. Like many other states, child neglect laws in New York are broad and include any action that results in a child’s death or serious harm.The authorities have said no adult was present when the incense came in contact with a couch, sparking the blaze. One child was lying on the couch and another was sitting on the living room floor, she said.The Bronx district attorney’s office ultimately determined Ms. Konte’s actions went so far beyond what a reasonable parent would do to keep her children safe that she had committed a crime. “The loss of these two young girls is a devastating consequence of their mother’s seemingly innocuous actions,” the district attorney, Darcel D. Clark, said at the time.The Bronx district attorney’s office declined to comment on the decision not to seek a prison term. The offense is punishable by up to four years in prison.In an interview with The New York Times, Ms. Konte described being haunted by her decisions that day. Her life has unraveled since the fire, which also injured 10 other people, including three firefighters.Born in France, Ms. Konte was raised in a small village in Gambia. She was 23 when she arrived in New York in 2012, seeking a better life as she left behind a poor economy and an oppressive regime at home. She found work as an on-call hair braider in salons.She said she entered the United States with a passport. But she had remained in the country illegally, officials said.She said she had met a taxi driver, Bully Jabbie, online before arriving in the United States. They married, and their first child, Jainabu, was born in 2014.“Life was good,” Ms. Konte said through a translator at the Bronx mosque where she worships. “I was happy to be a mother.”But soon after the birth of their second child, Adama, Ms. Konte said her husband began to change. He stopped helping as much with the children, she said, and most of the child care fell to her.The family was sharing an apartment with a friend who allowed them to stay temporarily in a third-floor unit at the Butler Houses on Webster Avenue in the Claremont Village section of the Bronx. Ms. Konte, pregnant with their third child, said her husband had tried to find a new place for the family to live; when he failed to do so, it became a point of contention in their marriage.Ms. Konte said she remembers each detail from the day of the fire with raw clarity.She was four months pregnant. That morning, she had walked across the street to Webster Laundromat with her two daughters. She filled the washing machines with clothes before returning to the apartment.Once inside, Ms. Konte said Jainabu spotted an ice cream truck from the window. “Mommy, ice cream,” Ms. Konte recalled the little girl saying.She looked out the window, but the truck had left.That evening, a second ice cream truck pulled up in front of the building. Ms. Konte ran down to catch it, but she missed it, she said. Her husband, she said, was praying in a mosque.She then returned to the laundromat to put her clothes in the dryer, leaving the girls inside. Her imam, Musa Kabba, of Masjid Ar Rahmah, said she was away from the apartment for up to 40 minutes before fire trucks arrived. She said she rushed out of the laundromat at the sound of sirens and fainted at the sight of one of her daughters being carried out of the building by firefighters.“I couldn’t take it,” Ms. Konte said.The fire prompted intense debate on social media. Some expressed sympathy for Ms. Konte, saying the loss of her children was punishment enough for her carelessness, while others harshly criticized her as a mother and said she should be charged with a crime. There were no earlier reports of neglect, or complaints that she had left her children alone.For her part, Ms. Konte said the fire was an accident and that she loved her children. Her cousin, Mohamed Gumaneh, said, “If she knew this would happen she would not even do the laundry.”Since the fire, Ms. Konte and the daughter she was carrying at the time, who is now 2, have been living in a shelter in the South Bronx. Ms. Konte and her husband divorced last year.Ms. Konte arrived at court earlier this month with her daughter, who resembles Jainabu. The restless toddler looked on as Ms. Konte pleaded guilty for the deaths of her sisters.Christine Scaccia, a senior prosecutor in the Bronx district attorney’s office, told Justice Ralph Fabrizio in State Supreme Court that prosecutors had met with Ms. Konte’s ex-husband and he found the plea to be “acceptable.” Mr. Jabbie could not be reached for comment.Ms. Konte said during the interview that she felt rushed into making a decision to take the plea offer. She also said she had been scared about going to trial.Some community leaders and city officials questioned the Bronx district attorney’s decision to bring criminal charges against Ms. Konte.“There’s no punishment greater than what she actually lost,” Councilman Rory Lancman, a candidate for Queens district attorney, said, adding, “And the knowledge that she maybe could have prevented it. Why would banishment be appropriate? There’s no point to it.”Chris Gottlieb, co-director of the New York University Family Defense Clinic, said prosecutors had overreached. “Most of the time when parents lose a child we sympathize with them,” she said.But Mark A. Bederow, a defense lawyer and former Manhattan prosecutor, said as a legal matter it was clearly negligent for Ms. Konte to have left her two young children home alone. “The charges were appropriate,” he said.Ms. Clark was also criticized for not filing criminal charges against a public housing maintenance worker who provided false information in safety reports and lied about the smoke detectors in Ms. Konte’s apartment hours before the fire.Ms. Konte is expected back in court March 27 for sentencing.She has not decided where she and her daughter will go when they leave the country.“This disaster happened by mistake,” Mr. Kabba said. “She has faith that a better life is coming. I’m praying for her.”"
142,"TIJUANA, Mexico — Pushed beyond their limits by prolonged waits in dangerous and squalid conditions in parts of Northern Mexico, thousands of caravan members who had been waiting to seek asylum in the United States appear to have given up, Mexican officials said, dealing President Trump an apparent win after a humbling week for his immigration agenda.About 6,000 asylum seekers who had traveled en masse, many of them in defiance of Mr. Trump’s demands that they turn around, arrived in Northern Mexico in late November as part of a caravan that originated in Honduras. Since then, more than 1,000 have accepted an offer to be returned home by the Mexican government, the officials said. Another 1,000 have decided to stay in Mexico, accepting work permits that were offered to them last fall, at the height of international consternation over how to deal with the growing presence of migrant caravans.Mr. Trump resorted on Friday to declaring a national emergency after he failed to secure funding from Congress for a border wall that he said would block migrants from entering the United States. But the data from Mexican officials suggested that harsh policies he has introduced to crack down on asylum seekers may already be achieving some of its intended effects.Added this week to new policies that are bearing down on asylum seekers — which include tight limits on the number of people who can apply for the status each day and a heightened standard of proof to qualify — was the extension of a rule that certain asylum seekers must wait in Mexico for the full duration of their legal cases, which can take years.[Read the first edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]The requirement originally applied only to adults, but the Department of Homeland Security expanded it to include families with children as well.Among those who have been dissuaded, at least for now, is Natali, 32, who asked to be identified only by her first name because she feared for her safety. Speaking from her modest apartment atop a steep hill in western Tijuana, she explained that she and her husband had fled their home in El Progreso, Honduras, after she witnessed a murder carried out by a local criminal gang. Soon after, she began to receive threats in the mail warning her to keep quiet.Once in Mexico, they heard about the increasingly long odds of receiving asylum in the United States, and feared more than anything that officials there would return them to their home country. Rather than crossing the border, they decided to seek humanitarian visas to remain in Mexico legally for at least one year, and have slowly begun to build a life.She still believes she might ask for asylum in the United States, but is realistic about her chances. “I like Tijuana,” she said. “It’s a very pretty city and there’s a lot of work.” More than anything, she fears the United States would deport her back to Honduras.Mexican officials said the data on people who have deferred or given up their quest for asylum in the United States reinforced an idea that is often raised by Mr. Trump: that many caravan members are not truly desperate for protection.“What happened is that many people came on an adventure, trying their luck,” said Cesar Palencia, Tijuana’s chief of migrant services. “When they realized that it was hard to cross and the conditions in Mexico were also difficult, among many factors, they decided to return home.”The Honduran caravan ballooned in size as it swept through impoverished villages, drawing a swarm of national media attention and an eclectic mix of participants. Many came from poverty, lacking education and resources, and said they were unfamiliar with the complex set of laws that would ultimately determine who would be granted legal status in the United States, and who would not.Immigrant advocates said that hype and false promises had attracted a group that was somewhat unrepresentative of typical asylum seekers. But they pointed to the roughly 4,000 members who had successfully entered the United States and had at least requested protected status to argue that most had legitimate claims.Michelle Brané, the director of migrant rights and justice at the Women’s Refugee Commission, warned that while Mr. Trump’s tough policies may discourage the undeserving, they might also endanger people who need protection. She said they would likely drive vulnerable migrants into the arms of human traffickers, who promise to provide passage into the United States.“It may look like it’s working in the short term,” Ms. Brané said, “But I don’t think it’s a long-term solution. It’s driving people further into the shadows and that’s exactly the opposite of what we want.”When they arrived in Mexico, many of the caravan members had been living in squalor, sleeping in tents or lean-tos inside the Benito Juárez sports complex. A downpour devastated the grounds, and those who remained fled to a new expansive shelter called Barretal on the outskirts of Tijuana. Once packed with 2,500 people, that location also recently closed because it had shrunk to fewer than 200.“It is not the same as when we had Barretal and Benito Juárez,” said Esme Flores, an immigrant-rights advocate at the San Diego office of the American Civil Liberties Union. “It really feels that the population has moved on.”On Friday, all that remained of the formerly bustling migrant quarter around the Barretal shelter was a small camp around the corner, only partially covered by a tin roof. The conditions are far from comfortable, but the occupants said it was better than sleeping on sidewalks.Most were not yet ready to give up trying to enter the United States, but knew of others who had. Elde Rodriguez, 26, said he had left Honduras hoping to send money back to his wife and daughter. Believing that he would not qualify for asylum, he tried last week to cross the border illegally but he and a friend were unable to find their away across and turned back.“There’s enough work here in Mexico, and you can live on that if you’re alone. But you can’t make enough to send money home, and that’s the point about all this,” he said. “If I can’t get in, I’ll just keep trying.”While Tijuana appears to be emptying, large groups of migrants have accumulated in other areas along the border as a result of the new policies. After a riot the day before, authorities in Mexico said on Friday that they would disband a group of 1,400 Central American asylum seekers who had been waiting in the city of Piedras Negras to cross the border into Eagle Pass, Tex., according to news reports.The Trump administration has said that the latest policy requiring asylum seekers to wait in Mexico, which it called Migrant Protection Protocols, is a vital response to a crisis at the border. Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, has said the policy aims to alleviate a humanitarian crisis on the border and secure the United States. Introduced as a pilot program across the border from San Diego, the administration plans to expand the policy into Texas.Border Patrol apprehensions of families along the southwest border remain near all-time highs, though there was a slight downward turn in January, as is often the case, according the latest government figures. Customs and Border Protection said more than 1,800 Central American parents and children crossed the border illegally on Monday, the largest number of families recorded on a single day. And like other asylum policies of this administration, the “remain in Mexico” policy has already drawn legal scrutiny, leaving its future uncertain.On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union and two other groups sued the administration on behalf of 11 asylum seekers who were required to wait in Mexico, claiming that the policy, which was introduced last month at the San Ysidro port of entry, near San Diego, violates United States and international laws.The lawsuit was filed in federal court in the Northern District of California on behalf of migrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador who feared for their lives in Mexico, according to the complaint.One of them was robbed at gunpoint and told by the assailant that he would be killed if he was seen again. Two others said that they had been threatened by local residents wielding rocks or sticks. Another plaintiff said he had to bribe a police officer to avoid arrest.“Asylum seekers in Mexico face a heightened risk of kidnapping, disappearance, trafficking, sexual assault and murder, among other harms,” said the complaint.In December, the A.C.L.U. successfully sued the administration over another new rule that became known as the “asylum ban” because it significantly restricted the locations where people could request the status. That policy remains enjoined by a federal court; the Supreme Court declined to reinstate it.Like members of the caravan, many of those who continue to come to the United States each day lack a comprehensive understanding of the system they are entering.Ela Marina Rodriguez, 49, and her daughter, Duña Ventura, 16, arrived in Tijuana about three weeks ago and were taken to the small shelter by a man whom they had been traveling with. Ms. Rodriguez said she had heard on the news that bringing her daughter would guarantee them admission into the United States, and the two thought if they could make it through the journey they would have an opportunity for a better life.“That’s why we came all this way,” she said. “I’ve dreamed of doing this my entire life but I was afraid. Hiding through the desert and the mountains, I never had the courage before, until we heard they were giving papers to families.”Her eyes grew wide when she heard from a reporter that some asylum seekers are being made to wait in Mexico. She sighed heavily and replied: “I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t want to be here.”Ms. Rodriguez said that “honestly, yes” she would cross illegally if that is what it takes to get into the United States. But if she is unable to gain entry to the United States, she said, she would likely turn back to Honduras. “I mean, what else can you do in that case?”"
143,"WASHINGTON — In an effort to stem the flow of Central American migrants coming into the United States, the Trump administration has focused on limiting who can apply for asylum and instituting detention policies that officials hope will deter people from seeking refuge in the country. On Tuesday, Attorney General William P. Barr issued an order that could keep thousands of migrants seeking asylum in jail while they wait for their requests to be evaluated by a judge.Asylum is a legal process by which people fleeing persecution in their home country may seek to live in safety in the United States. International treaties and federal law require the government to evaluate a claim for asylum from anyone who enters the United States, whether that person arrives legally, through a port of entry or illegally by crossing the border and being apprehended.People who are already in the country legally may apply for asylum directly with an agency called United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. Migrants who arrive illegally and were apprehended, or have been told they will be deported, may ask for asylum as a way of avoiding being sent home.Soon after asking for asylum, migrants are usually interviewed by a trained asylum officer to determine whether they have a “credible fear” of persecution in their home country “on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.” If the officer determines that there is a “significant possibility” that the migrants will be able to prove such persecution, a court date will be set for a final determination about whether they will be granted asylum.More than 75 percent of migrants pass the initial screening because of congressionally mandated rules that set a fairly low bar for approval to ensure that persecuted people have the opportunity to apply for refuge in the United States. Trump administration officials argue that the credible-fear screening should be far less generous.Migrants who pass a credible-fear screening after being apprehended trying to cross the border illegally have in the past been released from detention to wait for their final hearing. A huge backlog in immigration court cases — approaching 900,000 cases — has meant that some asylum seekers must wait years for their claim to be heard. After a period of time, the migrants are given permission to work legally while they wait.The Trump administration has tried to keep more asylum seekers in detention while they wait for their day in court, in part because officials argue that many migrants disappear before their hearing, becoming permanently undocumented immigrants. The Tuesday night decision about bail by Mr. Barr is part of that effort to prevent asylum seekers from getting out of jail.Under federal law and court rulings, families and unaccompanied children who seek asylum may not be detained for longer than 20 days. So most are released from detention to await their asylum hearings.Mr. Trump’s decision last summer to separate migrant children from their parents at the border was an attempt to get around those restrictions. Once the children were separated and sent to shelters, the parents were subject to rules that allowed authorities to detain them for longer periods of time.A federal judge in California halted the practice last summer and the president issued an executive order reversing the policy of routinely separating families after an uproar in which critics called it “inhumane,” “cruel” and “evil.” Mr. Trump has publicly said he has no plans to go back to family separations.People seeking refuge in the United States must show that they have a “well-founded fear” of being persecuted if they were to return to their own country. That is often demonstrated through direct testimony about the situation they expect to face if they return home, as well as other evidence of the situation they faced before coming to the United States.Immigration judges typically deny 80 percent of the applications, weeding out fraudulent claims and ineligible applicants. When the process was devised, there was a fairly short period between the initial screening and an appearance in immigration court. But that has changed significantly, and a backlog of hundreds of thousands of cases has led to asylum seekers waiting years to appear in court.Yes, although the Trump administration is trying to change that. Currently, if an immigration judge approves a migrant’s asylum request, the migrant is eligible to receive public welfare benefits, such as food stamps and Medicaid. In some cases, the amount of benefits or the amount of time the benefits are available varies from state to state.The Trump administration, however, has proposed a new rule that could deny public benefits to legal immigrants, including those granted asylum. Last year, the Trump administration announced that if immigrants used public assistance, such as a Section 8 housing voucher, they could be denied a green card, forcing some immigrants who are legally in the country to choose between their own welfare and the ability to live and work in the United States.After one year, a migrant who has been granted asylum is allowed to apply for a green card to become a permanent legal resident in the United States.The difference between the two types of migrants largely depends on where a person applies for safe haven. Refugees make their application outside the United States. Asylum seekers are people who are already in the country or arrive at an American port of entry. Both must prove that they realistically fear persecution in their own country.Mr. Trump and his aides have also been trying to reduce the number of refugees who can seek protection by coming to the United States each year. In the wake of the refugee crisis created by the Syrian civil war, President Barack Obama had increased the cap on the maximum number of refugees to 110,000 before he left office. Mr. Trump has lowered the cap to 30,000.Once people are granted asylum, the government does not track when they die or move out of the country, making it difficult to know how many people currently living in the United States are in the country because they were granted asylum at some point.According to statistics from the Department of Homeland Security, roughly 637,000 people were granted asylum between 1990 and 2017."
144,"Welcome to Crossing the Border, a limited-run weekly newsletter from The New York Times. Did you find it useful? Send this to a friend. If someone forwarded it to you, sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox.By Manny Fernandez in Falfurrias, Tex.Last week, President Trump told reporters during his visit to San Antonio that he was shocked to learn that migrants were dying in the South Texas brush after crossing the border illegally.“I had no idea,” Mr. Trump said. “Nobody has any idea how bad this is.” He added, “Many, many are dying. That was what surprised me.”The president spoke at a private club last Wednesday at 12:56 p.m. At that very moment, 186 miles to the south, Deputy Bianca Mora with the Brooks County Sheriff’s Office was driving a patrol truck on a caliche road. She was responding to a report of a migrant body on a ranch. It was her second body of the day.“I don’t know how to explain it but you get used to it,” said Deputy Mora, 25. “I went to one last year and I didn’t have enough body bags. I wasn’t prepared for the amount of bodies that we found. I went initially for one. We picked up three.”Brooks County is deep in South Texas brush country: an immense swath of ranchlands thick with thorny shrubs, cactus and mesquite and oak trees. The county seat, Falfurrias, has a population of 4,981. One ranch alone is 8,600 acres — more than 10 times the size of Central Park. Brooks County is far north of the border — about an hour’s drive — but it is home to a busy Border Patrol traffic checkpoint.[Read more about those checkpoints here.]Migrants, led by smugglers known as coyotes, try to hike around the checkpoint. Ill-prepared for the days-long journey in the harsh brush, sometimes without adequate water or food, hundreds of migrants have died on the private ranches in Brooks County in recent years, making it one of the deadliest places on America’s southwest border.Since January 2009, the bodies or skeletal remains of 642 migrants have been discovered in Brooks County. They die from the cold in the winter and die from the heat in the summer. They die of dehydration, heat stroke, hypothermia. They die alone. Sometimes they die together, like the five migrants whose bodies were found under a tree during a freeze one winter. Eight bodies have been found so far this year. Fifty were recovered in 2018 by the sheriff’s office, down from 52 in 2017 and 61 in 2016.Those 642 bodies are but a fraction of the border-wide total. From October 1997 to September 2018, the Border Patrol recorded 7,505 migrant deaths in its nine sectors along the entire southwestern border. The actual number of border deaths is likely higher, because the Border Patrol figure includes only cases reported to the authorities— no one knows how many were never found.The sheriff of Brooks County, Urbino “Benny” Martinez, said he was not all that surprised that some people were unaware of what has been happening in his county, including the president of the United States.“It’s kind of that old thing — out of sight, out of mind, and if it’s not happening in your backyard, you’re not going to pay attention to it,” Sheriff Martinez said.On the day the president spoke, the first call came in to the sheriff’s office shortly before 10 a.m., a few hours into Deputy Mora’s 12-hour shift. Border Patrol agents had called it in — the body of a woman, near a barbed wire fence in the back corner of a ranch. Her skeleton was face down. She was carrying cash from Honduras, Mexico and the United States. Prayer cards were found in the dirt around her, and in the pockets of her jeans.“The Border Patrol agents were following a group of illegals northbound, towards the highway, and the group crossed over the body and just kept going,” Deputy Mora said. “The agents came across it and called it out.”Deputy Mora was back in the office, writing up her report, when the second call came in shortly before noon. A worker had found the body of a man at another ranch. The man was lying face up, his arms extended out, on a sandy road known as a drag. A Honduran ID card was in his black wallet.Dr. Corinne E. Stern, who is the chief medical examiner of Laredo’s Webb County and who conducts autopsies for Brooks County, said both bodies had not yet been positively identified. The woman was possibly a Honduran missing person. The man was likely the Honduran on the ID, Dr. Stern said.“The most likely cause of death is dehydration,” Dr. Stern said of both bodies.Relatives in Honduras said they believed the man who was found last week was indeed the person on the ID card: Rudy Donaldo Martinez Arias, 21, a husband and father who lived in the northern Honduran city of San Pedro Sula. Relatives said they were told Mr. Martinez had died of thirst in South Texas after the coyote abandoned him and other migrants.“He left our country, Honduras, because the salaries are not enough here,” Maricela Amador, 24, Mr. Martinez’s cousin, said in an interview using Facebook messages. “It is pure poverty. That’s why people migrate to the United States without knowing what awaits them. He wanted to leave to find a good job where he could provide for his family.”Mr. Martinez’s daughter is 3 years old. In January, he posted a selfie of the two of them on his Facebook page. A relative posted a comment, remarking how beautiful the girl looked.“Yes, that’s right,” Mr. Martinez wrote in Spanish. “She’s the most beautiful, my princess.”Nubia Reyna contributed reporting from Brownsville, Tex.Manny is one of a team of New York Times journalists reporting on the border.

Email us at: crossingtheborder@nytimes.com.By Concepción de León, New York Times books departmentI write a column in which I recommend books for readers who want to better understand a topic in the news — climate change, immigration or the economy, for instance. To pick the books, I try to understand the questions my selections should answer. In this case: How do we understand life at the border? What happens to those who try to cross it? Is it as dangerous as some fear?These five books offer some answers to these questions, but they stand out because they also complicate and deepen our understanding of the stretch of land where Mexico and the United States meet, and the people who live there.LOST CHILDREN ARCHIVE, by Valeria Luiselli (2019)This road-trip novel follows two parents and their children on what may be their last trip together. They travel from east to west, each parent’s mind set on a different destination. For the mother, it is the border. She is haunted by the news of the unaccompanied minors crossing into the United States alone, and their journey looms throughout the book. Our reviewer wrote: “The novel truly becomes novel again in her hands — electric, elastic, alluring, new. And the story of the migrant, she believes, insists upon a new form: How else to tell a story that has no end?” Read the full New York Times review here.UNACCOMPANIED, by Javier Zamora (2017)Mr. Zamora, who was born in El Salvador, crossed the border alone at 9 to reunite with his parents in the United States. In this collection of poems, he mines his memories of crossing, remembers the country he left behind and imagines his parents’ journeys. Mr. Zamora wrote an essay about his experience for the opinion section last fall.RETABLOS: Stories From a Life Lived Along the Border, by Octavio Solis (2018)This memoir is told in a series of vignettes that focus on singular episodes formative to the writer’s identity. It’s modeled after the Mexican tradition of retablo painting, folk art that depicts life-altering stories visually on pieces of repurposed metal. Mr. Solis, who grew up just a mile from the Rio Grande in El Paso, writes about experiences such as being ridiculed for mispronouncing an English word in class or once finding a Mexican girl hiding in a cotton field.THE LINE BECOMES A RIVER: Dispatches From the Border, by Francisco Cantú (2018)Tired of reading about the border secondhand, Mr. Cantú decided to join the Border Patrol. This book covers his four years working as an agent in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Though the agents are primed for drug cartels, they more often encounter their victims: “bewildered, disoriented, helpless migrants,” our reviewer wrote. When it was released last year, Mr. Cantú’s book drew some criticism from immigrants. Read more about that controversy here. ACROSS THE WIRE: Life and Hard Times on the Mexican Border, by Luis Alberto Urrea (1993)Mr. Urrea, who is Mexican-American and was born in Tijuana, depicts the suffering of Mexico’s poor in Tijuana through a series of vignettes. A Times reviewer compared this book, one of a several Mr. Urrea has written which reckon with border life, to Elie Wiesel’s “Night,” about life in an internment camp, and says that it’s just as difficult to read. “But we keep returning to Mr. Urrea’s prose because it is startling, poetic and razor-sharp; in the midst of the most brutal sequences, we are informed and shaken, made to feel the pain of others as if it were our own,” wrote the reviewer.Have you read any of these books?

145,"A federal appeals court said Friday that the Trump administration could temporarily continue to force migrants seeking asylum in the United States to wait in Mexico while their cases are decided.A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a stay of a lower-court ruling four days earlier that blocked the administration’s protocol. The appeals court will consider next week whether to extend that stay — and allow the Trump administration policy to remain in effect for longer.The administration in December  announced its new policy, called the migration protection protocols, arguing that it would help stop people from using the asylum process to enter the country and remain there illegally. President Trump has long been angered by so-called catch and release policies, under which asylum seekers are temporarily allowed in the United States while they wait for their court hearings.On Monday, Judge Richard Seeborg of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California issued an injunction against Mr. Trump’s new protocols, saying that the president did not have the power to enforce them and that they violated immigration laws.Judge Seeborg said in his ruling that the protocols did not include “sufficient safeguards” to comply with the Department of Homeland Security’s obligation against returning migrants to places where their “life or freedom would be threatened.”On Friday, as Judge Seeborg’s injunction was set to go into effect, a three-judge panel for the Ninth Circuit issued the temporary stay.In a tweet late Friday night, President Trump wrote: “Finally, great news at the Border!” He has previously criticized the Ninth Circuit, which is based in San Francisco, saying that the court always ruled against him. While that is not always true, the administration’s track record in the circuit has been poor.The Justice Department, which appealed Judge Seeborg’s decision, argued that the injunction would “impose immediate, substantial harm on the United States, including by diminishing the executive branch’s ability to work effectively with Mexico to manage the crisis on our shared border.”The Ninth Circuit will consider next week whether to keep the stay — and Mr. Trump’s protocols — in place during the appeal.Judy Rabinovitz, the deputy director of the Immigrants’ Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, who argued the case, said she expected that decision to come next week.“The question will be, can the government continue to implement the policy while it appeals it to the Ninth Circuit,” she said. “Obviously, we don’t think it should be able to.”She called the policy unlawful and cruel.“We think it should be stopped,” she said.Lawyers for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The appeals court’s decision comes as the nation’s immigration system may have reached a breaking point as migrants increasingly arrive at the country’s southwestern border with Mexico.The flow of migrant families has reached record levels, with February totals 560 percent above those for the same period last year. Many are seeking asylum, in which they have the burden to show evidence of past persecution or testimony that establishes the “well-founded” fear that they would face danger if they return home.The Trump administration’s migration protection protocols were an attempt to deter migrants. Mexico’s government reluctantly agreed to house the migrants in December."
146,"[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]HIDALGO, Tex. — The federal government will spend nearly $40 million to build and operate two new tent cities for migrant families and children in Texas, as the Trump administration scrambles to respond to a surge of Central American asylum-seekers at the southwest border.Kevin K. McAleenan, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, told reporters during a visit to South Texas on Wednesday that the temporary facilities are part of a strategy to ease overcrowding at Border Patrol detention centers. The two tent cities will be built in El Paso and in the Rio Grande Valley town of Donna by April 30 as processing centers and temporary housing for Central American families and unaccompanied children detained after crossing the border from Mexico.“It’s clear that all of our resources are being stretched thin,” said Mr. McAleenan, standing in front of a section of border wall in the town of Hidalgo. “The system is full and we are beyond capacity.”Mr. McAleenan spoke to reporters the day after Attorney General William P. Barr issued an order to immigration judges that they deny some migrants a chance to post bail. The order, which is expected to be challenged in the courts, could keep thousands more in jail indefinitely while they wait for their asylum requests to be resolved, and appeared to be another effort to discourage migrants from seeking asylum. But it could also add to the overcrowding in detention centers on the border when it goes into effect in 90 days.For weeks, federal, local and nonprofit officials along the border have been struggling to handle a spike in asylum-seekers from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Mr. McAleenan, on his first trip to the border as acting homeland security secretary, said the numbers have become unmanageable.In March, officials encountered or apprehended more than 103,000 migrants, the most in any single month in more than a decade, he said. “Yesterday, in one 24-hour period, we had over 4,800 people cross our border, a new record for the modern era,” Mr. McAleenan said. “Almost 1,000 of them crossed in just three large groups, 375 people in the largest of those groups.”Over all, the flow of migrants is low compared with the record numbers in the 1990s and early 2000s. But the latest surge has raised a host of legal and logistical challenges. In the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector, the number of migrants apprehended so far this month is 8,928, already more than double what it was in April 2018. And in the El Paso sector, the number arriving in April is nearly eight times what it was last April.The federal government has a history of using temporary emergency housing to deal with influxes of migrants.The Obama administration also put migrants in tent camps, and in 2012, it turned a vacant dormitory building at an Air Force base in San Antonio into living quarters for migrant youths. Some of the Trump administration’s attempts to respond with similar measures have been met with widespread criticism.The Border Patrol recently placed families in a fenced-in encampment under a bridge in El Paso with little hot food. That area was closed after an outcry from elected officials and migrant advocates, although hundreds of migrants were still being held in several tents next to a Border Patrol station.Last year, officials built a tent city at the Tornillo border station, near El Paso, to house unaccompanied children. The Tornillo camp, with air-conditioned tents with bunk beds on a patch of desert, was originally built to house 360 teenagers. It was rapidly expanded and at one point had about 1,500 there. Costly and controversial, it was eventually shuttered.The two tent cities now scheduled to open in El Paso and Donna will house hundreds of migrants at each site in structures that federal officials call “soft-sided facilities.” According to federal contracting documents, the Donna and El Paso tent cities will operate for eight months and will have kitchen equipment, shower trailers, laundry trailers, office space and security cameras. The estimated cost of the two sites is $37.2 million.It was unclear how long the families and children would be held at the sites. Asked on Wednesday if officials planned to detain migrant families for longer periods there, one Border Patrol official said they were bound by law to release families after 20 days.“But we are always looking for additional options to have in place to house people,” said the official, Rodolfo Karisch, the Border Patrol’s chief patrol agent for the Rio Grande Valley sector. “Right now, if you look at every Border Patrol station that’s out here, we’re at overcapacity. So we do need some shelters here to help us house the people we have in custody.”Federal officials have been trying various things to mitigate the demands placed on border cities, including taking migrants to bus stations and shelters run by nonprofit and religious groups in other towns. But that informal network of shelters is now flooded along the entire border.On Tuesday, the mayor of Yuma, Ariz., signed a proclamation of emergency as the city struggled to handle the growing number of migrant families released by Customs and Border Protection officers there. The mayor, Douglas Nicholls, said he was seeking a “FEMA-type response” — help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency or its equivalent to provide shelter, food and other assistance to the migrants.Mr. McAleenan signaled the government’s willingness to work with local officials and nonprofit groups, meeting with several mayors of South Texas cities and touring a migrant shelter in the city of McAllen run by Catholic Charities. He did not take questions from reporters and did not comment about the Yuma mayor’s actions.One of the mayors who met with Mr. McAleenan — Dr. Ambrosio Hernandez, a pediatric surgeon who is the mayor of the Rio Grande Valley city of Pharr — said the acting secretary was not there “to sway anybody.”“He did most of the listening, we did most of the talking,” Dr. Hernandez said.At the McAllen shelter, a former nursing home that on Wednesday afternoon was packed with about 400 migrants, Mr. McAleenan met with the Catholic nun who assists migrant families in South Texas, Sister Norma Pimentel, the executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley.“At this point, I don’t know that we have any solutions that he proposed,” she said. “He said that he was going to work with us to make sure that for the solutions going forward, he would listen to what we have to say.”"
147,"WASHINGTON — In pursuit of a wall, President Trump ran into one. A single-minded drive to force Congress to finance his signature campaign promise has left Mr. Trump right back where he started, this time seeking a way to climb over the political barrier in his way after trying to charge through it did not work.As he inched closer to reluctantly accepting a bipartisan spending compromise without the money he demanded for his border wall, Mr. Trump offered no acknowledgment on Wednesday that his pressure tactics had failed even as aides sought to minimize the damage by tamping down criticism on the right.One call was made to Lou Dobbs, a favorite of Mr. Trump’s whose Fox Business Network show he often tries to catch live. Another was placed to Sean Hannity, the Fox host who regularly talks with the president. The message: Mr. Trump deserved support because he still forced concessions that he would never have gotten without a five-week partial government shutdown.Even so, it was arguably the most punishing defeat Mr. Trump has experienced as president, and it left the White House scrounging for other ways to pay for a wall on the southwestern border and rethinking its approach to a Congress now partly controlled by Democrats. Mr. Trump’s inability to reach a satisfying deal despite the negotiating experience he regularly touted on the campaign trail suggested that any aspirations of collaboration across party lines may be even more elusive than he had imagined.“We shut down the government for 35 days, we put America through this crisis, we jeopardized our economy — for what?” said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat in the upper chamber and a member of the House-Senate committee that negotiated this week’s spending deal. “Totally unnecessary.”The agreement that lawmakers produced this week would allocate $1.375 billion for fencing along the border, even less than was on the table at one point last year. The Senate plans to vote on the measure on Thursday, followed by the House. Mr. Trump would not say whether he would sign it, but he seemed to be leaning toward it in the interest of avoiding another government shutdown at midnight Friday.“With the wall, they want to be stingy,” Mr. Trump complained about Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional Democrats during an encounter with reporters on Wednesday. “But we have options that most people don’t really understand.”Those options involve diverting money from other programs and potentially declaring a national emergency to access further funds. In the end, aides said, Mr. Trump may even secure more money than Congress denied him. But those options were just as available to Mr. Trump in December before the showdown that closed federal agencies.While acknowledging disappointment in the agreement, the president and his aides characterized it as better than it seemed, citing money it will provide for overall border security. Mr. Trump argued that the shutdown had been useful because it educated the country about troubles at the border and, if nothing else, he has framed the national debate on his terms.That did not completely assuage conservatives. Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, contradicted the White House line and declared that the agreement was “a bad deal for the president.”“Only in Washington, D.C., can we start out with needing $25 billion for border security measures and expect applause at 1.37,” he said Tuesday on Fox News. “I mean, only in D.C. is that a winning deal.”Mr. Meadows and his allies were among those targeted by the White House in hopes of avoiding a more threatening conservative revolt. A meeting with members of his Freedom Caucus in the Oval Office was partly aimed at urging them to hold their fire in television interviews when talking about the bill, according to a person briefed on the effort.And indeed, despite his complaints about the bill, Mr. Meadows made a point on Wednesday of not blaming Mr. Trump. “I think he handled it as well as anybody could handle it, given a dysfunctional Congress,” Mr. Meadows told reporters.Among those involved in the outreach, according to the person briefed on the discussions, was Bill Shine, a White House deputy chief of staff and former Fox executive who in the West Wing is seen as adept at getting some hosts at Fox to respond to White House concerns.Since coming to office, Mr. Trump has missed several opportunities to make more progress on the wall. Instead of Mexico directly paying for a $25 billion, 1,000-mile concrete barrier, as the president once said would happen, he has been seeking partial installments from Congress, arguing that his new trade agreement with Mexico will ultimately pay off enough to offset the cost. The partial installments have generally gone to replacing or repairing existing barriers, not to building the new concrete or steel walls Mr. Trump wants.At one point last year, the president and Democrats were close to a deal in which he would get all $25 billion for the wall in exchange for protections for 1.8 million young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. But Mr. Trump ultimately turned away because he also wanted cuts to legal immigration that Democrats would not accept.In his budget request for this year, Mr. Trump asked for $1.6 billion, and the Senate Appropriations Committee agreed on a bipartisan basis to give him that last summer. But the measure stalled until after the midterm elections in November.By the time Mr. Trump met with Ms. Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, in December, they offered $1.375 billion. The president then insisted on $5.7 billion, and when he did not get it, much of the government was left without the funding to keep doors open.During the shutdown, Ms. Pelosi took an even harder line, saying she would not spend a single dollar on Mr. Trump’s wall, although she said she would provide money for other border security.The deal reached this week returned to the same $1.375 billion available in December to pay for 55 miles of fencing along the border, although not walls based on the new steel or concrete prototypes Mr. Trump has promoted.Mr. Trump and his aides claimed victory because they had gotten more than Ms. Pelosi’s zero dollars, and they noted that the agreement also included $23 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, an increase from $21 billion last year. But Democrats said much of the increase would go to their priorities, like more customs agents and humanitarian aid, not to Mr. Trump’s.Either way, his aides are now focused on finding pots of money that, with the president’s traditional discretion, can be reprogrammed toward the wall. If that is not enough, he could still declare a national emergency to bypass Congress, although such a move is opposed by many Republicans and would invariably draw a court challenge.As a result, some supporters of tougher border security said Mr. Trump’s critics should not crow because the struggle is not over.“People say, ‘Well, the president lost,’” said James Jay Carafano, a national security analyst at the Heritage Foundation. “The analogy here is if it’s a 10-round fight, Trump’s fighting 10 rounds. If Pelosi wants to say at the end of Round 1, ‘I won that round,’ Trump’s like, ‘Yeah, maybe, but I’m fighting 10 rounds.’”Andy Surabian, a former Trump White House aide, said the details do not matter to the president’s base as much as his determination to fulfill his promise. “His supporters don’t care about how the rest of the wall is built,” he said. “They just care that the wall is ultimately built.”"
148,"This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.When I was in college, a fair number of my fellow students liked to describe themselves as “socially liberal and economically conservative.” This was the 1990s, when Bill Clinton’s “third way” was thriving, and I was attending a college — Yale — where the student body was predominantly affluent.When members of the national media — whose incomes also tend to be above average — describe the prototypical centrist voter, this is the same image they often have in mind: socially liberal and economically conservative.But it’s a big myth.[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]True, many high-income voters are socially liberal and economically conservative. They aren’t particularly religious and generally agree with the Democratic Party on social issues, like abortion, affirmative action and immigration. On economic issues, though, these affluent voters lean to the center if not the right. They don’t like talk of 70 percent marginal tax rates, and they favor cuts to Medicare and Social Security (which they describe as “entitlement reform”).Many commentators share these views, and they commit a classic version of the pundit fallacy: They confuse their own beliefs with the country’s. They fool themselves into thinking that “socially liberal and economically conservative” is a good campaign strategy. This is precisely the theory that seems to motivate Howard Schultz, the former Starbucks C.E.O. now planning an independent run for president.In reality, the American public is closer to being “socially conservative and economically liberal” than the reverse.On the socially conservative part: More than half of Americans say they pray daily. About 53 percent say abortion should be legal either “only in a few circumstances” or never. Almost 70 percent say illegal immigration is a “very big” or “moderately big” problem. On some of these subjects, the answers can depend on the precise phrasing of poll questions. But you have to twist the data pretty hard to create a portrait of a secular, liberal majority on most social issues.Economic policy is very different. Large majorities of Americans oppose cuts to Medicare and Social Security and favor expanded Medicaid. They favor higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations. They favor a higher minimum wage and more aggressive government action to create jobs. No wonder: Incomes for most Americans have been growing painfully slowly for most of the past four decades.Schultz is correct that there may be room in American politics for a candidate who doesn’t line up neatly with the two parties. But we already knew that. Just consider the last businessman-turned-candidate who vowed to change politics.Donald Trump won the Republican nomination despite running well to the left of party orthodoxy on economics. (As president, he’s returned to the conservative orthodoxy.) And he won the Electoral College despite a set of social and cultural views — including racism — that social liberals rightly found odious.Obviously, I’m not at all happy about Trump’s presidency. But he is much closer to the median voter than Schultz is. Schultz’s version of that voter is a fantasy.Related: For more evidence on socially conservative and economically liberal Americans, see Jonathan Chait in New York magazine and Michelle Goldberg in The Times. HuffPost’s Zach Carter writes that “Schultz hails from an aging, elite enclave in which the conventional wisdom of the 1990s remains the foundation of all political truth.” Jeff Greenfield, writing in Politico, points out that a Schultz candidacy relies on a second myth as well: that of true political independence among voters. In fact, most voters are partisans, whether they'd admit it or not. Elsewhere …Even if Schultz isn’t a serious candidate to win the presidency, he could affect the outcome. The likelihood that he would do so was the subject of much debate on Monday.Nate Silver argued that a Schultz candidacy was likely to be irrelevant. “He’s probably about equally likely to draw from either major party candidate,” Silver tweeted.Others disagreed. The historians Kevin Kruse and Julian Zelizer argued that Schultz’s social liberalism made him unlikely to attract Republican votes — and, thus, more likely to hurt the eventual Democratic candidate. “If Schultz’s goal is breaking free of the polarized politics of the Trump presidency, he should understand that his independent candidacy could wind up prolonging it,” they wrote for CNN.My take: The chances that Schultz will affect the outcome seem small. But they’re not nothing. And because the stakes — the potential of a second Trump term — are so large, I think it’s irresponsible and self-centered of him to run as an independent. He should run for one of the party’s nominations. “Given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the Electoral College system, there is no way an independent can win,” Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who considered an independent run in 2016, said yesterday. If Schultz does run as an independent, Neera Tanden of the Center for American Progress called for a boycott of Starbucks. Schultz still owns a large stake in the company.For anyone interested in a more positive take on Schultz than mine, try David Frum in The Atlantic."
149,"EL PASO, Texas — The battle of the border was an epic desert showdown between two gifted politicians, each marshaling around 10,000 people, one blessed with the truth, the other peddling lies. And yet, to Donald Trump’s mystifying credit, the lie survived to fight another day. We tell some tall tales here in Texas. But no Texan is a match for this president.As day broke here in my hometown yesterday, it looked like after years, Mr. Trump’s lies about the border had finally run out. Amid his showdown with Democrats over his proposed border wall — which had already led to an unpopular 35-day-long government shutdown — Mr. Trump was coming to El Paso to make his case once again: “Build the wall.” The people of El Paso, with the local hero and presidential Hamlet Beto O’Rourke as their public face, had a response: “We’re safe not because of walls but in spite of walls. We’re safe not in spite of immigrants but because of immigrants.”Ahead of the president’s visit, normally taciturn local politicians turned on Mr. Trump for falsely claiming in recent weeks that El Paso, the second-largest border city in America, was swamped by an immigrant crime wave until a fence went up. The English-language daily, El Paso Times, proclaimed: “Local leaders ready to tell El Paso’s story.” The Spanish-language daily, El Diario, more startlingly heralded, “El Paso, National Battleground.” The officially nonpartisan mayor, Dee Margo, laid into Mr. Trump on Twitter, outraged: “El Paso was never one of the most dangerous cities in the U.S.”As Air Force One approached, winds whipped up to 50 miles per hour as people streamed toward the County Coliseum, formerly a site for livestock shows and rodeos, where Mr. Trump held what amounted to his kickoff rally for the 2020 election. This is not Trump country. After all, he’d branded the entire border, where millions of Americans live, a violent wasteland. Business leaders groused that the president had been bad for business, endangering $70 billion in local trade with Mexico while scaring away businesses with tales of immigrant mayhem. The County Commissioners Court is on the record opposing a wall cutting through downtown. El Paso voted nearly 3-to-1 against him in 2016.For a moment, it seemed the president would finally get his comeuppance here — a definitive and undeniable repudiation of his monstrous and unpopular pet project.On the merits, Mr. Trump should lose the battle hands down. The crime rate in El Paso peaked in 1993. Then it fell steadily for years finally settling at about 370 violent crimes per 100,000 people. Lower than a city El Paso’s size, like, say, Boston or the national average.Organized by some 50 local groups, the March for Truth gathered at least as many or even more people than Mr. Trump’s rally, winding its way to a field directly across from the County Coliseum. Some skewered Mr. Trump, sure; “Not today, Satan,” read one sign. But most people, like Cathy Benavidez, a retired social worker, came to defend their hometown’s reputation. “I’m just embarrassed by what Trump has said because it’s not true,” Ms. Benavidez said. Her hand-lettered sign said, in glitter, “Stop the wall, stop the lies, El Paso has always been safe.”Mr. O’Rourke appeared in shirt sleeves, despite plummeting temperatures, but with his usual upbeat attitude. In a brief interview over the rising voice of a mariachi singer, he said: “This is El Paso so I want to take every opportunity to support the cause, the culture and the community.”He helped bring out 10,000 supporters, according to local organizers, maybe as many as 15,000. Mr. Trump brought 6,700 to the old rodeo arena, according to the fire department, with a few thousand more stamping their feet in front of the parking lot Jumbotron. The truth — or at least the facts — made steady progress in El Paso.But that didn’t stop the lies, like Mr. Trump claiming 35,000 people came to see him while just 200 went to see Mr. O’Rourke. There is nothing the president won’t lie about. He even encouraged followers to chant “Finish That Wall,” though there’s been no construction since he became president on any kind of wall he promised, just fences ordered up since 2006. I tried to count the lies during his speech but had to stop after 10. My Stetson is off: The guy is a gifted and gratuitously generous liar.“Thanks to a powerful border wall in El Paso, Texas, it is one of the safest cities,” he insisted even after the uproar. And the crowd roared. Of course, I had parked my car by the 18-foot bollard border fence a block away; there was no wall, just like there were no 10,000 MAGA fans milling around outside.But the truth is plodding, getting its pants on, one leg at a time, while a lie races halfway around the world, as the old saw attributed to Mark Twain goes. Mr. Trump’s tales of kidnappings and mayhem, too, are far more racy than the truth. El Paso has problems. The international bridges carry tens of millions of people, cars, trucks and rail cars each year; they’re not getting inspected. But that is tedious. I grew up here and El Paso does have a crisis: too much poverty and too little education. But that is boring.Mr. Trump’s lies are dime novel, pulp fiction, heart-pounding, mesmerizing and that’s where they derive their power. Regardless, word came that evening that congressional negotiators would give Mr. Trump about $1 billion for more steel barriers, which he will call a wall and then declare victory. It will be anything but that.The president’s biggest cheerleader, Lindsey Graham, is absolutely right when he says “the wall has become a metaphor.” And Henri Rafael, a Trump fan I met at the rally, is absolutely right, too: “A border wall is very much needed. But it’s not about the wall anymore.” His friend in a pink MAGA hat, Monica DeMoss, chimed in: “These people need to go out and work.”The wall is about whatever you want it to be about: welfare, immigrants, race, class, socialism, you name it. It will never be an actual, 30-foot wall from sea to shining sea, as Mr. Trump once promised. He is, in fact, losing on the merits, bit by bit. But he will still get his monument: a metaphor that just as effectively divides the nation, even if a real wall never divides the border here, in El Paso.I’ll hand it to the guy: No Texan could tell a taller tale."
150,"As long as Washington remains unable to deliver comprehensive immigration reform, states will be left to decide how to deal with the millions of undocumented immigrants who are a part of their communities and the work force.Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York and the now Democratic-led State Legislature recently agreed to let undocumented immigrants apply for state financial aid to attend college, tapping a pool of talent and giving more young people a chance to fully participate in American life. There are an estimated 725,000 undocumented immigrants in New York State, making up more than 5 percent of the labor force in 2016, according to the Pew Research Center. They pay $1.1 billion in state and local taxes each year, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimates.Almost 250,000 of them live in the suburbs and upstate, where people rely on cars to get to work and school. That’s why the governor and legislative leaders have proposed legislation to let undocumented immigrants receive driver’s licenses, as a dozen states and the District of Columbia do.Under legislation pending in Albany, applicants would no longer be required to show proof they are in the country legally. They could use foreign passports to establish their identity and obtain a standard driver’s license, once, of course, they pass the same tests as everyone else.Though researchers say it is hard to isolate a single factor when studying road safety, law enforcement officials have said that knowing who is on the road is a clear benefit. William Bratton — who served as police commissioner in both Los Angeles and New York — has supported such measures, saying they would reduce the number of hit-and-runs, increase the number of insured motorists and, by having identification on record, help fight crime and terrorism.One 2017 study found hit-and-run accidents in California decreased by an average of 7 percent to 10 percent after undocumented immigrants were allowed to get driver’s licenses. After New Mexico approved similar legislation, the percentage of uninsured drivers fell to 9.1 percent in 2011 from 33 percent in 2002.Issuing licenses to undocumented immigrants would also bring the state more revenue. The Fiscal Policy Institute estimates New York could see about $26 million in fees for license applications and car registration, and the gasoline tax. Opponents say the state should not make it easier for immigrants who are here illegally to work jobs they are not supposed to have. But the bill would reflect reality: Undocumented immigrants are already driving on the state’s roads.New York once allowed undocumented residents to drive. But after the Sept. 11 attacks, Gov. George Pataki, citing the threat of terrorist infiltration, issued an executive order requiring applicants to prove their legal status before obtaining licenses. In 2007, Gov. Eliot Spitzer tried to restore these rights but backed off in the face of intense political blowback.Along with Mr. Cuomo, the Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie, and the Senate majority leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, have signaled support. But Ms. Stewart-Cousins may have a tough time persuading Democrats from Long Island, where anti-immigrant sentiment can be strong.For those who have to work and raise their families in the shadows as they provide cheap labor for contractors, restaurants, farms and factories, a driver’s license could change their lives.Aldo, a 40-year-old Mexican working illegally in construction and the food industry, lives with his wife and young son on Staten Island’s South Shore, far from public transportation. It’s an area the couple chose because the schools are good and it’s affordable. But he said driving in the area increases his chances of interacting with law enforcement. He stands out in a neighborhood where most residents are white, and there are few other immigrants. “They know you don’t have a license,” he said of the police, “and you’re fearful.”Keeping people like Aldo fearful doesn’t make anyone else safer. Giving them the right to have a driver’s license makes sense."

152,"On Sunday, United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested the rapper 21 Savage, stunning his fans by declaring that he is a British citizen and has overstayed his visa. The arrest comes just months after the 26-year-old musician’s latest album, “I Am > I Was,” debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 and just days after he sang on national television against President Trump’s policy on family separation. The rapper, who is also up for two Grammys this Sunday, now faces imminent deportation. Within minutes of the announcement of his detention, the internet was flooded with memes making light of the news, and fans who thought he was born in Atlanta seemed to believe that he had betrayed them.Their reactions have demonstrated what I have come to see, in my own experiences as a black son of immigrants, as an ingrained American inability to think about both blackness and immigration simultaneously and through a complex lens. According to ICE, 21 Savage, born She’yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, entered the country legally with his parents in 2005 when he was about 12 years old but remained after his visa expired a year later; his lawyers have said that he came to the United States much earlier, when he was 7. Rather than being appalled at the arrest, many responded with wisecracks. As the Washington Post pop music critic Chris Richards reported, “seemingly stunned by the strangeness of the breaking news,” some of the “citizens of rap-Twitter,” as he called them, “reflexively launched into joke torrents, superimposing 21’s face onto images of Buckingham Palace guards and translating his lyrics into Cockney slang.” While some prominent musicians have come to his defense, many of the memes about 21 Savage imply that despite his having lived in Georgia since he was a young boy, his British origin somehow disqualifies him from claiming it as his home. They imply that he is somehow a lesser rapper — that his claim to hip-hop and black American culture is now illegitimate. “21 not a blood; he’s a redcoat,” a person commented on Twitter. At first glance, these reactions could be viewed simply as harmless jokes. And maybe some just had a hard time conceiving that a rapper could be British. But their dismissiveness hit close to home with me, bringing up my own experiences in which similar attitudes have been all too prevalent. I remember the first time someone told me that I am not black. I was in middle school. A boy who had just found out that my parents were from Ethiopia turned to me and said, “Wait, I thought you were black?” I stared blankly, giving no response. “Nah, bro, you’re African.” I neither accepted nor denied this. A couple of months later, I was asked the same question. This time I replied, “What’s the difference?” Silence. A shrug. I was left not knowing who or what I was, feeling as though I was trying to fulfill a position I was unqualified for.I faced this false distinction at home as well. The first time I heard the world “black” used like it meant something dirty, I was around 9 or 10 years old. This experience is common for children of the African diaspora. It was probably a holiday or someone’s birthday, and my family was gathered together. The men sat in the living room, their laughs bellowing through the walls, talking about politics (Ethiopian and American), each louder than the other. Suddenly, the conversation shifted to race. Someone announced to a chorus of groans: “I am not black. I am African. I am Ethiopian. I know where I come from.” And then my mother’s swift rebuttal: “Here, our sons are black. Whether you like it or not, this country doesn’t care.” Yet again, I was left not knowing what to call myself or who I was. Years later, I remember this conversation when I am being followed in a store. Being Ethiopian does not exempt or shield me from American racism.It seems that a narrow view of the word “black” in an American context is preventing blackness from being allowed to coexist with other identities and racism from being allowed to coexist in conversations with other issues — especially immigration. In the case of 21 Savage, the mocking comments also show a lack of full recognition for how often ICE’s policies target black immigrants and how hurtful they can be. An ICE spokesman has reportedly said that 21 Savage’s “whole public persona is false.” Through such claims, ICE has tried to diminish 21 Savage’s career because of his immigration status and by implying that his experiences as a black man in America, chronicled by much of his music, are invalidated because of his birthplace. 21 Savage has overstayed his visa, but, as his lawyers have pointed out, this was “through no fault of his own.” One of his lawyers has said that ICE has known about his client’s immigration status and his whereabouts since he applied for the visa that would make him legal here, at least a couple of years ago. He also noted that his client “is clearly not a danger to the community, and in fact, his contributions to local communities and schools that he grew up in are examples of the type of immigrant we want in America.” Some have questioned the timing of ICE’s move, given that the rapper had been convicted of felony drug charges in 2014 (the conviction was reportedly later expunged). In the legal saga surrounding 21 Savage, I found unexpected validation. Here is a public figure who is very much black, and also an immigrant — an image that we don’t see enough and that I could have used when I was younger and grappling with my identity. It’s clear to me that 21 Savage is an immigrant and a black man, and neither invalidates the other. The foreign heritage of black immigrants like 21 Savage as well as first-generation children of African immigrants such as myself doesn’t counteract their blackness, and vice versa. It is not our responsibility to choose one identity. The inability to recognize both simultaneously has kept some from viewing his case as critically as they should. We as a society should not view race and immigration status as mutually exclusive.  Although it took the arrest of a prominent black man by one of the most feared government agencies in our nation to get us here, we are now finally starting to have a conversation about the intersection of blackness and immigration."
153,"CIUDAD JUÁREZ, Mexico — Near dawn on Friday, the line of trucks waiting to cross the border from Mexico into the United States stretched for more than three miles and wasn’t moving.Arturo Ornelas, a Mexican truck driver, was four places from the front, but his choice position had not come without sacrifice: He had joined the line at 8 a.m. Thursday and had spent the intervening 22 hours slouched in — or stretching his legs alongside — his truck, carrying a load of copper wire from a factory in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, to a warehouse in neighboring El Paso.But now his goal was finally, seemingly within reach, and he could see the twinkling lights of the American city through the nearby border fence, on the other side of the Puente Libre, or Free Bridge.“So close,” he muttered, “yet so far.”President Trump may have relented Thursday on his threat to close the southwest border of the United States in punishment for what he has said was Mexico’s failure to control illegal migration. But for a week now the border has, in effect, been partly closed because of American staffing shortages — costing businesses millions of dollars a day, according to industry officials, and causing painfully long delays for people and goods trying to legally cross the border.Last week, the Trump administration announced it was pulling 750 border agents from their normal assignments at specific ports of entry on the border, and reassigning them to help process the surge in migrants who have been crossing the border illegally and seeking asylum.The redeployments have caused slowdowns in inspections — for passenger and commercial traffic — at key crossings along the border, including between Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego; Nogales, Mexico, and Nogales, Ariz.; and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, and Laredo, Tex.The delays, which began on March 29, have been particularly severe for trucks delivering commercial goods from Mexico to the United States, with long waits fouling up production and delivery schedules on both sides of the border. According to the United States Chamber of Commerce, nearly $1.7 billion in goods and services flow across the border every day.Mexican trucking industry officials and other business leaders have reported millions of dollars a day in lost commerce and extra costs associated with the delays. Some companies in Mexico have been forced to slow or halt production as a result of the delivery delays, they said.Some firms have even resorted to shipping their products by air despite the significantly higher costs, Manuel Sotelo, a national vice president of the National Chamber of Freight Transportation in Mexico, said Friday.Business and labor leaders have warned that if the delays persist, they could lead to the cancellation of contracts and to widespread layoffs.Mr. Sotelo summed up the impact in one word: “Catastrophic.”The hardship has been particularly severe in Ciudad Juárez, a border city and major industrial center with more than 300 assembly plants covering a range of industries, including auto parts, cellphones, computers and household electronics.“In Danger, 280,000 Factory Jobs,” the front-page headline of El Diario, a newspaper in the city, announced on Friday.In a letter to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico on Friday, the Ciudad Juárez chapter of the Business Coordinating Council estimated that late deliveries would cost Mexican firms $2.1 million in overtime per day.The council also estimated that delays for trucks crossing from Ciudad Juárez to El Paso had stretched to eight hours on average. But many truckers were reporting far longer waits.Mr. Sotelo, who owns a trucking company, said that on Wednesday he dispatched 15 tractor-trailers to one of the crossings between Ciudad Juárez and El Paso. When they arrived, at about 3:30 a.m., there were already 200 other trucks in line. Twelve of his trucks were able to cross, barely making the cutoff at 11 p.m. when the crossing closed for the night. The other three had to wait until the following day.Under normal circumstances, he said, a truck can cross the border here within two hours.Business leaders said the only other border crisis that approached this one in severity was provoked by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. “After that, we had waits of up to six hours during the following days,” Mr. Sotelo said. “Today we are three times worse.”Luis Aguirre Lang, president of Index, a national manufacturing and export industry group, accused Mr. Trump of taking the Mexican and American private sectors “hostage” to put political pressure on Mexico. “We are worried,” he said.The Trump administration has characterized its redeployment of agents as a necessary step in dealing with an urgent crisis, especially in the region around Ciudad Juárez and El Paso, which has been in the vortex of the illegal migration debate.The United States Border Patrol’s El Paso sector — which covers a 268-mile stretch of border through the two westernmost counties of Texas, including El Paso, and New Mexico — has seen a huge surge in unauthorized migrants trying to cross.This cause, and the resulting effects, came into sharp focus shortly after dawn on Friday for Héctor Núñez, a driver with a Mexican trucking company.He and his rig were in the middle of the three-mile line of trucks waiting to cross the Free Bridge into El Paso. He was killing time with a colleague outside their trucks, parked along a highway that runs along the Rio Grande, when suddenly they noticed something unfolding on the other side of the river, along the border fence.At a gap in the fence, more than two dozen migrants were sitting in a row in the dirt, with several Border Patrol officials standing over them. In recent weeks, undocumented migrants, often seeking asylum in the United States, have waded across the river, barely a trickle of septic water in this location, and presented themselves to the American authorities permanently guarding the gap.Mr. Núñez, 54, understood that this sort of unauthorized crossing between legal ports of entry was precisely what was contributing to the extraordinary delays he was enduring this week.But he doled out his criticisms widely. He blamed Mr. Trump for “choking us” with his brand of politics. He blamed his own president, Mr. López Obrador, for not doing enough to halt illegal migration through Mexico.And he blamed the migrants for using Mexico as a “trampoline” to the United States, illustrating his remark with a bunny hop.But he also said he could empathize with the migrants. “It’s a dream that everyone has,” he said.Mr. Núñez gestured toward El Paso. “My dream is one day to have a tractor-trailer on that side,” he said. “Some day I want to arrive in the United States and say, ‘I’m an American truck driver!’ That’s my dream.”"
154,"Two millionaire fugitives from Ecuador, whose family poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into American political campaigns as they fought to stay in the United States, were arrested last week in Miami by immigration authorities, officials said.Roberto and William Isaías, 74 and 75, were taken on Wednesday to a detention facility where undocumented immigrants are held pending deportation, according to the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.It was not immediately clear what prompted the authorities to make the arrests, but ICE’s statement said the brothers were “unlawfully present” in the United States.The Isaías brothers, bankers vilified in Ecuador for increasing their wealth in the late 1990s just as their bank collapsed — wiping out tens of thousands of customers’ savings — were convicted of embezzlement by a court there in 2012. They were sentenced to prison terms in absentia, having arrived in South Florida almost a decade earlier.The brothers have vehemently denied accusations that they looted their bank, and said that the Ecuadorean government had politicized the case and unfairly seized their assets. They are still battling in the courts to recover their properties at home.Ecuador has estimated that the brothers cost the country $400 million, and has for years sought their extradition. At one point, even the American ambassador in Ecuador lobbied for their prompt return, accusing the men of financing a $2 million bribe to get Ecuador’s attorney general to drop the case.As their criminal case heated up in Ecuador, the cash started flowing  in the United States. The Isaías brothers’ relatives donated tens of thousands dollars to members of the United States Congress, and  $90,000 to help re-elect President Barack Obama.A year after the donation to the Obama campaign, the Department of Justice rejected Ecuador’s extradition request, saying it lacked sufficient proof.The Ecuadorean government later accused Washington of denying its request in exchange for checks. The Obama administration said the donations had nothing to do with its decisions.A renewed request for extradition is pending, said Alvin B. Davis, the Ecuadorean government’s lawyer in Miami. The Department of Justice referred questions to ICE.The Isaías brothers are now expected to appear for a deportation hearing in immigration court, said Nestor J. Yglesias, a spokesman for ICE.Mr. Davis said the government of Ecuador, having won a civil case in Florida against the brothers, is preparing to fight for some $1.3 billion in damages. The arrest left him “gratified,” he said.“They need to be held responsible after all these years,” Mr. Davis said.The Isaías’s lawyer in Ecuador, Jorge Zavala Egas, referred questions about the arrest to a South Florida publicist, Alfredo J. Balsera.Contacted by phone, Mr. Balsera said The New York Times had acted in “bad faith” in previous articles about the Isaías case and declined to comment.In a 2014 interview, Roberto Isaías denied asking for favors in exchange for political donations.“My family has given to about 20 congressmen who fight for human rights and freedom of speech in Latin America,” he said. “That’s legal.”"
155,"Kellyanne Conway, White House adviser, recently dismissed as a “silly semantic argument” questions about President Trump’s use of the word “wall” — is it concrete, steel, see-through, a “smart wall,” slatted, piked, solar-powered, a chain-link fence or just a metaphor?The semantics, however, are anything but trivial. If the White House and House Democrats are to reach a deal to avert another government shutdown by the Feb. 15 deadline, they must first reach a rough détente over what they are talking about — in particular, the definition of Mr. Trump’s “wall,” and of “border security,” the Democrats’ catchall description of their own approach.“There’s no magic glossary telling you the difference between a fence and wall or a barrier, they are kind of interchangeable,” said Jeh Johnson, who served as President Barack Obama’s homeland security secretary from 2013 to 2017. “There is a distinction between governing and political rhetoric, and people should not get trapped in the binary,’” Mr. Johnson said. “The moment when we reach a compromise on the vocabulary is the moment we reach a compromise on the policy.”Here is a glossary that could determine the fate of the debate.In the beginning, there was a tweet. At 4:34 p.m. Aug. 5, 2014, Mr. Trump sent a message: “SECURE THE BORDER! BUILD THE WALL!”Mr. Trump’s definition of “wall” has been a moving target since.In the early days of the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump said the wall should be built of “precast concrete” with “no windows, no nothing.” He now says that he always meant that steel and “see-through” materials could work, too, and has, from time to time, mused about festooning the wall with solar panels. In December, he tweeted an image showing a puzzling rendering of a picketed “Steel Slat Barrier.”Soon after taking office, the president commissioned eight prototypes of wall designs, four made of concrete and the remainder fabricated from steel and other materials. They ranged in height from 18 to 30 feet. The models were tested last year, and the results were inconclusive, according to leaked documents showing that all of them could be breached with a determined effort and the right tools. But Trump administration officials say that the testing provided them with valuable information, and lessons learned were incorporated into an already built section of slatted 30-foot-high “bollard” fence near Calexico, Calif.As Mr. Trump’s image of the wall changed, so did its price tag. He now wants $5.7 billion for the wall — but that number has bounced between $4 billion and $20 billion over the past three years. During the shutdown fight, he even suggested that he would accept an unspecified “down payment.” Ms. Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, was roundly mocked for dropping the “the” before “wall” — with critics likening it to the “I love lamp” scene from “Anchorman.” In reality, Ms. Nielsen was trying to keep her request as vague as possible to facilitate a compromise, while staying nominally true to Mr. Trump’s campaign promise.“She was lampooned,” Mr. Johnson said. “But she was really just trying to introduce the concept that a wall could be almost any kind of a barrier.”The fact that Ms. Nielsen felt compelled to use the “W” word indicated her concern about alienating members of Mr. Trump’s base, who roar “build the wall” at his rallies. To that end, members of the president’s team have been quietly removing the word “replacement” from public statements about upgrades to existing border barriers. They instead insert the word “new,” according to an official familiar with the practice.As part of the failed 2014 “Gang of Eight” effort to overhaul the nation’s immigration system, a coalition of Senate Democrats supported a $46 billion bill to expand the Border Patrol, with improvements to existing fencing. The bill was shot down by House Republicans because it included a process that would have allowed many immigrants who entered the country illegally to remain in the country.But the bill now stands as evidence to Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans of how Democrats in previous years voted to increase funding for barriers under the broad rubric of border security, when packaged with a path to citizenship. But Mr. Trump’s political weaponization of the wall is now making such a compromise increasingly untenable for Democrats. “We’re not doing a wall,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters this month. “Does anyone have any doubt that we’re not doing a wall?” The 2020 presidential campaign is making compromise even more difficult. Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, who announced this week that she is running for president, declared the wall “a medieval vanity project,” then vowed to make opposition to it a centerpiece of her campaign.“The wall concept is an anathema to most Democrats,” said Geoff Garin, a veteran Democratic pollster who works for Priorities USA, a political action committee. “They are more than willing to have a granular conversation about what is common sense and effective border security, but it’s not going to be a conversation about a wall in any sense that Trump has used the word.”The word “fence” is, for the moment at least, less politically charged than “wall.” In 2006, a coalition of Republicans and 90 Democrats in the House and the Senate — including Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, then senators — passed President George W. Bush’s plan to add more than 700 new miles of double-layered “reinforced” fencing. “I am comfortable with barriers that involve vehicles, fences,” Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, told CNN this week.But what exactly is meant by “fence”? The southern border is already a crazy-quilt of different border barriers of different sizes, different materials, installed in different eras — known, by and large, as fencing.And they have different uses. Urban chain-link is meant to deter migrants on foot; an array of metal and concrete “vehicle barriers” have been strung in remote areas; and stretches of concertina wire are used to fill in gaps where there are no permanent structures and on top of structures where there are some. There are also dozens of variants — pickets, corrugated panels, berms, X-shaped steel barriers, even planked walls placed along Gulf Coast beaches. In recent budget bills, Democrats have insisted on a provision limiting the expansion of barriers to “existing” technologies, a move intended to frame any new construction as an old “fence” rather than a new “wall,” according to a senior Democratic congressional aide.Back in 2006, Ms. Pelosi and other congressional liberals voted against the reinforced fencing bill. It is not clear they would support a similar measure even if it were part of a more extensive deal that included a reprieve for the young undocumented immigrants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, was one of those who supported the 2006 bill, and late last year offered Mr. Trump a $25 billion deal that included protections for DACA recipients — and left open the possibility of more fencing. Ms. Pelosi did not agree to the proposal.Mr. Trump’s $5.7 billion request would pay for the installation of barriers on another 215 miles of border — in addition to an estimated 654 miles of fencing, much of it in the form of vehicle barriers, currently in place along the 1,900-mile border. That number would include installation of about 100 miles of barriers to keep out migrants, many from Central America, seeking to enter the country on foot in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. Before the shutdown, Republican senators, led by John Cornyn of Texas, proposed passing $1.6 billion in funding for 65 miles of that project.The idea went nowhere at the time. But a handful of congressional Democrats, including Senator Jon Tester of Montana, did not rule out supporting the plan in the future.“The walls we are building are not medieval walls,” Mr. Trump said on Jan. 25 during his rambling Rose Garden announcement of the three-week funding deal that ended the 35-day government shutdown. “These barriers are made of steel, have see-through visibility, which is very important, and are equipped with sensors, monitors and cutting-edge technology, including state-of-the-art drones,” he told reporters.It seems like an unlikely gateway to compromise, but some Democrats believe the president was signaling his willingness to accept funding for new technologies, beyond steel and concrete.Two days earlier, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking Democrat in the House, told reporters that he would be open to fulfilling Mr. Trump’s $5.7 billion request if it were spent on a smart wall, targeted at improving border surveillance, the expanded use of drones and X-ray technology to screen for weapons and drugs, as well as on the hiring of more Border Patrol agents.Mr. Trump, aides said, is open to spending some of the money on similar improvements. His idea of a smart wall was inspired by the one built by Israel on its border with Gaza, which uses high-tech surveillance equipment, including closed-circuit cameras.Mr. Trump’s language has softened as the funding fight has intensified, and “barrier” now enjoys pride of place next to “wall.”“If the committee of Republicans and Democrats now meeting on Border Security is not discussing or contemplating a Wall or Physical Barrier, they are Wasting their time!” he tweeted on Wednesday.A day later, he was back to wall-only: “Lets just call them WALLS from now on and stop playing political games! A WALL is a WALL!” he tweeted on Thursday.Whether Mr. Trump was providing semantic cover for a compromise deal may depend on whether he is disciplined enough to tone down his messaging. His allies seem eager for him to do so.“It doesn’t have to be a wall,” Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, told reporters on Tuesday. “Physical barriers would be fine.”"
156,"Is the border wall ethical? President Trump has suggested the wall is moral and those who oppose it immoral. His critics claim the opposite. To answer this, we have to consider its effect on humans. What harm could a border wall cause to immigrants and refugees, all of whom are equal to us in the eyes of God? Some people who cross the border are in desperate search of work to support their families. A wall would probably drive them into more remote areas of the desert or mountains, possibly to their deaths, as the forces driving them — violence, persecution and extreme poverty — are more life threatening than a risky border crossing. In fact, close to 8,000 migrants have died in Arizona and parts of Texas since the construction of the San Diego and El Paso sectors of the wall in the mid-1990s.The latest arrivals at our border are primarily asylum seekers from the Northern Triangle of Central America, who, when they cross the border and ask for protection, are in compliance with both our domestic and our international laws — the Refugee Act of 1980 and the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention and its 1967 protocols.A wall would prevent asylum seekers from asking for protection at any point along our border — their right under the law — and would leave many of them at the mercy of drug cartels and other criminal groups in northern Mexico. More humane ways to achieve border security can be found to avoid these harmful consequences, through technology, additional legal avenues for entry and policies that address the factors pushing migration. You must also look at the intent of someone who wants to construct a wall in order to determine its morality. In this case, it is clear that Mr. Trump wants to deny entry to anyone crossing the southern border, even those who have a right to cross and seek protection and are no threat to us. The administration has just instituted a policy known as “Remain in Mexico,” which requires asylum seekers to stay in that country until their hearings, a process that could keep them vulnerable to organized crime for months or years.Mr. Trump is not acting with concern for the impact of the wall on their lives, including those of children, who would remain subject to danger. He also ignores the adverse impact of the wall on the environment, landowners and border communities, like the harm it can cause to wildlife and vegetation, the livelihoods of ranchers and farmers and cross-border commerce.Other policies his administration has pursued, including family separation, the rollback of asylum laws, family detention, the elimination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and termination of Temporary Protected Status for most of its beneficiaries, show that the administration’s intent is to rid the United States of as many immigrants — legal or otherwise — as possible.The way in which Mr. Trump has argued for a wall also is instructive. In trying to secure funding, he has cast all immigrants as criminals and threats to national security by spreading misleading and inaccurate information about them. His justification for the wall is based upon lies and smears against the vast majority of immigrants who are law-abiding and moral, but whom he paints as less than human.The president likes to highlight violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, for example, but fails to point out that immigrants commit crimes, including violent ones, at a much lower rate than citizens. All Americans grieve the harm caused when a violent crime is committed. That does not mean they agree that a border wall is the most effective way to prevent it. A wall itself is not immoral, but it can be constructed for an immoral purpose. President John F. Kennedy and President Ronald Reagan both resisted the Berlin Wall, which prevented millions in the Soviet Bloc from seeking freedom in the West. It eventually came down.Immigration reform that is humane and honors our nation’s values must finally be enacted, and the root causes of global migration addressed. This is the moral direction in which the president should lead the nation."
157,"Two students at the University of Arizona are facing criminal charges after protesting the appearance of United States Customs and Border Protection officers at an event last month on campus, an official said Tuesday.Denisse Moreno Melchor, 20, and Mariel Alexandra Bustamante, 22, were charged on Monday with interfering with the peaceful conduct of an educational institution, a misdemeanor, said Chris W. Sigurdson, a university spokesman. Ms. Moreno Melchor was also charged with making threats and intimidation, he said.The students are scheduled to appear at the Pima County Justice Court on April 22, he said. They have not been barred from campus.The students did not immediately reply to requests for comment. A Class 1 misdemeanor carries a possible sentence of up to six months in jail, Mr. Sigurdson said.The charges were related to what the university called a “disturbance” on March 19 at the Modern Languages building, where Border Patrol officers were making a presentation at a student club event, Mr. Sigurdson said.Video of the confrontation showed two agents giving a presentation while people outside called them “murderers” and “an extension of the K.K.K.,” The Arizona Republic reported. A group of people followed the agents after they left the building, chanting “Murder Patrol.”The episode raised issues about the extent to which freedom of speech is allowed on college campuses. Customs and Border Protection, the nation’s main border protection agency and the largest law enforcement agency in the country, is at the forefront of the debate over undocumented immigration as it plays out along the southern border, including in Arizona. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Associated Students of the University of Arizona, the student government body, said in a statement on March 21 that the presence of the uniformed agents on campus “will always be immensely harmful to our DACA and undocumented community,” referring to beneficiaries of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.It said that on the same day the border officials were on the university’s campus, in Tucson, a local family was “arrested and detained” just miles away.“The concerns students have of USBP are real, they are valid, and they need to be heard,” the statement said.The president of the university, Robert C. Robbins, said in a letter to students dated March 22 that the event raised concerns over privacy and the rights of students to hold a campus event without disruption.“While we will act within the law, the university will always protect students’ confidential information, including their immigration status, and we will work with other authorities to moderate disruptions on campus,” he wrote.“At the same time, all members of our campus community should be able to engage with a variety of viewpoints and positions and express themselves as well,” he said.Dr. Robbins went further in a second statement to students a week later, saying the confrontation between the protesting students and members of the organization that hosted the event, the Criminal Justice Association, was a “dramatic departure from our expectations of respectful behavior and support for free speech on this campus.”“Student protest is protected by our support for free speech, but disruption is not,” he added.Dr. Robbins said there would also be an investigation into the actions of university employees, but he gave no details. Mr. Sigurdson said on Tuesday that the university police were still investigating."
158,"Julián Castro, the former housing secretary and former mayor of San Antonio, announced on Saturday that he would run for president, one of the most high-profile Latino Democrats ever to seek the party’s nomination.His first campaign stop will be in Puerto Rico, where he will speak on Monday at the Latino Victory Fund’s annual summit and meet with residents still struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria. Later in the week, his campaign said, he will go to New Hampshire.“When my grandmother got here almost a hundred years ago,” Mr. Castro said at the Plaza Guadalupe amphitheater in San Antonio, in the neighborhood where he was raised. “I’m sure that she never could have imagined that just two generations later, one of her grandsons would be serving as a member of the United States Congress and the other would be standing with you here today to say these words: I am a candidate for president of the United States of America.”Mr. Castro’s announcement had been expected for several weeks. He established an exploratory committee in December, two months after publishing a memoir, “An Unlikely Journey” — a familiar path for presidential candidates who want to play up their life stories and qualifications and, perhaps, get ahead of their biggest vulnerabilities. This month he also visited two of the early caucus and primary states, Iowa and Nevada.He joins Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former State Senator Richard Ojeda of West Virginia and former Representative John Delaney of Maryland on the list of Democrats who have said definitively that they will seek for the party’s 2020 nomination. That list is expected to grow considerably in the coming weeks and months.In his speech on Saturday, Mr. Castro emphasized education, calling for a national version of the prekindergarten program he established in San Antonio when he was mayor. To fund the program there, he increased the city’s sales tax — a politically risky proposition, especially in Texas, but San Antonio voters approved it.His message was firmly progressive. He called for a higher minimum wage, denounced police killings of African-Americans, which he described as “state violence,” and embraced the Black Lives Matter movement. He also condemned President Trump’s immigration policy, including the practice of family separation and the proposed border wall, and declared that his first executive order if elected would be to rejoin the Paris climate accords, which Mr. Trump left.George Rodriguez, a conservative blogger, talk-show host and Fox News contributor whom Texas Republican leaders designated as their spokesman on the announcement, said after the speech that the discussion of immigration had stood out to him. Mr. Castro, he said, did not “seem to be able to distinguish between legal and illegal immigration.”Mr. Rodriguez also argued that the San Antonio pre-K program, which was one of Mr. Castro’s chief accomplishments as mayor, had duplicated existing programs like Head Start. “How much of an accomplishment that is is rather dubious,” he said.[Read about what Mr. Castro and the other early entrants will be doing in the early days of the 2020 campaign.]Mr. Castro, 44, was raised in San Antonio in a politically active family. His mother, Rosie Castro, was an activist with the Mexican-American political party La Raza Unida and frequently took Julián and his twin brother, Joaquin — now a congressman — to rallies and meetings. Joaquin Castro will be the chairman of Julián’s campaign.At the age of 26, Mr. Castro became San Antonio’s youngest City Council member, and after one unsuccessful campaign for mayor in 2005, he was elected to the city’s top job in 2009. In 2012, he delivered the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention — the same platform that catapulted Barack Obama, then a little-known state senator, to national prominence in 2004. Mr. Obama, as president, later chose him to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development.In a statement on Saturday, the Republican National Committee previewed one of the main arguments it is likely to use against Mr. Castro, calling him a “lightweight” without the experience needed to be president.Mr. Castro has brushed off concerns that he is not as experienced or as well known as many of the other likely candidates.“In my whole life, I don’t think I’ve ever started out as the front-runner,” he told The New York Times last month. “I grew up in a neighborhood where nobody growing up there was the front-runner at anything. So I’m not going to concern myself with who people think of as the front-runner and who they don’t.”Among the Democrats frequently mentioned as 2020 contenders, he is one of the youngest. If elected, he would be the third-youngest person ever to become president, after Theodore Roosevelt (42) and John F. Kennedy (43).The full field of candidates could include former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Bernie Sanders of Vermont; and former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas, who ran a high-profile but unsuccessful campaign against Senator Ted Cruz last year.Surrounded by his supporters after the speech, Mr. Castro was asked whether he expected to face a fellow Texan, Mr. O’Rourke, in the race. “There will probably be 15 or 20 people in the race, so it’s going to be crowded,” he said."
159,"[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]Marco A. De La Garza Jr. spent nearly six years as a federal officer with Customs and Border Protection, working on the front lines of America’s southern border in Arizona and doing his best to keep undocumented immigrants out of the United States.A Navy veteran, he was known for going the extra mile: One day, while off duty, he rushed out of a barbecue at his in-laws’ house in Sierra Vista, Ariz., when he spotted an undocumented man being chased by the Border Patrol. He tackled the runner and held him until the agents caught up.Few knew Mr. De La Garza’s secret: He was undocumented, too.The nation’s main border protection agency had hired an unauthorized immigrant to police the border — one of at least four cases of undocumented workers revealed to be working at federal immigration agencies in recent years.Mr. De La Garza, 38, was born in Mexico, and had lied about his citizenship status and supplied his employer with a fraudulent Texas birth certificate that falsely said he was born in Brownsville, Tex.“In retrospect, I fully understand now that I was being selfish in my desire to serve my country that I had so loved,” he wrote after he was indicted by a federal grand jury on three counts of passport fraud and making false statements on his application for a federal law enforcement background check.Mr. De La Garza agreed to plead guilty to one count of passport fraud, and the other two counts were dropped. On Thursday he was sentenced in Federal District Court in Tucson to one year of probation and a $1,000 fine. Judge Raner C. Collins said his service to the country “ought to count for something.”Before the brief hearing, Mr. De La Garza was surrounded by friends and relatives, including his two daughters, aged 2 and 4, who are United States citizens. He stood quietly before the judge dressed in a black suit.The Trump administration has pushed employers to stop hiring undocumented workers, urging the use of electronic verification tools and document checks and conducting hundreds of workplace raids to arrest and deport unauthorized immigrants. The fact that one was working in its own federal ranks shows the difficulty of ascertaining work status in a nation where the labor of immigrants is considered crucial in many industries. There are an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country.Federal authorities also must field a work force that by design reflects the heavily Hispanic communities across the Southwest they are expected to police. Agents sometimes have relatives, friends and neighbors whom they know or suspect are undocumented. In South Texas, one of the most heavily traveled migrant corridors in the country, Border Patrol agents or their spouses have sometimes hired undocumented housekeepers, as do many of their neighbors.Mr. De La Garza’s deception was unusual for Customs and Border Protection, the largest law enforcement agency in the country, with nearly twice the staff of the F.B.I. Yet it was not unprecedented. There have been at least three other cases of undocumented people working as Customs officers or Border Patrol agents who were prosecuted in federal court in recent years.One of those cases involved Oscar Antonio Ortiz, a Border Patrol agent in the San Diego area, who first applied for work in the weeks after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Like Mr. De La Garza, Mr. Ortiz was a Mexican citizen with a fraudulent birth certificate who had also served in the Navy. But once he was hired by Border Patrol, Mr. Ortiz got involved, along with another agent, in human smuggling: transporting migrants for money into the United States, sometimes in their Border Patrol vehicles, according to court documents. Mr. Ortiz, who had been assigned to the Border Patrol station in El Cajon, Calif., was sentenced in 2006 to five years in prison.Mr. Ortiz was later deported and now lives in Mexico. His lawyer, Stephen P. White, said his client had believed, like Mr. De La Garza, that he was born in the United States, based on what his parents told him and the fraudulent birth certificate they had provided him.“He got security clearances, background checks multiple times and was as surprised as anybody else to find out that he wasn’t a U.S. citizen when he got arrested on the alien smuggling charge,” Mr. White said.Mr. De La Garza worked at the port of entry in Douglas, Ariz., about 120 miles southeast of Tucson. He lived with his wife and children about 40 miles west of Douglas in the town of Hereford, and appeared to relish his job, filling his home with mugs, clocks and other trinkets bearing Customs or Navy logos. He was born in Matamoros, Mexico, and lived for most of his childhood in Mexico with his mother, moving to the South Texas city of Brownsville as a teenager. In 2003, at the age of 23, he enlisted in the Navy and served on the U.S.S. Greeneville, a nuclear submarine. He received an honorable discharge in 2008, and went to work for Customs and Border Protection in 2012, earning a spot as a squad leader at the agency’s basic training academy in Georgia.The authorities appeared to first learn that Mr. De La Garza was actually a Mexican citizen around the time he applied for a United States passport in 2017.Mr. De La Garza wrote in a letter he submitted to Judge Collins that he had believed in his youth that he was American.“Growing up, my parents told me that I was a U.S. citizen, and my whole childhood I was led to believe this was true,” he wrote. “Because of that, I grew up thinking I would do my duty one day and join the U.S. military.”Both of his parents tried to discourage that idea, and when, as a teenager in Mexico, he asked for his birth certificate, he was told the truth. His mother, he wrote, “told me that I had been lied to my whole life and I was and had been all along, a Mexican citizen. I refused to believe that to be the truth, and still came to America with my U.S. birth certificate that she had given me.”The birth certificate was a legitimate government-issued document that was based on fraudulent information. Prosecutors said that it listed Brownsville as his place of birth in December 1980. In reality, he was born in Mexico in October 1980.The midwife listed on the Texas birth record was convicted in 1984 of conspiracy to make false statements on birth certificates, prosecutors said.Nonetheless, Mr. De La Garza used that birth certificate to claim American citizenship, including for his five-year background check for Customs and Border Protection in October 2016 and on his passport application in October 2017.Citing his lack of any criminal history, federal probation officials recommended to the court that he serve one year of probation with no prison time. Mr. De La Garza told the judge in his letter that he hoped to one day legalize his immigration status, and his lawyer, Matthew H. Green, said that under the Immigration and Nationality Act, he was eligible as a veteran to apply for citizenship one year after the date of his criminal conviction.But it remains unclear whether Mr. De La Garza will be allowed to remain in the United States. He faces the possibility of being deported, but Mr. Green said that he had been told that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials decided against removal proceedings.“That’s what we have to look forward to at this point, applying for naturalization in a year,” he said.In a letter to the court, Mr. Green said his client had one hope: “Mr. De La Garza and his family ask only one thing from the United States — they ask for a second chance.”"
160,"WASHINGTON — Democratic congressional leaders called on President Trump on Tuesday to reopen the federal government while they resolve differences with him over securing the southern border, in a formal response to his prime-time address from the Oval Office that they dismissed as riddled with misinformation and fear-mongering.“The president has chosen fear; we want to start with the facts,” said Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, speaking from her office at the Capitol beside Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, as they delivered a joint response to the president.She said Mr. Trump had rejected bipartisan legislation to reopen the government “over his obsession with forcing American taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective wall — a wall he always promised Mexico would pay for.”Mr. Schumer suggested that the president’s formal address to the nation — Mr. Trump’s first from the Oval Office — had been a stunt. “This president just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration,” he said.The dueling speeches from opposite sides of Pennsylvania Avenue unfolded at the close of Day 18 of a government shutdown over Mr. Trump’s demand for $5.7 billion for a border wall that Democrats have steadfastly opposed.The Democratic leaders’ decision to select themselves as the message bearers to counter the president underscores how a partisan power struggle in a new era of divided government is undergirding the discussions over resolving the shutdown, even as the paychecks of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and benefits for millions of Americans hang in the balance.Mr. Trump, who spent much of the first two weeks of the shutdown cloistered inside the White House saying little about it, is now using the powers of the presidency to focus public attention on his ominous immigration message in an effort to build support for the idea of erecting a large wall on the border with Mexico. Democrats, newly in control of the House, are steering clear of talk of the wall itself, and are instead working to focus attention on the damaging impacts of the shutdown.“We don’t govern by temper tantrum,” Mr. Schumer said. “No president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down, hurting millions of Americans who are treated as leverage.”Appealing to Mr. Trump directly, he added, “Mr. President, reopen the government and we can work to resolve our differences over border security, but end this shutdown now.”Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, used a response to the president he streamed live on YouTube to brand Mr. Trump a liar, and ticked down a list of misstatements the president uttered during his address.“It gives me no pleasure to tell you what most of you already know, and that is that President Trump lies all of the time, and in remarks tonight and in recent weeks regarding immigration and the wall, he continues to lie,” Mr. Sanders said.He went on to discuss the plight of millions of Americans who lack health insurance, elderly people who have no retirement savings, millions more with crippling student debt and the specter of global climate change, arguing that those challenges were far more pressing than the one posed by illegal immigration.“We don’t need to create artificial crises,” Mr. Sanders said. “We have enough real crises.”Mr. Trump is planning a trip to the border in McAllen, Tex., on Thursday, while Democrats plan to bring up a succession of bills this week to reopen shuttered parts of the government, including the Internal Revenue Service, to allow tax refunds to be paid, and the Agriculture Department, to ensure that food assistance and farmer support payments can be made.The Treasury Department and the I.R.S. will come first, then Agriculture and Interior Department programs, including the national parks, on Thursday, followed by transportation and housing programs on Friday.“We are going to, daily, urge and take efforts to open up the government,” said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader. “Whatever problems confront us, they are exacerbated — not relieved — by shutting down government.”A group of Senate Democrats spent Tuesday evening taking turns on the Senate floor calling on Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to bring up the House-passed legislation to reopen the government. The dozen Democrats, led by Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, plan to spotlight the harm from the shutdown on federal workers and those who benefit from government programs.“Rather than Donald Trump putting on a political show tonight on TV and a political trip to the border tomorrow, I invite the president to come anywhere in Virginia, Maryland or the District and sit down with federal employees and explain this crisis and why they are not getting paid,” said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia. “We need to negotiate additional border security — I am all for it — but not holding hostage, literally, our federal employees and countless others.”In the House, the shutdown has proved a unifying issue for newly elected Democrats who campaigned as fierce opponents of Mr. Trump. In a brief but scathing speech from the House floor, Representative Ayanna Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, spoke directly to the president, uttering his name and earning a gentle reprimand from the presiding officer, who reminded her that lawmakers are barred from personally impugning the president or other elected officials.“You devalue the life of the immigrant, the worker and the survivor,” Ms. Pressley said. “This has nothing to do with border security; your shutdown, another Trump-generated crisis, has brought a tsunami of hurt to the American people.”"
161,"Starting as early as 2005, politicians have claimed to have discovered discarded prayer rugs — and perhaps even Qurans or “a lot of stuff written in Arabic” — at the southern border, hinting without evidence that Islamic migrants were entering the United States through Mexico and could pose a terrorism threat. Mr. Trump’s tweet revived this long-running and still unproved rumor. He was citing an interview in The Washington Examiner, a conservative newspaper, with one anonymous female rancher who lives on the border.“I’ve never seen any Middle Easterners — I’ve seen prayer rugs out here — but I’ve never seen any myself,” the woman, whose face is obscured, said in a videotaped interview.Asma Afsaruddin, a professor of Islamic studies at Indiana University, said that prayer rugs were meant to be kept clean and doubted that they would be deserted by practicing Muslims.“Standing in a clean place is a requirement of Islamic prayer,” she said. “Many of these rugs have images of the Kaaba in Mecca and other religious symbols on them. For all these reasons, they would not be just casually tossed around or carelessly discarded to be desecrated by others.” The rancher also told The Examiner that she had heard from Border Patrol agents that migration from countries other than Mexico “has really increased in the last couple years, but drastically even in the last six months.” “Chinese, Germans, Russians, a lot of Middle Easterners,” she continued. “Those Czechoslovakians they caught over on our neighbor this last summer.”Czechoslovakia split into two countries in 1993. Of the more than 300,000 people apprehended at the southern border in the 2017 fiscal year, fewer than one-half of 1 percent were from the countries the rancher listed (1,364 from China, two from Germany, eight from Russia, 61 from countries the State Department deems the Middle East, one from the Czech Republic and one from Slovakia).“There’s a lot of people coming in from not just from Mexico,” the rancher added. “People, the general public, just don’t get the terrorist facts of that.” That claim echoes earlier ones from Mr. Trump: baseless warnings that “unknown Middle Easterners” had infiltrated a migrant caravan and that terrorists were pouring across the southern border.Nowhere in the White House’s 25-page counterterrorism policy, released in October, was the threat of terrorists infiltrating the nation’s southwest border raised. And the State Department, in a September report, said there was “no credible evidence” that terrorist groups had sent operatives to enter the United States through Mexico.The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for evidence of Mr. Trump’s claims. The Washington Examiner report, like most of its predecessors over the past decade, did not include any photographic evidence of the prayer rugs in question and largely relied on hearsay. “Along the Mexican border there have been stories of suspicious items picked up by local residents, including Muslim prayer rugs and notebooks written in both Arabic and Spanish,” former Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, warned in a March 2005 speech.Later that year, former Representative Tom Tancredo, Republican of Colorado, told CBS that, during a visit to the border in Arizona, “we’ve found copies of the Quran, we have found prayer rugs, we have found a lot of stuff written in Arabic, so it’s not just people from Mexico coming across that border.”In 2014, David Dewhurst, then the lieutenant governor of Texas, invoked prayer rugs found “on the Texas side of the border in the brush.” PolitiFact Texas rated his claim “Pants on Fire,” and noted that it could find only one photo of a purported prayer rug, presented by the conservative news outlet Breitbart. That photo, eight scholars and religious figures said, looked nothing like a prayer rug, and it appears to have been removed from the current version of the Breitbart article. (Perhaps, suggested Gawker, the photo was actually of an Adidas soccer jersey.)In 2015, the right-wing outlet Judicial Watch reported, based on unnamed sources, that Muslim prayer rugs were recovered at an Islamic State training camp eight miles away from the United States-Mexico border. Federal and local officials in the United States and Mexico denied those claims.These persistent rumors promote the message that Muslims inherently “constitute a menace and danger to our safety,” Professor Afsaruddin said. “Remember Sinbad and his flying rug in the Arabian Nights? Maybe that is what they are remembering — after all, the Arabian Nights ‘prove’ that this is how Arabs and Muslims get around — talk about enduring stereotypes from the world of fantasy!” The most recent news reports about prayer rugs on the southern border surfaced last summer — describing a scene in the fictional action film “Sicario: Day of the Soldado.”Curious about the accuracy of a claim?

162,"LONDON — In an apparent effort to bolster his case for a wall along the Mexican border, President Trump pointed on Wednesday to examples of walls going up around the world, especially barriers built in Europe, as proof that they work.Here’s an assessment of those claims.While governments around the world have built or planned to build 77 walls, about seven such barriers are not expected to materialize anytime soon, said Elisabeth Vallet, a researcher at the University of Quebec in Montreal who keeps a tally of such construction. Seventy walls is closer to the truth, she said. Europe has built about 1,000 kilometers, or just over 620 miles, of walls since 2015, Ms. Vallet said. The White House did not respond to questions about the source of the numbers the president cited in his tweet. Some observers on social media speculated that he had been watching a report on Fox Business that examined the issue the night before.What Mr. Trump may think of as a “big, beautiful wall,” whether made of concrete or steel slats, would not fit the definition in Europe. Most of the walls he referred to on the Continent are, in fact, different styles of fences with masonry foundations. And not all of them were designed with migration in mind. Countries like Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary and Slovenia have built walls since 2015 to quell the flow of migrants arriving mainly from the Middle East via the Balkan Route. But Ukraine and the Baltic States that share borders with Russia have started raising barriers to mark their territories in response to perceived threats of invasion from their larger neighbor. “Almost a third of the walls in the world are designed to keep the neighbor out,” Ms. Vallet said. Much like the desert terrain along the United States border with Mexico, the perilous seas, not walls, have been the main obstacle for people trying to get to Europe. The Continent has gone beyond building walls to impede the arrival of undocumented migrants. Frontex, the European Union’s border agency, and national governments raised a security apparatus that is often referred to as Fortress Europe.It includes naval patrols and surveillance on the Mediterranean, where most migrants try to cross into Europe. European governments work with countries like Libya, Morocco and Turkey to try to deter migrants from attempting deadly sea crossings. Last year, an estimated 150,000 illegal crossings were detected on the external borders of the European Union, according to Frontex. (The same person may attempt the crossing and be counted in different locations.) This was 25 percent less than in 2017, and the lowest level in five years.Still, far-right politicians like Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary have promoted the specter of an impending migration crisis, accompanied by xenophobic rhetoric, to justify funds for border protection. [Read more about whether Europe is still facing a migration crisis.]“The boosting and militarization of border security has led to a higher death toll for forcibly displaced persons,” according to a report released in May by the Transnational Institute, a research and advocacy institute.In another report on border walls, researchers at the institute looked at maritime barriers in the Mediterranean and considered them as significant or more significant than land barriers on the European continent. Walls have worked for politicians who used them as a means to mobilize supporters, but not to deal with the problem of migration, Nick Buxton, a researcher with the institute, said by phone. “You can build more and more walls until you’re a completely walled society, but all you’re doing is making it more and more dangerous,” he said. “People will find ways to cross walls.” The fence around the entrance of the tunnel providing the only land access to Britain from Continental Europe has failed to deter illegal crossings. Last year, about 500 migrants, 10 times as many as in 2017, attempted to cross the perilous waters of the English Channel from France. More than half completed the journey.Reports of smugglers operating around most of these points of access suggest to researchers that walls alone cannot solve the problem. “Every time you have a border fence and no public policy that is dealing with the root problem, it is as if you were inviting organized crime to the table,” Ms. Vallet said. Ms. Vallet said she could not think of historical examples of walls that work. She noted that both the Great Wall of China and the Maginot Line in France — each built at great expense — ultimately failed to stop invaders. "
163,"SANTA ROSA DE COPAN, Honduras — Hundreds of Hondurans traveling in vehicles and on foot converged on the Guatemalan border on Tuesday, part of a new migrant caravan bound for the United States which President Trump has already used as fresh ammunition in his fight for border wall funding.The caravan began departing from the northern Honduran city of San Pedro Sula on Monday night. Others set off throughout the day on Tuesday. Honduran authorities estimated that between 800 and 1,000 people were in the caravan, while officials from Honduras’ National Human Rights Commission put the range between 1,500 and 2,000.Mr. Trump, whose dispute with Congress over his demand for $5.7 billion for a border wall between Mexico and the United States has led to a partial shutdown of the federal government since Dec. 22, warned on Twitter on Tuesday about the new mass migration.“A big new Caravan is heading up to our Southern Border from Honduras,” he wrote. “Only a Wall, or Steel Barrier, will keep our Country safe! Stop playing political games and end the Shutdown!”The new caravan is following in the footsteps of several other large migrant groups that left Central America last fall and crossed Guatemala and Mexico, with thousands of participants ending up in or near the city of Tijuana in northern Mexico.The Trump administration has excoriated Central American and Mexican governments for failing to stop the caravans, which met little resistance at the various international borders they crossed on the way north.In a show of muscle on Tuesday, however, the Honduran government vowed vigilance at its border with Guatemala and said it had detained 60 minors without proper travel documents to leave Honduras.“The border and the illegal crossings are reinforced,” Julián Pacheco, the Honduran security minister, told reporters on Tuesday. “If people are going to leave, they have to leave through legal, authorized points.”The Mexican government has also vowed to harden its southern border to block the passage of any undocumented migrants in the latest caravan. Olga Sánchez, the country’s interior minister, said that officials had identified about 370 illegal points of entry along its border with Guatemala and planned to monitor them to prevent illegal crossings.Tens of thousands of Hondurans and other Central Americans have migrated north in recent years, fleeing rampant violence and poverty. Some have chosen to move in large, semi-coordinated groups or caravans, offering participants a degree of security against the many perils that lurk on the migrant trail, including muggings, extortion and rape.Until last year, most caravans went largely unnoticed. But a migration that began in southern Mexico last spring drew the attention of Mr. Trump, who warned that the group posed a threat to the United States’ sovereignty.An even larger group set off from Honduras in October, drawing the ire of Mr. Trump as well as international media attention. It was followed by other groups and by mid-November, more than 6,000 migrants, nearly all from Central America, had made it as far as Tijuana.Hundreds of them have applied for asylum in the United States while others have tried to cross the border illegally. Still others have decided to remain in Mexico, availing themselves of the Mexican government’s offer of humanitarian visas and work permits. Hundreds more, frustrated with their inability to cross legally into the United States, have been voluntarily repatriated to their homes in Central America.But neither the dashed hopes of so many from last year’s caravans nor Mr. Trump’s threats seemed to discourage many of the participants in the latest caravan.“Even though a wall is being built, that’s not going to stop us,” said Junior Aleman, 17, who was walking with a group of about a dozen migrants through the mountains of western Honduras on Tuesday. The group had left San Pedro Sula on Monday night and, through a combination of walking and hitching rides, were making their way toward the Honduras-Guatemala border crossing at Agua Caliente.He intended to try to cross illegally into the United States and head for Virginia, where two of his aunts lived. There, he said, he planned to find a job — something that had been hard to come by in Honduras.“There’s no work and I want to help my family,” he said."
164,"Offering traditional Mexican food and social justice conversations, La Morada in the South Bronx is equal parts restaurant and refuge. Run by an immigrant family from Oaxaca, it is home to both fresh tostadas and a community book exchange.The purple walls are adorned with posters denouncing deportations and neighborhood children’s art projects. And one member of the family once spent two weeks in an Arizona immigration jail — by choice — as a form of political protest.But on Friday, an altercation between one of La Morada’s owners and police officers turned the haven into a hostile flash point, fracturing an often strained relationship between police officers in the 40th Precinct and the community they serve in the South Bronx.The interaction resulted in the arrest of Yajaira Saavedra, a daughter of Natalia Mendez and Antonio Saavedra, who opened the restaurant in 2009. Police also attempted to arrest her younger sister, Carolina, 25, but after Carolina started showing signs of a panic attack, police did not carry out the arrest, according to the Saavedra family.A few hours later Ms. Saavedra, 30, was released and her arrest voided after police determined she had not committed a crime.“As an undocumented immigrant, we are always on our toes when it comes to immigration raids and police raids, ” said Ms. Saavedra, who is a recipient of DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that protects undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. “They both create terror.”Accounts of the incident depict an ill-fated encounter between police in the midst of a sting operation that ended with an officer’s safety in jeopardy and a community with deep-seated distrust of all police activity.La Morada is situated in a part of New York City where homicides, fueled by entrenched poverty and rival criminal crews fighting over turf, stubbornly persist.Whereas some police precincts in New York now regularly experience no killings in a given year, the 40th Precinct in the Bronx — made up of the Melrose, Mott Haven, and Port Morris neighborhoods — logged 14 in 2016, six in 2017, and eight last year.To crack down on crime, officers in the 40th Precinct are active in the area but have tried to limit negative interactions with residents to maintain public trust, according to the police.“There has been a significant decrease in the number of interactions with the public while crime has continued to decrease,” according to Lt. John Grimpel, an NYPD spokesman. “We continue to correct conditions while at the same time using discretion and precision.”After the community fallout from Ms. Saavedra’s arrest, the 40th Precinct’s Community Affairs Unit said they were doing outreach to explain what happened and hear community members’ concerns. But that outreach does not always attract the community buy-in the unit needs to change residents’ negative perception of the police.“We put ourselves out there, we make ourselves available to the public, but we don’t receive the participation from the community we would like to see,” said Detective Claudia Mera of the Community Affairs Unit.The unit holds a meeting once every three months and invites area residents to bring up concerns.Still, there is no specific plan to address the incident at La Morada.Members of the community believe the tactics they use have created a schism between law-abiding residents and police officers who treat all residents as a possible threat.“I’ve been working in and with this community for two decades now and police brutality has always been an issue, relationships between the police department and the community have always been an issue,” said Alyshia Galvez, 45, a cultural anthropologist who works in the South Bronx. “The way Yajaira was disrespected is the same way other members of the community are disrespected on a daily basis.”For the South Bronx’s immigrant community, a negative experience with the police is not just an issue of respect and trust. It also brings fears for their immigration status. For Ms. Saavedra, her arrest made that fear palpable.“It doesn’t matter if I live in a sanctuary city,” she said. When the incident occurred, “I was just thinking that this could lead to my deportation.”It all began around 4:30 p.m. last Friday when an undercover officer from the Bronx narcotics unit made a felony purchase of narcotics on the street outside the restaurant and the individual from whom she purchased the drugs began acting aggressive, according to a police spokesman.Noticing what appeared to be an arrest happening outside the restaurant, Ms. Saavedra began filming the incident on her phone, mindful of the stories she hears often from friends and customers of what she describes as prejudiced police practices in the neighborhood.The police do “not have a good relationship with the community,” Ms. Saavedra said. “We see them making unfair arrests, racially profiling us, so I started recording so if that happened it could be exposed.”As the undercover officer entered La Morada for her own safety, another plainclothes officer approached Ms. Saavedra’s brother, Marco Saavedra, and asked him to momentarily close the restaurant to new customers. The siblings instead asked that the officers leave, explaining they did not want to be involved in any police activity.“I could tell the officer was getting frustrated, and that’s when he said he would ‘flip the place upside down’ if we didn’t do what he told us to,” said Mr. Saavedra.The police officers then left the restaurant, returning minutes later with additional officers and handcuffing Ms. Saavedra.Ms. Saavedra was trembling as she described her encounter on Monday morning after community members filled the restaurant offering their support.“La Morada is like the watering hole for this community, it’s our meeting point, and this family is an inspiration for us,” said Vanna Valdez, a 31-year-old resident who has lived in the neighborhood her entire life.Ms. Saavedra’s parents opened La Morada in 2009, after living in the United States for 17 years. When they came in 1992 after crossing the Sonoran Desert, their plan was to stay only one year. But settling into Washington Heights, her mother, Natalia Mendez, was impressed by the schools and the neighborhood so she sent for her children to come join them and begin life anew.When she and her husband, Antonio, opened the restaurant on Willis Avenue it became a neighborhood sensation. Longtime neighbors and resident artists became regulars. Mayor Bill de Blasio stopped by. The five moles Ms. Mendez prepared for her customers soon earned glowing reviews from critics who praised the family’s ability to bring both Oaxacan food and its sense of selfless reciprocity to the neighborhood.But the critical need the restaurant filled — providing neighbors a safe, positive, community-oriented space — also underscored the dangers that surrounded it.The attention Yajaira’s arrest garnered has made the incident a rallying cry for neighbors who have experienced similar interactions with the police and feel their voice is rarely heard.On Friday residents arrived at the precinct to demand her release while others went to La Morada to comfort her family members, who were shocked by the way the officers treated Yajaira.“This is the kind of thing I would see in Mexico not here in the United States, a country that respect laws,” said Antonio Saavedra, Ms. Saavedra’s father. “Where is the law? I don’t see it here right now.”"
165,"The federal government said this week it had effectively closed a teeming tent city for migrant children on the Texas border, a facility that opponents of the Trump administration’s tough immigration policies had described as a juvenile prison.But plans are now underway in Florida to nearly double the capacity of a similar, unregulated detention center for migrant teenagers, federal officials confirmed this week.The government plans to expand the number of children housed at a “temporary shelter” in Homestead, Fla., from 1,350 to 2,350 in January, according to a Dec. 26 letter from the Department of Health and Human Services outlining the plan.A department spokeswoman confirmed the plans, but said that the facility still houses only 1,100 minors as of this week. “As you know the numbers are unpredictable,” Lydia Holt, the spokeswoman, said in an email. “Our job is to be prepared and have capacity when/if needed.”Like the tent city in Texas, the facility in Florida, adjacent to Homestead Air Reserve Base, is a “temporary” or “influx” shelter on federal land. Thus, it is not subject to state regulations and inspections intended to guarantee child welfare — only to a loose set of Health and Human Services guidelines.In contrast, permanent shelters traditionally used to detain minors must abide by state requirements for staff vetting and training, as well as standards that ensure minors are educated and safe.The number of children in federal custody has been shrinking rapidly since the Trump administration last month eased a strict security policy that had delayed — often by months — the placement of newly arrived children with sponsors, typically relatives already in the United States.The Trump administration had required that everyone in a potential sponsor’s household submit fingerprints to the F.B.I. for a background check, which many families, some of whom are undocumented, were unwilling to do. Coupled with a surge in unaccompanied teenagers arriving at the southwest border, mostly from Central America, the policy prompted a shortage — and a scramble — for shelter beds.To help handle the overflow, the government in June opened the camp at Tornillo, Tex., a collection of tents on a barren patch of desert about 35 miles southeast of El Paso. It quickly grew to house more than 2,800 migrant teenagers. The camp had the look and feel of a military barracks, with what critics described as inadequate health care and education services.Children had little access to legal services. Instead of several hours of schooling a day, as is offered at licensed shelters for migrant children around the country, children at Tornillo were offered workbooks which they were under no obligation to complete, migrant advocates said.The Office of Inspector General in November criticized the facility’s failure to conduct F.B.I. fingerprint background checks on staff, and also said it had too few staff members to provide sufficient mental health care.Eventually, the private nonprofit operating the sprawling desert site informed the government that it did not wish to extend its management contract, setting it up to close.“This tent city should never have stood in the first place, but it is welcome news that it will be gone,” Will Hurd, the Republican congressman who represents the southwest Texas border region, wrote on Twitter.The number of migrant children under detention reached record numbers last year, an increase due to both the large numbers of children crossing the border and the roadblocks imposed by the Trump administration to releasing them to family members.The crunch has eased with the elimination of the policy requiring fingerprints of all adults in any household in which a migrant child is placed. Fingerprints are now only required of the adult who is sponsoring the minor.As of Jan. 13, about 10,500 migrant minors were held in more than 100 shelters across the country overseen by Health and Human Services, down from about 14,700 in December. Despite the recent decline, the number of children in federal custody remains substantially higher than a year ago, when about 7,550 were staying in shelters.The news that federal officials plan a significant expansion at the Homestead facility is a clear signal, immigration legal analysts say, that the Trump administration is not changing its policy of holding migrant teenagers in detention, but is merely changing the location.Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon who led a congressional delegation to Tornillo last month and pressed for it to be shuttered, said that the expansion of Homestead shows that “the Trump administration has not changed its fundamental strategy of deliberately hurting kids as part of its ongoing strategy of deterrence.”“It’s a shell game of moving kids from one facility to another,” Mr. Merkley said in a telephone interview.The Homestead site, about 30 miles south of Miami, housed teenage migrants from June 2016 to April 2017, but closed after the number of children entering the country dwindled. It reopened in March 2018 amid the surge in arrivals and is now the country’s biggest detention site for unaccompanied minors.The facility’s “temporary” or “influx” shelter status suggests that children will be kept there only briefly. But the tent city at Tornillo was also intended to be a temporary home for a few hundred migrant children. Instead, its population multiplied and the stay of many children dragged on for months.The children at Homestead sleep in dorms with bunk beds, take classes inside a massive tent and eat meals at a dining hall. Some of the dorms are fashioned from former military barracks. As at other shelters, including state-licensed facilities, the children are not free to leave the site, which is fenced and guarded.“Homestead has the same maladies that Tornillo suffered from,” said Holly Cooper, a co-director of the immigration law clinic at the University of California at Davis.Ms. Cooper will visit Homestead next month with a team to assess whether it is in compliance with the terms of a 1997 consent decree, known as the Flores agreement, establishing guidelines for the treatment of minors in government custody. “We have received multiple complaints about the facility and will make the investigation of the conditions in Homestead a top priority for the coming months,” she said.The Miami-Dade County public school district has not been asked to provide teachers to work at the Homestead facility, even though the district staffed classrooms when the shelter previously opened under the Obama administration.The schools superintendent in Miami-Dade County, Alberto Carvalho, said that he raised a concern about the failure to provide certified teachers at Homestead in a letter last summer to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, but that she did not directly address his question. “It would appear to me that there is a continued inequity of the quality and standards of education provided to children in that shelter,” Mr. Carvalho said.Federal officials said the government was committed to providing excellent care for migrant youths at the facility, and said all staff members receive F.B.I. fingerprint background checks. “Even though Homestead is on federal property, we continue to maintain the high standards of care expected in our permanent shelters,” Ms. Holt, the H.H.S. spokeswoman, said in a statement."
166,"The deployment of active-duty United States troops at the border with Mexico will most likely be extended through September, the Pentagon said Monday.The Pentagon’s border mission had previously been scheduled to end on Dec. 15, and the Defense Department later extended the deployment into January. Then came Monday’s announcement.In a rare use of military force first announced in October, the Trump administration sent about 5,900 active-duty troops to join up with Border Patrol agents and National Guard members, as a caravan of Central American migrants made its way toward the United States.The move was viewed by many as unnecessary political fear-mongering as the midterm elections approached. Border and military officials insisted the caravan was a serious threat.On Monday, the Pentagon said that its “assistance” would continue through Sept. 30 at the Department of Homeland Security’s request, and that the support would focus on “mobile surveillance and detection” and placing concertina wire “between ports of entry.”It’s not clear exactly how many troops are currently at the border or how the number is expected to change — a Pentagon official said in November that the number was expected to dip below the 5,900 initially deployed. The Pentagon did not immediately answer further questions about Monday’s announcement.The extension comes as a new migrant caravan was forming in Honduras, and Mr. Trump and Congress’s differing visions on border security have led to the longest shutdown of the federal government in American history.Mr. Trump continues to push for a wall to stem what he calls a crisis at the border.But the reality is more complicated.Illegal border crossings have been declining for nearly two decades, and border-crossing apprehensions in 2017 were at their lowest level in more than 45 years.But a record number of families have tried to cross the border in recent months, and asylum claims have jumped as many migrant families say they fear returning to their home countries.The troops, who are prevented by the Posse Comitatus Act from engaging in law enforcement activities within the country, had been spread across small bases where they spent the initial weeks setting up concertina wire and other security barriers. Later, the troops were also giving rides to Border Patrol agents and conducting more training."
167,"WASHINGTON — Republican leaders are sharpening and poll-testing lines of attack that portray Democratic policies on health care, the environment and abortion as far outside the norm, in hopes of arming President Trump with hyperbolic sound bites — some of them false — asserting that Democrats would cause long waits for doctors or make killing babies after birth legal.The blunt messaging underscores one of the biggest challenges facing Democrats as they try to defeat the incumbent president: the need to define themselves and their ideas before Mr. Trump and his conservative allies do it for them.The Republican National Committee has already begun polling in 16 states to assess ways to discredit ideas like “Medicare for all,” which Senator Bernie Sanders proposed in a bill this week, and build on the party’s broader argument that Democratic candidates like Mr. Sanders are promoting an extreme socialist agenda. Social conservative leaders have met with White House officials to discuss calling attention to Democratic-sponsored legislation to loosen restrictions on abortion in the second and third trimesters, like one that passed recently in New York.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]The recent focus on health care and abortion follows well-coordinated attacks on policies like the Green New Deal, which reduced the far-reaching climate change proposal to a punch line with jokes about cow flatulence and putting farms out of business.Some Democratic strategists said they have been taken aback recently by how successful Mr. Trump and Republicans have been at setting the terms of the debate around liberal policy ideas. And they are encouraging their party to be more nimble and deliver a more concise and accessible message.In a fight with Mr. Trump, they say, nuance is not usually the Democrats’ best weapon.“What our side has to understand is that to fight Trump it’s a battle for definition,” said Celinda Lake, a top Democratic pollster who has been working with left-of-center groups on a strategy to counter the messaging campaign from the right.“The Democrats will issue a 61-page white paper that nobody in their right mind will pass on to their friends,” she added. “He uses a one-sentence slogan, and his voters feel emboldened to share it, pass it on.”Democrats say they expect an asymmetrical battle against an opponent who makes his own rules and possesses a singular ability to saturate the national conversation. This can cut both ways, especially on issues like immigration where his fitful threats to close the southern border may cast him as more of a crisis instigator than mitigator. In 2018, Mr. Trump’s alarmist warnings about the Central American migrant caravan and his exaggerated claims about immigrants and crime were divisive with many suburban voters and contributed to Democratic victories that helped the party win the House.Still, the president’s purge of the Homeland Security Department this week signals his belief that strict immigration enforcement is a winning issue for him. And while the wall he promised in 2016 remains unbuilt, he will continue to look for new ways to hold a hard line on border security.It is not clear whether any of the Republican messaging is having an impact on voters outside of the president’s so far unmovable base. But Ms. Lake said that as she surveyed likely 2020 swing voters, she was surprised to hear people in focus groups repeat false assertions made by the president and his allies — that Democrats would end air travel in the United States and shut down dairy farms and beef production because of greenhouse gas emissions from cows.“It’s amazing the number of people who would volunteer that,” she said. The actual language in the proposal calls for cleaner transportation and agriculture “as much as is technologically feasible.” The misperception about cows and airplanes originated with a now-retracted fact sheet published by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s office that contained an ironic aside about getting rid of “farting cows and airplanes.”Republicans said they also saw “Medicare for all”-type proposals as a way to give their rallying cries on socialism more substance and potency. Some plans, like the one put forward by Mr. Sanders, would largely eliminate private insurance plans, which Republicans have found is overwhelmingly unpopular with the kinds of voters they need to win back.[Who’s running for president in 2020? Keep up with who’s in and who’s out with our candidate tracker.]“The debate that’s going to play out in suburbs across the country is a choice between capitalism versus socialism,” said Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee. “When Democrats talk about abolishing private health insurance, for example, most of my friends are on private insurance plans through their jobs or their husbands’ jobs. They don’t want to lose that. They don’t want to wait in line to get to the pediatrician.”“Whichever Democrat wins the nomination will have to own their party’s socialist agenda,” she added. “That’s a debate that President Trump is eager to have and knows he can win.”The Republicans’ data on voters from the 2018 midterms showed that coverage of pre-existing medical conditions was the top issue of concern. But here they face a serious disadvantage: They have no health care plan of their own.But they have been testing messaging on health care with likely voters in the 16 states they believe will be the most competitive in 2020. These include ones Mr. Trump narrowly won like Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida, as well as those he won by larger margins but have tilted more Democratic lately, like Arizona and North Carolina. The R.N.C. found that when voters were told that “Medicare for all” would eliminate private insurance and create a government-run system paid for by higher taxes, independents, married women and union members disliked the idea by wide margins. Among married women alone, nearly 60 percent disapproved.Mr. Trump’s own approach at labeling Democrats has been inconsistent. He has yet to come up with the kind of indelible rhetorical device that he used repeatedly to brand his opponents in 2016. So far he has nothing like “Crooked Hillary,” “Little Marco’’ and “Low-energy Jeb,” which delighted many of his supporters two years ago.But he has occasionally made graphic and false claims that Democrats support legislation that would allow “executing babies AFTER birth,” as he said in a recent tweet. During a meeting at the White House before his State of the Union address that included some conservative activists, Mr. Trump expressed amazement at comments by the governor of Virginia, Ralph Northam, who had to clarify his defense of abortion in later stages of pregnancy after activists accused him of saying doctors should be able to kill a baby born alive during the procedure.“Can you believe this governor?’’ the president said, according to two people at the meeting, who said that he was surprisingly animated about the subject and vowed to keep mentioning it.The Centers for Disease Control says such late-term abortions are extremely rare. Only about 1.3 percent of abortions in the United States in 2015 were performed in or after the 21st week of pregnancy, the agency reported.But anti-abortion activists said the efforts in some states like New York and Virginia to remove certain barriers to second- and third-trimester abortions allowed them to present the issue to voters in a new and graphic light. Democrats have struggled to defend the new legislation; privately some say they are not being persuasive in explaining the health situations the bills address while the other side accuses them of condoning infanticide.While polls show that Americans support allowing abortion in the first three months by wide margins, that support drops sharply when people are asked in general about the second and third trimesters. (They overwhelmingly support exceptions if the mother’s life is endangered.)“We’re in a totally different environment,” said Mallory Quigley, vice president of communications for the Susan B. Anthony List, a group that opposes abortion rights and that plans to test messages on the issue with voters in the months ahead.Democrats say they cannot let Mr. Trump and other Republicans go unanswered as they try to link the party to socialism — a term that Americans view negatively over all — and to extremism in a broader sense. That has been the motivation behind Republicans’ intense focus on two young, freshman members of Congress: Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, the congresswoman from Queens who calls herself a democratic socialist; and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, whose criticism of Israel led the president and others to condemn her as an anti-Semite. Some of Ms. Omar’s most vocal defenders have been self-described democratic socialists.Even if Americans say they like policies that are derivative of socialism, like Social Security, the term “connotes very clear imagery to people in a very dog whistle kind of way,” said Jefrey Pollock, president of the Global Strategy group, which advises Democrats on messaging. “Then they attach faces to it,” he added, “and I think it can have resonance, and it has had resonance.”The effort on the right to elevate Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, as the most prominent socialist foil is something Democrats are watching, Mr. Pollock said. “She is, of course, six years away from being able to run for president. But they are still trying to make her the face of the party.”Conservatives have extended this line of attack beyond candidates like Mr. Sanders, who identifies as a democratic socialist. They are using it on other 2020 contenders like Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. Laura Ingraham, the Fox News host, last week accused Mr. Buttigieg’s father, who died recently, and who had taught at the University of Notre Dame, of being “a committed Marxist, who affectionately embraced the Communist Manifesto.” She cited a Washington Examiner report as evidence.Democrats’ own research has found this approach to be effective with the Republican base, which can be more aware of liberal policies like the Green New Deal than liberals are. When Global Strategy Group and GBA Strategies surveyed Fox News viewers last month, they found that Republicans who watch Fox are more than twice as likely as all other groups to have heard about the plan than Democrats.Their verdict? Seventy-seven percent of them are very concerned about the influence of socialism in the Democratic Party."
168,"In November, I became the first Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals beneficiary to win the Rhodes scholarship. The news was bittersweet.In 2017 the Trump administration rescinded the option for overseas travel for those with DACA status, the Dreamers who were brought to this country illegally as children. This means that when I leave the country in October to study at Oxford with my fellow Rhodes scholars, I may not be able to come back. This is a perpetual reality of being undocumented: I never know if I have a place in America — my home — even after receiving one of the most esteemed scholarships in the world.My family left South Korea during the Asian financial crisis in 1997. I remember being whisked away in the middle of the night when I was 7 and boarding a flight for what my parents said was “a magical place” called America. At the time, I was unaware of the economic forces that had compelled my parents to make the journey to a new country.We settled in a Korean enclave in Flushing, Queens. The language, people, smells and flavors reminded us of home, and that helped ease our transition into our new life. My mother found work in a beauty salon, providing manicures and facials. My father was hired as a line cook in a Korean restaurant, working 12-hour shifts six days a week. I started going to a school in a nearby Korean church. I slowly began adapting to my new life. I found comfort in learning how to speak English. Despite their demanding workload, my parents were resolute and nurturing. When my father learned that playing baseball was an American rite of passage, we’d go out to the sidewalk in front of our apartment complex to play. He didn’t know how to pitch, but he tried to teach me anyway. In 2012 I received DACA status, which allowed me to apply to Harvard. I graduated in December with a degree in biology and government. These days the conversation around immigration is centered on conspiracy theories and racially charged statements. I’m reminded daily that I don’t belong here, and find myself having to justify why I should be allowed to remain. I can argue that I am smart, driven and able to contribute to this country, just like my fellow undocumented immigrants. We pay taxes to help keep systems such as Medicare and Social Security solvent — systems that we may never directly benefit from. According to a  2017 study, 91 percent of Dreamers are employed and will contribute $460.3 billion to the gross domestic product over the next decade. Over 65 percent of us are pursuing a degree in higher education.And yet I resist citing my “intelligence” or “abilities” to defend my presence here, because a human being need not be a Rhodes scholar to be treated with basic fairness and decency. A human being shouldn’t have to be a “genius” or “economically productive” to have access to equal opportunity. We are your co-workers, your friends, your classmates and your fellow Americans — we work, learn and laugh alongside you. As I attempt to make sense of what it means to be an undocumented immigrant, I often retreat into the Pusey Archives at Harvard to pore through the personal library of John Rawls. Rawls, considered the most important philosopher in the 20th century, concentrated on one crucial question: How can a society establish just institutions when there are seemingly irreconcilable differences among its members? He argues that we must recognize first and foremost those who stand among us, who are members of the union, and who therefore must be treated fairly. I plan to use my time at Oxford to think about how undocumented immigrants can urge this country to recognize that we are American — we stand among you and we are embedded in this country, its practices and its institutions. I hope to start a dialogue about how we as Americans can collectively forge a common identity that respects human rights.When I step on that plane in October and leave the United States for the first time since I arrived 16 years ago, I will think of the bustling flea market on 41st Street and Union Avenue in Flushing, and of the smell of freshly made spicy tteokbokki rice cakes in Korean eateries along Northern Boulevard that I pass on my way to the 7 train. These are my roots. These are the sights and sounds that nurtured me as I became the person I am today. Walking through those streets has taken on a new meaning as I grapple with the knowledge that soon it may very well be the last time I do so. There’s a Korean adage that warns that, “What becomes far from the eyes becomes far from the heart.” Yet I have no doubt that these sights and sounds will carry me and remain with me wherever I go, because that’s the nature of home: It stays with you even if the country you call home won’t accept you."
169,"WASHINGTON — Immigrant advocates denounced it as cruel. The conservative right howled that it was amnesty.What President Trump billed on Saturday as a compromise to end the country’s longest government shutdown pleased neither the Democratic congressional leaders whose buy-in he needs to strike a deal nor the core supporters whose backing has always been at the heart of his insistence on a border wall.Instead, in offering temporary protections for about one million immigrants at risk of deportation in exchange for funding for a wall, Mr. Trump did something rarely seen during his presidency. He tried to reach beyond his base of supporters — which polls have begun to show is losing patience with him as the partial shutdown drags into its fifth week — and speak to a broader swath of Americans.The Saturday afternoon speech from the West Wing was an attempt by Mr. Trump to, at the very least, shift the narrative of the past several weeks and show that rather than spoiling for a longer shutdown fight or making unreasonable demands, he was looking for a broadly acceptable way out of a morass he once boasted he was proud to wade into.“I think you could tell by the president’s remarks today,” Vice President Mike Pence said, “that we’re reaching out.”Yet in seeking to inch toward the center, Mr. Trump alienated portions of his hard-right base, the core supporters he most depends on and the group he and his closest aides have most feared losing. That raised the possibility that, in his zeal to get out of an intractable situation, he may have landed himself in the worst of all worlds, without a clear solution or the support of his most ardent followers.[Read: Trump’s Deal Meets With Skepticism Among Immigrants in Texas]The tensions and anger over the policy have been quietly playing out in the West Wing as well, as Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, fended off Stephen Miller, the architect of much of Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda. Mr. Kushner has long been a proponent of protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, while Mr. Miller has pressed for aggressive measures to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration.In recent days, as White House officials had been working out the details of the compromise, Mr. Miller intervened to narrow the universe of immigrants who would receive protection, according to people familiar with the internal discussions who described them on the condition of anonymity.While the original idea had been to include protections for as many as 1.8 million undocumented immigrants eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program known as DACA that protected those illegally brought to the United States as children, Mr. Trump ultimately proposed shielding only the 700,000 who are enrolled.Mr. Kushner conceded in a briefing after the president’s speech that he did not see the proposal as a solution for the DACA program, which Mr. Trump moved to rescind in 2017.“At this moment in time,” Mr. Kushner said, “this is a good path forward.”Many conservatives did not share that view.“Trump proposes amnesty,” the conservative commentator Ann Coulter said on Twitter. “We voted for Trump and got Jeb!” she added, referring to Jeb Bush, who challenged Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016 and supported a broad immigration overhaul that would have given undocumented immigrants a path to legal status.Still, in the eyes of many White House officials, the prospect that Mr. Trump could use the proposal to shift blame for the shutdown and pressure Democrats to end the impasse was worth trying. Mr. Pence argued on Saturday that the speech was a “sincere effort” by Mr. Trump to break the logjam, and he and other White House officials suggested that the measure could attract enough support to succeed from centrist Democrats fed up with the shutdown and willing to side with Republicans.But such a coalition did not appear to be forming, and courting one bears considerable risk for a president who is most comfortable when he is defying convention, eschewing compromise and being hailed as a hero by supporters who often equate bipartisan deal making with weak-kneed capitulation.The vast majority of Democrats knocked the approach. While many of them have pressed for measures to protect DACA recipients and immigrants living in the United States under Temporary Protected Status enacted when their countries were destabilized by war or catastrophe, most regard the proposal he put forth on Saturday as woefully inadequate. It offers only three years of protections for the DACA recipients and those who hold T.P.S., which the Trump administration has also moved to end for several countries.“This is not an amnesty bill,” Mr. Pence said. “There is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal.”That was high on Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s list of reasons to call the plan “unacceptable.”That is unlikely to matter to the president. Despite saying publicly last month that he would be proud to own a shutdown over the wall, and privately displaying confidence that his base would stick with him through the fight, Mr. Trump has been dismayed to find otherwise in recent days.An NPR poll released last week showed Mr. Trump’s approval ratings down and the first cracks in backing among critical supporters, including whites without a college education and white evangelicals.Such pressure from what he has called the forgotten men and women who elected him and chant “Build! The! Wall!” at his arena rallies has swayed Mr. Trump before, including last year, when the conservative news site Breitbart branded him “Amnesty Don” for considering a similar deal that would have provided $25 billion in wall funding for a path to legal status for those the DACA program was created to help. The president ultimately abandoned that agreement, concerned about angering his base and after Mr. Miller and others advised him he should insist on additional immigration restrictions.On Saturday night, Breitbart panned Mr. Trump’s latest idea with the headline “Three-Year Amnesty, Most of Border Remains Open.”"
170,"TIJUANA — Life in Tijuana’s largest migrant shelter has begun to take on the familiar rhythms and sounds of a Central American neighborhood: Early in the morning, adults rise and get ready to go to work. Children dress for school. Mothers gather huge bundles of dirty clothes for the day’s wash. Vendors hawk coffee.“We are getting used to this life,” said Norma Pérez, 40, who left Honduras in a migrant caravan bound for the United States about two months ago with her 5-year-old son.For weeks, they walked from Central America up to the Mexican border with the United States, fleeing poverty and violence. All along the way, President Trump described the migrants as a danger, as invaders trying to crash their way into the United States. But they didn’t stop their trek north.When they arrived at the border, Tijuana was not ready for them. The conditions were deplorable, and the migrants were surprised they would not be able to apply for asylum right away. Twice, groups of migrants approached the border fence and were repelled by border patrol agents using tear gas and pepper spray.But now, life for many of the new arrivals has settled down.Mexico’s new president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has begun to make good on promises to create alternatives to immigration, and he has already rolled out a plan to increase wages along the United States-Mexico border.And the migrants themselves have begun to create a sense of community in the shelters here, like the city’s largest, known as El Barretal. They said they have no intention of turning back.Mr. Trump “should personally go to Honduras so he can see with his own eyes that we simply can’t go back, that there are no jobs, no companies, nothing,” Ms. Pérez said.So she is settling in at El Barretal, a concert venue turned into a shelter where tents are lined up in orderly rows on the clean concrete floor. For the thousands of migrants like her in El Barretal and 18 other Tijuana shelters, this is home — for now.As she waits for her chance to apply for asylum in the United States, Ms. Pérez has decided to apply for a temporary humanitarian visa in Mexico. That will let her find a job in Tijuana and support herself and her child for as long as necessary, she said.Rodolfo Figueroa, an official with the National Immigration Institute, a government agency, said most of the migrants who arrived in Tijuana with the caravan and who applied for humanitarian visas have been approved. In total, 2,200 visas have been awarded in little over a month, he said. About 1,300 migrants have either been deported or voluntarily returned to their home countries, he added.Early on a typical morning in the El Barretal shelter, migrants who already hold a temporary Mexican visa head to work at a nearby market as meat and poultry vendors. Others make their way to jobs as truck drivers, construction workers or laborers in the city’s electronics manufacturing plants.The shelter’s manager, Leonardo Nery, said the number of people living there had dropped from 3,000 a month ago to around 1,000 as some migrants found their own living arrangements in town. Others have crossed over to the United States or returned home, he said.Around 10 a.m., loudspeakers inside El Barretal announced that buses sent by the Mexican federal government had arrived to take anyone interested in Mexican humanitarian visas to an immigration office. The same voice reminded migrants to gather any trash and place it in the available cans.Around noon on most days, English classes start inside a small white tent with bright blue carpets covering the concrete floor. Puzzle pieces are spread on tables, along with drawings and crayons. Posters with names of colors hang on the walls.Darwin Bardales, an 18-year-old Honduran, has been working as a volunteer in the shelter’s English school.“It feels good to do something for the others, especially the kids,” he said. “After all, we are all in the same vulnerable situation.”The children usually take classes in English and Spanish, learning to read, to color and to eat healthy foods. This Friday, the classes got a late start: The arrival of donated teddy bears and piñatas had the children’s full attention until a female voice boomed from the loudspeaker.“Hello everybody, it’s your teacher!” the voice said. “It’s time for class, kids!”Adult migrants scattered around the camp cheered in response.Food is cooked and distributed both by private aid groups and by Mexican marines twice a day — rice, soup and sandwiches. It is a bare-bones existence, but friendships have developed and at least one wedding took place in a downtown shelter.Early on Friday, José Daniel Castro, 44, was already busy managing what has become the shelter’s corner shop, where he sells cigarettes, potato candy, soup and other basics around the clock.Mr. Castro left Honduras in mid-October. Now he buys supplies in Tijuana every morning, and he earns about $20 a day reselling them — enough to buy his own food, he said. Having been deported from the United States three times, he plans to stay in Mexico indefinitely, working as a vendor, he said.“I can work here and make a little money,” he said. “That is already more than I can say about back home. In the end, all we wanted was to work and help our loved ones back home.”Taracio Pérez stood nearby holding bottles of soda, hoping for customers.“We are fighting, and hustling,” said Mr. Pérez, who also scrubs floors in a downtown Tijuana restaurant. “The dream was and is the United States. But it has all become so difficult and dangerous for us that the best thing to do is work while we wait for things to get better.”Their first few days in Tijuana last November were chaotic, and a bitter disappointment, migrants said. The Trump administration had limited the number of asylum applicants that could be seen in a day, separated parents from their children, sent troops to patrol the frontier — and even, starting last month, shut down the federal government in a bid to get funding for a border wall.Housed initially in an open-air sports complex, the migrants saw a torrential downpour turn the ground to mud around their makeshift tents. Children started to get sick and adults grew dispirited.But to many, those hardships felt temporary — and less threatening than the conditions they had left at home. And life at El Barretal is a definite step up from those first, soaking days.Elisabeth Ponce, 38, was putting the last touches on her makeup before she started her day’s work. She came from Honduras and now has a job inside the shelter, handing out toiletries, medicine and other basic supplies.She fled Honduras, like so many others, fearing for her life after being threatened by criminal gangs. Joining the caravan was a drastic decision: It meant leaving behind her four children and venturing outside her country for the first time, knowing she had no one to help her if she ever got to the United States.Now she knows she may never get the asylum she is applying for, and that crossing illegally is dangerous. But she remains resolute.“I am going to try, regardless,” she said."
171,"OAKLAND, Calif. — Nearly nine months after the Trump administration officially rescinded its policy of separating migrant families who have illegally crossed the border, more than 200 migrant children have been taken from parents and other relatives and placed in institutional care, with some spending months in shelters and foster homes thousands of miles away from their parents.The latest data reported to the federal judge monitoring one of the most controversial of President Trump’s immigration policies shows that 245 children have been removed from their families since the court ordered the government to halt routine separations under last spring’s “zero tolerance” border enforcement policy. Some of the new separations are being undertaken with no clear documentation to help track the children’s whereabouts.Images of crying mothers and children at the border last year prompted an intense backlash across party lines, with all four living former first ladies and Melania Trump expressing horror at the policy. But despite President Trump’s June 20 executive order rescinding it, the practice was never completely suspended.Under the original policy, most children were removed because parents who illegally crossed the border were subject to criminal prosecution. The recent separations have occurred largely because parents have been flagged for fraud, a communicable disease or past criminal history — in some cases relatively minor violations, years in the past, that ordinarily would not lead to the loss of parental custody.[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]The new separations are taking place amid an unprecedented influx of migrant families from across the southern border that has highlighted the failure of the Trump administration’s hard-line policies to deter them. The Border Patrol detained 76,103 migrants in February, an 11-year high for that month. Among those intercepted were about 40,000 members of families, two-thirds more than in January.In Congress last week, Democrats grilled Kirstjen Nielsen, the Homeland Security secretary, over the separation policy, citing research that has found that separations from parents can inflict long-term psychological harm on children.Family separations also sometimes occurred under the Obama administration, but only rarely and in extreme cases in which a child’s safety appeared to be at risk.Customs and Border Protection officials say the separations are legal under the parameters set by the court and are intended to protect children, who they say may be threatened by human trafficking or by adults pretending to be a parent to capitalize on the advantage that gives them under American immigration laws.“C.B.P. does not declare that a parent poses danger to a child arbitrarily or without merit,” the agency said in a statement. It said agents “will maintain family unity to the greatest extent operationally feasible,” separating children only in the presence of “a legal requirement” set out in written policy or “an articulable safety or security concern that requires separation.”But opposition to the new separations has been growing from both outside and inside the federal government. At the Health and Human Services Department’s Office of Refugee Resettlement, which oversees the care of separated children until they can be reunited with their families, some officials have tried to resist receiving children referred to the agency by the Border Patrol.According to an official who was not authorized to discuss government business and spoke on the condition of anonymity, staff members have in some cases raised questions with Border Patrol agents about separations with what appear to be little or no justification. In some of those cases, border agents have refused to provide additional information, the official said, or if additional documents were provided, they were sometimes redacted to the point of illegibility.The official, along with another staff member at the Department of Homeland Security, the Border Patrol’s parent agency, said that some separations were occurring with no formal notification to the refugee resettlement office. Both officials said they had been made aware of concerns about an apparent inconsistency in standards applied by border agents when determining whether a family should be separated.The failure to keep accurate records suggests that more children could have been separated than the 245 accounted for by Feb. 20 in official records.The New York Times reviewed several cases of children who have been separated since the policy was officially ended, and learned of many others through the lawyers who handled them. Some of the new separations, the review showed, occurred in families with a parent who had a drunken-driving conviction in the past, or a 20-year-old nonviolent robbery conviction. In one case, a parent had been convicted of possession of a small amount of marijuana.Donna Abbott, vice president for refugee and immigrant services at Bethany Christian Services, a contractor that accommodates migrant children in temporary foster homes until they can be reunited with family members, said most cases of family separations do not list detailed reasons, making it difficult to evaluate whether they were appropriate.For example, some files state only that the parent was suspected of having gang affiliations or a criminal history, without additional information. “Is it trespassing or is it murder?” Ms. Abbott said.In December, a mother traveling from El Salvador with her three children was arrested and put on a bus to an immigration detention facility in Arizona while her children, ages 5, 8 and 15, were sent to foster care in New York.The woman, Deisy Ramirez, 38, said it was nearly six weeks before she talked to her children.They were “devastated,” said Ms. Ramirez’s sister, Silvia Ramirez, who was trying to persuade the government to allow her to take the children to live with her in Seattle while her sister was in custody. “They couldn’t understand why they were separated,” she said.On March 1, Ms. Ramirez’s eldest daughter was transferred to a hospital after threatening to take her own life, Silvia Ramirez said, and she remained there even after her mother’s release from detention last week.“I never imagined this could happen,” Deisy Ramirez said on Friday, her voice breaking. “All I want is to hold my children and to be with them.”Her lawyer, Ricardo de Anda, said he had received no response to his formal request for a reason for the separation. He suspects it may be connected to the fact that Ms. Ramirez had been deported from the United States more than a decade ago. He sent government lawyers a series of emails, ultimately securing her release.On Saturday, the day after her release from the Arizona detention facility, Ms. Ramirez was preparing to fly to New York to reunite with her children.Border agents removed 3-year-old Ashley Ramos from her father after they were detained last month in Arizona. He was swiftly deported to Guatemala and the girl was sent to a shelter.The child’s mother, Silvia Maribel Ramos, who had been separated from the pair during their journey from Guatemala when Mexican police pulled her and other migrants off their bus for questioning, arrived in Arizona a few days later, only to learn from authorities that her child was gone.“They told me they had no idea where she was, that I would find out after being released,” said Ms. Ramos, who is staying with relatives in Oakland, Calif.The child was located nearly two weeks later, she said, after her husband contacted Guatemalan authorities back home. Now Ms. Ramos is struggling with the paperwork required to recover Ashley. “My daughter can’t understand. She just weeps and begs to be with us,” she said.In late January, Victor Antonio Marin was separated from his 4-year-old son, whose mother is deceased, after they were detained near Calexico, Calif. According to his lawyer, Bob Boyce, Mr. Marin had a 20-year-old nonviolent robbery conviction in the United States that did not involve the use of a weapon. He served time and was deported back to El Salvador.Now Mr. Marin remains locked up in an immigration detention center while his child is in a shelter in Texas.Ruben Garcia, who runs a network of migrant shelters in El Paso, said that immigration authorities this month dropped off a distraught 18-year-old woman from Guatemala.The woman said she had given birth less than a week earlier and had been separated from her baby. Child welfare authorities had come to the hospital to take the child, who was a United States citizen; immigration agents took the mother back to a detention cell where she waited for several days. The baby’s first two weeks were spent away from the mother, who finally regained custody after interventions from multiple legal-aid groups, Mr. Garcia said.Since Mr. Trump ended the family separations under “zero tolerance” on June 20, about 2,700 children have been reunited with their parents. Still, thousands more children who were separated before the policy officially went into effect have not been accounted for, according to the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. The investigators cited the lack of an efficient tracking system.The American Civil Liberties Union requested that the government locate the families, and on Friday, Judge Dana M. Sabraw ruled that they should be included in the pending litigation over protecting and reuniting separated families.“The hallmark of a civilized society is measured by how it treats its people and those within its borders,” the judge wrote in his opinion.Some families affected by the earlier zero-tolerance separations continue to face repercussions.A 9-year-old Guatemalan boy named Byron Xol has been shuffled among four shelters since he was dragged away from his father at the border nine months ago, while the policy was still in place.After his father was deported to Guatemala, the boy’s parents decided that the child should remain in the United States for safety reasons. With the help of a lawyer, they designated an American family in Buda, Tex., to care for him.But authorities have refused to allow Byron to join the family, citing an anti-trafficking policy that bars a child from being released to a nonrelative sponsor unless the sponsor has a verifiable relationship with the child going back at least a year.Detentions and deportation proceedings have also resulted in family separations far from the border.Christy Swatzell, an immigration lawyer in Memphis, said that two of her clients who crossed the border without authorization and were released to await the outcome of their cases were told by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to leave their children at home ahead of their monthly check-in with the agency. When they showed up at the I.C.E. office, they were detained and transferred to an immigration facility in Louisiana.One of the clients, Francisca Yanes, 33, is the mother of a 6-year-old girl who is physically disabled. “I was in tears, telling them about my daughter. But it didn’t matter,” said Ms. Yanes, whose child, Paola, remained in the care of family members for the entire 45 days she was in detention.The Guatemalan migrant was released on a $7,500 bond set by the court after her lawyer filed a motion on her behalf. “What we are seeing is that families are being effectively separated,” said Ms. Swatzell. “Just not at the border anymore.”"
172,"WASHINGTON — President Trump warned on Wednesday that he reserved the option of declaring a national emergency to build his border wall without congressional approval.The president, speaking a day after his address to the nation that even some supporters conceded was unlikely to increase public support, headed to a luncheon meeting on Capitol Hill where he faced the urgent task of persuading wavering Senate Republicans that he could still come to an accord with Democrats on border security and end the partial shutdown of the federal government.Asked whether he was still considering declaring a national emergency, an extraordinary measure rarely used by presidents absent an urgent security threat, Mr. Trump said: “I think we might work a deal, and if we don’t, I may go that route. I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want.”[Read about whether Mr. Trump can use his emergency powers to build a wall.]Mr. Trump was scheduled to meet later Wednesday afternoon with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders at the White House in an effort to break the deadlock. So far, Democrats have held firm to the position that the president must agree to reopen the government before they will engage on the larger issue of border security legislation and his proposed wall.The president insisted that he maintained “tremendous” Republican support, even as nearly a half-dozen Republican senators have said directly or strongly suggested that they wanted to reopen the government, then have the debate about the wall.“I think we have tremendous Republican support,” Mr. Trump said. “The Senate has been incredible. Mitch McConnell has been incredible,” he said, referring to the Senate majority leader.The president, who has refused to sign any bill to fund the government that does not include $5.7 billion for the wall, also said some Democrats were moving to his point of view, although he did not offer any names.“The fact is that there is tremendous support,” he said.“If I did something that was foolish, like gave up on border security, the first ones that would hit me would be my senators — they’d be angry at me,” he said. “The second ones would be the House. And the third ones would be frankly my base and a lot of Republicans out there and a lot of Democrats that want to see border security.”Mr. Trump is scheduled to travel to southern Texas on Wednesday to dramatize his call for a wall. The Democratic members of Congress in that area of Texas, and several of the Republicans there, have said a wall along the entire Texas border is not necessary.“This is not a fight I wanted,” Mr. Trump said. “I didn’t want this fight.”"
173,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]New York City will spend at least $100 million to ensure that undocumented immigrants and others who cannot qualify for insurance can receive medical treatment, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Tuesday, seeking to insert a city policy into two contentious national debates.The mayor has styled himself, in his 2017 re-election campaign and during his second term, as a progressive leader on issues like education and health care, and as a bulwark against the policies of President Trump, particularly on immigration.In making the announcement, first on national television, Mr. de Blasio appeared to be trying to heighten that contrast and thrust his efforts on behalf of undocumented New Yorkers into the national debate over immigration, hours before Mr. Trump was to go on television Tuesday night to make his case for a border wall.“Everyone is guaranteed the right to health care, everyone,” Mr. de Blasio said during a news conference at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. “We are saying the word guarantee because we can make it happen.”New York City already provides health care to the uninsured and the undocumented through its hospital system, a roughly $8 billion behemoth whose history of service to the poor, regardless of an ability to pay, can be traced to the founding of Bellevue Hospital in the 18th century. A person without medical insurance has long been able to go to a city emergency room and get care, free of charge, or to seek a primary-care physician.But the financially challenged system did not work well to connect patients to doctors, Mr. de Blasio said. He promised a streamlined approach — complete with a hotline and dedicated membership card — and one that would be focused on the primary-care doctor, rather than the emergency room.“We were only covering them in the sense that they could go to the emergency room,” the mayor said. “It was not a way to live.”The announcement came as proponents of universal health care coverage have increasingly looked to local governments, rather than Congress, to make meaningful progress in the short term. Also on Tuesday, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington said he would seek to create a public option in the state.A day before, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, on his first day in office, announced his plan to move toward a single-payer system for that state. As mayor of San Francisco, Mr. Newsom oversaw the creation of a health care system in that city in 2007.The top health official who created the San Francisco program, Mitchell H. Katz, is now the head of New York City’s hospital system and will oversee the city’s effort, branded as NYC Care. “It’s a much bigger and more compassionate vision,” said Mr. Katz, comparing New York’s proposed program to the much smaller one in San Francisco.The mayor was quick to say that the plan would not be a substitute for any universal health care at the state level or a national single-payer plan. But, aides said, it was something the city could do immediately and on its own, without approval from the State Legislature, which is weighing some form of universal health insurance for New York State.Indeed, the mayor’s proposal is a mix of insurance and direct spending, and Mr. de Blasio said it would take about two years to get it fully running. The city already has a kind of public option for health insurance for low-income New Yorkers, through an insurance plan run by city hospitals known as MetroPlus.The new proposal would improve that coverage, which already insures some 516,000 people, and aim to reach more of those who are eligible, such as the young and uninsured, and others who qualify but have not applied.It would also provide additional direct city spending, at least $100 million per year when fully implemented, officials said, for the city’s hospital system to support care for those without insurance. The city estimates the uninsured population to be about 600,000 people, including as many as 300,000 undocumented residents. A major component of that effort would be improving customer service, including the phone line, to help those with questions about their care.Part of the goal of NYC Care, aides to the mayor said, was to direct people to medical care earlier — before they seek more expensive services in an emergency room — while providing them with better health care.The effort is also aimed at getting some of the so-called young-and-invincible uninsured population into the health care system, either through the city’s insurance plan or through its hospital system.“It appears that the mayor is ramping up outreach so that more people can avail themselves of services, regardless of ability to pay, that have been made available to them by Health and Hospitals for decades,” said Andrew Rein, the president of the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission. “The details are critical,” he added. “We still need to learn more.”The $100 million would go to both establishing the customer service component and hiring additional doctors and nurses, but officials could not provide a breakdown of how much would be spent on each. Indeed, details of how those seeking care could do so under the new plan were not immediately clear, nor was an exact start date.Mr. Katz said that the rollout would begin in the Bronx and that the city would start enrolling people in the NYC Care program this summer. The borough was chosen because the health care needs were greatest, he said.Such endeavors can be difficult for the city to implement quickly. Mr. de Blasio oversaw the creation of a municipal identification card for undocumented immigrants in his first term. But last week, he said that an ambitious goal of providing MetroCards to about 800,000 residents whose incomes are below the federal poverty line would fall far short of that goal initially, starting this month with cards for only about 30,000 people, or about 4 percent of the total.Mr. de Blasio said that the NYC Care system will also employ what amounted to a membership card in the city program. “They will have a card that will empower them to go to that doctor whenever they need,” he said.The city’s hospital system has been under severe financial strain and running deficits for years. The current financial plan for city hospitals anticipates budget shortfalls of more than $156 million in 2018, increasing to $1.8 billion in 2022, according to the city’s Independent Budget Office.Melanie Hartzog, the city’s budget director, took issue with those figures during the news conference. She said that the hospital system — which has received significant infusions of city money during the de Blasio administration — was now in “a very cash-strong position.” She said more details would be provided during a forthcoming budget briefing.Advocates for immigrants and health care analysts were encouraged by the plan, even if many were still looking to Albany, where debate over health care is likely to consume the coming months.“We hope it is a step toward making larger changes at the state level,” said Rebecca Telzak, director of health programs at Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy group supportive of the mayor’s plan. “Ending here is not enough.”"
174,"LOS ANGELES — Creating yet another roadblock to the Trump administration’s efforts to deport ineligible migrants, a federal appeals court ruled on Thursday that immigration authorities can no longer swiftly deport asylum seekers who fail an initial screening, opening the door for thousands of migrants a year to get another shot in the federal courts to win asylum in the United States.The ruling broadens constitutional protections for undocumented immigrants at the border and opens a new legal gateway for some of them to appeal for permission to stay in the country, even when an asylum officer and an immigration judge have made a determination that they do not have a credible fear of persecution in their homeland.“The historical and practical importance of this ruling cannot be overstated,” said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, who argued the appeal on behalf of a Sri Lankan migrant who had been turned away at California’s border with Mexico in 2017. He said the ruling “reaffirms the Constitution’s foundational principle that individuals deprived of their liberty must have access to a federal court.”After dropping precipitously over five decades, the number of migrants intercepted at the southern border — the key indicator of how many undocumented people are entering the United States — is soaring again, driven by an influx of families from Central America fleeing violence and poverty. Immigration authorities received more than 99,000 requests for asylum interviews during the 2018 fiscal year, including more than 54,000 submitted at the southwest border.[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]President Trump has said that migrants are exploiting the asylum system by making baseless and fraudulent claims in order to remain in the United States, and his administration has taken a number of steps to make the process harder, including narrowing the grounds for winning asylum, limiting the number of asylum seekers who can be processed at the border each day and requiring some applicants to wait in Mexico while their cases make their way through the courts.In 2016, the most recent year for which data is available, an estimated 7,200 migrants were denied permission to apply for asylum after their initial interviews and were placed in expedited deportation proceedings. An analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University found that in June 2018, only 15 percent of initial asylum reviews found that the asylum seeker had a credible fear of persecution, about half the proportion that had prevailed a year earlier.Thursday’s court decision will most likely send that trend in the other direction, legal analysts said.“This is a historic decision,” said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration scholar at Cornell Law School. “But the government will surely appeal this to the Supreme Court.”The opinion, from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, extends constitutional habeas corpus guarantees to those applying for asylum at the border and provides that they can seek a hearing in the federal courts before being summarily deported — though the court did not specify what standards the courts must use to evaluate such petitions.The ruling applies to asylum seekers in the nine western states included in the court’s jurisdiction and, because it conflicts with an earlier ruling rejecting such legal protections in the Third Circuit, the issue is likely to be resolved ultimately by the Supreme Court. In the meantime, legal analysts said, the court’s decision is likely to have sweeping implications for immigration deterrence efforts by enabling thousands to remain in the country while they seek the court review.Under current procedure, every migrant who arrives at the border and expresses a fear of persecution in his or her homeland is referred for an interview with an asylum officer. Those who succeed in convincing the officer that they have a credible fear are allowed to enter the country and proceed with their asylum cases in the immigration courts. Those who don’t can request a review by an immigration judge, but it is usually cursory and favorable decisions are rare. There is usually no access to a lawyer, and no opportunity to challenge the decision; deportation quickly ensues.In the case before the appeals court, Vijayakumar Thuraissigiam, a member of Sri Lanka’s Tamil ethnic minority, was arrested about 25 yards north of the border near San Ysidro, Calif., and told an asylum officer that he was fearful of returning to his homeland. The officer found no credible fear, and that finding was upheld by a supervisor and an immigration judge.Mr. Thuraissigiam was in deportation proceedings when he filed a habeas corpus petition in the federal court. He argued that the asylum officer had failed to elicit important background about his case, including that he had been detained and beaten by Sri Lankan army officers on two occasions, and at one point had been lowered into a well and nearly drowned. He also said there were communication problems between the translator and both the asylum officer and the immigration judge.As a result, his lawyers argued, he was deprived of “a meaningful right to apply for asylum.”A district court judge in Los Angeles rejected that argument, but the three-judge appeals court panel, sitting in San Francisco, held that even though an asylum seeker may lack the right to a full trial in immigration court, the Constitution requires a more complete review than what immigration law currently provides.At its “historical core,” said the 48-page opinion written by Judge A. Wallace Tashima, “the writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of reviewing the legality of executive detention, and it is in that context that its protections have been strongest.”"
175,"WASHINGTON — President Trump raised the possibility on Friday of declaring a national emergency to allow him to build a wall along the southwest border without congressional approval, hours after Department of Homeland Security officials requested additional support to erect temporary barriers between the United States and Mexico.Mr. Trump’s comments followed a contentious meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House. It failed to produce a deal to end the two-week partial shutdown of the federal government, a funding lapse that began with the president’s insistence that Congress allocate $5.6 billion for the wall.“We can call a national emergency and build it very quickly,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden when asked about an emergency declaration.Asked if his claim was intended to scare Democrats into making a deal, he replied, “I never make threats.”[President Trump took the public stage this week clearly intent on framing the conflict on his own terms.]Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, presidents are allowed to take unilateral action in times of crisis, provided they notify Congress, specify the circumstances that necessitated the declaration and document all uses of executive authority that are covered by the emergency.Officials at the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense Departments have researched the issue for Mr. Trump. However, no emergency order has been drafted or approved, one official with knowledge of those plans said.The Homeland Security Department submitted an official request for assistance from the Pentagon on Friday, a Defense Department official said. But the military has yet to determine what resources are needed and if any additional troops are required for the mission, the official said.The moves come as the president finds himself trapped between a central campaign promise to build a wall and rising anxiety among Republicans over political damage inflicted by a shutdown that Mr. Trump has defiantly owned.Speaker Nancy Pelosi has ruled out paying for a border wall, even at a much lower funding level, despite suggestions by Mr. Trump that the government shutdown could last “months or even years.”Administration officials have been scrambling to tackle the legal and logistical problems involved with steering previously allocated funding toward any project that can be described as a wall, a fence or a barrier.The definition of a wall has grown ever more elastic.The White House and homeland security officials have been pushing the Pentagon to continue to use military troops at the border — mainly to install, extend and repair a section of concertina wire used to stop immigrants from entering unmanned sections of the southwest border.Mr. Trump tweeted last month that “the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall” — a reference to several hundred miles of fencing along the border.The temporary troop deployments are just one of many recommendations that the homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, and her staff have made to the Pentagon.One possible solution, in the absence of new congressional allocations, is figuring out a way to steer contracts already planned for Army Corps of Engineers projects toward some kind of barriers. But lawyers at the Homeland Security and Justice Departments have yet to determine if doing so could withstand court challenges, two senior administration officials said.Mr. Trump spent the holidays at the White House to demonstrate his determination to secure new border funding. Yet he has struggled to dramatize his cause, as stories of federal employees and other Americans suffering from the effects of the shutdown pile up.On Thursday, homeland security officials abruptly canceled a scheduled press briefing by Kevin K. McAleenan, the commissioner of United States Customs and Border Protection, when Mr. Trump decided that he wanted to appear in front of the cameras himself. He did so, in the White House briefing room, with Border Patrol and other immigration enforcement employees who had been meeting with him in the Oval Office.“It was completely off the cuff,” Art Del Cueto, a Border Patrol agent in the room with Mr. Trump, said shortly after leaving the White House. “I don’t know who in the room — it may have been him — that was like, ‘We should go out there and do a presser.’ So we did.”Mr. Del Cueto and other members of the Border Patrol’s labor union have met with Mr. Trump several times in his presidency — so frequently, they said, that they could not remember the number of times they had been to the Oval Office.Separately, on Friday, Mr. Trump in a tweet denied as “FAKE NEWS” a New York Times article reporting that he was considering nominating former Senator Jim Webb, Democrat of Virginia, as his next defense secretary. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned last month to protest Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from Syria."
176,"President Trump has tried to halt the arrival of undocumented migrants by beefing up border security, limiting who qualifies for asylum and, for a while, separating migrant children from their parents at the border. However, figures released on Tuesday suggest that those measures are failing to deter tens of thousands of migrants from journeying over land to the United States.Indeed, after shriveling to the smallest total in five decades, the number of migrants intercepted at the southern border — the best indicator of how many undocumented people are entering the United States — is soaring again.Border authorities detained nearly twice as many migrants — 268,044 — in the first five months of the fiscal year that started in October than were detained in the same period the previous year.To understand what’s happening, it’s important to look at who is coming, what is driving them and how the answers to those questions have changed over the years. [Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]In the past, undocumented immigrants were overwhelmingly single men from Mexico who slipped into the country undetected to find work and send money home. But immigration from Mexico has plummeted in recent years. In fact, more Mexicans are leaving than arriving in the United States. Mexicans are less compelled to come because there are more opportunities in their own country and they have smaller families to support.Central American families have become the new face of undocumented immigration.In the first five months of the fiscal year that began in October, the Border Patrol detained 136,150 people traveling in families with children, compared with 107,212 during all of fiscal 2018.A trend toward family migration from Central America that began when Barack Obama was president has endured, after temporarily dipping during Mr. Trump’s first year in office. [More than 76,000 migrants cross in a month. Read about the “breaking points.”]Many Central Americans live in fear. El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have among the world’s highest homicide rates. Arriving migrants report that they have faced extortion, and want to prevent their children from being recruited by street gangs.But murder rates in the Northern Triangle countries have been declining in recent years, and economic imperatives are believed to be the most important push factor for the majority of recent arrivals. More than 90 percent of the most recent migrants are from Guatemala, according to the newly released data. The majority hail from impoverished regions, including the Western highlands, where conflicts over land rights, environmental changes and depressed prices for crops like maize and coffee are undermining the ability of farmers to make a living.[Read about the treatment of detainees with medical conditions.]Migrants generally lack understanding of United States immigration law. But they appear to be informed about the basics.The majority know to request asylum at the border, either at an official port of entry or when they surrender to border agents shortly after sneaking into the country from Mexico.They know that they are unlikely to remain detained if they travel with a child and that they have a better shot at fending off deportation when they come with a child.By law, the government cannot keep migrant families in holding facilities at the border for more than 72 hours. It must either transfer them to an immigration detention facility suitable for children or release them. The government has been letting thousands of detained migrants go free each week because it lacks enough beds to hold them in family detention facilities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s three residential family centers — two in southern Texas and one in Pennsylvania — can accommodate 3,326 parents and children.The largest share of migrants arrive in Texas, but there appears to be a growing number who are entering through remote areas of Arizona and New Mexico.In the spring of 2018, the Trump administration tried to discourage parents from traveling with a child by prosecuting everyone who crossed the border illegally, even those who were traveling with children — a policy known as zero tolerance. This resulted in children being removed from their parents and placed in shelters across the country.The policy drew widespread condemnation, prompting the president to halt the practice in late June. But Customs and Border Protection officials believe that the various legal rulings preventing families from being detained have helped solidify the message to smugglers, who roam villages offering to guide people to the United States, that adults who come with a child are protected from deportation.Whether they sneak into the country in remote areas or enter the country through a port of entry, most migrants are trying to petition for asylum.In 2008, just under 5,000 applicants claimed they had a credible fear of persecution, the first legal step toward obtaining asylum, to avoid being returned to their homeland. Last year, nearly 100,000 claimed a credible fear.The Trump administration contends that people are flooding the asylum system with invalid claims. In recent years, immigration judges have granted less than 20 percent of asylum requests, a proportion that is even lower for Central Americans.Many asylum seekers from Central America claim they have been victims of gangs, which is harder to prove than political and other types of persecution. Poverty is not among the grounds for receiving asylum.If they are denied, asylum seekers can be deported. But since many are released while their case is pending, some never return to court and evade deportation. "
177,"MCALLEN, Tex. — She trembled as she sat on the witness stand. She kept her head down and avoided looking at the man at the defense table only a few feet away.In the blue-carpeted courtroom in the Texas border city of McAllen, she was identified only by her initials, M.M.U.T. She had come from Honduras, she told the court, and the smugglers who helped her cross the border had placed her with about a dozen other migrants at a stash house near McAllen. The man in charge was known as El Gordo — the Fat One.When one of the migrant women escaped one morning, El Gordo forced M.M.U.T. to go with him in his truck to search for her, she testified. He drove her to an unoccupied trailer some distance away.“He raped me,” she said.It was a small, nearly whispered moment one day in 2017 in one of the busiest federal courthouses on the southwest border. It was also a #MeToo moment for a category of women whose long history of sexual assault has gone largely unpunished for decades. Undocumented women rarely get the chance to face their accused rapists in court. Attacks are most often never reported, and if they are, the perpetrators are often never found.[Read: The Hidden Nightmare of Sexual Violence on the Border]This case was different. The woman had agreed to testify, and the man she said attacked her was in custody, facing sentencing on a different charge: Adan Hernandez-Nunez sat facing his accuser in court.One other thing was different: The federal judge hearing the case was a native of the Texas border region, a woman, and the daughter of migrant farmworkers.“I wanted more than anything else for her to feel that the court had listened to her as a human being,” Judge Micaela Alvarez said later, in an interview.The federal prosecutor, Alexandro Benavides, urged M.M.U.T. to go on with her story. “While that was happening, did he tell you anything?” he asked.“He told me that if I ever said this, that he would kill me,” she said.She stopped talking. “I’m afraid,” she said softly.[Read the Newsletter: Yes, There Was Duct Tape: The Harrowing Journeys of Migrants Across the Border. Sign up for Crossing the Border here]Judge Alvarez reassured the witness that federal marshals were in the courtroom to keep everyone safe.This judge had seen several cases like this. Before being nominated to the bench in Texas’ Southern District by President George W. Bush in 2004, Judge Alvarez had been a social worker for the state’s Child Protective Services. She is a native of the nearby border town of Donna and, out of hundreds of federal judges around the country, one of only 29 Latinas on the federal bench.“You can take as much time as you need,” Judge Alvarez told the witness. “I can assure you that you are safe here.”When the witness was ready, Mr. Benavides, the prosecutor, asked her if she saw the man she knew as El Gordo in the courtroom.“That’s him,” she said as she pointed at Mr. Hernandez-Nunez.And then she said, again, “I’m afraid.”She began crying. Judge Alvarez stepped down from the bench, walked to the witness stand and crouched down next to her. She called Mr. Hernandez-Nunez’s lawyer over so he could hear.She said later that it was the first time in her 14 years as a federal judge that she had left the bench to console a witness.Mr. Hernandez-Nunez had already pleaded guilty to harboring an undocumented alien and was headed to federal prison; the question at the sentencing hearing that day was for how long.Prosecutors hoped for a stiff sentence because of the rape accusation. But Mr. Hernandez-Nunez, now 32, denied the attack, and investigators were unable to locate either the stash house where M.M.U.T. said she was held, or the trailer where she said the rape occurred.Norman E. McInnis, the federal public defender, reminded the judge that investigators had declined to pursue sexual assault charges against his client in state court. “If they really felt like this was injustice, then they could have pursued other charges,” he said.Judge Alvarez, having heard the arguments from both sides, started speaking. She found the victim to be credible, she said. And she said the woman was not alone — she had seen a number of migrant women coming forward lately with allegations of sexual assault, beginning to break a silence that has long been part of the price of crossing illegally into the United States.“I don’t know if it was because those instances have increased, or maybe the victims are more willing to step forward now because, you know, they’ve lost some of that fear,” she said in the courtroom. “Certainly the victim here, you know, demonstrated a lot of fear.”Judge Alvarez said she found the penalty recommended under the federal sentencing guidelines, about two and a half years, to be too short. She sentenced him to four."
178,"A 24-year-old Honduran woman gave birth to a stillborn baby boy last week while in ICE custody, the authorities said Monday, further raising concerns about the care pregnant women receive while detained.The woman, whose name has not been released, was apprehended by United States Border Patrol officials near Hidalgo, Tex., on Feb. 18, according to a joint statement issued Monday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. She told the authorities that she was six months pregnant, and she was taken to a hospital and examined, the agencies said.The woman was placed in ICE custody at the Port Isabel Detention Center near Los Frenos, Tex., and set to be released last Friday. Then she complained of abdominal pain and was to be sent to a hospital, but went into labor.She gave birth to an unresponsive baby boy. Danielle Bennett, an ICE spokeswoman, said she had seen no information that indicated the woman’s detention contributed to the stillbirth.“Although for investigative and reporting purposes, a stillbirth is not considered an in-custody death, ICE and CBP officials are proactively disclosing the details of this tragic event to be transparent with Congress, the media and the public,” the agencies said in the statement.Ms. Bennett said that ICE has 60 pregnant detainees in custody and that between Oct. 1, 2017, and Aug. 31, 2018, more than 1,600 pregnant women had been booked into ICE custody.Twenty-eight women “may have experienced a miscarriage just prior to, or while in ICE custody” between Oct. 1, 2016, and Aug. 31, 2018, she said.Ms. Bennett said that without a full understanding of someone’s medical history, it was difficult to tell what caused a miscarriage or when exactly it began.Randy Capps, director of United States research for the Migration Policy Institute, said because the woman’s detention was only for a few days, “it would seem unlikely detention was the cause” of the stillbirth.But how immigration officials care for people in their custody has been under scrutiny in recent months. An 8-year-old Guatemalan boy, Felipe Gómez Alonso, died on Christmas Eve while in United States custody, and three weeks earlier, a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl, Jakelin Caal Maquin, died in Border Patrol custody.“There has been more and more public death,” said Erika Andiola, chief of advocacy for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or Raices, a nonprofit organization that provides low-cost legal defense services to immigrant and refugee families in Texas.She said the treatment of pregnant women had been a particular focus after the Trump administration said it would stop assuming pregnant women should be released, instead detaining them on a case-by-case basis.Ms. Andiola said based on interviews with migrants who have recently left detention centers, some pregnant women do not get the care they need at the centers. For example, some were told they would be taken to off-site medical professionals but never were, she said.“We know those are not the best conditions for pregnant women at all,” Ms. Andiola said. “This is not surprising, really.”The story of the Honduran woman detailed Monday still has many uncertainties. It is not clear how or why she was taken into custody by the Border Patrol officers or how it was determined that she should be released.Ms. Bennett, the spokeswoman, referred questions about the woman’s apprehension to Customs and Border Protection. C.B.P. did not answer questions seeking more information Monday."
179,"LIMA, Ohio — It is an obsession he cannot seem to shake.Senator John McCain of Arizona has been dead for seven months, but President Trump’s feud with him is very much alive, and in front of a military audience at a tank plant here in Lima, Ohio, on Wednesday, he took it to a new level.He said he gave Mr. McCain “the funeral he wanted, and I didn’t get ‘thank you,’” exaggerating the role he played in honoring the senator’s death four days before his 82nd birthday.He blamed him for “a war in the Middle East that McCain pushed so hard.” He said that “McCain didn’t get the job done for our great vets” and the Department of Veterans Affairs. And he was blunt in saying that his animosity toward Mr. McCain was not going to change.“I have to be honest: I’ve never liked him much,” Mr. Trump said, about 10 minutes into a freewheeling speech that was ostensibly about the resurgence of manufacturing jobs. “Hasn’t been for me. I’ve really — probably never will.”The long, antagonistic history between the president and Mr. McCain, in his youth a Navy pilot and prisoner of war celebrated for his bravery and later known as a maverick in the Republican Party, dates to the early days of the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump, who never served in the military, said Mr. McCain was not a war hero, adding, “I like people who weren’t captured.”Mr. Trump was reacting to the senator’s accusation that he riled up “crazies” with inflammatory remarks about illegal immigration across the Mexican border. His attack on Mr. McCain, the party’s 2008 presidential candidate, horrified his own aides and led Republican leaders to denounce the outsider who was already disrupting their party. It also proved to be an early example of Mr. Trump’s ability to remain undamaged by any self-created controversy.Now, months after Mr. McCain’s death in August, Mr. Trump suddenly cannot stop talking about his old adversary, outraging Mr. McCain’s supporters and creating another divide — if only temporary — between himself and congressional Republicans.His attacks began over the weekend, when the president used his Twitter feed to berate Mr. McCain for his role in giving the F.B.I. a dossier of unverified information about Mr. Trump’s connections to Russia that was compiled by a former British spy — a dossier the F.B.I. already had. He brought up Mr. McCain’s vote against repealing the Affordable Care Act. He claimed that Mr. McCain, a former prisoner of war, was “last in his class” at the Naval Academy, when Mr. McCain actually graduated fifth from the bottom.On Tuesday, seated in the Oval Office next to President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Mr. Trump told reporters that he was “never a fan” of Mr. McCain, and never would be. And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump reiterated all those reasons in a diatribe that was part of a week that Mr. Trump seems to have dedicated to airing personal feuds.He has spent days criticizing George T. Conway III, the husband of Kellyanne Conway, one of his top advisers, who has been raising alarms about the president’s mental health and calling him unfit for office via his Twitter feed. On his way to Ohio, Mr. Trump called Mr. Conway a “whack job,” capping two days of back and forth with the spouse of one of his most loyal and longest-serving aides.But his relentless fixation on Mr. McCain was more reminiscent of an election-year feud Mr. Trump escalated against a Gold Star father, Khizr Khan, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention, and, brandishing a pocket Constitution, challenged Mr. Trump for smearing the character of Muslims. Republicans once again denounced Mr. Trump when he continued to attack Mr. Khan and his wife, who Mr. Trump implied was forced against her will to stand silently by her husband’s side during the emotional speech.The feud with Mr. McCain, however, has carried into his presidency, even after the man who was considered an elder statesman of the Senate learned he had brain cancer and eventually died.Planning his funeral, Mr. McCain made it clear that the president would not be welcome, leaving Mr. Trump to fume when his two immediate predecessors, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, eulogized Mr. McCain in a service at Washington National Cathedral. The president’s response was to stall on issuing any proclamation of praise, or ordering flags to be flown at half-staff to commemorate the senator’s death.His posthumous attacks have been cheered at the president’s Make America Great rallies. But at the army tank plant in Lima, where Mr. Trump said a third of the work force is made up of veterans, the denunciations drew no cheers. And they once again resulted in rare criticism from Mr. Trump’s own party.On Wednesday, Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, called out the president’s string of recent comments about Mr. McCain.“It’s deplorable what he said,” Mr. Isakson said in an interview with Georgia Public Broadcasting’s “Political Rewind” radio show, adding, “It will be deplorable seven months from now if he says it again, and I will continue to speak out.”He joined Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, who had criticized the president on Tuesday. “I can’t understand why the President would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend John McCain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and God,” Mr. Romney wrote on Twitter.Other Republicans, like Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, however, were more muted in responding to Mr. Trump’s latest attacks, choosing to emphasize their support for Mr. McCain rather than confront the president.But at least one Democratic presidential candidate used the moment to demand change in the White House.“This Vietnam vet was brought to tears when hearing the stories of the President going after John McCain this week, as well as the lack of focus on mental health for kids in this country,” Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, wrote on Twitter, with a picture of her embracing a veteran.Mr. McCain’s family, meanwhile, responded in his stead.“This is a new bizarre low,” Mr. McCain’s daughter, Meghan McCain, said on “The View” on Wednesday. “I will say attacking someone who isn’t here is a bizarre low. My dad’s not here, but I’m sure as hell here.”She added: “I think if I had told my dad, ‘Seven months after you’re dead, you’re going to be dominating the news and all over Twitter,’ he would think it’s hilarious that our president was so jealous of him that he was dominating the news cycle in death as well.”Mr. McCain’s widow, Cindy McCain, for her part, shared on Twitter a hateful message she received after Mr. Trump’s most recent attacks, in which the sender wished that Ms. McCain’s daughter “chokes to death.”Mark Salter, Mr. McCain’s closest political adviser and a harsh critic of the president, said all of Mr. Trump’s personal attacks against critics were of a piece.“The problem isn’t Trump’s disrespect to John and his family — it’s Trump,” he said. “He’s unfit for the office, and most members of Congress know he is. I hope this latest evidence of that convinces more people that he can’t be ignored.”"
180,"TIJUANA, Mexico — Hoping to convince American immigration officials that his life is in danger, Selvin Alvarado sorted through photographs of men who he said have threatened to kill him.Mr. Alvarado said he fled Honduras last fall after exposing corruption in his hometown and was followed into Mexico by an armed group. Once he reached the United States, he believed he would be safe — even if that meant being detained while waiting for asylum.“I prefer 1,000 times being jailed,” he said last week at a shelter south of the United States border, “than being dead.”Instead, as part of a newly expanded Trump administration policy, Mr. Alvarado, 29, a father of two, was sent back to Mexico. He has been waiting for weeks to be summoned for an asylum hearing in California.Hundreds of asylum seekers are expected to be blocked from waiting in the United States each day under the so-called Remain in Mexico policy, which American officials describe as a deterrent to illegal immigration.Officials at the Department of Homeland Security said the policy also aims to ease overcrowded detention facilities as they grapple with a recent surge in migrants along the southwestern border. The policy is being challenged in federal court.“The crisis at our border is worsening, and D.H.S. will do everything in its power to end it,” Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, said this week.[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]On Thursday, an official from Mexico’s Foreign Ministry said it was unclear how many asylum seekers might be turned away from the United States under the policy, which he said the Trump administration had expanded without its consultation. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a delicate diplomatic issue.About 633 Central American asylum seekers have been turned away since January, unable to prove sufficient fear of being tortured and persecuted in Mexico. It is a shift from earlier guidelines, which allowed migrants who convinced the authorities that they had a credible fear of returning to their home nations to remain in the United States while their asylum cases were being considered.Stories of fleeing violence, extortion and corruption in their home countries do not meet the new standard for entry. Many migrants are also unable to obtain lawyers to represent them in court without first meeting them in the United States.Mr. Alvarado said he was considering sneaking into the United States if his asylum claim was further delayed.“I’ll have to do it illegally,” Mr. Alvarado said, holding photographs of the men who he said pursued him from Honduras, through Guatemala and into Tapachula, Mexico. “I’ll have to give up everything.”For the most part, the policy has been rolled out slowly and quietly.When it began at the San Ysidro port of entry in California in late January, only men traveling by themselves from Central America were told to wait in Mexico as their asylum cases wound through the American legal system. The policy has since expanded to stop entire families from waiting in the United States, although unaccompanied children and Mexican citizens will be allowed to enter.It is now being enforced at border ports at Calexico, Calif., where President Trump traveled on Friday to tour the border, and El Paso. Ms. Nielsen has directed her department to expand the policy to other legal crossing points from Mexico.The number of border crossings are nowhere as high as in the early 2000s, when as many as 220,000 migrants crossed the border in a month. Ms. Nielsen estimated last month that border officials had stopped as many as 100,000 migrants in March, up from 76,000 in February.A State Department report released last month acknowledged the possibility that the migrants were no safer in Mexico from the same gangs that threatened them in Central America than they had been at home.That is constantly on the mind of Daniel Nuñez, who was working as a security guard in Honduras when gang members opened fire in October, severely injuring several of his colleagues.Mr. Nuñez fled to the United States border, where he asked for asylum in Calexico, but he was recently sent back to the Mexican city of Mexicali to wait for his immigration hearing.The closest American immigration court is 30 minutes away. But Mr. Nuñez was told he had to report for his hearing at the San Ysidro port, a nearly three-hour drive.He has no car, is sleeping in a shelter with about 370 other people and is trying to figure out how to get to San Ysidro. “I was thinking about that,” he said last week, scratching his head. “How I was going to manage.”In a lawsuit filed in February in federal court in San Francisco, the American Civil Liberties Union accused the government of violating immigration law by returning asylum seekers to Mexico. The Trump administration has maintained it has broad discretion over removal proceedings.Jacqueline Brown Scott, a lawyer, represents one of the plaintiffs in the case, who is identified in court papers only as Howard Doe for protection. He claims to have fled a drug cartel in Honduras, only to be kidnapped by another cartel in Mexico. He escaped after 15 days and he went to the United States border to seek asylum.Immigration authorities diverted him to Tijuana. Last week, he appeared in immigration court in San Diego, where Ms. Scott argued that he had a fear of persecution in Mexico. He was sent back again.“I told them everything, but they didn’t seem to care,” the migrant said in a text message that was viewed by The New York Times, which is withholding his name for security concerns.Some migrants face additional delays from immigration judges who insist they find legal counsel before their cases can move forward.Denis Rostran, of Honduras, said he called 10 lawyers who were listed on a document that Department of Homeland Security officials gave to him when he was sent back to Tijuana. None answered. Mr. Rostran said he has slept some nights on the street and has been robbed twice.A Department of Homeland Security official said it was committed to ensuring migrants have legal assistance at no cost to the government. The agency also is not forcing migrants to return to Mexico who would “more likely than not” be persecuted or tortured there, the official said.Twenty shelters and churches in Tijuana are housing around 3,000 migrants — and have almost reached their limit, said Esmeralda Siu, the executive coordinator of the Migrant Defense Coalition, in the Mexican state of Baja California. Many of the migrants are awaiting their court dates, she said, and do not expect to leave soon.That means that newly arrived and future migrants will have few, if any, options for shelter.“There’s no city, no state, that has sufficient resources to prepare for this,” said Gustavo Magallanes Cortés, the director of migration affairs for Baja California. “They’ve allowed these people to return, but cut the resources for migrants, which has led to chaos. Every day a shelter calls me and says, ‘I’ve run out of food.’”But many of the waiting migrants are determined to keep hope.“Many people say they’re doing this just so we get tired and give up on our cases,” said Daniela Diaz, 19, who said she left El Salvador after a member of the MS-13 gang threatened to rape and kill her. She has been living in a shelter in Tijuana since late January.She is frustrated that following the rules and asking for asylum at a legal port of entry — instead of sneaking into the United States — have resulted in a system of immigration purgatory.“There’s a lot of people throwing themselves over the wall,” Ms. Diaz said, “and we’re doing this the fair way.”"
181,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.A lot has been made of the new Democratic majority in the House. They’re young. Female. Diverse. Outspoken.All the focus on Democrats made us curious about what being in the new Congress looks like from the other side of the aisle.Representative Dan Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL with no prior experience in elected office, has emerged as one of the stars of the new Republican class. He survived a crowded primary race and a runoff for the Republican nomination last year, en route to winning his Houston-area district.But real fame came shortly after the election, when Mr. Crenshaw, who wears an eye patch because of an injury he suffered in Afghanistan, appeared on “Saturday Night Live” to rebut the comedian Pete Davidson, who had mocked Mr. Crenshaw as looking like a “hit man from a porno movie.” The two offered a sincere plea for civility, and a political star was born.Since then, Mr. Crenshaw’s staunch support for President Trump’s border wall and his fiery presence on social media have some Republicans calling him the conservative answer to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.We recently talked with Mr. Crenshaw about the wall, social media and civility in politics. The interview was conducted before Mr. Trump agreed on a border deal, but we decided to leave in those parts of the conversation, because the debate over the wall isn’t going away anytime soon. As usual, our interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Lisa: You came into Congress in the middle of the shutdown. Was that frustrating? I mean, you’re here to make a difference, presumably, and you enter in a stalemate. Dan Crenshaw: The frustrating part for me is why we were shut down. You can’t just be mad at a shutdown. You do have to take a side. And in the end, this shutdown boils down to $5 billion over basically extending the authorizations we’ve had in the past. That’s what’s frustrating, that we’re actually arguing over that.Well, it’s about the wall, right? Sure. To me, it’s frustrating that we can’t come to a deal. I mean, the idea of a government shutdown, it’s a consequence of our system. The president is under no obligation to sign the spending bills that Congress gives to him. And once that happens, once he says no, then you’re supposed to negotiate. So the frustrating part was to see how the Democrats refused to negotiate.That didn’t really make it out into the media very much because — I mean, we can say it all we want, but the media, generally speaking, the CNN pundits and The New York Times, will generally call it the “Trump shutdown,” because he owned it initially. I get that. But once he owned it, he asked to negotiate, and I think that’s a pretty fair ask. He did not have anyone to negotiate with. So that was frustrating, to watch that play out from the inside.Now, it looks like maybe the deal will be less money for the wall, or some kind of fencing.The semantics over wall versus fencing, first of all, are highly misleading. Trump’s plan has been what normal people would describe as fencing for a long time now. I get that he still calls it a wall. But that’s because in our English language a normal person would go up to what we have on the border right now and say it’s a wall, or a fence, and they’d both be right.What we’re actually talking about is steel bollard fencing. Again, it’s a mass misinformation campaign by the other side on this. And that’s been amplified by a lot of the media, is that we’re just talking about 2,000 miles of, like, concrete wall. It’s so unbelievably false.I want like a giant reset button to be like, “O.K., let’s start the debate over,” because I wasn’t here when we started the debate. Now I am. I’d like us to be very honest about what we’re talking about.Sounds like you’re describing a messaging problem for Republicans. I don’t have all the answers, but I think the way I’d describe the right way to message is to help people understand the “why” behind the “what.” It’s like, why do I believe we need extra fencing down the southern border? And in a deeper “why” than just, “Hey, it’s security and murders and crime.” Some of that’s true, but it leads us into a debate about how much crime and how much drugs.The “why” is: We enforce our laws, and because we believe in our own sovereignty, and I believe that illegal immigrants shouldn’t be able to cut in front of legal immigrants. That’s a better “why.”Traditionally in Washington, there was an idea that as a new member you come in and keep a low profile. You — and other freshmen — are clearly taking a different approach. Why? There was no, like, decision point. They listen to me because I just have a large following, and yeah, I got famous on national TV.There’s a sequence of events that drew us here. It’s like, you know, why is A.O.C. [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] famous? It’s just that story of beating Joe Crowley. Once that hooks people, and you’ve got that following, that’s sort of self-perpetuating. There isn’t really a rule, necessarily, that the leadership tries to keep freshmen from talking.You’ve used some of that platform to call for a return to civility. What does that look like for you? It just looks like, don’t question the other people’s character.You can be pretty sharp, particularly on Twitter.Yeah, I can be sharp. But what I never say is, you know — let me give an example of what they do to us all the time. “You can’t say that because you’re a white Christian man.” That’s not civil. That’s avoiding the debate of ideas and attacking a person because of who they are. That’s not O.K.I will attack ideas very hard. I am not shy about that one bit. So I don’t want people to think that because I had a call for civility that that means I shy away from debate and that I’m agreeable. That’s not the case. What is the case is that I will not question who you are as a person.You can say that your ideas are bad for America, and frankly un-American, but don’t say the person is a traitor. That’s the line that we should aspire to, at least in the short term.Do you think the president crosses that line?Well, let’s see. I’m trying to think of some examples.Lyin’ Ted, Liddle Marco, Horseface. I can keep going.Yeah. Those are examples. Sure.So name-calling, in general, is bad, and then what I see from the other side is like, if you’re calling someone a racist, bigot, homophobe — and they have their list, right? And that’s terrible. You know what, with everything happening in Virginia right now, are we all on social media calling him a racist? No, actually, we’re saying you did something racist. See, that’s the difference. To say someone is a racist, versus saying you did something or said something that could be perceived as racist.You think there’s a way to unwind this new tone?Just be part of the solution and not part of the problem. That’s the only way.[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter from The Times about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]____________________Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers.

182,"Suppose one night there is a knock on your door. You open it to find 100 bedraggled families shivering in your yard — exhausted, filthy, terrified. The first cry of your heart would be to take them in, but you’d know there were too many.But you’d still do something. You’d rally your neighbors and the local authorities and put some system in place — some way to provide immediate care, figure out who these people were and how, within your means, you could lift them up.And this is precisely what the U.S. has failed to do in handling the refugees who are flooding across the southern border. There is nothing remotely like an adequate system in place to handle the hundreds of thousands of people fleeing violence in Central America or seeking economic opportunity. And there is no prospect of a plan being put in place from either Republicans or Democrats.And in that way the border crisis is paradigmatic of our politics right now. Both parties are content to adopt abstract ideological postures. Neither is interested in creating a functioning system that balances trade-offs and actually works. In the age of Trump, national politics is showbiz — self-righteous performance art to make the base feel good about itself.The Trump show is all about toughness and cruelty. The administration adopted a zero-tolerance policy that was supposed to deter potential immigrants. It failed miserably. Roughly 103,000 unauthorized immigrants reached the U.S.-Mexico border in March, twice as many as in March 2018.Aside from baring his fangs, Trump is uninterested in processing the extra refugees. The facilities are overwhelmed. Over 800,000 people already have their cases pending. New asylum seekers are held for a couple of weeks, dumped out on the streets, and most will wait until 2021 to get their formal hearings. My colleagues Michael Shear, Miriam Jordan and Manny Fernandez cite the words officials are using to describe the situation: “operational emergency,” “systemwide meltdown,” “the system is on fire.”The field is wide open for the Democrats to come forth with a decent plan. But on many issues the 2020 Democrats aren’t really having a primary campaign; they’re having a purity test. The candidates are not sure if they can deviate from wherever the social media warriors have defined the leftward edge. So the Democratic show consists of indignant generalities intended to sound radical while changing nothing.Many Democrats in Congress are denying there even is a crisis on the border. The only Democratic candidate with an immigration plan so far is Julián Castro, who wants to repeal a 1929 provision that made illegal entry a federal crime. Others gesture toward the open border crowd with policies like eliminating ICE. This is Trumpian extremism reversed.Immigration is one of those issues on which the extreme positions are wrong, because the correct answer means balancing competing goods.On the one hand, these people are our neighbors. Many of them come to us with harrowing stories of husbands murdered, daughters raped, mass extortion. It’s our obligation and joy to reach out to them with a hand of solidarity. It’s barbarism to send them back to lawlessness.On the other hand, many who are coming across seeking asylum do not qualify for it. When they get their hearings, only 20 percent win the right to stay in the United States because they’d face persecution in their home countries. Many come for traditional economic reasons. The murder rate in El Salvador has fallen in half since 2015, while the number of asylum seekers has skyrocketed.The U.S. cannot take in everybody who wants to come. So the first task is to set priorities. The victims of violence and persecution get top priority, then those being systemically denied their basic rights because their country has become a failed state, then those seeking economic betterment.Then you create a system to implement those priorities. Over the short term do the things any practical mayor would do: build new detention centers at the border; expand the capacities at the ports of entry; expand the number of judge teams, to speed through the backlog; create an orderly release procedure coordinated with humanitarian agencies; increase the number of counselors so refugees can navigate the system; vet children in their home countries for refugee status so they don’t have to make a fruitless trip.Over the long term, you help build better police and justice systems in the home countries. You cooperate with Mexico to jointly tackle this challenge we face together. You might shift to a more skills-based immigration system while increasing the number of refugees we take in each year.Designing a practical response that wins widespread support is, in theory, not hard. But it requires starting with a certain question: What can we do to help them? Much of today’s politics starts from a different question: What posture can I adopt that will reflect well on me? What can I say to prove I’m manly or woke?This is what happens when the politics of practical action get replaced by the politics of performative narcissism."
183,"With President Trump’s border wall tied up by his fight with congressional Democrats, and public opinion about the wall mixed, Kris Kobach wants to take matters into his own hands.Fresh from his defeat in the race for Kansas governor, Mr. Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state, is involved in an audacious new project — a privately-funded wall along the Mexican border.Mr. Kobach, a hard-line ally of President Trump known for his strident stand on immigration, has long advocated a tough border policy.He is currently an advisory board member of “We Build the Wall Inc.” a nonprofit group that has collected more than $12 million toward the effort. Mr. Kobach says the group has obtained the presidential seal of approval for the private initiative.President Trump gave the undertaking his “blessing” in a telephone conversation Wednesday night, according to Mr. Kobach. The White House press office did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Kobach, 52, says the group will begin construction soon on its first section of the wall on donated property, likely in Texas, and that the work can be completed cheaply and efficiently by the private sector.The private wall idea is an outgrowth of a plan started in December as a GoFundMe campaign by Brian Kolfage, a disabled Air Force veteran living in Florida who says the impetus for his project was mounting public frustration over the government’s failure to reach an agreement on border protection.After raising nearly $20 million, the organization was forced to contact donors because it hadn’t reached its initial goal of $1 billion. At that point, contributions would be automatically returned to donors unless they opted back in. Mr. Kobach said that efforts to retain contributors had been very successful, with 94 percent of those contacted transferring the money into the new effort.Mr. Kobach, who is considering a 2020 run for the United States Senate seat being vacated by Pat Roberts, said he is currently an unpaid adviser to the organization but added that he might take a major administrative role as the project grows. Asked whether he would be compensated at that point, Mr. Kobach said he was not sure.We caught up with Mr. Kobach this week by telephone. His remarks were condensed and edited for clarity. Q. I understand that you’re on the board of an organization that’s promoting a private wall. Can you tell me what the goal is? A. The goal is to facilitate construction of a border wall on private land with private funds along the southern border in conjunction with federal government efforts to construct the wall. Have you done any work to see how much that’s going to cost? We believe we can build the wall, or build sections of the wall, for well under half the price that the federal government is projecting and perhaps as low as a quarter of the price. Quite often the federal government purchases things at prices higher than individuals in the private marketplace. Do you have a location in mind right now? Do you have landowners who will donate land for this? We have landowners who are inviting us already. We’ll be hopefully breaking ground within weeks, but I don’t want to give the names yet. We haven’t selected where we’re going to start. It doesn’t require the donation of a large amount of land. The landowner retains the land. It’s not like we build the wall and take possession of the land.Do you think there’s a groundswell of support for this?I do think there’s a groundswell of support. It’s an objective that people conceive of very easily. It’s not rocket science. It’s not super high technology to construct border barriers.Democrats have proposed other kinds of mechanisms for securing the border — technology, drones, radar.We already have drones and sensors on the border and they seem to think that having more is adequate. Drones don’t stop people from coming across the border, they merely tell you that someone is coming across the border. I don’t think the people who are proposing the drones only are serious about stopping the flow of illegal immigration.What are people in Kansas telling you?In Kansas, support for the wall is very strong. We haven’t done any polling or outreach on the specific question of “We Build the Wall” organization, but certainly support for building a wall or a series of barriers on the border is very high.Have you reached out to people at Homeland Security? Are they on board with this idea?I have not personally but I believe others in our organization have. We intend to cooperate and to the extent possible collaborate with the Department of Homeland Security. The objective is to assist and to create a system of sections that ultimately connect and serve one another.I talked with the president, and the “We Build the Wall Effort’’ came up. The president said ‘the project has my blessing, and you can tell the media that.’Do you see this as an alternative to a federal project?I see it as a supplement to a federal project. The $5.7 billion would not secure the entire border, even if Democrats gave the president everything he’s asking for in the current discussion. There will be hundreds of miles of gaps collectively that still wouldn’t be secured. So these private efforts will help supplement and fill in the gaps that still exist after, if and when the president is able to complete the sections of wall that he’s proposing. Some people might say securing the border is a government function just like air traffic control.It is correct that securing the border is a government function, but when the government fails, it has a specific and significant impact on individual landowners. So the failure to secure the border affects me in Kansas indirectly and it affects you in New York indirectly. But the landowner who has the ranch right on the border is affected in a way that is 1,000 percent greater than what you and I would experience. The biggest effects are litter and security. The traffickers, as they’re bringing their migrants through, they’re constantly dumping clothing, food containers and trash on the ranchers’ land. And then there’s an environmental impact. But the biggest impact for individual landowners is security.Sounds like you’re looking at this from the standpoint of private property rights and the rights of private landowners?Exactly. In this project the rights of private landowners intersect perfectly with the objectives of the U.S. government. Ostensibly, members of both parties say they want to secure the border. The landowner needs to secure the border because of the damage being done in terms of litter and in terms of public safety and in terms of trespassing.I have heard stories of landowners who like the open border because they’ve made friends with people who live on the Mexican side and they’re neighbors.In that case if a landowner doesn’t want to have any fencing or barriers on his project, he wouldn’t be someone we would be working with."
184,"President Trump has been eager to show progress on construction of his long-promised wall on the border with Mexico. So eager that on Wednesday he sent a tweet showing the building of steel fencing in southern New Mexico with the video sped up to add a sense of both efficiency and urgency.He retweeted himself on Thursday with the all-caps proclamation “THE WALL IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW!” This is misleading.The government has built about 700 miles of wall and fencing along the border since 2006. The barriers, damaged by migrants trying to get through them or by the elements, need periodic repairs.The section of the barrier that Mr. Trump showcased this week was not new construction, but rather replacement for existing fencing. The money for the steel-slatted barrier came from a congressional appropriation in 2017, not from newly authorized spending in the recent deal that averted a government shutdown, or from money the president is seeking to take from other federal projects under his national emergency declaration from last week.A construction contract for the replacement bollard fencing was awarded on Jan. 22, 2018, to a company in Montana, according to a news release from United States Customs and Border Protection. “The area of the border wall replacement will be a 20-mile section of existing vehicle barrier located just west of the Santa Teresa Port of Entry and extending westward” in New Mexico, the release said. “The existing barrier will be replaced with an 18- to 30-foot-high bollard-style wall.”The contract called for the project to be completed in about 390 days. The agency also highlighted the benefits of the see-through characteristics of the bollard wall.Mr. Trump noted that the project finished ahead of schedule.Whether there will be new wall or fence construction in that area is an open question. New Mexico is among the states suing the Trump administration to challenge his emergency declaration.Curious about the accuracy of a claim? Email factcheck@nytimes.com."
185,"As President Trump declared a national emergency on Friday to bypass Congress and build his long-promised wall, he again painted a portrait of a lawless, chaotic border and cited arguments about the effectiveness of the kind of barrier he has in mind that were not rooted in facts.Illegal border crossings have been declining for decades. While families are overwhelming an immigration system devised to handle single men, a border wall would not prevent them from seeking asylum, which is legal. Research does not show that immigrants commit more crimes than native-born Americans. And a wall would do little to prevent drugs and human trafficking at the border, as official ports of entry are the main route into the United States for both.Cumulatively, Mr. Trump’s unsupported or misleading statements undercut his rationale for declaring an emergency, a step that is widely viewed as testing both constitutional and political norms and is sure to draw legal challenges. Mr. Trump is correct that there were 23 murders in El Paso last year, compared with more than 1,200 murders in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. But the disparity predates the existence of border barriers separating the two towns.In 2007, the year before border fencing construction began, El Paso reported 17 murders while Juárez recorded about 320 homicides, before the drug war between cartels escalated.In 2010, after the barriers were largely completed, El Paso recorded five murders before the number increased to 16 a year later. That same year, murders in Juárez topped 3,600 before declining to over 2,000 in 2011. Mr. Trump was referring to the flow of drugs across the border and disputing arguments that most smuggling takes place not in remote areas where a wall might be built but through authorized border crossing points, or ports of entry. The relevant statistics come from Mr. Trump’s own agencies, not Democrats. Data from Customs and Border Protection shows that 80 percent to 90 percent of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl is seized at ports of entry (marijuana is the exception). The Drug Enforcement Administration noted that a “small percentage of all heroin” is seized at areas between ports of entry.You can. For example, the Justice Department recently detailed how an international sex trafficking ring committed visa fraud to transport women from Thailand into the United States and coerce them into the sex trade. About 80 percent of human trafficking victims passed through official ports of entry, according to a decade’s worth of data collected by the Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative. The Polaris Project, a group that works to prevent human trafficking in the United States, said in a statement that out of nearly 50,000 cases it has handled, “the vast majority of victims” arrive through ports of entry. Israel built a wall along its border with Egypt in 2013, and it has proved to be effective. Israeli officials have said that illegal crossings decreased to 12 in 2014 from more than 16,000 in 2011 — a 99 percent reduction.Whether that example could be applied to the United States is another matter, as PolitiFact has reported. The border between Israel and Egypt is much shorter than the United States-Mexico border, along flat land as opposed to mountainous terrain. Israel also invested in technology and manpower to guard its border.Mr. Trump is right that previous presidents have issued 58 national emergency declarations since 1978, 30 of which are still in effect. But those declarations have largely dealt with crises and conflicts abroad.Examples include blocking transactions with the Taliban, prohibiting the importation of diamonds from Sierra Leone, placing restrictions on North Korea and allowing faster treatment during the swine flu outbreak in 2009.Mr. Trump’s declaration, however, is extraordinary in that it addresses a domestic policy issue and involves redirecting money without the approval of Congress.The funding deal passed by Congress on Thursday authorized $1.375 billion for border fencing, which is less than the $1.6 billion that senators proposed last June and that Mr. Trump rejected. Asked about his reaction to the reduced funding, Mr. Trump misleadingly cited comments made by Speaker Nancy Pelosi.At a news conference in January, while the government was still partially shut down, Ms. Pelosi jokingly said that she would agree to give Mr. Trump $1 for his border wall. But Ms. Pelosi and Democrats have consistently drawn a distinction between the wall and border security, referring to employing technology enhancements and additional personnel as well as barriers. At that same January news conference, Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats promoted a bill that included $1.3 billion for border fencing and would have temporarily reopened the government. Mr. Trump also repeated four other claims about immigration and his border wall that The New York Times has previously fact-checked: Curious about the accuracy of a claim? Email factcheck@nytimes.com. "
186,"As congressional negotiators were wrestling their way toward a compromise bill to fund the federal government this week, one sticking point emerged: the demand by Democrats to reduce the number of beds for immigrants detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And while the details are complicated, Democrats claim that the legislation, which President Trump is expected to sign Friday, will bring the number of beds to 40,520, down from 49,057.But while well intentioned — the list of problems with the immigrant detention system is long — if the Democrats get their way, they will likely make conditions much worse for the tens of thousands of undocumented migrants and asylum seekers in limbo on both sides of the border.Cutting back beds highlights two major objections to the detention system. First, the system is an integral component of a private prison-industrial complex owned by a handful of companies, whose profits rely on mass incarceration. Second, because of the Trump administration’s criminalization of prospective asylum seekers and undocumented migrants, the vast majority of detainees are either Central American families fleeing horrific violence or law-abiding Central American and Mexican members of American society. About 58 percent of detainees have no criminal record, and only 20 percent have been convicted of serious felonies (including selling marijuana).We have spent the last few years researching migrant flows into the United States, and this data is consistent with research our team has conducted with roughly 300 returned Central American and Mexican migrants. For the most part, Central Americans were detained after crossing the border as they awaited an asylum hearing, while the majority of Mexicans spoke of being raised in the United States, playing by the rules and being apprehended for minor traffic violations — speeding, a broken taillight or driving without a license. None of the handful of deportees who were found guilty of more serious crimes had languished in immigration detention. They had been summarily deported after serving time in federal prison.Detention facilities also hamper the ability of both prospective refugees and undocumented migrants to gain asylum or to successfully plead their case to remain in the United States. Such facilities limit inmates’ communication with the outside world, a situation further compounded by their remote location. And once locked up, detainees are deprived of the means to earn the income required to hire the professional lawyers they need to have a realistic chance of success.The treatment migrants receive in detention centers is inhumane. While the traumas that detained children face are well documented, the adult immigrants we interviewed also told countless stories of abuse, including racist taunts, physical aggression and the deprivation of their most basic needs. Jason, a young man voluntarily traveling back to Mexico by bus, was apprehended on the bus and detained because his visa had expired two weeks earlier. He was sent to a detention facility. He told us of begging for food, only to have a guard toss a burrito onto the floor of a fly-infested cell that reeked of excrement. Israel Concha, a young man stopped for speeding and separated from his pregnant wife, described an immigration hearing in which he was prevented from even touching his newborn son.Such stories make it easy to see why Democrats pushed to shrink ICE’s capacity to detain people. But cutting back on capacity will not solve the abuses of immigration detention. In fact it is more likely to make things worse (a fact that Democrats have quietly conceded by allowing ICE to adjust the facilities’ capacity if they need to, which is why Republicans claim the actual number of beds allowed is much higher). It is foolhardy to imagine that, in response, the Trump administration will simply detain fewer people, in order to guarantee them all a bed. If anything, it will double down its enforcement of existing policies, rendering the lives of detainees even more of a living hell.Increasing numbers of prospective asylum seekers, subjected to the Remain in Mexico policy, would be dispatched to dangerous tent cities in Mexican border towns to wait their turn. Undocumented immigrants would be herded into increasingly cramped quarters or into county jails where conditions are even worse. Florizel, an undocumented Mexican teenager and convert to Mormonism whom we interviewed, described being apprehended and held in a county jail surrounded by pedophiles and murderers, “They left me in the cell for like almost like a whole day without water without food. And it was really cold. I would ask them, ‘Hey, but I didn't do anything!’ And they would just tell me to ‘shut up, friggin’ Mexican.’”Despite its horrors, many apprehended undocumented immigrants opt for detention as the least awful option. Those without a criminal track record are typically given a choice. They can leave the United States voluntarily, or be placed in detention to fight their removal. The vast majority of people we interviewed chose detention because they want a chance to defend themselves and can’t face the prospect of upending their entire lives by leaving. Mr. Concha opted for detention with the faint hope of preserving his life in the United States. “I wanted to fight ’til the end,” he told us. “I had a company and all my family was here. I wanted to know the final outcome instead of wondering all my life, ‘What if I would have fought? What if I did have a chance? What if the laws change?’”To the extent that Democrats are serious about immigration reform, restricting beds is more a gimmick than a solution. Absent the comprehensive reform desperately needed, Democrats should use their new political capital to protect migrant rights. That means demanding more humane treatment at detention centers, guaranteeing the right to asylum for refugees from the region, assuring due process for the majority of undocumented migrants who are upstanding members of our society, and requiring that ICE focus its resources on detaining and deporting only those migrants who have committed truly serious crimes. We know what is needed. What we lack is the political will and commitment to push forward an agenda that restores humanity and legality to a broken and corrupt system."
187,"[President Trump said he is considering releasing migrants in so-called sanctuary cities. Read the latest here.]WASHINGTON — President Trump’s top aides considered an idea to pressure immigration agencies to release apprehended migrants into so-called sanctuary cities represented by Democratic lawmakers, according to several people familiar with the proposal.The idea was floated in an email by a top White House policy adviser in November, when Mr. Trump was furiously condemning migrant caravans from Central America headed toward the southwestern border, the people, including two government officials, said.In the email dated Nov. 16, with the subject line “Sanctuary City Proposal,” May Davis, the deputy White House policy coordinator, raised the idea with officials from the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.Ms. Davis suggested that migrants who had been apprehended and were slated to be released into border towns could instead be taken to one of several sanctuary cities, which limit how local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration officers.The proponents of the idea inside the White House argued at the time that it would help with overcrowding at nonprofit shelters in border towns by transferring the migrants to cities that already embrace the idea of having more immigrants, one official said.Once there, the migrants would be released onto the streets — potentially sending a message to the Democratic politicians who oppose Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda and his demands for a wall along the border with Mexico.“The idea has been raised by one to two principals that, if we are unable to build sufficient temporary housing, that caravan members be bused to small- and mid-sized sanctuary cities,” Ms. Davis wrote to the officials at the agencies. She added, “There is not a White House decision on this.”Matthew Albence, the acting deputy director of ICE, objected to the idea, telling the White House that there would be liability issues if a migrant were injured during transport. He also raised concerns that the agency’s budget had not been appropriated for that purpose.In an email, Mr. Albence responded that the proposal would create “an unnecessary operational burden” on the department and added that he did not know how paying extra to transport migrants to another location was “a justified expenditure.”Mr. Albence is in line to run ICE after the departure this week of Ronald D. Vitiello, whom Mr. Trump pushed out because the president said he was not responding to the surge of immigrants in a tough enough fashion.“This was a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion,” a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement on Thursday evening.In a statement from the White House, an official called the proposal a “nonstory” and said that “these are illegal aliens already being released and sent to U.S. communities every day.”“The administration’s position is that we want to deport — not release — illegal aliens,” the official said.The plan to transport migrants to sanctuary cities, which was first reported Thursday evening by The Washington Post, did not go into effect, according to the officials.But the White House did raise the idea again several months later, in February, suggesting that releasing the immigrants into the sanctuary cities would be a way of punishing Democrats for resisting budget requests for more money to detain undocumented immigrants, according to one person familiar with it.A White House official denied that punishing the Democratic lawmakers was the primary purpose of the idea. The official said that it was an effort to deal more efficiently with migrants who were already going to be released.But at that time, officials at the Department of Homeland Security once again raised significant concerns about the idea’s legality, and the proposal was not carried out.A spokeswoman for Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, who represents San Francisco, one of the most high-profile sanctuary cities in the country, condemned the idea on Thursday night.“The extent of this administration’s cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated,” said Ashley Etienne, a spokeswoman for Ms. Pelosi. “Using human beings — including little children — as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable, and in some cases, criminal.”Ms. Etienne added, “The American people have resoundingly rejected this administration’s toxic anti-immigrant policies, and Democrats will continue to advance immigration policies that keep us safe and honor our values.”Mr. Trump has frequently, and harshly, criticized sanctuary cities, saying their actions are a violation of federal immigration laws and allow violent criminals who are undocumented immigrants back onto the streets instead of being deported.During his campaign for the presidency, Mr. Trump often cited the case of Kate Steinle, who was killed by an undocumented immigrant in San Francisco. He mentioned the case during a key immigration speech in 2016, months before the election.“Another victim is Kate Steinle,” Mr. Trump said. “Gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, by an illegal immigrant, deported five previous times. And they knew he was no good.”As president, he has continued to lash out at sanctuary cities. In remarks in the East Room in January 2018, Mr. Trump said that sanctuary cities were “the best friends of gangs and cartels.”One person familiar with the proposal to transport migrants to sanctuary cities said that none of the proposals came directly from Stephen Miller, the architect of the president’s immigration agenda and the top domestic policy adviser in the White House.But the person said that Department of Homeland Security officials understood that Mr. Miller was a chief advocate of the idea. Mr. Miller did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday night.But Mr. Albence said in a statement issued late Thursday by the department that “as the acting deputy, I was not pressured by anyone at the White House on this issue.”“I was asked my opinion and provided it and my advice was heeded,” he said. “The email exchange is clear, and suggesting that it indicates inappropriate pressure is inaccurate.”The idea’s existence was revealed as Mr. Trump and Mr. Miller have begun to purge the immigration agencies of officials they believe have not worked aggressively enough to prevent the surge of migrants at the border and to advance the president’s hard-line immigration agenda.In addition to Mr. Vitiello, Mr. Trump pushed out Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, and Claire Grady, the acting deputy secretary of the department. The president also appears poised to oust two other top immigration officials at the department in the coming days.A senior administration official told reporters this week that when it comes to the administration’s core priorities on immigration, many of them have been “moving too slowly or moving in the wrong direction” at immigration agencies."
188,"After prompting the longest government shutdown in history, President Trump’s divisive proposal for a border wall has taken a back seat in recent days for negotiators in Congress who are seeking to avoid another crippling closure. The latest talks have focused on another immigration issue that has exploded in recent months: Record numbers of migrants being held in cramped detention centers.Under orders to end the process that the president calls “catch and release,” the authorities have arrested and jailed tens of thousands of migrants since Mr. Trump took office, and Republicans would like it to stay that way.Democrats argue that ordinary immigrants around the country are being unnecessarily plucked from their families and jailed, and newly arrived migrants are being forced to wait unreasonable lengths of time in harsh detention centers.At issue is how much money the budget should provide for detention. Without more money, the authorities will have to scale back on arrests.“We’ll be releasing gang members. We’ll be releasing individuals convicted of domestic violence and drug crimes,” said Matthew Albence, deputy director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “We will not be able to respond to as many calls as we do today. And in fact, in many of these calls, we’re going to tell them, ‘Just release them,’ because we have no choice.”Democrats point out that more than a quarter of current ICE detainees are not subject to mandatory detention under the law.Both Republicans and Democrats are citing competing data to claim that the new budget proposal advances their goals. Here’s what the plan really says:Months of brinkmanship between Congress and the White House over the border wall have distracted from the issue of detention, which has now reached a breaking point, with the authorities being urged by the White House to arrest more immigrants than they can currently afford to detain.With little support for a robust border wall on either side of the aisle within Congress, Republicans and Democrats have moved on to detention, which is also expensive, and has implications for recent border crossers as well as immigrants with firmly established roots in the United States.Mr. Trump’s strict enforcement agenda has pushed the population of detained immigrants to the highest levels in history, with the authorities sweeping into immigrant-heavy locales to arrest vast numbers of the undocumented, as well as immigrants who have violated the terms of their visas (usually through criminal convictions), making them deportable.Under sweeping policy changes introduced by Mr. Trump, ICE has gone after immigrants who were once not targeted, repopularizing workplace raids, arresting community leaders, and using previously frowned upon tactics to ferret out anyone who can be expelled from the country. As a result, the average daily population in immigration detention for the 2019 fiscal year has reached 45,890. ICE currently has funding to house only 40,520 people.Republicans are saying that they secured money for 5,000 additional immigration detention beds, while Democrats are saying that they managed to bring down detention numbers by 17.4 percent. Technically, both are true. Here’s why:Both parties agreed in the proposal to fund an average daily population for 2019 of 45,724 ICE detainees, or about 5,000 more than the 2018 budget provided — allowing Republicans to claim their success.But in order to reach that average by Sept. 30, the last day of the fiscal year, ICE will gradually have to decrease its detained population to 40,520, which represents about a 17 percent decrease from the 49,057 who are currently detained.Republican aides suggested in internal communications that the number of detained immigrants could reach 58,500 under the proposal through a process called reprogramming, which allows agencies to adjust their budgets to address unforeseen emergencies.Under reprogramming, federal agencies can take money that has been appropriated by Congress for specific matters, and use it to fund other things. And though it is meant to be used sparingly, the Department of Homeland Security has often used reprogramming to fund extra detention beds.Though it is a common tactic, Democrats argue that the amount of money that would need to be reprogrammed in order to reach 58,500 detention beds, $750 million, would be unprecedented.And they argue that the congressional committees that are now controlled by Democrats would never approve such a large amount.The Department of Homeland Security has historically deferred to such committees for approval before reprogramming funds, though it is not technically required.The deal provides funds for $1.375 billion in physical barriers along the border, far less than the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump requested for his border wall. The money could be put toward 55 miles of new fencing, using only “currently deployed designs.”The proposal also provides funding to revamp holding facilities that are used by Customs and Border Protection, which came under renewed scrutiny after the deaths of two young migrant children around Christmas.And it would refund Obama-era programs that were eliminated under Mr. Trump, which had provided alternatives to detention for certain immigrants. Those who had been enrolled in the programs were allowed to roam freely, using GPS ankle bracelets and other incentives devised to make sure they showed up for court."
189,"CORQUÍN, Honduras — The farmer stood in his patch of forlorn coffee plants, their leaves sick and wilted, the next harvest in doubt.Last year, two of his brothers and a sister, desperate to find a better way to survive, abandoned their small coffee farms in this mountainous part of Honduras and migrated north, eventually sneaking into the United States.Then in February, the farmer’s 16-year-old son also headed north, ignoring the family’s pleas to stay.The challenges of agricultural life in Honduras have always been mighty, from poverty and a neglectful government to the swings of international commodity prices.But farmers, agricultural scientists and industry officials say a new threat has been ruining harvests, upending lives and adding to the surge of families migrating to the United States: climate change.And their worries are increasingly shared by climate scientists as well.Gradually rising temperatures, more extreme weather events and increasingly unpredictable patterns — like rain not falling when it should, or pouring when it shouldn’t — have disrupted growing cycles and promoted the relentless spread of pests.The obstacles have cut crop production or wiped out entire harvests, leaving already poor families destitute.Central America is among the regions most vulnerable to climate change, scientists say. And because agriculture employs much of the labor force — about 28 percent in Honduras alone, according to the World Bank — the livelihoods of millions of people are at stake.Last year, the bank reported that climate change could lead at least 1.4 million people to flee their homes in Mexico and Central America and migrate during the next three decades.The United States has allocated tens of millions of dollars in aid in recent years for farmers across Central America, including efforts to help them adapt to the changing climate.But President Trump has vowed to cut off all foreign aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador because of what he calls their failure to curb the flow of migrants north.Critics contend the punishment is misguided, though, because it could undermine efforts to address the very problems that are driving people to abandon their farms and head to the United States.“If Donald Trump withdraws all the funds for Honduras, it’s going to generate more unemployment, and that’s going to generate more migration,” said María Esperanza López, the general manager of Copranil, a coffee-growers cooperative here in western Honduras. “And that’s going to result in more abandoned farms.”Coffee cultivators in the region are at particular risk of disruption because the crop is highly sensitive to weather variations.Fredi Onan Vicen Peña, the coffee farmer whose brothers, sister and teenage son have already given up and joined the exodus north, reached over and tore a leaf off one of his plants.It was a mottled yellow and brown: signs of coffee rust, a disease whose spread has been influenced by climate variability. As much as 70 percent of his crop, planted across five acres in a pine forest, had been affected, he estimated, and there was little chance he could salvage it.“Climate change is destroying some farms,” said Mr. Vicen, 41.Beyond that, some of his healthier plants had begun to blossom nearly two months ahead of schedule because of a heavy unseasonable downpour, throwing the entire growing cycle into doubt.“This is not something we predicted,” Mr. Vicen said.Average temperatures have risen by about two degrees Fahrenheit in Central America over the past several decades, making the cultivation of coffee difficult, if not untenable, at lower altitudes that were once suitable.That has forced some farmers to search for land at higher altitudes, switch to other crops, change professions — or migrate.“Some very fine families that have been producing quality coffee for a long time are now facing the decision of whether to stay in coffee,” said Catherine M. Tucker, a professor of anthropology at the University of Florida who has done research in Honduras for more than two decades.Some climate scientists say that in the absence of long-term meteorological data, it is hard for them to say with certainty whether the increasing variability is caused by long-term changes in the region’s climate. But, they say, they are leaning in that direction.“It’s becoming so unusual, it’s almost certainly climate change,” said Dr. Edwin J. Castellanos, dean of the Research Institute at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, a university in Guatemala City, and one of Central America’s leading scientists in the field of climate change.Climate change is rarely the sole factor in the decision to migrate. Violence and poverty are prime drivers, but climate change can be a tipping point, farmers and experts say.“Small farmers are already living in poverty; they’re already at the threshold of not being able to survive,” Mr. Castellanos said. “So any changes in the situation may push them to have enough incentives to leave.”The outlook for the region seems bleak. Reduced yields of coffee and subsistence crops like corn and beans could significantly increase food insecurity and malnutrition. By some predictions, the amount of land suitable for growing coffee in Central America could drop by more than 40 percent by 2050.The number of coffee producers in the area where Mr. Vicen lives has dropped by a quarter in the past decade — to about 9,000 from about 12,000 — partly because of pressure from climate change, said Marlon Danilo Mejía, the regional coordinator for the Honduran Coffee Institute, an industry trade group.A vast majority are small producers, managing less than about nine acres each, he said.José Edgardo Vicen, 37, one of Mr. Vicen’s brothers, had weighed migrating for years. He had worked in the coffee fields since he was a boy, continuing the family tradition. In this part of Honduras, coffee is a major crop, with an increasing amount bound for North America, Europe and Asia.But after a rust outbreak and other pressures in recent years, including plunging commodity prices, the younger Mr. Vicen said he could no longer earn enough from his harvest to cover production costs.He headed north with his 14-year-old son last August, crossed the border illegally and settled in Texas. A brother and a sister, driven by similar circumstances, left Honduras soon afterward and also sneaked into the United States.“For the small producer, I promise you, there’s no way to get ahead,” said Mr. Vicen, who now works in construction and sends remittances home to support his wife and daughter.When he was younger, harvest time “was like a party,” he recalled. Now, “there are only losses, no profits.”Fifteen producers from the Vicens’ coffee cooperative — more than 10 percent of its members — have migrated to the United States in the past year, said Ms. Esperanza López, the general manager of the cooperative. They have joined thousands of others from villages in Honduras’s western highlands.Stephanie Leutert, director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the University of Texas at Austin, said that government statistics on apprehension of migrants at the southwest border of the United States in recent years reflect a sharp increase in people from western Honduras.After large caravans of migrants arrived last fall in Tijuana, Mexico, a United Nations survey found that 72 percent of those surveyed were from Honduras — and 28 percent of the respondents had worked in the agricultural sector.The exodus of farm workers has worsened already serious labor shortages in western Honduras. Some industry leaders in the region joke that if the caravans in recent months were “the laborer caravans,” the next wave will be “the grower caravans.”Coffee farmers have been scrambling to adjust to the changes, learning which species are more resistant to plague and drought, and branching out into other crops — like cacao, avocados or trees that produce construction-grade wood.Nongovernmental and public-private initiatives have also taken root in coffee-growing regions of Central America and around the world to help guide farmers. Some have received the backing of the world’s biggest coffee sellers — like Starbucks, Tim Horton’s and Lavazza — trying to ensure their future supply.Yet even the application of best practices is no guarantee that everything will be fine.“The weather is crazy,” said Carlos Peña Orellana, 58, a farmer and member of a local coffee cooperative. “Everything’s out of control.”He owns 12 acres of land but can afford to farm only about five. He gets by with income from a tomato greenhouse he built with the cooperative’s help, and with remittances from two sons who migrated to the United States after struggling through the rust crisis of 2012-13.“They’re helping to revive the farm,” he said at his ramshackle ranch one recent afternoon. “It’s really difficult now.”He turned to his youngest son, Carlos, 12, and saw a future migrant. Pointing a leathery finger, he said: “You’re next, right?” Mr. Peña chuckled. The boy squirmed, saying nothing."
190,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]Facing serious overcrowding in immigration courts, federal authorities in New York adopted a high-tech solution last year: Immigrants would be kept in detention centers for their legal proceedings, appearing before judges only by videoconference.Now, a new lawsuit claims that the policy infringes upon immigrants’ constitutional rights in a deliberate attempt to speed up and increase deportations.The lawsuit, filed on Tuesday in the Federal District Court in Manhattan, asserted that detained immigrants could not fully communicate with their lawyers and participate in proceedings when their only interaction with immigration court was through video.As a result, the lawsuit said, immigrants who might otherwise be granted the ability to stay in the United States instead could be deported. The suit cited several instances when videoconferencing had harmful effects on immigrants and their hearings.One immigrant spent three extra months in detention because his jail’s one videoconferencing line connecting inmates to immigration court had been double booked.Another was afraid to testify about his sexual orientation because Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officers at the detention facility where he was being held were listening as he spoke to the court in a videocall.The interpreter for a third had difficulty understanding an immigrant as he sobbed through his two-hour testimony, because his words were muffled over the audio feed of the videoconference.ICE has justified videoconferencing as an efficient way to address the backlog at the immigration court on Varick Street in Manhattan.An ICE spokeswoman said she could not comment on pending litigation.But the lawsuit said the videoconferencing was “merely pretext for the true reasoning behind the policy — limiting due process, access to the courts and counsel for immigrants in an effort to rush deportations and deport more people.”Immigration courts have been overwhelmed by cases for over a decade, but the suit put a spotlight on efforts under the Trump administration to tackle the backlog by speeding up proceedings. The strategy has drawn criticism from immigration lawyers, advocates and judges, who argue that expediting proceedings can rob immigrants of a fair trial.To address overwhelmed dockets, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in April 2017 that the Department of Justice would bring on an additional 125 immigration judges, at least 44 of whom have been hired.Mr. Sessions also imposed policy changes the Justice Department called common-sense reforms to increase the efficiency of immigration courts.But immigration lawyers argued that prioritizing speed has come at the expense of due process.“This push toward efficiency over due process is particularly Trumpian,” Andrea Sáenz, the supervising attorney at Brooklyn Defender Services, said. The videoconferencing policy in New York is part of a larger trend of addressing the backlog by focusing “on what the government or ICE thinks is faster or cheaper, instead of giving people full and fair hearings,” Ms. Sáenz said.The plaintiffs in the federal suit include Brooklyn Defender Services, the Legal Aid Society and the Bronx Defenders, all of which offer free legal services to immigrants facing deportation as a part of the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project, a program funded by the New York City Council. Low-income people in immigration detention do not otherwise have a right to a lawyer if they cannot afford one.In previous years, judges frequently used their discretion to close some cases they deemed “low priority,” to take them off their dockets indefinitely and reduce the backlog.But Mr. Sessions restricted judges’ ability to do so, arguing in a decision in September that closing certain cases was “not a free-floating power an immigration judge may invoke” solely to create space on their docket. Advocates said this has added to the backlog.In June, the ICE field office in New York announced the policy in which detained immigrants would appear in court by videoconference instead of being brought to the court on Varick Street.At the time, ICE officials presented the policy as a security measure, after a group of demonstrators gathered outside the court to protest the administration’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy.The announcement also came three days after President Trump suggested that people who came into the United States illegally be sent back to their home countries without due process, the suit noted.“When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter.Even when the Varick Street protests ended, the New York policy remained in place. The use of videoconferencing “is more efficient, providing an economic savings to taxpayers, while continuing to ensure the safety of ICE employees, the court, the public and the detainees,” an ICE spokeswoman said in a statement in December.Videoconferencing is sometimes used in regions where judges are hours away from the jails, prisons and detention facilities where immigrants are held to help expedite procedural matters, such as scheduling hearings or accepting documents.A 2015 study by the U.C.L.A. law professor Ingrid Eagly found that deportation proceedings of detained immigrants heard by videoconference were adjudicated more quickly, in fewer days and with fewer trials, than those heard in person. But detained immigrants whose cases were heard through videoconferencing were also more likely to be deported.In New York, the introduction of videoconferencing for all proceedings meant that lawyers could no longer conduct on-site interviews to determine if a detained immigrant was eligible for free legal services, discuss how a client wanted to proceed in their case, or review strategies and clarify facts confidentially.Videoconferencing “does not always paint a complete picture” of a detained immigrant, said Judge Amiena Khan, speaking as the executive vice president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, the judges’ union. “Sometimes it’s more difficult to interact, to judge eye contact and nonverbal cues like body language,” all of which are critical to making determinations about an immigrant’s claims, Ms. Khan said.The suit, which is seeking class-action status, claimed that it was also more difficult for detainees to follow proceedings by video, especially when there were technology failures or when people required translators, who could not do simultaneous interpretation unless the immigrant appeared in person.Additionally, the suit contended that a shortage of videoconferencing lines and the failure of the technology had resulted in immigration judges routinely delaying scheduled proceedings or adjourning them altogether when lines were not available, prolonging immigrants’ detention."
191,"To the Editor:Re “Trump Declares National Emergency to Build Border Wall” (nytimes.com, Feb. 15):If some migrant workers and asylum seekers illegally crossing the southern border constitute a “national emergency,” then what to think of the tens of thousands of Americans lost to gun violence each year, the growing number of Americans without access to affordable health insurance and the existential threat of our increasingly extreme climate?If Republicans in Congress do not immediately rebuke this reckless and unconstitutional subversion of Congress’s own power of the purse, and if the increasingly partisan federal judiciary signs off on this obvious abuse of authority, then a dangerous precedent has indeed been set.And in that case, I very much look forward to a Democratic president declaring a state of emergency to ban assault weapons after the next school shooting, to create a universal Medicare opt-in for the uninsured, and to impose a large-scale reordering of our fossil fuel-based economy after the next devastating wildfires or hurricanes.Republicans will rue this latest capitulation to this lawless president — yet perhaps the country will come to be better off for it.Nikhil SinghShelton, Conn.To the Editor:How much waste of time, money and energy is it going to take for this country to come to its senses and demand that President Trump and Congress get serious about the business of government?Mr. Trump has conjured up a national emergency where none exists and has tied the entire country in knots for months over a useless wall he wants to build on our southern border to protect us from imaginary threats. Meanwhile, nothing is being done about the issues that will eventually have real consequences for the country.If this isn’t dereliction of duty, I don’t know what is.Stuart MathNew YorkTo the Editor:To paraphrase that famous quote: First the president came for the Justice Department, but the Republicans in Congress did not speak out because they were not part of the Justice Department. Then the president came for the free press, but the Republicans in Congress did not speak out because they were not journalists.And now the president has come for you, Congress. He means to usurp your power over appropriations — the most fundamental constitutional power granted to you by the framers. Will you leave it to the courts to defend your prerogatives — hoping that there are still some judges and Supreme Court justices left who are free of Trumpian influence? Or will you finally, finally speak out for yourselves, forcefully and with one unified voice?

Of course, it is his teammates — the Republicans in Congress — who stand to lose the most because they are no longer in the ballgame. They have kowtowed to their neighborhood bully once too often and may as well go home themselves.If Mr. Trump’s border wall truly had merit, the case to be made would be straightforward.

192,"This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.President Trump’s emergency declaration for a border wall is based on an obvious falsehood: There is no emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border. And because he was goaded into the declaration by Sean Hannity, the episode makes a mockery of the federal government.But in the relative scheme of Trump’s misbehavior, the emergency declaration doesn’t rank very high. It’s not corruption or obstruction of justice. It’s not an attempt to undermine America’s alliance with Western Europe. And it doesn’t even matter much for immigration policy. If you’re trying to calibrate your Trump-related outrage, you can take a deep breath this morning.“A presidential declaration of emergency in order to construct a wall would be stupid,” Lawfare’s Quinta Jurecic wrote. “It would be wasteful. It would test the limits of the president’s authority under the law in question. But it would not, in itself, be a step toward authoritarianism.” (Here’s the longer version of her case.)[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]“This will be challenged in courts immediately, and it will be pretty easy to throw this thing out,” Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general, predicted on Lawrence O’Donnell’s MSNBC show last night.“Trump’s fake emergency is a sign of weakness not strength,” tweeted The New Yorker’s John Cassidy. “He ran on the wall, he had two years of Republican control of Congress, and he still couldn’t get it financed. Weak president.”And Philip Klein of The Washington Examiner made the conservative case against the declaration: “The only hope for limited government conservatives is that any emergency declaration gets quickly enjoined, and eventually nixed, in federal court. At least then, the silver lining would be that a legal precedent would be set that the president cannot attempt such an end around Congress.”The China rivalry“I’ve always thought Americans would come together when we realized that we faced a dangerous foreign foe,” my colleague David Brooks writes. “And lo and behold, now we have one: China. It’s become increasingly clear that China is a grave economic, technological and intellectual threat to the United States and the world order.”I agree that the United States has been too complacent about the geopolitical challenge that China poses."
193,"Any onetime Mafia investigator who listened to the Trump “fixer” Michael Cohen testify Wednesday would have immediately recognized the congressional hearing’s historical analogue — what America witnessed on Capitol Hill wasn’t so much John Dean turning on President Richard Nixon, circa 1973; it was the mobster Joseph Valachi turning on the Cosa Nostra, circa 1963.The Valachi hearings, led by Senator John McClellan of Arkansas, opened the country’s eyes for the first time to the Mafia, as the witness broke “omertà” — the code of silence — to speak in public about “this thing of ours,” Cosa Nostra. He explained just how “organized” organized crime actually was — with soldiers, capos, godfathers and even the “Commission,” the governing body of the various Mafia families.Fighting the Mafia posed a uniquely hard challenge for investigators. Mafia families were involved in numerous distinct crimes and schemes, over yearslong periods, all for the clear benefit of its leadership, but those very leaders were tough to prosecute because they were rarely involved in the day-to-day crime. They spoke in their own code, rarely directly ordering a lieutenant to do something illegal, but instead offering oblique instructions or expressing general wishes that their lieutenants simply knew how to translate into action.Those explosive — and arresting — hearings led to the 1970 passage of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, better known as RICO, a law designed to allow prosecutors to go after enterprises that engaged in extended, organized criminality. RICO laid out certain “predicate” crimes — those that prosecutors could use to stitch together evidence of a corrupt organization and then go after everyone involved in the organization as part of an organized conspiracy. While the headline-grabbing RICO “predicates” were violent crimes like murder, kidnapping, arson and robbery, the statute also focused on crimes like fraud, obstruction of justice, money laundering and even aiding or abetting illegal immigration.It took prosecutors a while to figure out how to use RICO effectively, but by the mid-1980s, federal investigators in the Southern District of New York were hitting their stride under none other than the crusading United States attorney Rudy Giuliani, who as the head of the Southern District brought charges in 1985 against the heads of the city’s five dominant Mafia families.Ever since, S.D.N.Y. prosecutors and F.B.I. agents have been the nation’s gold standard in RICO prosecutions — a fact that makes clear precisely why, after Mr. Cohen’s testimony, President Trump’s greatest legal jeopardy may not be in the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller.What lawmakers heard Wednesday sounded a lot like a racketeering enterprise: an organization with a few key players and numerous overlapping crimes — not just one conspiracy, but many. Even leaving aside any questions about the Mueller investigation and the 2016 campaign, Mr. Cohen leveled allegations that sounded like bank fraud, charity fraud and tax fraud, as well as hints of insurance fraud, obstruction of justice and suborning perjury. The parallels between the Mafia and the Trump Organization are more than we might like to admit: After all, Mr. Cohen was labeled a “rat” by President Trump last year for agreeing to cooperate with investigators; interestingly, in the language of crime, “rats” generally aren’t seen as liars. They’re “rats” precisely because they turn state’s evidence and tell the truth, spilling the secrets of a criminal organization.Mr. Cohen was clear about the rot at the center of his former employer: “Everybody’s job at the Trump Organization is to protect Mr. Trump. Every day most of us knew we were coming and we were going to lie for him about something. That became the norm.”RICO was precisely designed to catch the godfathers and bosses at the top of these crime syndicates — people a step or two removed from the actual crimes committed, those whose will is made real, even without a direct order.Exactly, it appears, as Mr. Trump did at the top of his family business: “Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That’s not how he operates,” Mr. Cohen said. Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen said, “doesn’t give orders. He speaks in code. And I understand that code.”What’s notable about Mr. Cohen’s comments is how they paint a consistent (and credible) pattern of Mr. Trump’s behavior: The former F.B.I. director James Comey, in testimony nearly two years ago in the wake of his firing, made almost exactly the same point and used almost exactly the same language. Mr. Trump never directly ordered him to drop the Flynn investigation, Mr. Comey said, but he made it all too clear what he wanted — the president isolated Mr. Comey, with no other ears around, and then said he hoped Mr. Comey “can let this go.” As Mr. Comey said, “I took it as, this is what he wants me to do.” He cited in his testimony then the famous example of King Henry II’s saying, “Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?,” a question that resulted in the murder of that very meddlesome priest, Thomas Becket.The sheer number and breadth of the investigations into Mr. Trump’s orbit these days indicates how vulnerable the president’s family business would be to just this type of prosecution. In December, I counted 17, and since then, investigators have started an inquiry into undocumented workers at Mr. Trump’s New Jersey golf course, another crime that could be a RICO predicate; Mr. Cohen’s public testimony itself, where he certainly laid out enough evidence and bread crumbs for prosecutors to verify his allegations, mentioned enough criminal activity to build a racketeering case. Moreover, RICO allows prosecutors to wrap 10 years of racketeering activity into a single set of charges, which is to say, almost precisely the length of time — a decade — that Michael Cohen would have unparalleled insight into Mr. Trump’s operations. Similarly, many Mafia cases end up being built on wiretaps — just like, for instance, the perhaps 100 recordings Mr. Cohen says he made of people during his tenure working for Mr. Trump, recordings that federal investigators are surely poring over as part of the 290,000 documents and files they seized in their April raid last year.Indicting the whole Trump Organization as a “corrupt enterprise” could also help prosecutors address the thorny question of whether the president can be indicted in office; they could lay out a whole pattern of criminal activity, indict numerous players — including perhaps Trump family members — and leave the president himself as a named, unindicted co-conspirator. Such an action would allow investigators to make public all the known activity for Congress and the public to consider as part of impeachment hearings or re-election. It would also activate powerful forfeiture tools for prosecutors that could allow them to seize the Trump Organization’s assets and cut off its income streams.The irony will be that if federal prosecutors decide to move against President Trump’s empire and family together, he’ll have one man’s model to thank: his own TV lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who perfected the template to tackle precisely that type of criminal enterprise."
194,"Look at the numbers, and something of a mystery emerges regarding the Trump administration’s claims of a surge of uncontrolled arrivals.Net migration across the southern border is at historic lows. Border apprehensions of unauthorized arrivals were at the lowest in modern record in 2017 and 2018. Apprehensions are up this spring, but still far below the highs of the 1980s, 1990s or early 2000s.Yet processing centers and detention centers are filling, some to near-capacity, straining to meet even basic medical needs of migrant families. Images from the border show women and children huddling in overcrowded facilities.The answer, immigration experts say, is that the crisis isn’t primarily caused by the number of arrivals, but by Trump administration policies that disperse them to a handful of centers and that treat families who voluntarily surrender as invaders — creating the appearance of an invasion.Far from being unique to the Trump administration, it is merely the latest in a pattern across Western democracies, where anti-immigration sentiment is driving demand for harsh policies that may not only fail to reduce arrivals, but to also make the problem look even more uncontrolled and overwhelming.The causes of that self-reinforcing cycle may run far deeper than policy mismatch or even matters of immigration.Economic dislocation and demographic change have provoked feelings of lost control and lost status among some whites, however real or imagined. It is a combination of forces, research suggests, that taps into deep-seated instincts to seek safety in a familiar group identity — and to try to reimpose control.Those feelings tend to focus on borders, even if undocumented immigration is not actually up. And policies that deliver on desires for a strict response can make the problem appear worse, deepening fears of chaos and of being overwhelmed.This feedback loop, building in the United States and Europe since long before the latest upticks in arrivals, may be a major driver of the populist revolt. And it is playing into the growing global conflict between old-style national identities, imagined as homogeneous and fixed, and a world that no longer aligns with them.“Migration is really tough because, as Catherine Dauvergne said, it’s the last bastion of sovereignty,” said Jaya Ramji-Nogales, an immigration scholar at Temple University’s law school. “At points in history where the demographic shift is changing, that’s an easy thing for people to be scared of.”Some 30 years ago, the United States constructed a wall on its southern border between the San Ysidro crossing, which links San Diego with Tijuana, and the Pacific Ocean.This had an unintended effect: It funneled some migrants onto Interstate 5, which cut through the barriers. When a handful were hit by cars, transit authorities posted now-infamous yellow signs showing a silhouette of a dashing family — widely known as “immigrant crossing” signs.“That gave the impression of utter chaos at the border,” said Douglas S. Massey, a Princeton University immigration scholar. “But nothing had really changed — we were just hardening the border and pushing people into different places.”The signs fed into a nationwide backlash against unauthorized immigration, Mr. Massey said, leading the Clinton administration to fund more border walls and nearly double border patrol agents.But rather than reducing arrivals, this pushed them into desolate routes across the Arizona deserts. Crossing sparse ranch lands rather than dense cities, the migrant flows came to look far more numerous, Mr. Massey said, which made “a big impression and fed the narrative that there was this new invasion.”Now, that cycle may be playing out again.Policies meant to deter arrivals are putting them into a handful of centers, concentrating numbers in a way that makes them appear overwhelming. The policies have also put asylum claimants and families, who take some time to process, into facilities designed to house unauthorized migrant workers who can be deported quickly.At the same time, the increase may appear larger than it actually is because a greater share of arrivals are voluntarily surrendering, hoping to apply for asylum. This is a right guaranteed under international law, but administration policy functionally treats them like undocumented immigrants, and even criminals. That feeds perceptions of a surge and creates the overcrowded conditions at detention centers.“The numbers aren’t that big, but if you’re treating families as criminals and arresting them, holding them, the system can’t handle that,” said Mr. Massey, the Princeton scholar. “It makes it look like there’s absolute chaos at the border, but the chaos is because we don’t have policies that fit the problem.”A similar cycle has played out in Europe and Australia. Tightened European Union land borders, for example, led more refugees to travel by boats. When they sank, as many did, the horrifying episodes deepened Europeans’ sense of chaos.The surge of arrivals to Europe in 2015 and 2016 was an undeniable crisis, but it also hit on much deeper issues. That may help explain why it also fed into fears around immigration in the United States.Psychological research suggests that fears about uncontrolled borders may be tied to deeper fears about loss of identity or loss of control.Human beings desire the sense of safety they get from a strong, familiar group identity. Though white people in Western countries remain politically and culturally dominant, rising diversity has left some feeling that their status is under threat.This is perhaps why heavily white areas where children are likely to be less well-off than their parents had been are especially likely to support Mr. Trump, according to a Gallup study.Fear that one’s in-group will decline in relative power, whatever the cause, can make people feel a sense of loss of control, leading them to cling more firmly to their ethnicity and to see outsiders as a threat. It also tends to make people more nationalistic and more skeptical of immigration, according to a recent study of voters in the United States, Britain and Poland, which found that this fear predicted support for Brexit and for Mr. Trump.The border, as perhaps the most obvious symbol of national identity and territorial protection, is a natural focal point for those fears. And so to many people, it feels true that there is a wave of uncontrolled immigrants and chaos at the border — even if arrivals are low in historic terms and many of the migrants are simply families seeking asylum.It may also feel urgently necessary to reimpose order.But stricter border policies tend to attract more attention and controversy, and can end up making immigration fears seem even more salient. As the news shows desperate people huddled in makeshift camps, creating the impression of a swamped border, the cycle repeats.These sentiments align near-perfectly with the drivers of right-wing populism: a sense of lost control, a desire to reassert order and a narrowing national identity. And that populist sentiment can feed back into itself.Global immigration flows are expected to increase over the long term due to climate change, deepening economic disparities and technology-assisted ease of travel. Demographic trends, though easily overstated, are already making Western countries more diverse.A populist sentiment that calls for resisting this long-underway change is likely to only heighten awareness of it, much like the strict border policies that tend to worsen the appearance of disorder.The resulting policies can have the opposite of their intended effect.When the Clinton administration stepped up deportations, it relocated American-born gangs like MS-13 to Central America, where they flourished in an environment of poverty and state weakness. Today, many Central American families are fleeing that gang violence for the United States. In response, Mr. Trump has cut aid to three countries most threatened by gang violence.These policies can bring significant harm to the migrants and refugees that they target.“When you have women and children behind fences under a bridge, that’s bad optics,” Mr. Massey said, referring to makeshift migrant detention practices in Texas that left children sleeping on gravel and under mylar blankets. “It’s causing a lot of human damage.”"
195,"LAS VEGAS — President Trump on Saturday again declared that the United States was “full” and called its asylum system “a scam,” tying his push to close the country’s borders to undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers to an entreaty for Jewish voters to support his re-election campaign.“Our system’s full; our country’s full,” Mr. Trump said, speaking to an audience that included descendants of Holocaust survivors, Jews in red skullcaps emblazoned with “Trump” in white thread and people carrying Israeli flags. “You can’t come in. Our country is full. What can we do? We can’t handle any more. Our country’s full. You can’t come in, I’m sorry.”He was met with raucous applause and cheers at the Republican Jewish Coalition’s annual leadership meeting in Las Vegas, underscoring how many conservative Jewish voters, alarmed by rising threats of anti-Semitism and energized by his pro-Israel policies, have embraced a president with a history of trafficking in anti-Semitic tropes — including remarks that he has made before the coalition.Fresh from a visit on Friday to a California border town, the president doubled down on his attacks on migrants seeking asylum at the border. The administration has recently toughened its policy for accepting asylum seekers, with stories of fleeing violence and corruption no longer meeting the standard for entry.“The asylum program is a scam,” he said, describing people “who look like they should be fighting for the U.F.C.,” with large muscles and face tattoos. “Some of the roughest people you’ve ever seen.”Mr. Trump has sought to paint himself as a chief supporter of Israel, trumpeting the fulfillment of his promise to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem and his decision to recognize Israel’s authority over the long-contested Golan Heights. Vice President Mike Pence, in a speech later Saturday, called the president “the greatest friend of the Jewish people ever to sit in the Oval Office.”Like the lawmakers who spoke before him — Representative Lee Zeldin of New York, one of two Republican Jewish representatives, and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader — the president framed Democrats as unwilling to combat anti-Semitism.“Republicans believe that we must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism,” Mr. Trump said. He brought the crowd to its feet by introducing Timothy Matson, a police officer wounded during the shooting in October at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.In condemning anti-Semitism, all three men singled out Representative Ilhan Omar, the freshman Democrat from Minnesota and one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, who for weeks has fended off accusations of anti-Semitism over comments critical of Israel.“Special thanks to Representative Omar of Minnesota,” Mr. Trump said, expressing gratitude to other attendees, including Sheldon G. Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate and prominent Republican donor, and his wife, Miriam. “Oh, I forgot, she doesn’t like Israel. I’m so sorry.”(Ms. Omar herself was recently the target of death threats. This week, federal agents arrested a New York resident, Patrick W. Carlineo Jr., after he reportedly called her office, described her as “a terrorist” and promised, in an expletive-laden threat, to “put a bullet in her skull.”)Ms. Omar later responded on Twitter by quoting a prayer of forgiveness: “My Lord, forgive my people for they do not know.”Mr. Trump also appeared to blur the lines between the American Jews in the audience and Israelis, referring at one point to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel as “your prime minister” and warning that congressional Democrats “could leave Israel out there all by yourselves.”At one point, he asked the crowd, “How the hell did you support President Obama? How the hell did you support the Democrats?” Reminded by the audience that members of the Republican Jewish Coalition did not, in fact, support Mr. Obama, he laughed before conceding: “You guys didn’t. That’s right.”A few protesters were escorted from the arena early on in the speech, chanting “Jews are here to say: Occupation is a plague,” according to IfNotNow, a Jewish organization that issued a statement afterward. Logan Bayroff, a spokesman for J Street, the liberal Jewish organization, said the president’s remarks about immigrants and minorities were “extremely discordant and extremely disgusting to the majority of Jewish people.”But the crowd of supporters in the ballroom at the Venetian hotel and casino were enthusiastic as the president delivered a cornucopia of boasts, complaints and exaggerations typical of his campaign rallies: efforts to overhaul trade deals with Mexico and China, and his pledge to build a border wall. Cheers of “four more years” rang out after Mr. Trump left.The president’s claims about the country’s capacity to support more immigrants echoed an argument he made on Friday during his visit to a border town in California, backing down from a threat to close the legal ports of entry between the United States and Mexico.Allies of the president have argued that he is right to push to overhaul the process, with the surge of families turning themselves in to Border Patrol agents at the ports of entry or in between them.“What you see happening here is an abuse of asylum laws,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a close ally of the president’s, said in a brief interview after Mr. Trump’s speech. “If asylum is going to be that everybody who is economically impoverished can come to America, there will be no way we can handle the flow.”“Bottom line is,” he added, “we accept refugees.”"
196,"So Donald Trump is a champion of women. Who knew?He’d been hiding that facet of himself diabolically well all these years, as he grabbed them by parts of their bodies that newspapers try not to mention and showed them special derision on Twitter, comparing Stormy Daniels to a horse and Omarosa Manigault to a dog. A shallow, casual observer might rush to judgment and conclude that he didn’t fully respect the opposite sex.But his remarks and bearing during his State of the Union address on Tuesday night surely corrected that impression.He beamed at the rows of women in white, female House members who were seated together and dressed in a single hue to make a statement about their progress and their strength.It was to them that he targeted his assertion that “no one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year.”He then addressed them even more directly: “Exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before.”Indeed we do. There are 102 in the House. But here’s the thing: That group includes 89 Democrats and just 13 Republicans. History was made courtesy of the party that he worked hard in the midterms to defeat, that he works hard all the time to diminish and that he repeatedly trolled in the rest of his remarks on Tuesday night. If he’d had his way and sway, those rows of white would have been sparser. But he neither exhibited any awareness of that nor made any resolution to improve his party’s stubbornly miserable record of recruiting and promoting female candidates.Instead he basked in the women’s — and the Democratic Party’s — accomplishment as if it were his own. “That’s great,” he told them. “Really great. And congratulations.”It’s nice to be Trump. His bragging is unencumbered by his past. His self-satisfaction crowds out any self-examination. What he needs isn’t a fact check. It’s a reality check, because his worst fictions aren’t statistical. They’re spiritual.He pretends to care about matters that don’t move him in the least. He feigns blamelessness in situations where he’s entirely culpable and takes credit in circumstances where he has more to apologize for. He presents himself in a positive light, as one kind of person, when his actions paint him in a negative light, as a different character altogether. Many of his biggest lies are to himself.The State of the Union address was a herky-jerky testament to that. I say herky-jerky because it was six or eight or maybe 10 speeches in one, caroming without warning from a plea for unity to a tirade about the border; from some boast about American glory under Trump to some reverie about American glory before Trump (yes, it existed!); from a hurried legislative wish list to a final stretch of ersatz poetry that read like lines from a batch of defective or remaindered Hallmark cards. As much as Trump needed modesty, his paragraphs needed transitions.But there was a leitmotif running through the disparate patches, and it was Trump’s readiness to reassemble recent history and reinvent himself.If you didn’t know that he was a champion of women, then you probably also didn’t know that he saved us from war with North Korea. He alone can fix it! And according to him, he did fix it, or is fixing it, never mind what his intelligence chiefs told the Senate Intelligence Committee just last week. They had doubts about his supposed success on that front. He doesn’t. So he’ll cling to his version. It’s the one that flatters him.On Tuesday night Trump suddenly cared about diversity and minorities, and abandoned much of the divisive lexicon that he had used over the first two years of his presidency, most memorably when he attached a fecal epithet to countries with largely black populations.On Tuesday night he ached for Americans with H.I.V. or AIDS. I can’t recall them being on his radar much before, but I do recall that he or other members of his administration worked to expel transgender people from the military, appoint homophobic judges and argue against civil rights protections for L.G.B.T. Americans.On Tuesday night he excoriated wealthy Americans who benefit from undocumented immigrants even as those immigrants (supposedly) diminish less wealthy Americans. He made no acknowledgment of his own use of undocumented immigrants at the Trump golf resort in Bedminster, N.J. Two of them, in fact, were invited by Democrats to the speech.On Tuesday night he said that we Americans “must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism or those who spread its venomous creed.” And he himself has not ignored those who spread it; rather, he has defended and encouraged them — by accepting their support during his campaign, by re-tweeting them, by insisting that some of the white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville, Va., and railed against Jews were good people.On Tuesday night he called for comity. He yearned for bipartisanship, at least when he wasn’t modeling the opposite. “We must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution,” he said, and it was like an alliterative butcher declaring that we must reject red beef. He urged that we “rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors.” Might he try out some of that rekindling on his Twitter account, which, even in the hours before his speech, was a font less of love than of spite? President, heal thyself.But most incongruous of all was his feminism, closeted until Tuesday night. He framed his concerns about illegal immigration in terms of migrant women being sexually assaulted on the way north to our border with Mexico or sold into prostitution by traffickers.And then there was the shout-out to women in the workforce. During it, female House members stood, and some pumped their fists in the air. He registered surprise at first, followed by satisfaction, as he seemed to realize that their moment could also be his moment; that he could, for this one instant, hallucinate mutual respect and pantomime common cause; that he could just slough off all his sins and latch on to a spurious grace.“Don’t sit yet,” he told them when he feared that they would end their celebration too soon, before his next great pronouncement. “You’re going to like this.”Even the newly, briefly, falsely sensitive version of Trump couldn’t lose his bossy streak — or stop hungering for, and predicting, the next round of applause."
197,"WASHINGTON — Faced with limited options and a looming deadline to prevent another government shutdown, President Trump is moving toward accepting a border security deal that would fall well short of his once firm demand for $5.7 billion in funds for a wall along the southwestern border.House and Senate conferees were nearing an agreement that could offer the president $1.3 billion to about $2 billion in funding for border security. That funding, still subject to change, could include money for some physical barriers, such as “bollard fencing,” and result in a deal as early as Monday.“We’re 95 to 98 percent done,” said Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.Mr. Trump has told allies that he would grudgingly accept a border security figure of about $2 billion, but House Democrats remain publicly opposed to spending that much on physical barriers. It is still not clear how much of the final allocation would go toward new fencing, according to three people briefed on the negotiations.“Throughout the talks, Democrats have insisted that a border security compromise not be overly reliant on physical barriers,” said Evan Hollander, the communications director for the House Appropriations Committee. “We will not agree to $2 billion in funding for barriers.”The effort to find a funding compromise is an end game of sorts for high-stakes negotiations between House Democrats and Republicans hoping to avoid another government shutdown. The longest one in American history, which stretched from December through most of January, left the president’s approval ratings at new lows and exhausted lawmakers.The final package is likely to include multiple spending bills, including one for the Department of Homeland Security that has border security funding as well as six others that would keep the government operating, and disaster relief to help communities recover from last year’s natural disasters, according to an appropriations aide.But the final agreement still has wrinkles to iron out.While Democrats want to keep funding for border barriers as low as possible, members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, which had earlier pushed Mr. Trump to take an uncompromising line on wall funding, met with him on Thursday and indicated that any number even slightly above $2 billion would satisfy them, for now.Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, told party colleagues at a lunch and in private conversations over the past few days that the president had told him, “I can live with $2 billion,” according to a Senate aide who witnessed one of the exchanges. A spokesman for Mr. Lee, Conn Carroll, said the remarks were misinterpreted, and the senator was speculating about steps that could be taken to persuade the president to move below his $5.7 billion demand.Beyond that, negotiators remain far apart on the number of beds for families detained at the border with Mexico. There currently are enough funds allocated for 40,520 detention beds, under the control of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Democrats asked to limit the number of beds to 35,520 for the remainder of the fiscal year, and to increase funds for alternatives to the practice of family detention. Republicans want substantially more beds.Disputes like that were part of why Democratic aides on Friday played down the likelihood of a quick deal. The Democrats’ last official offer on funding for barriers was a little more than $500 million — although privately they acknowledge they are likely to go higher.Regardless of where the talks land, the funding under discussion is another significant compromise for Mr. Trump as he struggles to fulfill his campaign promise that he would build a wall at the southwestern border. In December, he publicly dismissed a proposal for $2.5 billion as insufficient, undercutting Vice President Mike Pence, who had floated the prospect by Democrats.Mr. Leahy, a member of the bipartisan House-Senate committee negotiating the deal, declined to elaborate on any details, citing the need to keep the continuing talks private.He said that he, along with staff and other members of the 17-member committee, planned to stay in Washington this weekend to negotiate the final details and prepare to sign off on it on Monday. Because of procedural rules in the House, it is seen as the last possible day for lawmakers to unveil a deal that would prevent a government shutdown before the Feb. 15 deadline.Over the past several days, negotiators have begun discussing the potential placement of new barriers — some of it likely to be bollard fencing, made of sturdy, steel slats — in specific locations on the border that have seen significant increases in illegal crossings, according to two Republican aides.“The walls we saw were really heavy fences,” said Representative Kay Granger of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, describing a trip to the border she took this week. She told reporters that after speaking with Border Patrol agents, she would support bollard fencing on sections of the border.In an interview, Ms. Granger expressed optimism that bollard fencing would satisfy the president because he has described its spaced, steel slates in the past — including in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday.“There’s no one that said we should put a solid wall across our southern border,” she said.And Ms. Granger said she was heartened by Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s assurance that she would support any bipartisan compromise that emerges from the negotiating committee.“It didn’t change anything,” she said, chuckling. “We all just started breathing better.”The president’s supporters, however, present a different challenge.“I don’t know,” Ms. Granger said when asked how best to convince Mr. Trump’s base that an emerging deal would be acceptable.On Thursday, Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Chairman, told fellow Republicans that a one-on-one meeting with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office this week left him optimistic.“I think we are going to get a deal,” Mr. Shelby said, according to one of the attendees.Democratic lawmakers are bracing themselves for some opposition from the party’s most liberal flank over funding for ICE and other enforcement agencies.The presence of Representatives Lucille Roybal-Allard of California, a member of the Progressive Caucus, and Henry Cuellar of Texas, a moderate member of the Hispanic Caucus from a border district, among others on the committee, provided some reassurance to Democrats.But on Thursday, a handful of freshman Democrats held an emotional news conference foreshadowing their resistance to any deal that does not reduce funding for ICE, immigrant detention and other components of enforcement at the border.“Budgets really are a statement — a statement of our moral values,” said Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, her voice cracking as she recalled her own experience as a refugee. “We cannot have a budget that doesn’t uphold our values.”"
198,"ALGONA, Iowa — For nearly two decades, Representative Steve King pummeled Republican primary challengers, dispatched Democrats, even a former Iowa governor’s wife, and glided to victory in his conservative district. He spent little energy on fund-raising, put few controls on his racist language and made little effort to hold town halls with constituents.Then in November he was re-elected by just 10,000 votes in what he called “the nastiest, most dishonest political gauntlet that any Iowan has been put through”; two months later he was stripped of his committee assignments and rebuked by the House for comments that seemed to endorse white supremacy. Now the nine-term Iowa Republican is under attack from both the left and the right.Far from folding, though, Mr. King is returning to basics, reasserting an aggressive presence in his northwestern Iowa district, scheduling events in every county and holding as many as three town halls in a week, where constituents pack in, then linger to take photos and shake hands.“This is a really important part of our civic activity,” Mr. King told constituents crowded into a room in a library here in Algona, a northern town of about 5,000. “We have always done so, we just haven’t always told you that.”The winds have shifted, even Republicans concede.“Things are different than they’ve been before,” said Craig Robinson, a former political director of the Republican Party of Iowa. “Steve King can only be so good for so long. A lot of eyes were opened when they saw just how close he came to losing that seat in the last election cycle.”Hoping to win over prominent conservatives tired of putting out Mr. King’s fires, three Republicans — widely considered the most serious challengers Mr. King has faced in years — have already pledged to run in the 2020 primary race, including an assistant majority leader of the Iowa State Senate, Randy Feenstra, who represents one of the most conservative swaths of the district.The campaign arm of the House Democrats has also put a target on his back, and the state Democratic Party has deployed an organizer to set up a ground game for next year, the earliest Democrats have ever begun such efforts in a district that backed President Trump by nearly 30 percentage points.“We see him being held accountable. We really put a spotlight on something that was overlooked for a very long time,” said J. D. Scholten, the Democrat who lost to Mr. King in November. “You’re seeing his reaction to things where he hasn’t been held in check for years.”Regardless of scrutiny, Steve King will be Steve King. Last week, he declined to answer a question at a town hall here asking whether a “white society is superior to a nonwhite society” because the query was “so hypothetical.” At another town hall last week, he complained that Hurricane Katrina victims, who were mostly black, asked for help for only themselves, not their neighbors, while “Iowans take care of each other.”The Cedar Rapids Gazette issued a scathing editorial accusing Mr. King of choosing to “embarrass Iowans with inflammatory rhetoric.”For many western Iowans, that’s part of his appeal.“He’s a straight talker,” said Art Cullen, the Pulitzer Prize-winning editor of Mr. King’s hometown newspaper, The Storm Lake Times. “He ain’t afraid of the man. He ain’t afraid of the system. That’s powerful.”The system is clearly against him. House Republican leaders removed Mr. King from his committee assignments in January, after comments he made to The New York Times questioning why “white supremacist” was considered offensive. A number of powerful party leaders, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 House Republican, suggested he should resign, and the House overwhelmingly passed a resolution disapproving of Mr. King’s statements.Even before then, in October, the head of the House Republican campaign arm at the time, Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, all but jettisoned Mr. King just a week before his election, declaring, “We must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms.”Mr. King has long made remarks denigrating immigrants, and they were long overlooked. Republican presidential candidates genuflected toward him as a kingmaker before the critical Iowa caucuses. Republican House leaders ducked and dodged rather than answer for Mr. King as he enmeshed himself in one scandal after another: retweeting a Nazi sympathizer, saying young unauthorized immigrants have “calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert,” displaying a Confederate flag and adopting white nationalist language such as “we can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.”But his close race in November signaled to members of his own party that voters’ patience may be wearing thin. Mr. Feenstra announced his primary challenge a day before Mr. King’s incendiary comments on white supremacy were published, then raised $100,000 in the next 10 days, according to The Des Moines Register.“Today, Iowa’s Fourth District doesn’t have a voice in Washington because our current representative’s caustic nature has left us without a seat at the table,” Mr. Feenstra said in January.Mr. King’s younger son and spokesman, Jeff King, was quick to fire back, telling The Register that Mr. Feenstra’s challenge amounted to “misguided political opportunism, fueled by establishment puppeteers” and “the lies of the left.”Republican strategists say the conservative tilt of Mr. King’s district and his entrenched presence will make for an uphill battle even for conservative challengers like Mr. Feenstra. But in a presidential year, when a wide-open Democratic field and antipathy toward Mr. Trump will energize liberals, Republicans should be worried.“There will be a lot of Republican activists who will defend him until the very end,” Mr. Robinson said. “But I think when we get closer to Primary Day, people’s opinion might change, because he barely held on last time, and I think it would be concerning, especially in a presidential year, that Republicans could lose this seat, which would be unfathomable.”Before 2018, the last scare Mr. King faced was in 2012, when Democrats pumped resources behind their challenger, the former Iowa first lady Christie Vilsack. She mustered less than 45 percent of the vote.This time Democrats face something of a conundrum.Mr. Scholten, a 39-year-old former minor league baseball player, must decide whether to run again for the House or shoot higher. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, flew him to Washington to discuss challenging Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, according to Democrats familiar with the meeting.“The dilemma I’m having right now is that Democrats won the House, and so in order for us to pass some of these things, we need to have at least one senator from the state of Iowa be a Democrat,” Mr. Scholten said. “It’s difficult because King is the most vulnerable he has ever been, but do we advance the things that I’m fighting for if I go back to the House seat?”The decision may not be all Mr. Scholten’s to make. Mr. Schumer and his staff have also made overtures to State Senator Liz Mathis and freshman Representative Cindy Axne — and it is also unclear whether another breakout Democratic candidate exists in the Fourth Congressional District.Mr. King’s supporters say he has been unfairly treated by the national news media, and they praise him as a steadfast ally of agriculture and an anti-abortion crusader. Confronted with the question about white societies at the town hall meeting, Mr. King demurred. But his rambling anger ended with a proclamation of his belief that life begins at conception — and left his questioner agreeing with him.“Ask anyone who talked to him: Didn’t you think he was kind of like your crazy uncle?” Mr. Cullen said. “Didn’t you kind of like the guy when he was talking about white supremacy?”Many will answer yes."
199,"Americans are frustrated by the inaction of their federal government on comprehensive immigration reform and border security. So are we. We both represent districts on Long Island, and we have both worked on immigration-related issues for over 25 years — one of us, Representative Suozzi, from the perspective of immigrant’s rights as a mayor, as a county executive and now as a member of Congress; the other, Representative King, from the perspective of border security as a former county comptroller, and now as a congressman and former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.We come at this from different points of view and different parties, but with a shared commitment to finding a solution to our country’s border-security issues. Together, we have found common ground to address the problems faced by undocumented immigration and the need for robust border security.For more than 30 years, our government has failed to solve these problems. This year, the American people endured the longest government shutdown in American history when lawmakers and the president failed to reach a spending deal that centered around border security and immigration along the United States and Mexican border.The national emergency regarding immigration reform, however, is not on the border, but in the nation’s capital. We must work together — across party lines — to address these matters in a way that receives bipartisan, bicameral support, and gives the president legislation he feels he can sign.On Long Island, we have one of the 10 largest populations of undocumented immigrants from Central and South America, as well as countless unaccompanied minors. Many have been in our communities for decades living productive lives, attending school with our children, working six days a week and going to church on Sunday.It is our duty, as elected officials, to provide solutions to the problems, not sound bites to the press. That is why we are proposing a realistic set of reforms that would offer legal protection for five million undocumented people and, alongside it, enough funding to make our border secure.First, our plan would create a path to citizenship for approximately 1.9 million immigrants brought by their parents, without documentation, when they were 18 or under, the so-called Dreamers. To be eligible, they must have graduated from high school; have no record of criminal activity; and be either in the military, working full time for at least three years or attending college.We would extend similar coverage to the 400,000 people who were invited to America and given temporary protective status after facing natural disasters, violence and extreme poverty in their home countries.Finally, relatives of Dreamers, of T.P.S. recipients and of others who are undocumented — approximately 2.7 million more people — would be eligible for three years of protective status, renewable indefinitely, if they have been in the United States for a significant number of years and have no record of criminal activity.Taken together, this represents five million people. Next, to qualify for protection, an undocumented person would be required to pay a $2,000 fee. If each of the five million paid that amount, our plan would generate $10 billion.Some of that money, in turn, would be used to cover the administrative costs of this new program; we figure those costs would be $1.4 billion.The remaining $8.6 billion would be split evenly: $4.3 billion would pay for additional physical structures along the United States-Mexico border, as proposed by the Department of Homeland Security, and $4.3 billion would go to aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to help prevent further out-migration from those countries, as well as to radar technology, improved ports of entry, immigration judges, border patrol personnel and humanitarian assistance along the border, as recommended by the Department Homeland Security.For far too long, many people living in our country have been living in fear, and many others have grown frustrated by the inaction of our elected officials. The undocumented have lived in the shadows, facing the daily anxiety of potential deportation, even as they try to participate in our American communities. As legislators, we know what we have to do: We must stand together and pass legislation that will help secure our borders while giving undocumented immigrants a path to permanent residency without the fear that at any moment they may be deported."

201,"ANTELOPE WELLS, N.M. — The Border Patrol’s tiny base in the southwest corner of New Mexico is so remote that the wind howls through the surrounding basin where mountain lions still stalk their prey.But that hasn’t stopped thousands of Central Americans from journeying in recent weeks to the rural outpost and other isolated points along the Southwest border, launching increasingly desperate bids for asylum in the United States.In a two-day span in January, 362 migrants surrendered to the Border Patrol in Antelope Wells, overwhelming the small base’s capacity to process asylum requests. Last week, a new group of 306 migrants arrived at the same location, including children in need of immediate medical care — a situation officials in New Mexico say is without precedent.Prompting these trips to ever-more-remote border locations are not only the nearly 700 miles of border wall and fencing built since 2006, but the Trump administration’s increasingly rigid immigration policies aimed at deterring the flow of migrant families, mostly from Central America, that have streamed in from Mexico since 2014.Over the past year, the government has limited the number of asylum seekers who are allowed to present their cases each day at certain ports of entry, stationed agents on bridges to turn asylum seekers away and launched tear gas at migrants attempting to cross the border near San Diego.The administration went even further last week, announcing that it would start requiring some asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their applications are processed, which can take years. Officials plan to implement the new policy at the San Ysidro border crossing near San Diego before expanding it to crossings in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.Taken together, these moves effectively have forced some Central American migrants to wait for months to apply for asylum, sometimes sleeping on the street or in crowded shelters in Mexican border cities.Frustrated and increasingly desperate, thousands of families have lately been opting to pay smugglers to take them to remote border stations where they can surrender quickly to American officials and hope to be allowed to remain in the United States while their asylum claims are processed.In December, which saw a record number of families arriving at the border, 27,518 migrants traveling in families were apprehended in areas outside normal border stations. The El Paso sector, which includes the suddenly busy area of rural New Mexico, saw a 1,866 percent increase in family apprehensions during October and November of 2018, compared with the same period a year earlier.Pushing migrants toward remote desert locations puts them at higher risk of dehydration, heatstroke or hypothermia. Most are choosing the more dangerous crossing routes because they have been foreclosed from seeking asylum at the more widely traveled border crossings, said Fernando Garcia, director of the Border Network for Human Rights in El Paso. “How else to explain the desperation of thousands of people making it to the middle of nowhere just so they can surrender to Border Patrol?”Trump administration officials have argued that the new policies are an attempt to discourage migrants from even attempting the dangerous trips through Mexico where they are especially vulnerable to extortion and human trafficking. Officials contend that existing legislation encourages parents to bring children along on the journey.Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, laid blame on the federal government having to comply with the Flores agreement, a 1997 legal settlement aimed at preventing lengthy detentions of migrant children, and subsequent legislation codifying parts of the settlement into federal law.“We continue to call on Congress to address this humanitarian and security crisis that entices smugglers to bring families across the border,” Ms. Waldman said.Border Patrol officials have put forward various theories about why crossings at remote locations are climbing that have nothing to do with the administration’s policies. Kevin McAleenan, commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said in a conference call with reporters in December that smugglers could be trying to hold down the transit fees they pay to other criminal organizations with sway in northern Mexico by dropping migrants near remote locations like Antelope Wells.In an interview in El Paso, Jose Romero, a supervisory agent in the Border Patrol’s sector that oversees operations in New Mexico, offered another explanation, claiming that Mexican cannabis smugglers were trying to distract agents in the field by flooding remote stations with asylum seekers.“Our adversary is no idiot,” Mr. Romero said, adding that while agents were arresting 247 migrants in Antelope Wells one January day, traffickers were trying to smuggle hundreds of pounds of marijuana across the border in another location. “Now they know where our weak spots are,” he said.The administration has not been unmindful of the hazards of migrants venturing into little-traveled regions. Partly in an attempt to deter such crossings and what government officials describe as “meritless” asylum claims, the administration tried last year to refuse to accept asylum applications from anyone who had not entered the country at a legal border crossing, but that policy was blocked by the courts. And Antelope Wells, though remote, is a legal border crossing.Just how dangerous such crossings are became apparent in December, when Jakelin Caal Maquin, a 7-year-old girl from Guatemala, died in United States custody after she and her father crossed the border in a group of 163 migrants that surrendered to agents at Antelope Wells. Only a few weeks later, an 8-year-old boy from Guatemala, Felipe Gómez Alonzo, died after crossing the border about three miles west of the Paso Del Norte port of entry in El Paso.But the numbers have only continued to grow. Since the start of the 2019 fiscal year, the Border Patrol said, it has found at least 24 groups of 100 or more migrants that had crossed around the Bootheel, the sparsely populated area where New Mexico’s border with Mexico dips southward like a cowboy boot’s heel.At the end of a 45-mile road from the decaying hamlet of Hachita that runs through grazing lands dotted with creosote bushes, the Border Patrol has maintained a small presence at Antelope Wells for decades. A sign says the base is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The population of Antelope Wells, once 2, sometimes soars all the way into the high single digits when more than a handful of agents are deployed here for weeklong assignments.At another remote point to the west in Arizona, the Border Patrol reported that 376 migrants had tunneled through the sandy soil under the border fence near Yuma, earlier this month and then surrendered to agents. The group, which included dozens of children, ranks among the largest groups of families and unaccompanied children ever arrested on the border with Mexico.Immigration activists say the increase in remote crossings is just the latest development in a decades-long effort to push immigration out of urban areas, tracing back at least to Operation Blockade, a Clinton administration initiative in 1993 to curb unauthorized crossings in the city of El Paso. Border fencing erected in Southern California and Arizona in recent years drove some of the biggest migration flows toward the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, where the river marks the border and many migrants are able to cross with a short boat ride.Busy border crossings like the one in McAllen, Tex., now have relatively elaborate infrastructure set up to handle newly arrived families seeking asylum. But no such facilities exist in this stretch of rural New Mexico, raising fears that the recent deaths of the two Guatemalan children won’t be the last.The grim cost of United States immigration policies is hardly new. Law enforcement authorities have found the remains of about 8,000 migrants who have died while crossing the border with Mexico since the 1990s. And while undetected illegal border crossings have fallen sharply over the past decade, hundreds of migrants continue to die making the attempt each year.At least 413 migrants were found dead along the border in 2018, according to a preliminary count by the International Organization for Migration, up from 412 in 2017 and 399 in 2016.“We’re seeing the increase in people crossing out here, and we’re afraid,” said Amanda Adame, 39, a cattle rancher whose family lives in Hachita, about 45 miles north of Antelope Wells. “We’re fearful for the families that are going across and fearful for our own safety.”Still, humanitarian groups say they are waging an uphill battle to save lives along the border. Some cite the conviction in January of four volunteers from the Unitarian Universalist Church in Tucson on charges of abandonment of property after they left caches of food and water in an Arizona wildlife refuge where migrants have died while crossing into the United States.“Asylum seekers shouldn't have to cross in the middle of the desert,” said Justine Orlovsky-Schnitzler, a member of the advocacy group No More Deaths in Tucson. “This is the newest stage of policies that have been sentencing migrants to death for decades.”"
202,"President Trump wants $5.7 billion to build a wall at the southern border of the United States. Nancy Pelosi thinks a wall is “immoral.” The fight over these slats or barriers or bricks shut down the government for more than a month and may do so again if Mr. Trump isn’t satisfied with the way negotiations unfold over the next three weeks.But let’s be clear: This is a disagreement about symbolism, not policy. Liberals object less to aggressive border security than to the wall’s xenophobic imagery, while the administration openly revels in its political incorrectness. And when this particular episode is over, we’ll still have been fighting about the wrong thing. It’s true that immigrants will keep trying to cross into the United States and that global migration will almost certainly increase in the coming years as climate change makes parts of the planet uninhabitable. But technology and globalization are complicating the idea of what a border is and where it stands.Not long from now, it won’t make sense to think of the border as a line, a wall or even any kind of imposing vertical structure. Tearing down, or refusing to fund, border walls won’t get anyone very far in the broader pursuit of global justice. The borders of the future won’t be as easy to spot, build or demolish as the wall that Mr. Trump is proposing. That’s because they aren’t just going up around countries — they’re going up around us. And they’re taking away our freedom.In “The Jungle,” a play about a refugee camp in Calais, France, a Kurdish smuggler named Ali explains that his profession is not responsible for the large numbers of migrants making the dangerous journeys to Europe by sea. “Once, I was the only way a man could ever dream of arriving on your shore,” the smuggler says. But today, migrants can plan out the journeys using their phones. “It is not about this border. It’s the border in here,” Ali says, pointing to his head — “and that is gone, now.”President Trump is obsessed with his border wall because technology has freed us from the walls in our heads.For people with means and passports, it’s easy to plot exotic itineraries in a flash and book flights with just a glance at a screen. Social feeds are an endless stream of old faces in new places: a carefree colleague feeding elephants in Thailand; a smug college classmate on a “babymoon” in Tahiti; that awful ex hanging off a cliff in Switzerland; a friend’s parents enjoying retirement in New Zealand.Likewise, a young person in Sana, Yemen, or Guatemala City might see a sister in Toronto, a neighbor in Phoenix, an aunt in London or a teacher in Berlin, and think that he, too, could start anew. Foreign places are real. Another country is possible.If you zoom out enough in Google Earth, you’ll see the lines between nations begin to disappear. Eventually, you’ll be left staring at a unified blue planet. You might even experience a hint of what astronauts have called the “overview effect”: the sense that we are all on “Spaceship Earth,” together. “From space I saw Earth — indescribably beautiful with the scars of national boundaries gone,” recalled Muhammed Faris, a Syrian astronaut, after his 1987 mission to space. In 2012, Mr. Faris fled war-torn Syria for Turkey.One’s freedom of movement used to be largely determined by one’s citizenship, national origin and finances. That’s still the case — but increasingly, people are being categorized not just by the color of their passports or their ability to pay for tickets but also by where they’ve been and what they’ve said in the past.This is what is happening on that front already:A 2017 executive order barred people from seven countries, including five with Muslim majorities, from entering the country. An older rule put in place during the Obama administration compelled anyone who’d even just visited seven blacklisted nations to obtain additional clearance before traveling to the United States. Even as the Trump administration’s policy has met with legal challenges, it means that the barrier to entering the United States, for many, begins with their data and passport stamps, and is thousands of miles away from this country. The Trump administration would also like to make it harder for immigrants who’ve received public assistance to obtain citizenship or permanent residence by redefining what it means to be a “public charge.” If the administration succeeds, it will have moved the border into immigrants’ living rooms, schools  and hospital beds.The walls of the future go beyond one administration’s policies, though. They are growing up all around us, being built by global technology companies that allow for constant surveillance, data harvesting and the alarming collection of biometric information. In 2017, the United States announced it would be storing the social media profiles of immigrants in their permanent file, ostensibly to prevent Twitter-happy terrorists from slipping in. For years, Customs and Border Protection agents have asked travelers about their social media, too.The Electronic Frontier Foundation has said these practices can “chill and deter the free speech and association of immigrants to the United States, as well as the U.S. persons who communicate with them.” In other words, it’s no longer enough to have been born in the right place, at the right time, to the right parents. The trail of bread crumbs you leave could limit your movements.It’s possible to get a glimpse of where a digital border might lead from China. Look at its continuing experiment with social-credit scoring, where a slip of the tongue or an unpaid debt could one day jeopardize someone’s ability to board a train or apply for a job. When your keystrokes and text messages become embedded in your legal identity, you create a wall around yourself without meaning to.The Berkeley political theorist Wendy Brown diagnoses the tendency to throw up walls as a classic symptom of a nation-state’s looming impotence in the face of globalization — the flashy sports car of what she calls a “waning sovereignty.” In a recent interview for The Nation, Professor Brown told me that walls fulfill a desire for greater sovereign control in times when the concept of “bounded territory itself is in crisis.” They are signifiers of a “loss of a national ‘we’ and national control — all the things we’ve seen erupt in a huge way.” Walls are a response to deep existential anxiety, and even if the walls come down, or fail to be built in brick and stone, the world will guarantee us little in the way of freedom, fairness or equality. It makes more sense to think of modern borders as overlapping and concentric circles that change size, shape and texture depending on who — or what — is trying to pass through.It’s far too easy to imagine a situation where our freedom of movement still depends entirely on what has happened to us in the past and what kind of information we’re willing to give up in return. Consider the expedited screening process of the Global Entry Program for traveling to the United States. It’s a shortcut — reserved for people who can get it — that doesn’t do away with borders. It just makes them easier to cross, and therefore less visible.That serves the modern nation-state very well. Because in the end, what are borders supposed to protect us from? The answer used to be other states, empires or sovereigns. But today, relatively few land borders exist to physically fend off a neighboring power, and countries even cooperate to police the borders they share. Modern borders exist to control something else: the movement of people. They control us.Those are the walls we should be fighting over."
203,"WASHINGTON — Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, was confident in his ability as a good-faith negotiator who could find a compromise to end the government shutdown.His pitch to Democratic lawmakers was simple: He told them he was the person who could “land this plane.”Buoyed by his success in helping pass a criminal justice bill, Mr. Kushner, a senior White House adviser, agreed to take the lead when the president asked him to find a way to end the monthlong stalemate. He hoped his experience winning over Democrats skeptical of the Trump administration during negotiations for that measure would produce a similarly successful conclusion.But negotiating a broad immigration deal that would satisfy a president committed to a border wall as well as Democrats who have cast it as immoral proved to be more like Mr. Kushner’s elusive goal of solving Middle East peace than passing a criminal justice overhaul that already had bipartisan support.For one, Mr. Kushner inaccurately believed that moderate rank-and-file Democrats were open to a compromise and had no issue funding a wall as part of a broader deal.“If Jared Kushner thinks there is any daylight between House Democratic leadership and rank-and-file members on this issue, then the extent that he lands this plane it will land in the Alamo,” said Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York.And Democratic leaders like Senator Chuck Schumer, party officials said, did not believe that Mr. Kushner had the power to circumvent Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser to the president. In meetings, they also noticed, Mr. Kushner appeared to prop up Mr. Miller as an expert on immigration, noting that Mr. Miller’s reputation as a hard-liner was out of sync with his reasonable nature.On Friday, President Trump did what Mr. Kushner had privately insisted was not an option on the table: He folded.Standing in the Rose Garden, Mr. Trump announced he was ending the standoff, during which he had failed to convince Democrats to fund a $5.7 billion border wall, and was reopening the federal government for three weeks.It was a stunning setback for the president and for Mr. Kushner, who had told colleagues that public opinion would move to their side and that Speaker Nancy Pelosi would emerge as the one who looked unreasonable and intransigent.Mr. Kushner had advised the president against declaring a national emergency, which would enable him to get funding for his wall without approval from Congress. Instead, he ultimately pushed Mr. Trump toward the announcement he made on Friday, supporting it as a way to buy more time to reach a deal.Mr. Trump, White House aides said, has been frustrated at everyone around him for not delivering a deal he can accept. And he has become wary of his son-in-law’s advice on this issue, the aides said.This account is based on interviews with more than a dozen congressional officials, White House aides and people involved in the immigration debate.On Capitol Hill, aides said, Mr. Kushner had positioned himself as the person who could sell the president on a compromise, casting himself as a facilitator who did not lobby for details of any proposal but simply wanted to find a solution that both sides could claim as a victory.Mr. Kushner has told Mr. Trump that he should spend the next three weeks trying to achieve a broader immigration package. That challenge has eluded both parties for years, but Mr. Kushner has suggested to colleagues that it is worth trying for, according to West Wing aides.The president appears to have internalized the advice. “21 days goes very quickly,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday morning. “Negotiations with Democrats will start immediately. Will not be easy to make a deal, both parties very dug in. The case for National Security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the Border & through dialogue. We will build the Wall!”But Democrats said they do not believe that Mr. Kushner will have better luck drafting a larger deal in the next few weeks. “Unless he’s able to convince his father-in-law to abandon his obsession with building a medieval border wall, then he’s not going to be successful in finding a bipartisan agreement,” Mr. Jeffries said.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, however, noted that Mr. Kushner was still seen internally as one of the administration’s most successful negotiators, pointing to his involvement with the criminal justice bill as well as the new North American trade deal. “Jared is a key player in the administration and will continue helping the president accomplish his top priorities,” she said in an email.But for now, Mr. Kushner appears to have few allies, occupying what people close to him describe as a no-win position.Mr. Kushner finds himself with little sway over Democrats, who consider the substantial changes that the White House keeps proposing for asylum seekers to be poison pills. And conservatives are not convinced Mr. Kushner is the right person to negotiate a deal. They recognize he has Mr. Trump’s ear, but worry he does not understand the fault lines of the debate or what proposals will anger Mr. Trump’s base. One proposal that was reviewed, which would give green cards to 700,000 undocumented young immigrants, enraged conservatives.Within the White House, several aides said, Mr. Kushner is not interested in opinions that vary from his, and tends to view people who disagree with him as problems, closing them out of discussions. People close to Mr. Kushner, however, speaking on the condition of anonymity, have described him as working well with West Wing colleagues, particularly the legislative affairs director, Shahira Knight, a veteran of Capitol Hill.But even Mr. Kushner’s allies concede that when it comes to immigration, he has not grasped the emotional nature of the fight the way he did when he tackled the criminal justice overhaul, an issue that was personal because of his father’s own incarceration.Mr. Kushner, allies said, sees the $5.7 billion request for border wall money as reasonable, and has compared it to one month of troop deployments in Afghanistan. He views Ms. Pelosi as “trophy hunting,” or trying to take down the president politically with the shutdown.Allies of Mr. Kushner say that not all of his discussions with Democrats have been publicized, and that he has gained trust partly because he keeps his conversations confidential. But on Capitol Hill, many Democrats said discussions on immigration have been scarce.Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, was given no notice about Mr. Trump’s announcement last weekend in which he offered temporary protections for young undocumented immigrants in exchange for wall money, according to a congressional aide. Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, heard from Mr. Kushner only once, when he phoned before the president’s prime-time address from the Oval Office to warn him that the moment would move public opinion to the president’s side. Mr. Jeffries, who worked closely with Mr. Kushner on criminal justice reform, had no conversations about forging a bipartisan immigration bill.Some Democrats, however, gave Mr. Kushner credit for at least trying to keep a dialogue going, even if it did not result in a compromise.“We disagreed on the issue, but talking is essential in a divided government, especially if we want to solve any problems,” said Representative Josh Gottheimer, Democrat of New Jersey."
204,"SAN ANTONIO — Donald J. Trump got Brenda Hernandez’s hopes up in 2016 when he indicated that he had a heart for young undocumented immigrants like her, who were brought into the country by their parents. But her hopes were dashed when Mr. Trump became president and ordered an end to the federal program known as DACA that shields her from deportation.After the president’s latest announcement on Saturday — that he was proposing to end the standoff over the partial government shutdown by, among other things, temporarily extending that shield — Ms. Hernandez just shrugged.“I don’t trust Trump — I don’t believe him,” she said as she hoisted her 3-year-old son onto a swivel chair at the D & H Beauty Salon in San Antonio. The blue-collar shop, with rows of wooden chairs in the waiting area, is a favorite among immigrants in the city. But in the hours after Mr. Trump’s White House address, his latest offer of an immigration deal was finding little support.[Read: In Trump’s Immigration Announcement, A Compromise Snubbed All Around]In exchange for $5.7 billion to erect a barrier along the border with Mexico, Mr. Trump said he would agree to extend protection for three years for the roughly 800,000 immigrants who benefit from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which covers people brought into the country illegally as children. The president held out the hope of similar relief for 300,000 immigrants living in the United States with temporary protected status, known as T.P.S., after fleeing earthquakes and other disasters in their own countries.“I am here today to break the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward to end the government shutdown and solve the crisis along the southern border,” Mr. Trump said, calling his offer “a common-sense compromise both parties can embrace.”But many of the clients waiting their turn for a $6 haircut or shave at the D & H salon, in a strip mall in the northern part of the city, greeted Mr. Trump’s announcement with skepticism, if not downright indifference. Most expressed deep reservations about a border wall, deeming it a waste of money.Eliseo Castillo, 60, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, said an extension of DACA’s protections from deportation, and its offer of work permits, could benefit his 26-year-old son. He said his son had relied on the program for years to get a driver’s license and a job and to live without the fear that even a minor misstep, like driving with a broken taillight, could land him in deportation proceedings.But Mr. Castillo, a construction contractor who relies on a steady flow of workers from Latin America, said he wondered what would happen to his business if a reinforced border wall halted the flow of workers. He said he is already having trouble hiring enough laborers.“The fact is, there is not an American who wants to mix cement, do carpentry and heavy work,” said Mr. Castillo, who employs 18 people to lay down foundations for houses in San Antonio’s expansive subdivisions.Mr. Castillo, who wears cowboy boots and bluejeans and keeps his silver hair in a braid, has called Texas home since the 1980s. But he harbors no illusions about legalizing his status, at least as long as Mr. Trump holds the highest office in the land.Waiting his turn for a haircut in paint-splattered trousers that gave away how he earns his living, Jose Ramos, 63, a naturalized American born in Mexico, said he had no faith that Mr. Trump, whose “favorite sport is blaming immigrants for everything, which is not right,” would ever keep his word.“This isn’t a deal,” Mr. Ramos said. “Trump is just offering to give back what he already took away.”Democrats in Washington have criticized the president for offering to extend DACA and T.P.S. protections, when it was he who had ordered those protections revoked. Some have called the offer a nonstarter because it did not include any long-term solutions, like a path to permanent legal status or citizenship for DACA recipients, who are known as Dreamers.But many people in San Antonio never had much faith that such solutions were even possible with Mr. Trump as president.Indeed, some in the city wonder how much the president knows about the border.Speaking with reporters on Saturday, Mr. Trump cited the city as a place that had benefited from building a border barrier. “You look at San Antonio, you look at so many different places, they go from one of the most unsafe cities in the country to one of the safest cities, immediately, immediately,” he said.But San Antonio is 150 miles from the border, and has no wall.Alicia Alaniz, 47, the stylist working at station 7 in the salon, rolled her eyes and said that the only thing she could agree with in Mr. Trump’s statement was the notion that the immigration system was “broken.”“We need immigration reform — it would benefit the country and everyone who lives here,” said Ms. Alaniz, a legal permanent resident who emigrated from Mexico. People just want to work the right way, and support this country that has brought them many blessings.”President Obama introduced DACA in June 2012 as a temporary reprieve for young unauthorized immigrants, at a time when Congress was in a stalemate over immigration policy. To qualify for DACA protection, immigrants must have lived in the United States for much of their lives and meet certain other requirements, like passing a background check and completing high school.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed to eliminate any program that Mr. Obama had created by executive action, including DACA, a stance that generated deep anxiety among the Dreamers.But in December 2016, shortly after winning election, Mr. Trump softened his position.“We’re going to work something out that’s going to make people happy and proud,” he told Time magazine. “They got brought here at a very young age, they’ve worked here, they’ve gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they’re in never-never land because they don’t know what’s going to happen.”Once in office, however, Mr. Trump appointed one of the fiercest opponents of the DACA program, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, as his attorney general. Mr. Sessions rescinded DACA in September 2017, but the action was challenged in court and has yet to take full effect, while the courts decide the program’s fate.Without work permits provided under the program, young immigrants would face cascading, and possibly dire, consequences: They would lose their jobs, driver’s licenses and the chance to attend college at in-state tuition rates.Friday was the last day the Supreme Court could accept an appeal and schedule any arguments on the DACA litigation in its current session, and the court let the day pass without addressing the Trump administration’s bid to kill the program. That ensures that DACA will survive at least until the court’s next session, which begins in October.When the administration made its bid to end the program, “I worried about what I would do; I was so sad,” said Ms. Hernandez, who works these days for a casual dining chain known as Zoe’s Kitchen. But with the issue tied up in the courts, she said she has simply had to get on with her life. “Now, I don’t even think about it,” she said.Her DACA permit expires in a year."
205,"WASHINGTON — For the last month, President Trump’s public schedule has mostly been a sparse document. The one issued for Tuesday, for instance, listed only his daily intelligence briefing and lunch with the vice president. No new policy announcements. No new cabinet appointments.As the partial government shutdown enters its 33rd day, Democrats accuse Mr. Trump of hostage-taking tactics, but among the hostages has been his own presidency. Other than his single-minded pursuit of a border wall, Mr. Trump has all but put on hold advancing the rest of his agenda. It has become, as one administration official put it, a one-issue White House.“There are important things that aren’t being addressed,” said William A. Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide to President Bill Clinton. But the wall has become the singular issue for Mr. Trump because he has become convinced that his presidency is on the line. “It’s easy to come up with a list of things on the domestic front that he should be worrying about,” Mr. Galston said, “but it’s just as easy to understand why he’s not.”Senate leaders briefly raised hopes of a possible cease-fire in the shutdown on Tuesday by agreeing to hold votes on a pair of measures this week, but it appeared unlikely that either would draw the 60 votes necessary. Mr. Trump is eager to deliver his State of the Union address in the House chamber next week as originally scheduled, the most prominent platform a president has to set the terms for the coming year. But Speaker Nancy Pelosi has suggested it might be postponed or canceled if government agencies remain closed.White House officials said they were operating on the assumption that the president would still give the speech at the Capitol next Tuesday unless expressly disinvited, but if that were to happen, they had alternative options, like a televised speech delivered in the East Room of the White House. The address is being written to unveil a variety of policies, not just discuss the border dispute, which is one reason it is so important to Mr. Trump.The standoff has already forced Mr. Trump to cancel a trip to Europe to meet with global business leaders in Davos, Switzerland, at a time when the world economy faces a possible slowdown. The president has made no evident progress in filling a series of senior vacancies nor has he produced the tax-cutting plan he promised last year. He has done nothing in weeks to publicly promote priorities like fighting opioid abuse or bolstering the economy.“There is this frustration that the shutdown is interfering with the ability of Republicans — I assume Democrats feel the same way — to advance the agenda,” said Lanhee J. Chen, who was chief policy adviser to Mitt Romney’s Republican presidential campaign in 2012 and is now at Stanford University.And yet, given the new era of divided government, he added, “I’m not sure how quickly any agenda would be moving even if the government were open. That’s a sad testament about where we are as a country.”Many of Mr. Trump’s agency leaders and senior advisers, of course, are still at work. His trade negotiators are focused on brokering an agreement to ease the tariff war with China, and Mr. Trump himself met with a visiting official from North Korea to pave the way for a second summit meeting with its leader, Kim Jong-un, as early as next month.But at a time when a president is typically finishing a collection of policies in connection with the State of the Union and previewing them to build public support, some of Mr. Trump’s aides acknowledge that the president and his senior team have been almost entirely focused on the border dispute.Indeed, administration officials said the situation had the unintended benefit of making it easier for Mick Mulvaney, the newly installed acting White House chief of staff, to settle into his job because he did not have as many issues to juggle.The president, who made no public appearances on Tuesday, has kept his primary attention on the fight for the border wall for weeks, making only two unrelated out-of-town trips since the shutdown began, an unannounced stop in Iraq to visit troops at Christmas time and a quick flight to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware last weekend to pay respects to the returning remains of four Americans killed in Syria. Even a day trip to New Orleans to address farmers turned into another public pitch for the wall.Still in his inbox are a slew of important vacancies to fill, including defense secretary, interior secretary and chief of staff. His attorney general, United Nations ambassador and Environmental Protection Agency chief are all serving in an acting capacity while waiting for Senate confirmation votes of his nominees. The White House on Tuesday sent 51 judicial nominations to the Senate, returning names that had gone unacted on last year.Mr. Trump expressed no urgency when asked by reporters recently about all the acting officials in the upper echelon of his administration. “I like acting,” he said. “It gives me more flexibility.”Left uncertain is how Mr. Trump may pursue other goals. He vowed before the midterm election to pass a middle-class tax cut in the new Congress but has said little about it since then. He also vowed to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement to pressure Congress to pass his newly negotiated replacement but has yet to do so.He has similarly talked about collaborating with Ms. Pelosi’s Democrats, who just took over the House, on possible bipartisan initiatives like rebuilding the nation’s roads, bridges and other infrastructure or bringing down the cost of prescription drugs. Neither of those ideas has come up lately and it is hard to see the current impasse establishing the sort of trust that might lead to across-the-aisle cooperation.Moreover, any bitterness or ill will that lingers once the current shutdown is resolved, assuming it is, may complicate future financial negotiations when the debt ceiling needs to be raised to keep the country from defaulting on its obligations and when the current fiscal year is over at the end of September.That may depend on how the border fight turns out. Some optimists see the potential for an eventual deal between Mr. Trump and Democrats that includes money for his wall in exchange for permanent revisions to immigration laws protecting many of those who have lived in the country illegally for many years.“Hopefully, in the end, we can turn an awful situation into a legislative accomplishment for both sides,” said Representative Josh Gottheimer, Democrat of New Jersey and a leader of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, who met recently with the president.Others are not so sure. Mr. Trump has been willing to subordinate the rest of his agenda to the border wall, analysts said, because it is so central to his political identity and his campaign for re-election next year.“The president believes that the wall represents his contract with America, certainly his contract with his supporters,” said Mr. Galston, who is now at the Brookings Institution. “He regards it, and I think probably accurately, as the issue that did more than any other to propel him to the White House.“That being the case,” he added, “this government shutdown is not over a peripheral issue that overshadows other issues. It is the most important issue, at least from the perspective of the president.”"
206,"SAN DIEGO — With a mother and her three children facing deportation, the immigration judge wanted to make sure the woman understood the charges against her. But even with the help of an interpreter speaking in Q’anjob’al, a Mayan language, Magdalena Lucas Antonio de Pascual appeared to comprehend little.“What language do you speak?” Judge Philip S. Law asked.“The reason why I left my country?” she replied through the translator.“I came across the border illegally because I needed to,” she later told the judge.“I am going to ignore what you just told me, because that’s not what I asked you,” he said. “I am trying to explain the process and your rights.”Throughout the 50-minute hearing, the misunderstandings kept coming.Ms. Antonio de Pascual is one of many migrants coming into the United States from remote areas of Central America who only speak indigenous languages. An increase in the number of these migrants is adding to delays in a court system that is already overwhelmed by a backlog of more than 800,000 cases. Now the courts do not have enough interpreters to serve them, pushing the system to its limits, many lawyers, interpreters and advocates say.United States immigration officials provide interpreters in as many as 350 languages over all, including Mandarin, Creole, Punjabi, Arabic and Russian. But Mam, K’iche’ and Q’anjob’al — all indigenous to Guatemala — have each become one of the 25 most common languages spoken in immigration court in the past few years.In San Diego, a Q’anjob’al speaker had her asylum hearing pushed back for more than a year because no interpreters were available. In another case, a man whose primary language is Mam was unable to explain that his family had been killed in his Guatemalan town, which could be a basis for asylum, his lawyer said. The problems have seeped into the criminal courts as well: In the case of one man accused of a misdemeanor battery, the court interpreter, who was speaking in Ixil, did not ask him if he was competent to stand trial, as the judge instructed, but instead told him to “pray to God,” according to a complaint filed in Wisconsin state court.Ashley Tabaddor, an immigration judge in Los Angeles and the president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said the lack of interpreters was contributing to even more delays.“It’s a colossal waste of our time to now have to reorganize hundreds of thousands of cases to deal with language issues and then there’s no interpreter,” Ms. Tabaddor said.The small number of interpreters who do have a basic grasp of indigenous languages are still often ill-equipped to help — they must explain legal terms that are difficult to comprehend in any language and there are significant differences between regional dialects.With migrants who cannot understand or be understood, lawyers and immigration experts say, there is no way to ensure fairness in court.“We have an entire infrastructure set up where the default language is Spanish, but there are thousands of people coming to the southern border who can’t communicate that way — and they basically become invisible,” said Blake Gentry, a researcher who estimates that as many as a third of the migrants crossing the border through Arizona do not speak Spanish.Immigration courts across the country have seen a steady rise in speakers of indigenous Guatemalan languages in the last five years, according to the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees the court. And they are only the most recent additions to the list, which for several years has routinely included Zapotec, Mixtec, Ixil and Popti, languages from southern Mexico and Central America.“The lack of interpretation for indigenous people has been a problem for a long time,” said Odilia Romero, a Zapotec interpreter who has been an activist with the Binational Front of Indigenous Organizations for the last 20 years. “But what we see now is something entirely different: We have entire populations showing up with languages that we have not seen in the United States before.“The court may provide an interpreter so they have fulfilled the requirement, but that doesn’t mean there is any real understanding,” she said.Although many immigration courts have Spanish interpreters on staff, they rely on private contractors for interpreters of indigenous languages. Nearly all in-person interpreters come from one Virginia-based company, SOS International, which has an $80 million contract with the federal government.The government could not say how many interpreters are available in specific languages and relies on SOS International, which did not respond to multiple inquiries. A spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Immigration Review said the court tries to accommodate all non-English speakers and constantly monitors the cases nationally to meet new needs.But getting interpreters to court is hardly a given: With so few of them in such high demand, they have to be arranged weeks or even months in advance. Judges are often forced to rely on interpreters by phone, making it difficult to hear and impossible to understand body language. And interpreter shortages are plaguing courts across the country, including New York and Chicago.Even when interpreters are in court, it is routinely difficult to explain legal concepts to the migrants, particularly to the vast majority who do not have a lawyer. And because many indigenous interpreters do not speak English, they must use “relay” interpretation — with the judge’s English first being translated into Spanish before being translated to the indigenous language.In many cases, said Ms. Tabaddor, the immigration judge, migrants who speak only rudimentary Spanish try to get by in that language, sometimes out of shame or a belief that Spanish will help them convince United States officials that they should be allowed to stay.The problem extends to lawyers, who often can’t speak to their clients. Carmen Chavez, the executive director of the Casa Cornelia Law Center, a nonprofit immigration legal service in San Diego that helps match clients with interpreters, said that of the more than 2,000 cases the group handled last year, roughly a quarter of migrants from Latin America did not speak Spanish.“It is constantly difficult to find someone who is qualified to interpret for these cases,” she said.Even among interpreters certified to work in the courts, there is little oversight, and advocates worry whether interpreters and those who hire them are competent.Since immigrating to Los Angeles from Guatemala in the 1990s, Policarpo Chaj has worked as a K’iche’ interpreter for lawyers, doctors and other businesses. Mr. Chaj said he has repeatedly heard of lawyers trying to hire anyone they meet who speaks K’iche’ and Spanish.“Speaking a language is not the only thing that makes you qualified to be an interpreter,” he said. “You have to understand the law, you have know how to write, you have to know how to ask something concrete. You are dealing with people’s rights, it is your moral responsibility to make sure they understand exactly what the judge is saying.”It’s possible for migrants to not encounter a single person who speaks their language on their path through the immigration system, making it all but impossible to give officials information. While most agents working along the Mexican border and in detention centers speak at least basic Spanish, few know any indigenous languages. Officers often grow frustrated and accuse these migrants of being uncooperative, leaving them even more confused, lawyers and advocates say.Children who do not speak Spanish are especially isolated, shelter workers say. They are left without the ability to speak with counselors and are more likely to act out, then are punished or medicated. Parents who only speak an indigenous language often cannot communicate that they have been separated from their children.Even migrants with lawyers are often forced to depend on their bilingual children for further help.In court, Ms. Antonio de Pascual struggled to explain her situation through the court interpreter. The family arrived last summer, meeting her husband who has lived in the San Diego area for several years. She enrolled each of her children in school, and her 8-year-old daughter refused to miss class for the court hearing. Ms. Antonio de Pascual, who is illiterate, said she could not remember what forms she signed or questions she answered when she spoke to United States officials near the border last year.Ms. Antonio de Pascual’s initial hearing had already been postponed because no interpreter was available. As this recent one ended, she asked the judge to give her six months to save money for a lawyer. Saying that would be too much time, the judge said he wanted her back in court in June and expected her to begin looking for a lawyer immediately.When she was dismissed, her 12-year-old son, who speaks limited Spanish and Q’anjob’al, took the stack of court documents, placing them inside his small green backpack. He said he planned to spend the afternoon calling the phone numbers listed for pro bono lawyers who might take their case."
207,"EL PASO — Over the last month, I have traveled in three congressional delegations to El Paso and southern New Mexico. We heard from federal law enforcement, toured detention centers and Border Patrol stations, and listened to human rights and legal advocates who have worked with migrants for decades. Some of us even saw where Felipe Gómez Alonzo, an 8-year-old Guatemalan who recently died while in custody, and his father were apprehended.Obviously, El Paso and its metropolitan area, including Ciudad Juárez, in Mexico, is just one point along a very long border. But everything we saw demonstrated why President Trump’s call for a wall is simplistic and misguided. While there is indeed a crisis on the border, it’s not the one the president describes — and, in fact, his “solution” will only make things worse. The border runs for 2,000 miles. Some of it runs through impassable terrain, some alongside cities like El Paso. About 700 miles of it already has a wall. In other words, the border may look like one long, thin line on a map, but in reality it is much more complicated. Nor are those arriving at the border the threatening mass of humanity Mr. Trump imagines. For one thing, there are a lot fewer people being apprehended — down 60 percent from a decade ago. And these days the majority are seeking asylum, their legal right. And while drugs do flow across the border, most of them come through ports of entry. It’s not just Mr. Trump who fails to appreciate these facts; as I’ve come to learn as an El Pasoan and now a member of Congress, so does the Department of Homeland Security. Despite receiving more money than all other federal law enforcement agencies combined, the department has not adapted to changes in migrating populations and patterns. Before giving it another penny, Congress must understand why.Instead of developing a nuanced response to the facts on the ground, this administration has chosen incompetence and cruelty as its approach. The consequences are already apparent.For example, one reason more migrants are coming across the border through the desert, then requesting asylum, may be that they are being unfairly rejected at official border crossings or being forced to languish in Mexico while their applications are being considered at a deliberately slow pace, a tactic called “metering.” Many choose not to wait, and make a desperate, risky choice — and some die as a result.And because federal law enforcement agencies have failed to adapt to this changing population, agents are ill equipped to handle the asylum seekers once they do arrive. Those agents are used to chasing after single Mexican men determined to evade capture. They are now dealing with Central American families, fleeing their countries and running to, not from, the agents. Some carry very small children; all are being crowded into small, inhumane cement cells for days at a time.I am not blaming the agents. During one of our visits to an El Paso Sector station, agents were up front with us about how unprepared they were to care for the large groups of people they apprehended. They had to buy burritos from a vendor down the street, then warm hundreds of them in a single, small microwave that eventually burned out. Then there was the mother who, in our presence, asked for a cup of water for her toddler, only to be told that the facility was out of cups. What a terrible situation for the mother, holding an exhausted, thirsty child in her arms. And what does that do to the agent who has to say no to her?During flu season, agents in El Paso had to dispense medication to their charges. Imagine keeping track of dozens of prescriptions intended to be dispensed every few hours. And all of this was keeping agents from what they were trained to do: track and apprehend bad guys.When I ask agents what they worry about most, I hear stories like this — not pleas for a wall. Other times they ask for better cellphone coverage and updated radios to use in rural areas. In urban areas with busy ports of entry, they ask for more personnel and newer equipment. There aren’t enough immigration judges, they don’t have enough independence, and the laws on the books don’t reflect modern realities.The agents may not be to blame, but the agencies sure are. Local immigration activists said their main concern was inadequate communication from federal law enforcement, which left their organizations scrambling when the local Immigration Customs Enforcement office releases hundreds of migrants in need of temporary housing into the nighttime streets of El Paso. When we talk about a crisis along the border, this is what it looks like: desperate families overwhelming agents who get little direction or support from their local offices, let alone Washington. This year, Congress needs to investigate the inability of a well-funded agency to adapt, why supervisors ignored the alarms raised by their agents on the ground, how two children (Felipe Gómez and 7-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquin) died as a result, and how we best address the root causes of changed migration.President Trump and his base won’t end their obsession with border security until there’s not a single undocumented crosser — an impossibility. For them, of course, this isn’t about border security; it’s about nationalism and isolationism. For the rest of us, it’s about finding a humane solution to a humanitarian challange."
208,"My first encounter in America was with a luggage cart. In the summer of 1992, when I landed at Kennedy Airport, I carried with me a travel bag filled with books. It was so heavy that it could not be checked in at my originating airport in Casablanca, Morocco, without putting me over the weight limit. Since I couldn’t afford the excess baggage fee, I brought the bag with me on the plane, where the flight attendant helped me hoist it into the overhead bin. In New York, I hauled it down the jet bridge and through passport control, my hands blistering from the effort. Relief washed over me when I saw a row of carts. I tried to get one, only to discover that it required three dollars to unlock. I remember thinking: What kind of a heartless place is this?I didn’t have three dollars, or a five or a ten. The money I did have was in the larger denominations I had received at the currency exchange office where I’d traded in my meager savings. I began to doubt whether I would make it to the terminal from which my flight to California was scheduled to leave. Then a voice behind me called, “Do you need help with that?” A middle-aged man in a baseball cap picked up my bag and carried it for me to the terminal bus. All the way to my next gate, other people stepped in to help. This wasn’t a heartless place after all, I thought; Americans were more than willing to lend a hand to a stranger.I am no longer a stranger here. In the 20-odd years since I arrived at Kennedy, I have had ample time to learn about this country’s history, culture and politics. Although my plan had been to complete a graduate degree in linguistics and return to Morocco, chance intervened: I met an American, we fell in love, got married. Now, I’m an immigrant. There is nothing extraordinary about this condition — I share it with millions of others — yet hardly a day goes by when I am not reminded that to be an immigrant is to have crossed a threshold, to see the world from two vantage points at once, to perceive it in shades of gray rather than in black and white.When I hear elected officials talk about immigrants, they seem to be speaking about figments of their imagination, conjured up to illustrate talking points. The president rants about “criminals,” “rapists” and “terrorists,” then uses them as justification for building a wall, separating families at the border, jailing refugee children in tent camps and banning people from five Muslim countries. The president’s critics, meanwhile, portray newcomers to this country as singularly talented people who start new businesses, serve in the armed forces, innovate new technologies, run for Congress or otherwise “get the job done.”By casting immigrants as either heroes or villains, these politicians reveal that they view immigration as a law-enforcement issue. The reality is much more complicated. Like other species on this planet, human beings are a migratory type. When they suddenly find themselves in desperate need of physical safety or economic opportunity, they leave home and start over somewhere new. It has always been this way. The earliest stories we tell ourselves are stories of displacement: Adam’s fall from Eden, Moses’ flight from Egypt, Muhammad’s hegira to Medina. Trying to stop this process through the building of walls strikes me as both ineffective and unnatural — like trying to stop a river from flowing.I use the simile deliberately. Scientists predict that over the next decade the earth will warm by 1.5 degrees, and perhaps as much as two degrees Celsius if we fail to take drastic and sustained action on climate change. Even under the best-case scenarios, we will witness huge hurricanes, wildfires, droughts and other severe weather events. The consequences will be dire: loss of homes and livelihoods, hunger and disease, probably conflict, but eventually dislocation. As much as it is an economic, a social and a foreign-policy issue, migration is a climate issue.Those who are safe from displacement — at least for the moment — must confront the roles they want to play in this unfolding global story. What responsibility do people in America, for example, have toward those who live in places that have been ravaged by wars the American government has started or abetted? What responsibility do they have toward those who have benefited least from industrialization but stand to suffer most? And how do they plan to adapt to global migration? In Christchurch, New Zealand, last week, at least 49 people were killed during Friday prayers by a white nationalist who released a manifesto railing against Muslims and immigrants. As refugees and migrants rebuild their lives in new places, both the intolerance and the resilience of their host communities are revealed.In order to have a fruitful conversation about immigration, we have to set aside antiquated ideas about barbarians at the gate and thoroughly rethink our approach to the inevitable displacements that will take place in our lifetimes. The overwhelming majority of immigrants are neither dangerous monsters nor exceptional achievers — they are ordinary people who find themselves, for a range of personal or political reasons, pulled or pushed to leave home. Whether they will be met by kind strangers or by an enforcement machine as faceless and indifferent as a luggage cart is a choice that Americans still have the luxury to make."
209,"The internet expands the bounds of acceptable discourse, so ideas considered out of bounds not long ago now rocket toward widespread acceptability. See: cannabis legalization, government-run health care, white nationalism and, of course, the flat-earthers. Yet there’s one political shore that remains stubbornly beyond the horizon. It’s an idea almost nobody in mainstream politics will address, other than to hurl the label as a bloody cudgel.I’m talking about opening up America’s borders to everyone who wants to move here.Imagine not just opposing President Trump’s wall but also opposing the nation’s cruel and expensive immigration and border-security apparatus in its entirety. Imagine radically shifting our stance toward outsiders from one of suspicion to one of warm embrace. Imagine that if you passed a minimal background check, you’d be free to live, work, pay taxes and die in the United States. Imagine moving from Nigeria to Nebraska as freely as one might move from Massachusetts to Maine.[Farhad Manjoo answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]There’s a witheringly obvious moral, economic, strategic and cultural case for open borders, and we have a political opportunity to push it. As Democrats jockey for the presidency, there’s room for a brave politician to oppose President Trump’s racist immigration rhetoric not just by fighting his wall and calling for the abolishment of I.C.E. but also by making a proactive and affirmative case for the vast expansion of immigration.It would be a change from the stale politics of the modern era, in which both parties agreed on the supposed wisdom of “border security” and assumed that immigrants were to be feared. As an immigrant, this idea confounds me. My family came to the United States from our native South Africa in the late 1980s. After jumping through lots of expensive and confusing legal hoops, we became citizens in 2000. Obviously, it was a blessing: In rescuing me from a society in which people of my color were systematically oppressed, America has given me a chance at liberty.But why had I deserved that chance, while so many others back home — because their parents lacked certain skills, money or luck — were denied it?When you see the immigration system up close, you’re confronted with its bottomless unfairness. The system assumes that people born outside our borders are less deserving of basic rights than those inside. My native-born American friends did not seem to me to warrant any more dignity than my South African ones; according to this nation’s founding documents, we were all created equal. Yet by mere accident of geography, some were given freedom, and others were denied it.“When you start to think about it, a system of closed borders begins to feel very much like a system of feudal privilege,” said Reece Jones, a professor of geography at the University of Hawaii who argues that Democrats should take up the mantle of open borders. “It’s the same idea that there’s some sort of hereditary rights to privilege based on where you were born.”I admit the politics here are perilous. Although America’s borders were open for much of its history — if your ancestors came here voluntarily, there’s a good chance it was thanks to open borders — restrictions on immigration are now baked so deeply into our political culture that any talk of loosening them sparks anger.People worry that immigrants will bring crime, even though stats show immigrants are no more dangerous than natives. People worry they’ll take jobs away from native workers, even though most studies suggests that immigration is a profound benefit to the economy, and there’s little evidence it hurts native workers. And if we worry that they’ll hoover up welfare benefits, we can impose residency requirements for them.But these are all defensive arguments, and when you’re on defense, you’re losing. For opponents of the president’s xenophobic policies, a better plan is to make the affirmative case for a lot more immigrants.Economically and strategically, open borders isn’t just a good plan — it’s the only chance we’ve got. America is an aging nation with a stagnant population. We have ample land to house lots more people, but we are increasingly short of workers. And on the global stage, we face two colossi — India and China — which, with their billions, are projected to outstrip American economic hegemony within two decades.How will we ever compete with such giants? The same way we always have: by inviting the world’s most enthusiastic and creative people — including the people willing to walk here, to risk disease and degradation and death to land here — to live out their best life under liberty.A new migrant caravan is forming in Honduras, and the president is itching for the resulting political fight. Here’s hoping Democrats respond with creativity and verve. Not just “No wall.” Not just “Abolish ICE.” Instead: “Let them in.”"
210,"President Trump has shut down the government to get money for a border wall that he says will stop illegal immigration. But the fact of the matter is that that’s not all he wants to stop. During the three-day shutdown last January, he demanded a 40 percent reduction in legal immigration, arguing that America has been swamped by immigrants. “There’s a limit to how many people a nation can responsibly absorb into their societies, ” he has declared.He is not alone in invoking this boogeyman. That America is being overwhelmed by a flood of immigrants has become conventional wisdom across the political spectrum, presented in books from, on the right, Reihan Salam of National Review, the son of Bangladeshi immigrants; in the center, Francis Fukuyama of Stanford, whose mother immigrated from Japan; and on the left, Jefferson Cowie of Vanderbilt University, who actually counsels his fellow progressives not to fear more immigration.But by any reasonable metric, the idea that America is experiencing mass immigration is a myth. The reality is that we desperately need to pick up the pace of immigration to maintain our work force and economic health.You could argue that mass immigration — a vague term with no set definition — is happening in Lebanon and Jordan, primary destinations for refugees escaping Syria’s civil war. Lebanon, which had about 4.4 million people in 2010, has admitted in just a few years around one million Syrian refugees, which works out to around 23 percent increase in its population.In America, by contrast, there are about 44 million foreign-born people who now constitute about 13.7 percent of the population, according to the Pew Research Foundation. This is close to the historic high of 15 percent at the turn of the 20th century. Why is that considered a meaningful benchmark? Because at that time the United States, responding to nativist and union pressure, embraced strict border controls, essentially ending what had until then been an open borders policy.Literacy tests were instituted in 1917, and the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act imposed national-origins quotas limiting visas to 2 percent of the total number of people of each nationality in the United States as of the 1890 census. The purpose of this legislation was to cut back immigration overall, especially from Eastern Europe and Asia — and it succeeded spectacularly.Congress finally eliminated these quotas, which had widely come to be regarded as racist, in 1965, and immigration subsequently picked up. But immigration opponents have made the 15 percent foreign-born figure a tipping point, as if it were based on science instead of being an arbitrary historical event. If it were indeed a tipping point, countries would regularly experience a backlash once the immigrant population approached that level. That is far from the case.America’s share of the foreign born ranks 34th among 50 wealthy countries with a per capita gross domestic product of over $20,000. The United States netted five new immigrants — authorized and unauthorized — per 1,000 people from 2015 to 2017, United Nations figures show. Compare that to the figures in two other English-speaking liberal democracies: Canada let in eight (and just announced that it’s going to admit over a million new immigrants over three years), and Australia 14. All in all, the foreign-born are now over 20 percent of Canada’s population and 28.2 percent of Australia’s (more than double America’s figure). And yet they haven’t inspired the sort of public condemnation of immigration that often occurs in the United States. America has also taken in a relatively modest numbers of immigrants over the last half-century. In 1965, when Congress got rid of national-origin quotas, America’s foreign-born made up around 5 percent of the population. Over two decades from 1980 to 2000, this proportion rose to 11.1 percent, from 6.2 percent, not insignificant but not particularly noteworthy.But then the rate of increase slowed to a crawl, rising from 11.1 percent in 2000 to 12.9 percent in 2010 and then barely inching to 13.5 percent in 2016. In other words, in six years, America’s foreign-born population inched up 0.6 percent. Yet the more America’s (modest) immigration decelerates, the more the mass immigration trope accelerates.A good yardstick for whether a country is admitting too many or too few immigrants — beyond the political mood of the moment — is its economic needs. If America were admitting too many immigrants, the economy would have trouble absorbing them. In fact, the unemployment rate among immigrants, including the 11 million undocumented, in 2016, when the economy was considered to be at full employment, was almost three-quarters of a point lower than that of natives. How can that be evidence of mass immigration?The truth is that America is a low-immigration nation. Demographic trends in America point to a severe labor crunch that’ll become a huge bottleneck for growth unless the country opens its doors wider.It has long been clear that the dropping fertility rates of native-born white Americans meant that the generations coming after the millennials were on track to be much smaller. From 2015 to 2035, the number of working-age Americans with domestic-born parents is expected to fall by eight million. Furthermore, the Census Bureau in 2017 quietly revised downward its population forecast for 2050 by a whopping 50 million people from its 2008 estimates, as Jack Goldstone, a political demographer at George Mason University, pointed out. Why? Because immigration from Mexico dwindled after the Great Recession at the same time that Hispanic fertility rates dropped by a quarter as well. At the current rate that America is admitting immigrants, this means that the total work force will grow only 0.3 percent per year. Unless American birthrates pick up suddenly and expand the work force — an unrealistic assumption given that the country just set a record for low fertility — or the productivity of its dwindling work force quickly doubled, only slightly less unrealistic, says Mr. Goldstone, the United States will be staring at real G.D.P. growth of less than 1.6 percent per year in less than a decade, all else remaining equal.America should be admitting a million more immigrants per year — more than double the current number from now until 2050. This still won’t add up to mass immigration because it would put America’s foreign-born population that year at around 26 percent, less than Australia’s is today.Fifteen years ago when I was writing about immigration for the conservative editorial page of The Detroit News, the myth that America was being overwhelmed by immigrants had retreated mostly to nativist activist circles. Just because it has spread now does not mean it’s true. It’s a myth that should be killed before it kills the American dream."
211,"WASHINGTON — Standing before a diverse new class of House Democrats, in the shadow of their new female speaker, President Trump showed on Tuesday how he planned to govern in a divided Washington.The answer, judging by his words, is no differently than he did before.Mr. Trump briefly acknowledged Nancy Pelosi as “Madam Speaker,” but dispensed with even perfunctory congratulations. He all but ignored the midterm elections that swept the Republican Party out of power in the House. And he vowed that the United States “will never be a socialist country,” likening the progressive Democrats in the chamber to the discredited leader of Venezuela.The president did issue a call for bipartisan cooperation, and he invoked the heroism of World War II to celebrate a shared history. But on the issues that have rived Washington during Mr. Trump’s turbulent presidency, he did not give an inch.Whether it was the border wall, which he insisted would be built; abortion, where he tried to fan conservative anger over comments made by Virginia’s governor; or the investigations of his presidential campaign’s ties to Russia, which he dismissed as “ridiculous” and “partisan,” Mr. Trump chose to appeal to his political base rather than trying to build bridges to Democrats.“If there is going to be peace and legislation,” he declared, setting out the terms of his engagement with Congress, “there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn’t work that way!”Save for the majesty of the setting, the president’s adherence to his script, and a single unscripted moment when Mr. Trump tipped his hat to the scores of Democratic women elected to Congress last November, parts of this State of the Union speech could have been drawn from one of his “Make America Great Again” rallies.Mr. Trump warned of a new wave of invading caravans from Central America, spoke of grisly crimes committed by illegal immigrants and accused what he said were wealthy politicians who oppose his immigration policies — presumably including Ms. Pelosi — of favoring open borders while “living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.”“No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and political class than illegal immigration,” he said.In front of him, however, the divide was between the mostly male Republicans, who applauded his red-meat lines, and the Democrats, many of them women, who were clad in white to signify the women’s suffrage movement.Mr. Trump delighted in his role as the dismantler of Democratic legacies: He boasted of eliminating a “very unpopular” provision of Obamacare, withdrawing the United States from the “disastrous Iran nuclear deal” and renegotiating the “catastrophe known as Nafta.”As for how the Republicans and Democrats might work together, Mr. Trump revived his proposal for infrastructure legislation, calling it “not an option” but a “necessity.” But he offered no details and breezed through the proposal, which is less popular among Republicans, in barely three lines, half as much time as he gave his campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs.Even Mr. Trump’s conciliatory phrases carried a partisan sting. He said, for example, “the agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda,” using a shortened form of Democratic that some Republicans favor as a mild slur against the opposing party.For a president whose party lost 40 seats in the House three months ago, and who just lost a battle with Ms. Pelosi over the 35-day government shutdown, Mr. Trump behaved like the insurgent who rode into Washington two years ago with a congressional majority and a mandate to upend the establishment.He claimed credit for a long list of economic and national security achievements, some of which were almost comically exaggerated. “If I had not been elected president of the United States,” he said, “we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea.”In addressing Congress on Tuesday, Mr. Trump found himself in an identical position to his three immediate predecessors, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton — facing a hostile Congress after a devastating midterm defeat.How each confronted the moment offers a window into their presidencies; together, they stand as a stark contrast to the current occupant of the Oval Office.In 1995, Mr. Clinton responded to the Republican Revolution of the previous November by pivoting to the center and giving credence to the small-government agenda of Newt Gingrich and his fellow warriors. He admitted to missteps in his first two years in office, which had allowed his Republican opponents to caricature him as a tax-and-spend liberal.Mr. Clinton sketched a vision of a leaner, more efficient government, with fewer regulations and an overhauled welfare system. The conservative commentator William Kristol marveled that it was the “most conservative State of the Union by a Democratic president in history.”Twelve years later, Mr. Bush opened his State of the Union address with a warm tribute to Ms. Pelosi, who assumed the speaker’s gavel for the first time after Democrats swept to power in the House in 2006. He spoke of the pride her late father, Thomas D’Alesandro Jr., a congressman from Maryland, would have felt in seeing his “only daughter, Nancy, presiding tonight.”It was a grace note for Mr. Bush, who was fighting to salvage his legacy after midterm elections that served as a referendum on the Iraq war and his bungled handling of Hurricane Katrina. Mr. Trump, by contrast, appeared to rush his opening remarks to deny Ms. Pelosi the chance to introduce him.Mr. Obama’s speech in 2011 came days after former Representative Gabrielle Giffords was nearly killed in a mass shooting in Tucson — a tragedy that muted the normally partisan tone. Mr. Obama seized on the fleeting comity to declare, “Each of us is part of something greater — something more consequential than party or political preference.”Like Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton, he appealed to Republicans to find common ground — in his case behind a national project to make the United States more competitive in a rapidly changing global economy.“This is our generation’s Sputnik moment,” Mr. Obama said, urging Americans to “out-innovate, out-educate and out-build the rest of the world.”Mr. Trump referred to outspending and out-innovating major competitors, too, but he put it in the context of building nuclear weapons, after explaining why he pulled the United States out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.For presidents, State of the Union speeches rarely grease the wheels of bipartisanship. Mr. Clinton clashed repeatedly with Republicans after their congressional takeover, outmaneuvering Mr. Gingrich after he precipitated a government shutdown, though he made a historic deal on welfare overhaul that set the stage for his re-election in 1996.Mr. Bush stuck to his troop surge in Iraq, reaping unexpected gains. But with the exception of a deal with the Democrats late in his term on the fiscal crisis, his legislative agenda was over by the time he spoke in 2007.Mr. Obama’s call for bipartisanship went nowhere in the Republican Senate, where the leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, vowed to make Mr. Obama a one-term president. He failed to strike a grand bargain on fiscal policy with Speaker John A. Boehner, with both sides blaming the other for bad faith in the failed negotiation.For Mr. Trump, the portents for cooperation seem even less promising. He offered no tangible compromise on the border wall, he faces a newly energized Democratic Party and he is heading into a presidential election year.“We must choose between greatness and gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction,” Mr. Trump said.The president implored his audience to choose “greatness,” but he gave them no road map for pursuing it."
212,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has stepped back from declaring a national emergency to pay for a border wall, under pressure from congressional Republicans, his own lawyers and advisers, who say using it as a way out of the government shutdown does not justify the precedent it would set and the legal questions it could raise.“If today the national emergency is border security, tomorrow the national emergency might be climate change,” Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, one of the idea’s critics, said this week. Another Republican, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, told an interviewer that declaring a national emergency should be reserved for “the most extreme circumstances.”Mr. Trump, who according to aides has grown increasingly frustrated over the refusal of Democrats to bend and sees the shutdown as a road with no off-ramp in sight, hinted on Friday that the warnings were having an effect.“What we’re not looking to do right now is national emergency,” he told reporters gathered in the Cabinet Room as the shutdown approached its fourth week. Minutes later he contradicted himself, saying that he would declare a state of emergency if he had to.As Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, have proved immune to Mr. Trump’s threats, the idea of using the president’s constitutional powers to declare an emergency has received close scrutiny in the White House because it would enable Mr. Trump to obtain the $5.7 billion he has sought for construction of a wall without the approval of Congress.Instead, Mr. Trump would use his authority to transfer funds to the wall that were appropriated by Congress for other purposes. Toward that end, the Army Corps of Engineers has been directed to study whether it can divert about $13.9 billion in emergency aide set aside for Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California. And with the money secured, the president could drop his opposition to the appropriations bills whose passage would end the shutdown.That would allow Mr. Trump to say he had never backed down from his fight with congressional Democrats or abandoned his pledge to build the wall even if the construction became tied up in legal challenges.Former White House aides, who noted that Mr. Trump did not focus on the wall during the first two years of his presidency, said the optics of fighting for the wall were more important to the president than erecting it.But opposition has come from many Republican quarters. Some conservatives see it as an unacceptable extension of executive power. Kellyanne Conway, a White House aide, has said it would essentially give Congress a pass. Representative Mike Simpson, Republican of Idaho and a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said it was not clear to him that an emergency declaration would even lead to the prompt reopening of the government.He called it “a bad escape hatch” that was going to anger many House members.Mr. Trump’s reluctance is also frustrating allies ginning him up to take action. “If it’s a crisis, treat it like a crisis,” Stephen K. Bannon, the former chief White House strategist, said in an interview. “His best option now is to declare a national security emergency and get on with it.”On Thursday, Mr. Trump traveled to the border in Texas to dramatize his support for a wall but used a photo-op along the banks of the Rio Grande on Thursday only to repeat his familiar arguments for building it. He sidestepped the issue when Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, asked him in an interview that night to detail what a national emergency would look like.“There’s some compromise needed,” Mr. Trump said.But Mr. Trump, who allies said was eager to spend time at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and resented the advice of aides to deliver an Oval Office address and travel to Texas on Thursday, is left with few good options.As he searches for a way to end the political stalemate with Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Trump is finding himself boxed in, in a familiar position when it comes to immigration issues. Former aides say that is because he conflates legal and policy issues with public relations campaigns and does not anticipate an endgame.In March, Mr. Trump was facing pressure to meet a deadline on a decision about what to do with immigrants who were part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allowed young adults brought to the United States illegally as children to avoid deportation and become eligible for a work permit.Racked by anxiety as he quizzed aides for advice, Mr. Trump turned to an adviser and asked, “How do I get out of this?”In the end, Mr. Trump was saved, at least temporarily, by a federal appeals court ruling last year that he could not immediately end the program. Mr. Trump moved on.In the opening weeks of his presidency, Mr. Trump issued an executive order banning citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States. That ban was almost immediately halted in court. A second, rewritten version, however, was upheld by the Supreme Court and was seen as at least a partial victory for the administration.But Mr. Trump vented, privately and publicly, that the version that passed legal muster was “watered down” and “P.C.,” and made him look “weak.”How Mr. Trump found himself in his most recent predicament can be traced back to September, when White House aides and conservative lawmakers urged the president to engage in a fight for wall funding. But he was told to postpone the fight until after the election, to avoid forcing vulnerable Republicans in swing districts to take a politically perilous stance on the wall.When he looked like he might compromise and support a bill that provided far less money for the wall than he asked for, conservatives like Ann Coulter excoriated him, describing him as “gutless,” and he backed down. Soon he was telling Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi during a televised Oval Office meeting last month that he would proudly “own the shutdown,” thrilling conservatives.Buoyed by the praise, and encouraged by the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump decided to keep digging in.But that encouragement for what played well in a viral television moment never led to a coherent strategy for a prolonged stalemate, according to a half-dozen people in the White House or working with the administration on a way to end the shutdown.Mr. Trump’s allies insist that he is winning the political battle.“Democrats are boxed in,” said Greg Mueller, a conservative strategist. “Every time the president and G.O.P. go to the Democrats with a fix, they say no, which positions them as obstructionists ignoring the problem, and opening themselves up for major troubles in 2020.”Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who had tried and failed to find an alternative to reopen the government earlier in the week, emerged from a meeting with Mr. Trump on Friday declaring that it was clear Democrats “don’t want to make a deal and will never support border wall/barriers.”And he encouraged the exact action many of his colleagues were warning against. “Mr. President, declare a national emergency now,” he said. “Build a wall now.”Mr. Trump’s aides said they expected the stalemate over the wall funding to be resolved by the time he delivers the State of the Union address on Jan. 29. But the White House also has drafts based on the shutdown being over — or well into its sixth week."
213,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said Tuesday that it would summon tens of thousands of federal employees back to work without pay to get the government running amid a partial shutdown well into its third week, as the White House and increasingly agitated lawmakers on Capitol Hill cast about for a way to end the stalemate.On a day of inertia and theatrics in Washington, the partisan disconnect fueling the deadlock was on full — sometimes absurd — display. House Democrats spurned an invitation by President Trump to a bipartisan lunch at the White House, drawing howls of outrage from Mr. Trump’s team, while Democrats dismissed the steak-and-potatoes meal as little more than a photo opportunity. A group of House Democratic freshmen marched across the Capitol — with reporters in tow — to publicly confront Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, with demands to end the impasse. But Mr. McConnell was not in his office, so they left a note.In between the choreographed scenes of non-negotiation, Republicans and Democrats toiled privately to find a solution that Mr. Trump would accept. The talks were expected to continue Wednesday, after the president issued yet another invitation to a group of centrists from both parties, the Problem Solvers Caucus, who were scheduled to attend a meeting with him in the Situation Room.Senior administration officials, in the latest indication that they do not expect the partial shutdown to end anytime soon, made contingency plans to call back workers without pay. The Federal Aviation Administration said it was bringing thousands of furloughed inspectors and other employees back to work, while the Internal Revenue Service released a plan to have 46,000 of its 80,000 employees on the job for tax-filing season, up from about 10,000.The Interior Department is bringing back at least 40 federal employees tasked to work on a plan to sell oil and gas drilling leases off the entire United States coastline.In Washington, the deadlock showed no sign of subsiding. In the House, some freshman Democrats who won in districts carried by Mr. Trump in 2016 showed some sign of concern. They met on Tuesday to talk about whether — and how hard — to push their leaders to negotiate with the White House.“Maybe it’s an outlier view compared to some others in the Democratic Party, but I believe we have a responsibility to get in a room and negotiate,” said Representative Elissa Slotkin, Democrat of Michigan, who hosted the session in her office.But the House Democrats’ absence from Mr. Trump’s lunch on Tuesday was the latest indication that their party is standing firm for now against his demand that any proposal to reopen the government must include $5.7 billion for a wall on the southwestern border. White House officials, who had issued the invitation in the hopes of showing fissures among Democrats, used the regrets-only response to deflect responsibility for the prolonged shutdown, arguing that Mr. Trump was the one trying to end the impasse. A slew of recent polls have found that the public largely blames Mr. Trump and Republicans for the continuing dysfunction.“Unfortunately, no Democrats will attend,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement about the lunch. She added, “It’s time for the Democrats to come to the table and make a deal.”Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, have refused to negotiate over border security until the government reopens, but Mr. Trump has ruled out separating the two issues. While the Democratic-led House has passed several bills to end the shutdown, Mr. McConnell has said he will not advance the legislation knowing that the president will not sign it.“In a situation like this, where the president, in my view, is in the right place, trying to get the right outcome, as all of us have expressed, with regard to border security, of course not,” Mr. McConnell said.Ms. Slotkin would not say whether she agreed with Ms. Pelosi’s stance that no negotiation was possible until the government reopened, citing a confidentiality pledge she said members of the group had taken about their discussion. But she said she and her colleagues were walking around with copies of legislation co-written by Representative Will Hurd, Republican of Texas, and Representative Pete Aguilar, Democrat of California, that drew bipartisan support last year. The measure paired border security improvements with legal status for some undocumented immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children, sometimes called “Dreamers.”“There’s a lot of people who believe it’s important to work across the aisle, that we need a practical way forward, and they believe in figuring out practical solutions,” Ms. Slotkin said. “We know we’re not in charge, but we want to get caught trying to help.”She said she had called Ms. Pelosi on Monday to relay complaints by her constituents over the weekend about the shutdown, and has also been talking quietly with Republicans — whom she would not name — about how to find a way out of the stalemate.Yet Democratic leaders expressed confidence that their members would not break from their leaders’ strategy, notwithstanding Mr. Trump’s attempts to entice them.“Is anybody surprised that the president is trying to get votes wherever he can get votes?” Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, told reporters on Tuesday. “We are totally united — totally.”In a closed-door meeting of House Democratic leaders on Monday, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Hoyer said they had no problem with the idea of rank-and-file Democrats meeting with Mr. Trump. Ms. Pelosi said such a session would give lawmakers a sense of “what we’ve been dealing with” in a series of tense meetings with the president in the Situation Room since the shutdown began. “They’ll want to make a citizen’s arrest,” she added at one point, according to an official in the room who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversation was private.In the Senate, bipartisan efforts to forge a consensus appeared to have stalled as both sides agreed little progress was possible while the government remained shuttered.A group of Republican and Democratic senators met privately on Monday in the office of Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, to try to find a way out of the gridlock, but the talks yielded no breakthrough.“There was nothing there with structure to it except ‘what do you think, how can we get people back?’” Mr. Manchin said. “I think we all understand that you have to have immigration reform with security. That has to be done simultaneously, and I don’t think that can be done while there’s a shutdown.”The group included Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who tried last week to forge a compromise that would pair border security funding with legal status for certain groups of immigrants facing deportation. Democrats in the room said no progress could be made on such a deal until the government was reopened, two officials familiar with the talks said, and Republicans agreed.“What I would hope is that the president would reconsider” and allow the government to reopen for a brief period while senators worked on a compromise, said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, who attended the session.But the president has repeatedly ruled out doing so, and privately told Democrats this month that such a move would make him look foolish.As the gridlock continued, the Trump administration was searching for ways to lessen the pain of the partial shutdown for those affected. Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of Homeland Security, said she was working on legislation to ensure that the Coast Guard, the only branch of the military going without pay during the lapse in funding, would be compensated.The acting director of the Office of Personnel Management has been working with payroll providers to ensure that some federal workers going without compensation would receive back pay within a few days of when the government reopens, according to a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity without authorization to discuss the plan."
214,"BOULOGNE-SUR-MER, France — There is disquiet along the cold, foggy quays of this major French fishing port facing Britain.Captain after captain, returning to Boulogne-sur-Mer in squat fishing boats with the day’s haul of crab and sole, has the same story: Their boats are being broken into.The suspected culprits, according to the fishermen and local officials? Smugglers, and their migrant clients, who are intent on reaching Britain and are looking for vessels to cross the forbidding waters of the English Channel. A few of the stolen boats have even been taken to sea.Since the start of Europe’s migration crisis in 2015, the English Channel has largely been seen as an unbreachable barrier, its shifting currents and volatile weather making any attempt to cross too dangerous.But officials in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France’s largest fishing port, reported a surge of these migrant crossings in the last three months of 2018, whether in a stolen fishing boat or, far more frequently, in small inflatable craft that set off in the dark from the miles of beaches lining the French coast.“This is something completely new for us,” said Marc Bonnafous, who oversees the government’s search and rescue operation in the channel waters from the lighthouse high above the sea here at Cap Gris-Nez, up the coast from Boulogne. “And it has absolutely exploded.”Last year, around 500 migrants — 10 times as many as in 2017 — attempted the voyage across the channel, a trip of about 20 miles at its narrowest point. More than half made it across.The relatively small numbers notwithstanding, the crossings have set off large concerns in Britain, with headlines and anti-immigration politicians calling it a crisis. This month, the French interior minister, after talks with his British equivalent, announced that patrols would be increased at the port to try to stop any crossing attempts.Along the quays in Boulogne, the taciturn fishermen expressed surprise at the sudden intrusion of this new competitor for the sea.“This boat is my business. It’s my only enterprise,” said Jean-Marie Baheu, as he glumly tried to fix a lock damaged in a break-in on his boxy, 40-foot fishing boat, the Murex. Someone had tried to smash into the captain’s cabin several nights before, damaging the door.“We just don’t know what to do about this,” Mr. Baheu said, fiddling with a screwdriver.The Quai Gambetta, onto which deck hands from the Murex were hoisting crates of freshly caught crab as the captain worked on his repairs, gives out directly on to the sea and is the preferred docking spot for the port’s skippers. From here, they can unload their catch directly to the fish stalls run by relatives that line the waterfront.But the quay is readily accessible from the town, and its exposure makes the boats vulnerable. Twelve attempted break-ins have been logged in recent weeks, said Stéphane Pinto, the vice president of the regional fisherman’s committee.“We’ve never seen anything like this,” said Valerie Arnout, who was at her stand on the quay selling sole and skate caught by her brother that morning. “It’s really very disturbing.”The town, the largest fish-processing center in Europe, depends on its fleet for survival, so any threat to the boats is taken seriously. Some of the fishermen are vowing to sit up all night in their boats, cradling their guns.“It’s the worry above all,” Ms. Arnout said. “We’re all very concerned about it around here.”As other routes to Britain are blocked — the tunnel at Calais is sealed up tight and French officials have taken a tough line on the camps that once flourished at its edges, regularly dispersing them — the frigid, treacherous waters of the channel beckon to the desperate migrants.Most of those attempting the crossing by boat are Iranians, according to officials, in part because they have the means to pay the hefty fees demanded. In one recent case, a group of the migrants paid their smuggler 100,000 euros, around $115,000, officials said.The English Channel is one of the most heavily trafficked waterways in the world, with giant container ships and ferries whose wake could easily tip over the frail, inflatable skiffs typically used by the migrants — which is what makes the much more seaworthy fishing boats so attractive.“The risks are extremely high,” Mr. Bonnafous said.The currents are strong and constant, he added, and the water so cold that “you would survive for less than an hour.”In a marine police photograph of a rescue off Calais on Dec. 27, one man is clad in a T-shirt. Five of the 11 rescued had hypothermia.So far, there have been no reported deaths from the crossings, but Mr. Bonnafous thinks it is only a matter of time. And as news of the successful crossings reaches more migrants, the number of attempts is likely to rise, increasing the odds of fatalities. There were 78 crossings and attempts last year, with the number spiking in November and December.From the lighthouse where Mr. Bonnafous works, the white cliffs of Dover, England, are visible in the distance. His colleagues are bent over radar screens tracking the crossings.A boat taking what Mr. Bonnafous calls an “erratic” course will trigger an alarm among the rescuers, although it is often the migrants themselves who call the emergency number and ask to be rescued.The distress calls often come in the early morning hours, leaving the rescue teams the nightmare task of finding the small boats in the dark, “like looking for a needle in a haystack,” Mr. Bonnafous said.While the recent effort to steal Mr. Baheu’s boat failed, in a few cases the thieves have succeeded.In November, 17 Iranians made off with the Epervier, taking it from the docks of Boulogne and sailing to Dover, where they were arrested.And on a dark night just before Christmas, 14 migrants, including several children, made it seven miles off the coast on a boat stolen from the inner harbor at Boulogne, the St. Catherine, before the motor gave out. The thieves had forgotten to open the cooling valves.“They completely fried the motor,” said Quentin Gillon, who was sorting a tangled mass of ropes on the deck of the Saint Catherine, his cousin’s boat. “And then the boat got stuck.”On New Year’s Eve, it was the turn of the Caprice des Temps: The police, making the rounds on the quay, arrested 17 people, including a mother and two children, before the boat was able to depart.On Christmas Day, the dashboard of the Don Lubi, the boat belonging to Mr. Pinto, the regional fishing official, was ripped out. The thieves were trying to connect wires underneath to start the engine. They failed, but ruined the motor in the process. That same day, around 40 migrants made it across the Channel.Mr. Pinto said he was not unsympathetic to the plight of the migrants, but he was concerned both for their safety and his livelihood.“These nonprofits that are supposed to be helping the migrants, they should come down here on the quays and warn them not to risk their lives,” he said."
215,"WASHINGTON — For months, President Trump has been railing about the urgent need for a wall to protect against what he calls “an invasion” of illegal immigrants flooding across the southwestern border. But he has also been delivering another message: “We need workers,” he told a group of activists recently.In other words, he wants more immigrants.“I want people to come into our country, in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally,” Mr. Trump ad-libbed last month during his State of the Union address.Comments like those from the president have ignited furious criticism from his hard-line, anti-immigrant supporters who accuse him of caving to demands for cheap foreign labor from corporations, establishment Republicans and big donors while abandoning his election promise to protect his working-class supporters from the effects of globalism.“This is clearly a betrayal of what immigration hawks hoped the Trump administration would be for,” said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates cutting legal immigration by more than half. He warned that Mr. Trump was in danger of being “not even that different from a conventional Republican.”Breitbart News, a conservative website that promotes anti-immigrant messaging, published on Thursday the latest in a series of articles attacking Mr. Trump for catering to big business at the expense of the Americans who put him in the Oval Office. “Trump Requests ‘More’ Foreign Workers as Southern Border Gets Overrun,” the site blared on its home page.“That Mr. Trump would advance the interests of the global elite ahead of our citizens would be a tragic reversal on any day,” Lou Dobbs, the Fox Business Network host, said in a televised rant against the president on Wednesday evening. “The White House has simply lost its way.”Corporations and influential corporate conservatives such as Charles G. Koch and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have long urged the president to help them recruit the talent they need by expanding the number of workers who can enter the United States from other countries.That has become more urgent as the economy has improved and as declining unemployment has made it harder for companies to find workers. To assuage their concerns, Mr. Trump has increasingly tailored his immigration talking points to cater to the needs of business executives like those who attended a business round table on Wednesday at the White House.“We’re going to have a lot of people coming into the country. We want a lot of people coming in. And we need it,” Mr. Trump said as he sat next to Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, and other executives. “We want to have the companies grow, and the only way they’re going to grow is if we give them the workers, and the only way we’re going to have the workers is to do exactly what we’re doing.”But that message runs counter to the hard-line immigration image that Mr. Trump has carefully nurtured — most recently by shutting the government down for 35 days in a failed attempt to pressure Congress to fund a wall on the Mexican border.Mr. Trump won the White House in no small part by embracing anti-immigrant messaging that tapped into the economic fears of blue-collar workers upset about losing their jobs to foreign workers. Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, he attacked undocumented immigrants as “rapists and murderers” and called for a “big, beautiful wall” along the border with Mexico.Since becoming president, Mr. Trump has aggressively sought to crack down on illegal border crossings, increase deportations, cut the number of refugees allowed into the United States and make it harder for migrants to claim asylum. He has complained about drug dealers, gangs and members of Central American caravans pouring across the border. And last summer, his administration separated thousands of migrant children from their parents in an effort to deter Central American families from trying to seek refuge in the United States.The harsh record — and comments by Mr. Trump that disparaged African nations in vulgar terms and suggested that Haitian immigrants “all have AIDS” — has earned him the enmity of Democrats and immigration activists, who call him a racist president.It is unclear whether Mr. Trump will follow through on his recent, pro-business messaging. Many of the president’s aides — including Stephen Miller, his top immigration adviser in the White House — agree with the hard-line activists about the need to lower legal immigration.In 2017, Mr. Trump endorsed the Raise Act, a Republican Senate bill that would reduce legal immigration by as much as 50 percent. And the administration is currently considering a proposal to cut immigration by denying work authorizations, known as H-4 permits, to almost 100,000 spouses of immigrants who are brought in by companies to work legally in the United States.But even so, some of the nation’s most hard-line anti-immigration activists have become increasingly nervous that Mr. Trump might waver on their primary concern — the need to shrink the number of immigrants who enter the United States each year, currently 1.1 million.They argue that tight labor markets make it exactly the wrong time to allow more foreign workers to compete with Americans. Chris Chmielenski, the deputy director of NumbersUSA, which lobbies for lower legal immigration, said companies should be pressured to hire more Americans instead.“Anything we do now to bring in more foreign workers could actually reverse some of the economic gains over the last four years,” Mr. Chmielenski said. “We’re absolutely concerned. We feel this isn’t how he ran on the issue.”Last week, in an effort to communicate that message directly to Mr. Trump, NumbersUSA began airing an ad on Fox News Channel in the hopes that the president would get the message that his supporters do not want to let in more than one million immigrants each year.“The majority of voters say the number should be cut to 500,000 or less,” the ad said. “Americans want less immigration.”Mr. Krikorian, of the Center for Immigration Studies, said that companies that no longer have access to foreign workers would have no choice but to turn to Americans who are still struggling to find work: people with disabilities, teenagers, older people and even former convicts.He also said that modest increases in wages for workers would evaporate if companies were allowed to simply tap an unlimited pool of lower-paid workers from other countries.“If you want wages to go up,” Mr. Krikorian said, “you don’t import more foreign labor.”Business groups dispute that analysis. They argue that immigration expands the amount of business activity in the United States, adding jobs and increasing wages for the vast majority of American workers.“Our country has benefited tremendously from welcoming people who have contributed to our economy, our communities, across the board,” said James Davis, a spokesman for the Koch network. “We want to welcome in everyone who wants to contribute to our society. We want to see more legal immigration.”Todd Schulte, the president of FWD.us, a pro-immigration advocacy group that started with backing from Mark Zuckerberg, a founder of Facebook, said that “immigrants and immigration increase economic growth, they increase economic productivity and they increase wages for the overwhelming number of native-born Americans.”Mr. Schulte, whose group has been highly critical of Mr. Trump’s anti-immigrant messaging and policies, welcomed the president’s recognition that legal immigration is a positive thing for the United States’ economy.But he cautioned that Mr. Trump must be measured by his actions, not his words. He called on the president to halt the effort to deny the H-4 work permits to immigrant spouses.“He should stop trying to revoke the H-4 rule,” Mr. Schulte said. “Increasing legal immigration would help native-born Americans. Unfortunately, the record has been one bent on cutting overall immigration levels.”"

218,"McALLEN, Tex. — It was nearly 9 p.m., hours after the makeshift clinic for newly arrived migrants near the Mexican border in Texas was supposed to close, but the patients would not stop coming: A feverish teenager with a vile-smelling wound on his foot. A man with a head injury and bright red eyes. Children with fevers, coughs and colds.Earlier in the day, a little girl named Nancy had been brought into the clinic with a cough and shaking chills. She had been vomiting, she said, and her spine hurt. An assistant took her temperature. “She’s got 104, almost 105,” she said.The steady flow of migrants who arrived that night at the volunteer respite center operated by Catholic Charities here in the Rio Grande Valley had just been released by Customs and Border Protection after being apprehended near the border. The new arrivals had been in federal custody for up to 72 hours, but most had received no real medical attention — the volunteer physicians at the private clinic were the first doctors many had seen since crossing the border.“He may lose that leg,” Dr. Martin Garza, a local pediatrician who works at the clinic every other weekend, warned the father of the teenager with the foot wound, handing him a course of antibiotics to take with him. “I cleaned it up as much as I could.”An average of 2,200 migrants a day are now crossing the nation’s 1,900-mile border with Mexico, many after grueling journeys that leave them injured, sick or badly dehydrated. Yet most of the nation’s Customs and Border Protection facilities along the border lack sufficient accommodations, staffing or procedures to thoroughly assess health needs or provide more than basic emergency care, a situation that has led to dangerous medical oversights.[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]Six adults died in C.B.P. custody in the fiscal year ending in October, at least three of whom had a medical emergency shortly after being apprehended. Another, who had serious chronic diseases and was hospitalized, died from health complications last month. In December, two migrant children — Jakelin Caal Maquin, 7, and Felipe Gómez Alonzo, 8 — died within three weeks of each other after showing signs of illness while being held and transported by Border Patrol agents in Texas and New Mexico.A New York Times review of records and dozens of interviews with migrants, agents, researchers and health workers suggest that some of these deaths were not anomalies, but rather signs of entrenched problems that have repeatedly put detainees with medical conditions at risk.At respite centers like the one in McAllen, Tex., that shelter migrants for a night or two after they are released from Border Patrol custody, doctors say the care provided by the agency has sometimes been so poor that they have had to send new arrivals straight to emergency rooms.“They’re not treated as if their health and well-being is valued on any level,” said Dr. Anna Landau, a family medicine doctor who volunteers at a migrant shelter run by Catholic Community Services in Tucson. “How do you send people who are clearly hurting, clearly in pain and suffering, how do you just move them through as if they’re just another number, as opposed to an actual human being?”Migrants crossing the border from Mexico may be injured scaling barriers, in vehicle accidents, by gunfire or from nearly drowning. They may be suffering from dehydration, heat exhaustion or communicable illnesses — from influenza to chickenpox — that often spread in conditions of close confinement, though none so far have presented what health officials regard as an unusual or alarming public health or infectious disease threat. Some require medications for chronic diseases such as asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure. Yet Border Patrol facilities until now have failed to provide comprehensive health screenings for those in their care. Medications — including lifesaving prescriptions for such conditions as asthma, heart disease and infant diarrhea — are routinely confiscated. Some migrants describe being left alone in concrete cells with broken bones and recent surgeries, their pain medication deeply inadequate.In the coming days, the agency is expected to announce significant changes related to the health of migrants, including policies requiring Border Patrol agents to conduct more thorough interviews of each migrant who is processed through the system, and to refer all those who need care to a medical provider.The agency is also building a large new processing center in El Paso and adding $47 million to a private contract for migrant medical care.“We’re doing everything we can to ensure rapid medical care when needed,” Kirstjen Nielsen, the Homeland Security secretary, said at the White House in January. “The men and women of C.B.P. and ICE are doing the best they can with what they have, but they don’t have the facilities, the resources or the legal authorities to keep up with this crisis.”[Read: The Hidden Nightmare of Sexual Violence on the Border]Representative Raul Ruiz, a Democrat from California who is also a physician, helped secure funding for additional measures to improve migrant health after visiting border facilities where he said he saw children coughing and sneezing and infants without diapers, all packed tightly into cells with little in the way of food, soap and other basics. The Border Patrol stations and those working there were “unprepared, untrained and underequipped in dealing with the humanitarian needs of families,” he said.The moves come after years of warnings from both inside and outside government that were largely ignored by an agency that saw its primary mission as law enforcement — catching and deporting illegal border crossers, not nursing them back to health.“Border Patrol is a law enforcement agency. It’s not a humanitarian agency,” said Dr. Alexander L. Eastman, a senior medical officer with the Homeland Security Department who is trying to put into place, for the first time, a comprehensive approach to the care of migrants across the department.Some health care workers said they have seen Border Patrol agents in the field prioritize enforcement of immigration laws over migrants’ urgent medical needs. Ambulance crews near the border say they sometimes face delays at Border Patrol checkpoints.In one case around five years ago, described to The Times by two people who worked for an emergency medical response team in Starr County, Tex., a critically ill woman was driven across the bridge from Mexico into Rio Grande City and loaded into an ambulance from a nearby hospital. A paramedic, Sergio Garza Jr., began to help her with her breathing. But a C.B.P. employee, he said, opened the back doors of the vehicle and ordered the patient sent back, because she did not have papers to enter the United States.Mr. Garza and the director of his ambulance company protested, to no avail. Mr. Garza grudgingly transferred the patient back to a Mexican ambulance, which did not have trained personnel aboard, both he and the director recalled. Mr. Garza said he showed the patient’s husband how to squeeze an oxygen bag to try to keep his wife alive as she was driven toward a distant Mexican hospital. She died on the way there, the emergency workers said.For at least a decade, families and advocacy organizations have reported lapses in medical care for people in the custody of C.B.P. Complaints filed over the past few years included a mother who gave birth prematurely and was later forced to stay with the baby in a “dirty hold room,” a detainee who was refused access to prescribed heart medication, and a woman who had heavy vaginal bleeding after a sexual assault and was not provided any medical attention.The number of deaths remains unknown and is perhaps unknowable — the agency until December was not required to independently review or publicly report health-related deaths in its custody. And the consequences of failing to address urgent medical needs often emerge after detainees are quickly passed on to another agency, or released.In 2015, C.B.P. addressed some of the criticisms by establishing its first nationwide standards on transport and detention. However, the standards are nonbinding — the agency cannot be sued for not following them — and the subject of medical care in detention covers less than a page.Detention by Customs and Border Protection is intended to be brief — 72 hours or less, according to the standards. However that guideline is often broken. Felipe Gómez Alonzo, the boy who died in December and had influenza, was in his sixth day of detention when he was taken to a hospital, according to a timeline provided by the agency.At the hospital, Felipe was found to have a 103-degree fever. He was discharged from the emergency room several hours later, and agents took him back to a temporary holding cell at a highway checkpoint. Hours later, as the boy grew sicker, no medically trained agents were on duty there. He was returned to the hospital, but lost consciousness on the way.“Children should not be held in C.B.P. holding cells longer than 24 hours,” said Kathryn Hampton, a program officer for Physicians for Human Rights and the author of a recent study that found that the focus on securing the border has come at the cost of migrants’ safety.In some cases, Border Patrol agents take sick migrants to be seen at hospitals, but problems persist once they are brought back to C.B.P.’s crowded, ill-equipped facilities.Sonia Diaz-Castro, 39, an asylum seeker from Honduras, had fallen off the top of a 25-foot border wall as she entered the United States last year and was left barely able to move, with a broken elbow and pelvis.Border Patrol agents in New Mexico took her twice to local hospitals, and a doctor at one of them said he was promised by the agents that she would be given a wheelchair and have someone on hand to help her get around. She had neither. Though she was barely able to move, she was left alone in a concrete cell. When she had to use the toilet, she was forced to drag herself across the floor using her broken arm.“I just felt like crying out — like the only thing I could do was cry, and when I think about it, it still makes me want to cry,” Ms. Diaz-Castro said of the experience.On a typical afternoon in early February, Border Patrol radios in South Texas crackled with reports of “bodies,” people whose unauthorized crossing of the border had been detected by ground motion sensors and cameras on poles and tethered radar blimps.Agents responded as about 60 people from Honduras, Guatemala, Ecuador and Nicaragua, including mothers with children and some unaccompanied minors, clambered off rafts after crossing the Rio Grande. Hefting bags and babies, they climbed a muddy dirt path that cut through spiny brushlands, walking toward the agents, who awaited them at a gap in the border wall.René Reyes, a Border Patrol agent and emergency medical technician, eyeballed them for, he said, “anything life-threatening.”Mr. Reyes stopped briefly to ask parents about a boy with surgical scars on his head who was wearing a mask over his nose and mouth. He had a condition that causes too much fluid to build up in the brain, but he appeared stable. “The kids look O.K.,” Mr. Reyes concluded. His initial assessment of the entire group lasted less than five minutes.The children would get a more thorough medical check at their next stop, one of two temporary detention facilities in an industrial part of McAllen. Inside the agency’s largest processing center for migrants, chain-link fencing divides a vast warehouse with concrete floors into clusters of cells separating men from women and older children from parents. The site was opened in 2014 specifically for the temporary holding of families and unaccompanied children. When that site is full, an older facility with enclosed, jail-like cells processes families several blocks away.That afternoon, medical screeners sent a newly arrived 6-month-old, Victoria Medina, to the hospital after noticing that she was sick with a fever, severe cough and diarrhea. Hospital workers treated the baby and sent her back to C.B.P.That night Victoria’s mother, Mayte Medina, an 18-year-old from Honduras, lay on the bare floor of her chilly isolation cell under a thin Mylar sheet and held on tight to her coughing baby. The fever broke, but the diarrhea continued; the bottle of medicine Ms. Medina had carried with her to treat it had been in her backpack, which was confiscated when she was taken into custody. “I told everyone about it, everyone that saw her,” Ms. Medina said. “They never gave her anything.”Ms. Medina’s relatively easy access to medical care was possible in part because she was apprehended in the heart of the Rio Grande Valley, the most heavily trafficked way station for migrants in the United States. Last year, more than 63,200 migrants traveling as families were apprehended there.The Border Patrol facilities in McAllen are among the few in the country that have a small number of midlevel health professionals — nurse practitioners or physician assistants — on site. As government officials examine how they might expand medical services, those sites have been looked at as potential models.But even in those places, providing care in a facility where the ultimate decisions are controlled by law enforcement authorities sometimes frustrates practice and strains ethics. A former contract health care worker at the McAllen sites, who was not authorized to speak on the record by her previous employer, Loyal Source, recalled several occasions when she had alerted agents that a patient needed to go to the emergency room. Two or three hours later, she said, the patient was still there.Sometimes, she said, she blocked migrants with high fevers from being released to longer-term detention facilities. But she also sometimes felt intimidated, as if she would be blamed for slowing down the flow.She said that according to protocol, if a woman claimed that she had been raped, she had to be offered access to medical care to check for pregnancy, trauma and sexually transmitted infections. But that didn’t always occur, she said.In recent months, large groups of children and families have crossed into the United States  in remote desert areas lacking in medical infrastructure, including Antelope Wells, N.M., where one of the fatally ill children, Jakelin Caal Maquin, had arrived. A total of 15 Border Patrol stations or ports of entry that are within 100 miles of the southern border have no hospital within an hour’s drive, the Times review found.It is a perilous twist on a problem that has existed for years, after changes in border enforcement practices pushed furtive crossings into these areas.Some migrants encounter agents and turn themselves in; others spend days traversing vast ranchlands in extreme heat. Hundreds die every year. Agents often have to extract sick migrants from rough terrain to meet ambulance personnel, who may have to drive for hours to reach hospitals.An earlier attempt to solve the problem led to the creation in 1998 of a unit trained in tactical rescues and emergency medical services that has performed thousands of medical interventions. A separate program trains regular agents as emergency medical technicians. Over all, around 6 percent of Border Patrol agents can act as emergency medical services providers. Still, the vast majority have only basic training. Their protocols and equipment are limited. And they are not present everywhere their skills are needed.Where local emergency rooms are close at hand, Border Patrol agents tend to err on the side of caution, taking their charges for costly and sometimes unnecessary medical evaluations, several health providers said.In other cases, the Border Patrol focuses on moving migrants quickly through the system, and many end up in shelters and clinics run by charities, such as the one operated by Catholic Charities in McAllen.On a recent evening, dozens of migrants were dropped off at a shelter near the southern border of California, run by the San Diego Rapid Response Network. They stood outside, lined up near white tents under lights powered by a roaring generator. Medical workers supported by the county screened them for communicable diseases and other conditions.The rotating medical team diagnosed many untreated conditions that could spread, including 362 cases of lice, 113 cases of scabies, 22 cases of possible influenza, and four cases of chickenpox in the first two months of this year. The medical professionals referred 52 people to an emergency room.One young man stood out that evening. He limped to the tent on crutches, in great pain. A metal fixator emerged from his lower left leg, swaddled in layers of bloodied gauze. The only medical record a nurse could find in his belongings was a single X-ray showing a severe fracture he had sustained on his journey to the United States.The man had undergone surgery on his leg at a nearby hospital and was returned to detention the previous night. Now he was at the shelter. “They just dropped him here,” Dr. Kathy Fischer, the doctor on duty, said with a note of incredulity in her voice. “It’s kind of crazy.”"
219,"Donald Trump wants more than a wall.The president, once again, has created his own reality, manufactured a crisis, invented an invasion, criminalized immigrants, made up facts and, in a nationally televised speech on Tuesday, argued for a new wall at the United States-Mexico border. “How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?” he asked from the White House.Mr. Trump is not the first president to ask for money for a wall. George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush built fences and walls along the southern border. Barack Obama maintained the resulting system of roughly 700 miles of physical barriers. So why don’t we want Mr. Trump to build his wall? What is different?The difference is that Mr. Trump’s wall is a symbol of hate and racism, it would be completely useless, and it does not address any national emergency.The $5.7 billion requested by the Trump administration to build 234 more miles of walls and fences would be an enormous waste of time and money. Beginning with the first, 14-mile stretch of border fencing, built between San Diego and Tijuana in the early 1990s, undocumented immigrants have shown they can adapt very fast and move to areas with no border barriers. Deserts in Arizona and open areas along the Rio Grande in Texas are now a favorite point of entry. The same thing would happen with a new Trump wall.We also know that almost half of all undocumented immigrants arrive by plane or with a visa. They come legally as tourists or visitors and simply overstay their visas. The tallest fence cannot stop that.Nor would a new wall prevent the flow of illegal drugs entering the country, as Mr. Trump claimed in his speech. Most drug seizures happen at ports of entry. And as long as we have more than 28 million Americans regularly using illegal drugs, we will have drug dealers in Mexico and the rest of Latin America moving their products to the most profitable market in the world.The White House claims that 4,000 suspected terrorists were arrested along the southern border last year. That is simply wrong: A vast majority were detained at airports. Just six were actually caught crossing illegally by foot.I have recently traveled to the border in California and Texas, and I can report that contrary to what the president said in his speech, there is no invasion. The undocumented population has not grown in a decade; in fact it has fallen to 10.7 million. And despite the presence of violent drug cartels on the Mexican side, the American border towns are among the safest in the country.What is undeniable is the humanitarian crisis in Tijuana. But it is a crisis created in part by Mr. Trump. Record numbers of desperate families, fleeing violence, corruption and extreme poverty, have been arriving in caravans to our southern border. Instead of their asylum requests being promptly processed, as established by international and United States laws, only a few are allowed in every day. This policy of cruelty by design has unjustly affected children and the most vulnerable people in our hemisphere. These refugees certainly do not pose a danger to our national security.There is no need for a new wall — except, of course, in Mr. Trump’s mind. The closest he got to building his wall was in January 2018, when Democratic senators negotiated a compromise for a wall in exchange for legislation on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Then the White House unexpectedly walked away from the deal.Would the Democrats revisit the offer? Luis Gutierrez, who recently retired from the House of Representatives after 26 years, once explained to me that it was like paying a ransom for a kidnapping. If the White House brings up the deal this time, it will put the Democrats in a moral dilemma: Protect the Dreamers — maybe including siblings and families — and, in the process, open the government. But the wall would be an essential element of any new deal.It won’t be easy. It is no longer 2018. Things have changed dramatically. Democrats control the House and the wall has become toxic. And then, there is the racist thing.The wall has become a metaphor to Mr. Trump and his millions of supporters. It represents a divide between “us” and “them,” a physical demarcation for those who refuse to accept that in just a few decades, a majority of the country will be people of color.This is about more than just a wall. Mr. Trump promised it in 2015, in the same speech in which he announced his candidacy, the same speech in which he called Mexican immigrants rapists, criminals and drug traffickers. His goal was to exploit the anxiety and resentment of voters in an increasingly multicultural, multiethnic society. Mr. Trump’s wall is a symbol for those who want to make America white again.The chant “Build that wall, build that wall” became his hymn — and an insult not just to Latinos but also to all people who do not share his xenophobic ideals. The wall went from a campaign promise to a monument built on bigoted ideas. That is why most Americans cannot say yes to it. Every country has a right to protect its borders. But not to a wall that represents hate, discrimination and fear.No, Mexico will not pay for the wall. And it seems Congress won’t either. But the concept of America as an unwelcoming country to immigrants and uncomfortable for minorities is already here.In a way, Mr. Trump already got what he wanted. He is the wall."
220,"WASHINGTON — When Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California stepped to a microphone last week and pronounced President Trump’s border wall “an immorality,” most Democrats cheered and nodded their heads.But a few privately grimaced, worried that such stark terminology could make it more difficult for Democrats and Republicans to find their way out of an impasse over border security that has partially shuttered the government for three weeks, deprived about 800,000 federal workers of their pay and increasingly threatens beneficiaries of federal programs.Democrats, said one Democratic lawmaker from a Republican-leaning district who insisted on anonymity to offer a candid assessment, cannot be seen by the public as calling border security immoral.The divide illustrates why Democrats are working to focus public attention on the painful costs of the partial government shutdown — vulnerable families going without food assistance, farmers forgoing crop payments, national parks trashed — and Mr. Trump’s recklessness in courting it, rather than delving into the specific details of erecting a barrier on the southwestern border.While Mr. Trump has launched an elaborate public-relations effort to draw Democrats into a debate over the wall itself — even the material to be used to construct it — Democrats are just as determined to talk instead about a more universally resonant theme: the need to get the government open and functioning while negotiations continue.It is at the heart of Ms. Pelosi’s plan this week to push through the House a series of bills to reopen shuttered federal agencies, including one that passed Wednesday for the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service, among others. Like the others poised to be approved this week in the Democrat-controlled chamber, it is expected to die in the Republican-controlled Senate.The goal: to win over more Republicans in the House and raise pressure in the Senate, where on Tuesday, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska became the latest Republican to call for a vote to reopen the government as talks on border security continue.For Democrats, newly in control of the House, the shutdown fight has proved unifying, crystallizing a near-universal belief in their ranks that Congress should act as a check on the power of a president who has shown little regard for the law and has used his office to sow fear and misinformation on issues like immigration.But while they are almost all opposed to the idea of a wall between the United States and Mexico — which is unpopular among a majority of Americans and strongly opposed by Democratic voters, and which has been dismissed as ineffective by border security experts — Democrats are less united about what form of border security they do support.Some of them, including Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, voted in 2006 for 700 miles of fencing along the border, a position the White House has repeatedly sought to spotlight.On Tuesday, on the morning of Mr. Trump’s address to the nation on the topic, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, did not mention the word “wall” once in 11 minutes of opening remarks with reporters. He then sidestepped a question about the difference between fencing and other border security measures that Democrats have backed in the past and the wall that the president is demanding.“I didn’t answer it, maybe because I don’t have an answer that I think is a really good answer,” he finally conceded. “Fencing and walls have the same effect. One is supported by a large number of experts, but a large number of experts think neither are that effective.”The reality is that making a nuanced argument about border security — a highly technical and politically charged issue — is difficult and divisive. Some Democrats have learned that the hard way in recent days.Representative Adam Smith of Washington, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, seemed to break from Ms. Pelosi’s “immorality” remark during an interview Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” when he tried to explain his past votes for border barriers.“The wall is not in itself a bad idea, it’s just — it’s been done,” Mr. Smith said. “And what the president has not done is, he has not made the case that on the portions of the border where a wall has not been built, how is a wall going to actually enhance border security?”Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, jumped on Mr. Smith’s remarks, saying, “That’s a very different point than the one that Speaker Pelosi continues to make, which is that a wall is immoral.”When Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said this week that Mr. Trump’s recent talk of a wall made of steel slats rather than concrete was “progress,” he quickly clarified that he was not, in fact, buying into the president’s idea.“I said that it was a minor step,” he told CNN on Tuesday. “I was accepting that steel slats are preferred by the Department of Homeland Security over a concrete wall; I was not saying that I think that we should be pouring billions of dollars into a border barrier.”And Ms. Pelosi has also sought to press the more practical argument. On a card of talking points distributed Wednesday by her office, Democrats were instructed to emphasize that they favor “smart, effective” border security solutions, and to focus on Mr. Trump’s tactics. “There is no reason for President Trump to keep government shut down over his demands for an ineffective, wasteful wall,” the card said.Democratic strategists argue that Mr. Trump’s failure to build broad public support for a wall that he has been demanding since the early days of his presidential candidacy has made it easier for Democrats to stake out a unified message.“Obviously, there are some Democrats who talk about the wall being immoral or inconsistent with American values, but across the spectrum of Democrats, there is an emphasis on the degree to which the wall is waste of taxpayers’ money and irrelevant to addressing the most important challenges we face with regard to immigration in the country,” said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. “Democrats are being helped a little bit by Trump’s specificity in what he’s looking for. He keeps talking about something that is very specific, and is something that more than half of all Americans oppose.”Nick Gourevitch, a pollster and communications strategist who advised Democrats during the midterm campaign on Mr. Trump’s fear-soaked immigration message, said Democrats are sticking to the simplest and freshest argument they have to appeal to a public that does not focus on the finer points of border security policy.“The wall is unpopular, and the wall combined with the shutdown is even more unpopular,” Mr. Gourevitch said.“Most presidents don’t lose in a wave election and then double down on the strategy that got them there,” he added, “but that’s what this president seems to be doing.”"
221,"McALLEN, Tex. — When a president comes to town there are two realities, the one the White House hopes to create and the one that actually exists.President Trump arrived in this city on the Mexican border on Thursday to dramatize his desire for a border wall, a hardened position that has caused the partial shutdown of the federal government.He surrounded himself with border agents, victims of horrible crimes, a display of methamphetamine and heroin, an AK-47 and an AR-15 rifle, and a trash bag stuffed with $362,062 in cash that had been confiscated by law enforcement officials.In his view, it all added up to a single word, “crisis,” with a lone solution, building a wall — a point he emphasized in a discussion with the crime victims, law enforcement officers and McAllen residents.“That says it all,” Mr. Trump said of the contraband. “They didn’t have to go very far. This is all very recent.”But there was another reality. The display of drugs, weapons and cash was mainly the product of law enforcement actions stopping criminals at international bridges, where most drugs are smuggled, and conventional ports of entry.In a place where a wall is already in place, law enforcement officials boasted of apprehending criminals who had built a tunnel. The money was taken from a suspect who had overstayed a visa.In a meeting on Tuesday with network anchors before his prime-time address to the nation, Mr. Trump had dismissed the trip to McAllen as a waste of time, a mere photo op. But he gamely went forward after arriving here early Thursday afternoon.A few miles south of McAllen, he stood near a bluff above the Rio Grande, with Mexico in the near distance. There were more border agents, an array of military vehicles and a helicopter flyover for effect with agents saluting the commander in chief. The Fox host Sean Hannity stood nearby, waiting for an exclusive interview.Hundreds of people lined a nearby highway, many waving signs backing Mr. Trump. The border agents who assembled for the meeting also gave him hearty cheers. One supporter was Joe Cantu, a former police chief from a nearby town wearing a Make America Great Again baseball cap and T-shirt.“They’re coming over in Banzai waves,” Mr. Cantu said of immigrants crossing into Texas.Other signs told a different story. They said “No Wall, No Hate,” “We Are All Immigrants” and “Our Only Crisis Is Trump’s Failing Presidency.”On the route from the meeting to the photo op along the Rio Grande, the president’s motorcade also passed numerous product distribution centers, large, low-slung buildings that employ hundreds of people. Those businesses are a product of Nafta, the commercial agreement with Mexico and Canada that Mr. Trump has labeled the worst of all time, but that has transformed South Texas over the last two decades.The McAllen area is heavily Democratic and the local congressman opposes the wall, as do many local officials. Still, the scene was a draw.“I just wanted to get a picture,” said Veronica Whitacre, a local city commissioner and McAllen native. “It’s sad for South Texas that people believe we live in a dangerous place. When I go places, people ask where I am from and I say McAllen. And people say, ‘Are you O.K.?’”The city is certainly O.K. when it comes to crime, which is near a 30-year low. The president did not talk about that. “You’ll have crime in Iowa, you’ll have crime in New Hampshire, you’ll have crime in New York without a wall,” Mr. Trump said.Mr. Trump did not discuss the significant increase in cases of children being separated from their families as a result of his hard-line immigration policies. He spoke only a few blocks from a detention center, but did not go in. When asked by a reporter if he would visit it, the president said that he would like to, but that it would be up to the Secret Service. He did not go.He also criticized Democrats who have accused him of trying to manufacture a crisis to justify his $5.7 billion border barrier demand. “What’s manufactured is the word manufactured,” the president said.Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary who accompanied Mr. Trump to Texas, reiterated the administration’s position that what is happening along the border is a crisis.Those who claim it was manufactured, she said, “insulted” Americans. To that, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, who joined the president and his entourage, added, “When we see politicians go on TV and say the border’s secure and there is no crisis, they are ignoring reality.”Not to be outdone, Dan Patrick, the Texas lieutenant governor, added, “To those who say this is a manufactured crisis, it’s a manufactured cover-up by your opposition.”Democrats have insisted that the administration faces a large-scale humanitarian problem that is a direct result of Mr. Trump’s policy, but argue that a border wall is not the right solution and that Mr. Trump has failed to make the case that there is a true security crisis.A local pastor sympathetic to the president emphasized during a round-table discussion that the crisis was “humanitarian” in nature.Still, Mr. Trump said that he had a “feel about things” and could sense Democrats moving toward his position.“I know you don’t see it yet, but I have a feel about things, and I really believe the other side is starting to get it.”Representative Vicente Gonzalez, a Democrat whose district includes McAllen, was in Washington while the president visited his hometown. But he closely monitored Mr. Trump’s trip.“It’s all theatrics,” Mr. Gonzalez said in an interview, before insisting that Mr. Trump was somehow trying to escape the government shutdown with a victory.Mr. Gonzalez added: “He’s trying to land the plane, and I think he knows time is not on his side. So he came down to the border to try to make a final case.”"
222,"How fitting is it that President Trump’s first Oval Office address, which he requested be televised live in prime time by every major network, was aimed at stirring up the American public about a crisis largely of his own making?Not that the border crisis is one of Mr. Trump’s self-serving political fictions — like the deep state or widespread voter fraud. It may have started out that way, but the situation has, with the president’s nurturing, become something far more tragic.Pursuing poorly thought-out and even more poorly executed policies on the pretext of battling a nonexistent national security crisis, Mr. Trump has helped create a pressing humanitarian one. Desperate migrant families being detained en masse at the border are overwhelming a system pushed beyond its limits by an administration that chose to ignore the implications of its actions — overcrowding, children falling gravely ill and, paradoxically, the haphazard release of throngs of detainees into border communities stretching from California to Texas.Mr. Trump is now invoking the urgency of the situation as a justification for pursuing more wasteful, hard-line measures that most Americans do not support, chiefly the ludicrous border wall over which he has shut down critical pieces of the government. The president and his enablers have been busily knitting together inaccurate data, misleading anecdotes, exaggerations and other “alternative facts” about the flow of criminals, drugs and terrorists across the southern border. He seems to hope he can paint a dystopian landscape of security threats and human suffering so dire that the American people will rally to his side and pressure congressional Democrats to succumb to his demands for a towering wall — preferably concrete, but at this point, it seems, steel will suffice.Failing that, Mr. Trump has also been floating the possibility of stiff-arming Congress altogether. With his advisers increasingly anxious that Republican lawmakers are poised to abandon them on the shutdown, the president has raised the threat of declaring a national emergency, which he thinks would allow him to command the Pentagon to build his wall. Such a move would prompt a swift and furious legal challenge, if not a full-blown constitutional crisis, that could drag on indefinitely. It would, however, also give Mr. Trump a way to reach a wall-free funding deal with Congress without losing face, thus weaseling out of the shutdown box into which he has nailed himself.The border wall began life as an applause line at Mr. Trump’s rallies, and it has endured as the rare — perhaps even sole — policy objective that actually matters to him. The substance of true border security may not interest him much, but this symbol sure does. While Mr. Trump proved a wily campaigner and political street fighter, as president he has been painfully out of his element. Two years in, he remains ill suited to the complicated, thankless, often grinding work of leading the nation. Governance clearly bores him, as do policy details both foreign and domestic. He has proved a poor judge of talent. He prefers grandstanding to negotiating, and he continues to have trouble with the whole concept of checks and balances. While the Republican base remains enamored of him, most of the electorate has grown weary of his outrages and antics.Which is why, with his wall on the line, Mr. Trump so desperately needs to convince the American people that they are facing an acute crisis — maybe even a bona fide emergency.In times of trouble, an anxious public looks to its leaders, and the ability to telegraph strength, decisiveness and certitude assumes greater value than in periods of calm and prosperity. Circle-the-wagons patriotism, maybe even a little jingoism, becomes more appealing. People long to feel protected.With his demagogy, Mr. Trump managed to fuel a sense of insecurity and unease throughout his campaign, along with the idea that he alone could Make America Great Again. In office, he has attempted to perpetuate that angst by proclaiming existential threats to the Republic, be they migrant caravans storming the border, Muslim terrorists flooding the airports or violent immigrants roaming the countryside. Shutting down the government is only the most recent effort at getting what he wants by traumatizing the nation he has sworn to serve.Were Mr. Trump truly interested in securing the border, and easing the suffering his policies are making worse, there are immediate steps he could take. For starters, he could end this wretched shutdown so that the people responsible for protecting the border can get paid, immigration judges can return to processing asylum claims and, yes, the physical and virtual barriers already in place can be maintained and perhaps even improved.Beyond that, he would need to ease up on the my-way-or-the-highway swagger and sit down for a real discussion with lawmakers about how to address the deep dysfunction of this nation’s immigration system. None of which would be as sensational as grabbing some prime-time airtime.It would, however, be a sign that the president is at last getting serious about immigration concerns he has thus far done nothing but exacerbate."
223,"As the government shutdown over President Trump’s demand for border-wall funding moves through week three, the administration is looking to cut a deal with Democrats by emphasizing the deepening humanitarian crisis at the border — a crisis caused in large part by this administration’s inhumane policies, political grandstanding and managerial incompetence.In a letter Sunday to lawmakers, the White House laid out its latest proposal for addressing the border tumult. The administration called for more immigration and Border Patrol agents, more detention beds and, of course, $5.7 billion to build 234 new miles of border wall. The White House also demanded an additional $800 million for “urgent humanitarian needs,” such as medical support, transportation and temporary facilities for processing and housing detainees.Translation: Mr. Trump’s mass incarceration of migrant families is overwhelming an already burdened system that, without a giant injection of taxpayer dollars, will continue to collapse, leading to ever more human suffering.The situation is an especially rich example of the Trump Doctrine: Break something, then demand credit — and in this case a lot of money — for promising to fix it.Late last week, frustrated by his standoff with Democrats, Mr. Trump even threatened to declare a national emergency in order to get his wall built without Congress’s approval — a move guaranteed to prompt a ferocious legal challenge.Any attempt to sell Mr. Trump’s cruel immigration agenda with a veneer of humanitarian measures should be viewed with skepticism. This administration has long held that the best way to deal with asylum seekers fleeing the horrors of their home countries is to increase their suffering upon reaching the United States to discourage others from even trying. There is no question but that the administration remains ill equipped to cope with the fallout from its narrow fixation on deterrence. Migrant children are being piled into holding cells where they fall ill — or worse. The number of detainees at Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities has swelled to unprecedented levels, requiring periodic mass releases. Without preparation or planning, hundreds of migrants are simply dropped off at bus stations in border cities. The Times found that, in the final week of December, some 600 migrants were unceremoniously released onto the streets of El Paso.Mr. Trump’s spiteful choice to shut parts of the government is only making the situation messier. Immigration judges are being furloughed, further slowing the processing of asylum requests. Border Patrol agents are working without pay, eroding morale. In perhaps the choicest twist of fate, some $300 million in new contracts for wall construction cannot be awarded until the shutdown ends. With Democrats now controlling the House, the president is right to assume that he will need a new negotiating approach. But the answer isn’t for lawmakers to throw good money after bad, or to try to prettify a retrograde agenda with humanitarian trimmings.The Trump administration is asking Congress and the American public to embrace warped logic, that its policies are going to continue and that the only question is whether any money should be spent on measures to ease the suffering caused by those policies. After two years of watching this administration run amok, surely Democratic lawmakers can come up with a better approach."
224,"WASHINGTON — Stephen Miller was furious — again.The architect of President Trump’s immigration agenda, Mr. Miller was presiding last month over a meeting in the White House Situation Room when he demanded to know why the administration officials gathered there were taking so long to carry out his plans.A regulation to deny welfare benefits to legal immigrants — a change Mr. Miller repeatedly predicted would be “transformative” — was still plodding through the approval process after more than two years, he complained. So were the new rules that would overturn court-ordered protections for migrant children. They were still not finished, he added, berating Ronald D. Vitiello, the acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.“You ought to be working on this regulation all day every day,” he shouted, as recounted by two participants at the meeting. “It should be the first thought you have when you wake up. And it should be the last thought you have before you go to bed. And sometimes you shouldn’t go to bed.”A few weeks after that meeting, the consequences of Mr. Miller’s frustration and the president he was channeling have played out in striking fashion.Mr. Trump has withdrawn Mr. Vitiello’s nomination to permanently lead ICE and pushed out Kirstjen Nielsen, his homeland security secretary. The department’s acting deputy secretary, Claire Grady, and the Secret Service director, Randolph D. Alles, are departing as well. And the White House has made it clear that others, including L. Francis Cissna, the head of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, and John Mitnick, the department’s general counsel, are likely to go soon.Mr. Trump insisted in a tweet on Saturday that he was “not frustrated” by the situation at the border, where for months he has said there is a crisis that threatens the nation’s security. But unable to deliver on his central promise of the 2016 campaign, he has targeted his administration’s highest-ranking immigration officials.And behind that purge is Mr. Miller, the 33-year-old White House senior adviser. While immigration is the issue that has dominated Mr. Trump’s time in office, the president has little interest or understanding about how to turn his gut instincts into reality. So it is Mr. Miller, a fierce ideologue who was a congressional spokesman before joining the Trump campaign, who has shaped policy, infuriated civil liberties groups and provoked a bitter struggle within the administration.White House officials insisted to reporters last week that they had no choice but to move against administration officials unwilling or unable to make their agencies produce results. One senior administration official at the White House, who requested anonymity to discuss what he called a sensitive topic, said many of the administration’s core priorities have been “either moving too slowly or moving in the wrong direction.”But current and former officials from those agencies, who also requested anonymity to discuss contentious relations with the White House, describe a different reality.The purge, they said, was the culmination of months of clashes with Mr. Miller and others around the president who have repeatedly demanded implementation of policies that were legally questionable, impractical, unethical or unreasonable. And when officials explained why, it further infuriated a White House set on making quick, sweeping changes to decades-old laws.In a twist, many of the officials who have clashed with the White House were the president’s own political appointees, who share his broad goal of limiting immigration into the United States. To that end, they have already succeeded in lowering the number of refugees allowed into the United States, imposing a travel ban on entry from mostly Muslim nations, speeding up denaturalization proceedings, slowing asylum processing at ports of entry and developing proposals to limit work permits for spouses of high-tech workers.“I don’t think the president’s really cleaning house,” said Thomas D. Homan, a former acting ICE director and strong supporter of the president’s immigration agenda. “I think he’s setting the reset button.”A White House spokesman declined a request for comment. But even several of the most right-wing, anti-immigration groups have had a mixed reaction to the treatment of the immigration officials Mr. Trump and Mr. Miller have targeted.The Center for Immigration Studies tweeted that “Nielsen got tough at the end of her tenure, but it was largely too little, too late.” The Federation for American Immigration Reform wrote: “Under Francis Cissna’s leadership, USCIS has issued a steady stream of policy changes and regulations that are firmly in line with President Trump’s immigration agenda. Removing him would be a huge mistake.”But it has not been enough for Mr. Miller and his allies in the White House feeling the constant pressure from Mr. Trump.Perhaps the greatest point of contention within the administration has been the asylum laws that are the root cause of the most vivid manifestation of the immigration issue: the hundreds of thousands of migrant families from Central America who have surged toward the southwestern border, fleeing violence and poverty.In a Tuesday afternoon “deputies” conference call last year with about 50 or 60 officials from across government, Mr. Miller demanded to know why nearly all of the families seeking asylum were passing the first hurdle — a screening interview to determine whether they have a “credible fear” of persecution if they were returned to their home countries.Mr. Miller and others in the White House were outraged that 90 percent or more of the applicants passed the first screening, a concern during the Bush administration, as well. Immigration judges ultimately deny all but about 20 percent of the asylum requests, but because of a backlog of hundreds of thousands of cases, many asylum seekers wait years for their case to be heard for the second time, giving them the chance to gain work permits, build roots and disappear in the United States.To Mr. Miller, the asylum process was a giant loophole that needed to be plugged. And he faulted the asylum officers at Citizenship and Immigration Services who were conducting the screenings for having a cultural bias that made them overly sympathetic to the asylum seekers. “You need to tighten up,” Miller insisted.Immigration officials on the conference call did not disagree that too many migrants were granted asylum in the initial “credible fear” screening. But the rules for conducting the screenings were written into law by Congress and designed to be generous so that persecuted people had a real opportunity to seek asylum. It was unclear, the officials said, what else the agency could do.Listening to Mr. Miller continue to hammer the issue, two people on the call recalled, it was almost as if Mr. Miller wanted asylum officers to ignore the law. At one point during the call, Mr. Cissna erupted in frustration.“Enough. Enough. Stand down!” he said.But such pressure from the White House was hardly unique, according to officials from multiple agencies.For instance, a federal judge last week ruled that the White House early in the administration had improperly pressured officials at Citizenship and Immigration Services to terminate an immigration program for Haiti called Temporary Protected Status.The judge said the decision in 2017 to end the program was contrary to the statute and indicated that the White House had strongly influenced the department.More recently, White House officials pushed during one of the Tuesday afternoon conference calls to have Border Patrol agents, instead of asylum officers, conduct “credible fear” interviews. The notion, they said, was that the Border Patrol agents could process interviews quickly and cut out the several-day wait to schedule a meeting with an asylum officer.Many of the immigration officials recoiled at the idea. Assigning agents to interview duty would pull them from their primary roles at the ports and along the border. Even worse, asylum laws require interviewers to undergo up to two months of training that would strain the already understaffed Border Patrol stations.But even if they could be trained, officials told the White House, the logistics would be a nightmare. Cramped Border Patrol stations — many of which look like small, rural police stations — were not set up to conduct scores of two-hour interviews with hundreds of migrants flooding into border communities each day.When the idea leaked out in early April, immigrant rights advocates accused the Trump administration of trying to prevent migrants from having a real chance at asylum.“Border Patrol officers are simply not qualified to do this,” said Eleanor Acer, the director of the refugee program at Human Rights First. “This will put unfit, untrained and unqualified agents in charge of determining who warrants potentially lifesaving protection in the United States.”To Mr. Miller and other White House officials, it was another instance in which the law and machinations of government were getting in the way of needed changes. And they think there are many others.In November, as Mr. Trump railed publicly about the dangers of migrant caravans from Central America, a top White House domestic policy adviser floated the idea of  taking migrants who had been apprehended to so-called sanctuary cities represented by Democrats. Homeland security officials, who saw the idea as political retribution, resisted.In an email, Matthew Albence, the acting deputy director of ICE, said that it would create “an unnecessary operational burden” and that transporting the migrants to a different location was not “a justified expenditure.” Lawyers at the Department of Homeland Security, including Mr. Mitnick, also questioned the idea’s legality.The idea was dropped until last week, when news stories about the rejected proposal prompted Mr. Trump to say his administration was still considering the option.Mr. Trump has also not given up on the idea of shutting down the southern border, a move economists have said would be catastrophic and halt nearly $1.7 billion of goods and services that flow across the border each day.Even as Mr. Trump retreated publicly and said he would give Mexico a year to do more to prevent migrants from reaching the southern border of the United States, he has made it clear to his advisers privately that the closing was still on the table.His insistence increased the friction with his top immigration officials, especially Ms. Nielsen, who tried to talk him out of closing the ports of entry and refusing to grant asylum. Ms. Nielsen explained why she could not do that, citing economic and legal issues — banning migrants from seeking asylum would be against the law.When Ms. Nielsen did not give the president the answer he sought, he turned to Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, and asked him to stop migrants from entering the country. Mr. Trump told Mr. McAleenan that he would pardon him if he ran into any legal problems, according to officials familiar with the conversation — though he denied it in a tweet Saturday night.Ms. Nielsen’s refusal to shut down the southern border appeared to be the final straw for Mr. Trump. After forcing her resignation, he named Mr. McAleenan the acting secretary of the department.But Mr. Miller remains unsatisfied. Lately, he has made clear to immigration officials and others in the White House that he remains frustrated with the still-pending regulation on welfare benefits for immigrants. After nearly two years of painstaking work and more than 200,000 public comments, the 447-page rule is on track to eventually be published.And it is not clear that the political bloodletting is over. Mr. Cissna and Mr. Mitnick remain in bureaucratic limbo, having received neither their walking papers nor an explicit stay of execution. While Mr. McAleenan is now the acting secretary of homeland security, rumors persist that Mr. Trump may want someone else to be the permanent head of the department.Inside the immigration agencies, there is a persistent rumor that Mr. Trump may yet name an immigration czar to better coordinate — or, some believe, control — the sprawling immigration bureaucracy."
225,"REYNOSA, Mexico — As the human smugglers stalk the bus stations, migrant shelters and twisting streets of this Mexican border town, they have no trouble collecting clients like Julian Escobar Moreno.The Honduran migrant arrived in Reynosa, Mexico, intending to apply for asylum in the United States. But new policies north of the border have instead driven him into the hands of the city’s smuggling cartels, whose business is booming.“I honestly don’t want to cross illegally, but I don’t really have a choice,” said Mr. Moreno, 37.The Trump administration, which has partially shut down the federal government in a fight over funding for an enhanced border wall, has adopted a number of strategies over the last two years to deter migrants and persuade them to turn around — or not to come at all.Its latest effort is a policy that admits only a few asylum seekers a day, if that, at border crossings. As a result of this metering, migrants are now waiting on the Mexican side of the border for weeks and months before they can submit their applications.In Reynosa and elsewhere, the delays caused by the policy are prompting many migrants to weigh the costs and dangers of a faster option: hiring a smuggler, at an increasingly costly rate, to sneak them into the United States.In November, the number of migrant families apprehended attempting to cross the border skyrocketed to its highest levels on record, with some of those caught having turned to smugglers at some point in their trip.“What we have seen is that no one is getting across the border,” said Hector Silva, the director of a center providing services to migrants that sits near the banks of the Rio Grande, which separates Reynosa from McAllen, Tex. “This forces families, with all the desperation they feel, to go illegally.”The decision to endure a long wait or illegally expedite the journey to the United States is playing out not only in Reynosa, where the crack of gunfire has become a soundtrack of the city, but across the long sweep of the United States-Mexico border, all the way to Tijuana, where a crisis is unfolding as thousands of Central Americans wait their turn to cross the border.A visit to a Reynosa migrant shelter quickly makes it clear how many are considering the smuggling option.“I’m scared to go to the border crossing, because they will deport me,” said Maximo Rene Arana Nunez, a Guatemalan who arrived in Reynosa a few days ago and is looking to cross. “I’m stuck here until my family in the United States can save enough money to pay for a smuggler.”According to those recently deported, migrants who are attempting to cross and local officials, the price that smugglers can command is rising along with the demand for their services.For those able to afford it, and willing to accept the risk, finding smugglers in Reynosa is easy. The streets seethe with smuggling cartel agents, who openly pitch their services.The dangers of an illegal crossing are not enough to dissuade migrants. They are fearful, but many feel they have no other recourse. For many, the calculation is predicated on a simple truth: What lies behind them is worse than what may lie ahead.“I don’t have an option, I can’t be there,” Mr. Moreno said of his native Honduras. “Our government is totally corrupt, and if the Mexicans or Americans deport me, I’m dead.”Mr. Moreno now works 12-hour shifts on the outskirts of the city, trying to save enough to pay for a smuggler.For other migrants in the shelter, the equation was not necessarily of life or death, but of exchanging well-known hardship for vaguer hope.“Look, we know what the situation is in our country,” said Osman Noe Guillén, 28, who reached Reynosa with his partner shortly after their marriage, having treated the ride on the buses up from Honduras as something of a honeymoon. “We don’t know what will happen when we cross.”Mr. Guillén gripped the hand of his wife, Lilian Marlene Menéndez, and allowed himself a smile. Blind faith and economic need were enough for them. They did not know how grim and dangerous Reynosa was before they arrived, only that it was the closest crossing from Honduras and therefore the cheapest to reach.Yes, they had heard the angry rhetoric about migrants coming out of the United States, they said, and knew about the deportations and long waits at the border. But they didn’t care.“Desperation makes you do crazy things,” Mr. Guillén said. “I don’t think anything would stop me. And certainly not a wall.”The couple, having priced out the next leg of the journey with local smugglers, said they had accepted the risks of continuing. The smugglers, or polleros, are known to kill or strand migrants who falter in their payments, and to extort those who have families that can mortgage homes or drum up more money.In recent days, the couple was quoted a price of $7,000 apiece just to make it to the banks on the Texas side of the river.That appears to be on the higher end; many Central Americans recently have been quoted $5,500 to be ferried to reach the other side of the river. Not long ago, $4,000 was the going rate.Some of the migrants interviewed who were planning to try the smuggling route said they still intended to apply for asylum if and when they made it to the United States.While the United States’ revised policy toward asylum seekers is primarily aimed at dissuading Central American migrants from making the trip to the border, it is also affecting Mexican policy and the lives of Mexicans in border cities.The mayor of Reynosa, Maki Esther Ortiz Dominguez, noted that her city, in the state of Tamaulipas, was already one of the most dangerous in Mexico. She said she is worried the situation in Reynosa could grow even worse, as migrants are either preyed upon by criminals or recruited to join their ranks.“This policy could at any moment detonate a new crime wave here,” Ms. Ortiz Dominguez said.In the center of the bridge that connects Reynosa with McAllen, the United States Border Patrol this summer constructed a new booth for prescreening people hoping to make it into American territory. At least two officers are on duty in the tiny structure, asking everyone who passes for their documentation.More recently, Mexican officials have begun acting as a first line of border defense. As people queue up to cross the bridge, Mexican agents are now pulling Central Americans out of the line, demanding their paperwork and detaining them if they have not filled out the proper documentation.Some have languished for months waiting for family members to send money to pay the fee for the paperwork.The new approach by Mexican agents at the border was begun under pressure from the United States, said one Mexican official in Reynosa, requesting anonymity because this person was not authorized to discuss the decision publicly.It was this new approach by the authorities in Mexico that ensnared Mr. Moreno.Having been run out of Honduras by the notorious 18th Street gang for refusing to work for them, he believed he had a good case for political asylum in the United States and went to the bridge in Reynosa so he could start the application process.But moments after arriving with his pregnant wife and three children at the foot of the international bridge, he and his family were stopped by Mexican officials and detained.A few months ago, Mr. Moreno’s lack of proper paperwork would have been ignored by the Mexican authorities, according to local officials and immigration lawyers. But Mr. Moreno was held in a cell for 20 days and his family was placed in a temporary shelter.The lure of the smugglers in Reynosa is not limited to Central Americans. Mexicans, too, employ their services, although the cost is lower — the prices charged seem to depend on just how bad the situation is in a migrant’s home country.On a recent day in a migration office in Reynosa, a group of Mexicans sat waiting to be processed after their deportations from the United States.“For the migration authorities, it is a job,” said Melvin Gómez, 18, who is from the Mexican state of Chiapas. “For Mexicans and Central Americans, immigration is a dream.”Mr. Gómez had just tried crossing for the fourth time the day before.“We have something to live for,” he said, “and that keeps us going.”"
226,"WASHINGTON — At first, he vowed to “take the mantle” for closing part of the federal government. Then he blamed Democrats, saying they “now own the shutdown.” By Friday, President Trump was back to owning it again. “I’m very proud of doing what I’m doing,” he declared.Two weeks into the showdown over a border wall, Mr. Trump is now crafting his own narrative of the confrontation that has come to consume his presidency. Rather than a failure of negotiation, the shutdown has become a test of political virility, one in which he insists he is receiving surreptitious support from unlikely quarters.Not only are national security hawks cheering him on to defend a porous southern border, but so too are former presidents who he says have secretly confessed to him that they should have done what he is doing. Not only do federal employees accept being furloughed or forced to work without wages, they have assured him that they would give up paychecks so that he can stand strong.Never mind how implausible such assertions might seem. The details do not matter to Mr. Trump as much as dominating the debate. After an oddly quiescent holiday season in which he complained via Twitter about being left at home alone — “poor me” — he has taken the public stage this week clearly intent on framing the conflict on his own terms.[President Trump warned that he was considering declaring a national emergency to build the border wall.]People close to the president described him as emboldened since members of Congress returned to Washington after the break, giving him not only a clear target to swing at but helping him focus on a fight that he is convinced is a political winner. One aide said Mr. Trump believes he has gained the upper hand in the public battle.Although surveys at first showed more Americans blaming him for the shutdown than Democrats, later polling showed the fault more evenly split. And the voters he cares most about, his core conservative supporters, are more enthusiastic than the public at large. He has told people that “my people” love the fight, and that he believes he is winning.In the past three days, Mr. Trump has appeared in public three times to get his version of the story out while Democrats celebrated their takeover of the House. At a lengthy cabinet meeting on Wednesday, an appearance with border patrol union leaders on Thursday and a news conference with Republican congressional leaders in the Rose Garden on Friday, he engaged in quintessentially Trumpian stream of conscious discussions that ranged widely and unpredictably.At one point, he argued that the Soviet Union was right to invade Afghanistan in 1979 to stop terrorists, a revisionist version that provoked a strong reaction in Kabul and earned a sharp rebuke from the often supportive editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, which said, “We cannot recall a more absurd misstatement of history by an American President.”At another point, Mr. Trump mocked India for doing no more in Afghanistan than building a library, which generated headlines in New Delhi about the “jab” at its prime minister, not to mention more head scratching because, according to Indian news media, the country has not built a library in Afghanistan in many years.He repeatedly claimed that the new trade agreement he has negotiated with Mexico and Canada means that Mexico really is paying for the wall, even though the pact has yet to be approved by Congress and has no direct connection to border security. He has made misleading claims about how many terrorists might be coming across the border.Mr. Trump’s version of events differed even from the other people in the room at Friday’s meeting at the White House. When Democratic congressional leaders emerged after two hours, they described a “contentious” session with no meaningful progress as the president threatened to keep the government closed for “months or even years.” When Mr. Trump emerged shortly afterward, he described a “very, very productive meeting” and predicted the standoff could be “fixed very quickly.”Two people briefed on the meeting said that White House officials viewed the conversation as the first civil discussion that had taken place between the two sides, and it left some of Mr. Trump’s aides hopeful. Indeed, Mr. Trump made a point of publicly saying nothing but relatively positive things about the Democrats on Friday.Optimistic that a deal really is within reach, the president said he would have Vice President Mike Pence; Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary; and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, meet with Democrats over the weekend.But there were questions about his own side of the aisle. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, unlike other congressional Republican leaders, was not present for the Rose Garden news conference. “He’s running the Senate,” Mr. Trump explained, even though the Senate had adjourned hours earlier and Mr. McConnell’s spokesman said the senator did not know about the news conference.The president nonetheless was feeling energized by support he said he had received for the fight — including the very federal employees who are not being paid as a result of the partial shutdown.“A lot of people that you think are upset — and certainly they’re not thrilled — but they say, ‘Sir, do the right thing, we need border security,’” Mr. Trump said. “And these are people that won’t be getting paid.”As for his predecessors, he said, “This should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me, and they all know it. Some of them have told me that we should have done it.”By all public accounts, Mr. Trump had not spoken with his living predecessors since his inauguration until former President George Bush died last month. Mr. Trump called Mr. Bush’s son, former President George W. Bush, to offer condolences, but the subject of the wall did not come up, according to Mr. Bush’s office. A few days later, at the elder Mr. Bush’s funeral, Mr. Trump encountered his predecessors for the first time since taking office, but he sat quietly without talking with them during the service.The younger Mr. Bush built miles of wall and fencing along the Mexico line while he was president, but said it could not cover the entire border and insisted that enforcement should be coupled with an overhaul of immigration law to permit many people in the country illegally to stay. Former President Barack Obama has repeatedly criticized Mr. Trump’s proposed wall, and former President Jimmy Carter has said technological improvements would be more effective at protecting the border.The White House did not say afterward which presidents Mr. Trump was referring to, but a senior administration official said he was probably referring to public comments his predecessors have made about the need for border security, not necessarily for a wall specifically.As he careened this week from subject to subject and assertion to assertion, an energized Mr. Trump seemed to be enjoying himself. He went on for more than an hour and a half on Wednesday and another hour on Friday.“Should we keep this going or not, folks?” he asked reporters at one point before noticing that it was a cold January day in the Rose Garden.“Should we keep this going a little bit longer?” he asked again. “Let me know when you get tired.”One thing Mr. Trump was not was tired."
227,"[El Chapo was found guilty on all 10 charges. Read our latest story on his conviction.]Some of the drugs were hidden in passenger cars, concealed in trucks in cans of jalapeños or stashed in tanker trains with ordinary loads of cooking oil. Others were sent beneath the border in sophisticated tunnels.The 10 weeks of testimony at the trial of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the drug lord known as El Chapo who was convicted on drug conspiracy charges on Tuesday, revealed that his innovative smuggling network typically went through legal checkpoints — not isolated stretches of the border where a wall might be an obstacle.President Trump’s plan to build a wall along the southwestern border was not mentioned at the trial, but it lurked in the background of Mr. Guzmán’s prosecution, a watershed moment in America’s war on drugs.The trial, in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, was the first time that American federal prosecutors publicly revealed the inner workings of Mr. Guzmán’s Sinaloa drug cartel, offering the most extensive details yet on the organization’s structure, financing and distribution methods. In doing so, prosecutors relied on firsthand experts: a long list of Mr. Guzmán’s own former underlings and allies.Though Mr. Trump has primarily pitched his border wall as a way to stop illegal immigration, he has recently suggested that it would also help allay the cross-border drug trade.“If we build a powerful and fully designed see-through steel barrier on our southern border, the crime rate and drug problem in our country would be quickly and greatly reduced,” he said on Saturday. “Some say it could be cut in half.”He added, “We can stop heroin.”But the Guzmán trial indicated that stopping the flow of drugs into the United States might be more complicated than that. Through the testimony of people who worked with Mr. Guzmán, prosecutors showed that his cartel for decades was endlessly creative, constantly inventing new methods to circumvent detection.“What you’re hearing in this trial is what front-line border workers observe throughout,” said Doris Meissner, who served as the commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service from 1993 to 2000 and now works at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.Ms. Meissner added, “The idea that people are walking drugs across the border as though they are illegal immigrants who would then be stopped by a wall across the border, that is not the pattern.”But some supporters of the wall have noted that a physical obstacle along the border is needed as a safeguard to ensure the frontier is sealed as much as possible.“It’s about checking all the boxes: sea, land, air, port of entry and the space between the port of entries,” said James Carafano, vice president for foreign policy and national security at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank. “Otherwise you’re not implementing an effective border strategy. An effective strategy means that you create the most barriers possible. You don’t just close off one so they have 99 others.”One thing revealed at Mr. Guzmán’s trial was that among his earliest — and favorite — smuggling methods was sneaking drugs across the border in normal-looking passenger cars with secret compartments hidden in their chassis. Witnesses described how he often split loads among several vehicles to help ensure that at least some of them made the journey undetected.But Mr. Guzmán also used more dramatic and unusual tactics to transport drugs.At one point, testimony at the trial showed, Mr. Guzmán sent tons of cocaine across the border in cans of jalapeños marked with the label La Comadre chiles. The cans were stacked on pallets in the backs of commercial tractor-trailers, which simply drove through official border entry points. To protect his product from being found, witnesses said, Mr. Guzmán often placed the cans filled with cocaine in the middle of the pallets, surrounded by cans with actual chiles.Proponents of the wall have said such a structure could help improve inspections at the border.“One of the big problems is we have too many people standing on guard between and at points of entry and not enough people doing inspections, analysis and intelligence, so the wall will certainly channel the flow into areas you can manage, analyze and search more thoroughly,” said John P. Walters, the former director for drug control policy for President George W. Bush and the chief operating officer for the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank. “The wall itself does not stop all flow, but the wall becomes a way to stop all flow.”He added: “I’m not saying a wall will do everything, but what I’m saying is: How do you try to stop it without a wall?”But Mr. Guzmán’s methods went beyond regular border crossings. One witness at the trial, Tirso Martínez Sanchez, told jurors in December that he personally helped persuade Mr. Guzmán to use commercial tanker trains that traveled on cross-border rail lines.According to Mr. Martínez, cartel operatives first created front companies that appeared to be selling legal items like cooking oil. After shipping a few real loads of oil from Mexico to various American cities to make it seem as if the company was legitimate, Mr. Guzmán’s workers then packed cocaine into secret compartments in the tankers and sent them over the border.In the United States, other operatives received the trains at a network of secret warehouses, which, Mr. Martínez said, were located mostly on rail spurs so that the trains could be driven directly into them from major cargo rail lines.Sea routes were another, if a bit less frequent, means of moving drugs into the United States. This month, for instance, witnesses testified that Mr. Guzmán once sent a load of marijuana by boat from Mexico north on the Pacific Ocean to the coast near San Diego. The drugs were meant to be unloaded offshore by smaller boats. The shipment never reached San Diego, and three of Mr. Guzmán’s workers were arrested.The kingpin also sent bulk shipments of cash through normal border checkpoints in the opposite direction — from the United States to Mexico. As early as 1989, in fact, one of Mr. Guzmán’s brothers, Arturo Guzmán Loera, was briefly detained at the Douglas, Ariz., port of entry after border agents there found more than $1 million packed into the tailgate and side panels of his black Ford Bronco.Mr. Carafano said he understood that drug smugglers would always try to find new methods, and that the wall would simply be “part of the mix.”He added, “It is part of the tool, but you have to do all three simultaneously: at the port of entry, on the border and you have to do it at sea, so you’re creating just a series of bad options for the smugglers.”But then there’s the matter of El Chapo’s most famous smuggling method: tunnels.Early in the trial, Jesus Zambada García, one of Mr. Guzmán’s top logistics chiefs, told jurors how workers had dug a tunnel in the early 1990s under an innocuous-looking ranch house in Agua Prieta, Mexico, that reached a warehouse in Douglas.The entrance on the Mexican side, Mr. Zambada said, was hidden under a pool table that could be raised off the ground by hydraulic lifts. The lifts were activated by turning what appeared to be an ordinary garden hose valve in the yard outside.And the tunnel exit in the warehouse in Arizona?Remarkably, Mr. Zambada said, it was located only blocks from a local office of Customs and Border Protection."
228,"President Trump seems to think that his hard-line immigration stance is a political winner, saying he’s willing to keep much of the government shut down in order to get funding for his border wall. Polls suggest voters don’t see this Mr. Trump’s way, and blame him, not the Democrats, for the impasse. With Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives on Thursday, he now has the excuse he needs to make a deal.But if he doesn’t compromise, if he instead continues to try to transform his once proudly pro-growth party into the anti-immigration party, he will threaten Republican prospects for a generation. November’s midterm elections provided a clear indication that Mr. Trump’s strident positions on immigration were not widely popular. Ignoring the pleas of top Republicans, the president made the elections a referendum on the issue, vowing to end birthright citizenship, sending the military to deal with a caravan of asylum seekers and championing fringe legislation to cut legal immigration in half. House Republicans paid dearly for Mr. Trump’s gambit. They lost 40 seats, mostly in suburban districts, many of which were longtime Republican bastions whose younger, moderate, college-educated and female voters turned out for Democrats. In increasingly Asian-American Orange County, Calif., which voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, the first time it had gone Democratic since Franklin Roosevelt was president, Republicans lost four House seats. They also lost suburban races in traditionally Republican areas outside of Dallas; Des Moines; Houston; Miami; Philadelphia; Richmond, Va.; and even Salt Lake City. Those results suggest Mr. Trump may be doing to the national Republican Party what Pete Wilson did to the party in California in the 1990s. Hard as it is to believe today, California once reliably voted Republican in presidential elections. Other than Lyndon Johnson, no Democratic presidential candidate won the Golden State in the four decades between Harry Truman and Bill Clinton. Now, Democrats control the entire state government and hold 46 of its 53 House seats and both Senate seats.What happened? Mr. Wilson, then governor, went after immigrants, championing Proposition 187, a 1994 ballot initiative that barred illegal immigrant children from attending public schools and using other social services. Though the measure passed after a contentious fight, it was a hollow victory. An injunction was granted three days after passage, and the measure was ultimately deemed unconstitutional. Several studies have found that Republican support of Proposition 187 and other anti-immigrant efforts alienated white and Latino voters in California from the Republican Party. One of these studies, published in The American Journal of Political Science, points out that Proposition 187 actually reversed the trend of Latinos increasingly supporting Republicans, with “no counterbalancing gain in party supporters from other groups, particularly non-Hispanic whites.” The authors conclude that the “results raise serious questions about the long-term efficacy of racially divisive strategies for electoral gain.” This study should be required reading for Trump Republicans. The Hispanic portion of the United States population today is similar to the portion in California in the early 1990s. About 20 percent of the country is Hispanic; in 1990, 26 percent of California’s population was. You don’t have to be a political wizard to understand that alienating growing blocs of voters — not just Latinos, but also other immigrants and younger people — is bad political strategy.If national Republicans want to avoid the fate of their 1990s California brethren, they must reject Mr. Trump’s approach and make a Republican case for immigration. Prominent Republicans who have criticized Mr. Trump’s divisiveness, such as Utah’s incoming senator, Mitt Romney, should pick up this mantle.My organization, the Becoming American Initiative, seeks to persuade conservatives that expanding immigration will benefit the country. Members of our board, including William Kristol, Linda Chavez and Mona Charen, have worked in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. They have seen firsthand how those presidents’ support for more open immigration systems was not just good for America, but also helped neutralize immigration as a political issue.Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush both called for more work visas, a policy that would allow foreigners to pursue the American dream while contributing to the economy. Similar  immigration proposals, which would help ensure that Mr. Reagan’s “shining city on a hill” isn’t surrounded by a wall, would appeal to the more than one-quarter of the population who are either first- or second-generation immigrants.Republicans should make common cause with immigrants on shared values like work ethic, family and faith rather than writing them off. Judging by Mr. Trump’s shutdown rhetoric, they’ve got their work cut out for them. "
229,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. Venezuela’s opposition leader vows to return to the country, India and Pakistan are still at loggerheads and we go inside the Trump-Kim talks. Here’s the latest: Venezuela’s opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, has toured South America for much of the past week. Defying a government-imposed travel ban, he met with the far-right president of Brazil and the center-left president of Ecuador, among others, to demonstrate the broad international support for his claim to be the legitimate leader of Venezuela. Each day he spends out the country, though, he risks losing the unity of opposition parties, already reeling after President Nicolás Maduro last month reduced Mr. Guaidó’s promised “aid avalanche” at the border to a few flakes. Mr. Guaidó had vowed to re-enter Venezuela as those aid shipments broke through Mr. Maduro’s blockade. He has now set a deadline of this morning for his return. Mr. Maduro has threatened to have him arrested. Bigger picture: With Mr. Maduro firmly controlling the borders, and defections from his military so far a trickle, the opposition is realizing that the government’s rule appears to be more durable than Mr. Guaidó had painted it.Looking ahead: The secretary general of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, who is one of Mr. Guaidó’s chief international supporters, softened his demands on Mr. Maduro, saying he would not object to his running for office again in new elections if they were free and fair. The two nuclear-armed neighbors exchanged artillery fire on Saturday, killing at least five civilians and two soldiers and making it clear that hostilities over the disputed Kashmir region are hardly over.The recent flare-up, with both sides accusing the other of firing first, came just a day after Pakistan returned a captured Indian pilot as a good-will gesture.Dispute: Independent security analysts continue to question India’s claim that it targeted a “large number” of terrorists at a major training camp in Pakistan last week. Satellite imagery of the area showed India “didn’t hit their targets,” according to a think tank in Washington.Go deeper: After an aging Indian warplane was shot down by Pakistan, New Delhi’s military preparedness is under renewed scrutiny. The Indian military is in such a troubled state that, according to government estimates, if intense warfare broke out tomorrow its troops would have enough ammunition for only 10 days.On the ground: Kashmir’s complicated history, tugged in different directions by two muscular powers, has left its local population with a dark future and under the constant threat of death.The nuclear talks in Vietnam last week between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, were doomed before they even started, with no basic starting point established and  some of Mr. Trump’s aides questioning whether they should happen. Banking on the force of his own personality and their rapport, Mr. Trump offered Mr. Kim the same deal North Korea has rejected for a quarter-century: total nuclear disarmament in exchange for full sanctions relief. For his part, Mr. Kim miscalculated that Mr. Trump might accept a more modest offer. In an effort to maintain Mr. Trump’s détente with Mr. Kim, the Pentagon will hold off on large-scale military exercises with South Korea this spring, though a limited version is still expected to go forward. Mr. Trump first suspended the military exercises after his initial meeting with Mr. Kim last year, surprising the Pentagon. Another angle: North Korean hackers kept up attacks against European and American targets last week even during the meeting, cybersecurity researchers said.If the French language has a fortress, it is the imposing Académie Française, so exclusive that some of the greatest French writers have been turned away. Since the 17th century, members known as the Immortals have updated the definitive dictionary of French in an effort to protect the language against such ravages as the “deadly snobbery of Anglo-American.” But lately the academy has struggled to fill vacancies, a paralysis that reflects France’s own struggle to adapt to the 21st century. “We’re the reflection of the society, and it’s a society that’s questioning itself,” one member said.Saudi Arabia: Walid Fitaihi, a U.S. citizen initially detained at the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh as part of what the Saudi government has billed as a crackdown on corruption, has been imprisoned without any public charges or trial since 2017. His friend says he has also been tortured — including being shocked with electricity and whipped.Britain: Landlord checks on a prospective tenant’s immigration status lead to racial discrimination and violate human rights, a court found. The ruling was a blow to Prime Minister Theresa May, who has championed “hostile environment” policies to deter illegal immigration.China: The country’s vast detention program for Muslims has required more and more police officers. Some of them are being recruited from the very ethnic groups that are being targeted.Syria: The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons found “reasonable grounds” that chlorine weapons were used in the assault on the town of Douma last year that killed 43 people. The U.S. and its allies blamed President Bashar al-Assad for the attack and launched punitive airstrikes against government targets at the time.Turkey: A suburb made up of Disney-style chateaus is no magic kingdom — it  is unfinished, in bankruptcy and much criticized for its architecture — but the minicastles are still for sale. Chris Grayling: The political survival of Britain’s transport minister has baffled many who accuse him of staggering incompetence, but his loyalty to Mrs. May has protected him. Medicine: In the U.S., a colossal battle is underway over the regulation of fecal transplants, a revolutionary procedure used to treat life-threatening problems. Jeff Bezos: For years, Amazon’s chief executive kept a low profile. But in recent weeks, his discreet, focused life has become tangled in Hollywood’s gossip machine.Kidfluencers: Brands like Mattel and Crayola are striking lucrative deals with toddlers and tweens with large social media followings (some deals can fetch up to $50,000).In memoriam: Zhores Alferov, a Russian physicist and committed communist who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2000 for research that underpinned inventions integral to modern life like solar cells and cellphones, has died at 88.Tips for a more fulfilling life.Recipe of the day: Start the week with a bracing, spicy dinner of vegetarian mapo tofu.If you have friends or loved ones who are survivors of sexual abuse or assault, here are ways you can help their recovery.Traveling while holding down a full-time job sounds too good to be true. But it can be done.On Tuesday, the end of the women’s ready-to-wear season in Paris, the last of Karl Lagerfeld’s enormous sets for Chanel will be revealed — the final gesture of a man who shaped fashion as we know it. He died on Feb. 19.Though many designers have created dramatic shows — most notably Alexander McQueen, John Galliano when he headed his own brand and currently Thom Browne — none reached the extremes of Mr. Lagerfeld. He once imported (and then returned) a Swedish iceberg, had a rocket launch and created a sandy beach with real surf — all within the glass-roofed confines of the Grand Palais.Though I was never as big a fan of these fantasy moments as many of my peers (I believed the money could be better spent elsewhere, like on a charitable foundation), they were the markers of a time that is coming to a close, symbols of a vision that bridged the couture and Instagram eras.Get ready for the farewell hurrah. Given that Mr. Lagerfeld never did anything by half measures, it is bound to be a doozy.Vanessa Friedman, the chief fashion critic at The Times, wrote today’s Back Story.

230,"Donald Trump’s dogged, Captain-Ahab-like obsession with immigrants and asylum seekers crossing the southern border is many things.It is an open appeal to white-nationalist xenophobia among the many members of his overwhelmingly white base. Check.It is a frustration that his oft-promised new wall has yet to a single mile built. Check.It is a natural outgrowth of an intrinsic hostility to people who are Hispanics. Check.But I believe that it is also something more sophisticated and tactical than that: It is a play to the other, smaller part of his base, the black and Hispanic people who voted for him in 2016.Because Trump’s path to victory was so impossibly narrow during the last election, and because he has done absolutely nothing to expand his base, he will need to hold on to all of the base he had.It is worth remembering that in 2016, after years of the racist birtherism attack against President Barack Obama, after calling Mexicans rapists and murderers and after promising over and over to build the wall, Trump still won 28 percent of the Hispanic vote, 27 percent of the Asian vote and 8 percent of the black vote, according to exit polls.(It is important to note that in the cases where data is available, more minority men voted for Trump than women. Among black men, 13 percent voted for Trump compared with only 4 percent among black women, and among Hispanic men, 32 percent voted for Trump compared with only 25 percent among Hispanic women.)Trump wants to hold these numbers if not inch up a percent or two.He has multiple strategies to do that among black people, especially black men. One was to have the spectacle of a black man, Kanye West, in the Oval Office extolling Trump as a father figure who makes him feel like “Superman” because he “didn’t have a lot of male energy in my home.”Another is to constantly remind black people, and the rest of America, that black unemployment is at a record low — a decline that began under Obama, it must always be noted. Indeed, as an Associated Press Fact Check pointed out, “The most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under President Barack Obama, when it fell from a recession high of 16.8 percent in March 2010 to 7.8 percent in January 2017.”But Trump still touted in February: “African-American, Hispanic American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded.” (As point of fact, black unemployment hit its low during Trump’s tenure but has ticked back up.)Additionally, Trump signed the historic criminal justice First Step Act, which was a set of prison and sentencing reforms. I personally don’t think Trump cares much about criminal justice, particularly considering the way he has demeaned Black Lives Matter, demonized Colin Kaepernick and encouraged police brutality of crime suspects. But this was his son-in-law’s pet issue and Trump loves nothing more than to say that he did something for minority communities that Obama didn’t.There, you can see what the tent poles of Trump’s re-election pitch will be to black voters. But he is also adding to that list his anti-immigrant stance, suggesting to black voters that the competition for low-wage jobs is a “Hunger Games”-type blood sport, that when immigrants arrive they diminish black people’s economic prospects.As Trump said in January in an Oval Office address after shutting the government down because Congress wouldn’t fund the construction of his wall: “All Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic Americans.”That is a pitch to both blacks and Hispanics already in this country. There is a real cleavage between second-, third- and fourth-generation Hispanics and new arrivals.My brother Marvin used to work as an accountant in the federal prison system. The institutions would regularly house groups separately, to avoid possible conflict. Two of those groups were Mexicans who had been in America for a while and Mexicans who were new arrivals. As my brother put it, a common refrain among the more established group was, “They’ll help you move a refrigerator for $5.”As he understood it, it was all about the new arrivals causing embarrassment and downward pressure on wages. This friction rings true to me and has existed among other groups of immigrants.During the first wave of the Great Migration of black people from the South to the North and West, some Northern black people were also afraid that the newcomers would upset the delicate balance that they thought they had achieved with white people.As Kelly Miller, the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the historically black Howard University, wrote in a letter to The New York Times in 1916:“Should the influx of negro laborers to the North, without proper restriction and control, be allowed to prejudice public opinion and thus reproduce Southern proscription in the Northern States, the last state of the race would be worse than the first.”Add to this friction that although Americans often think of Hispanics as monolithic, they are anything but. Hispanics in America come from multiple countries and territories, some born abroad, others born here. Many of the asylum seekers at the border are from Central America. How Mexicans in California, Cubans in Florida or Puerto Ricans in New York feel about the influx may differ.Furthermore, we like to think of Hispanics as non-white, but Hispanic is an ethnicity, and Hispanics can identify as any color. Many Hispanics identify as white; they do so here and they do so in the home countries and territories. For instance, Puerto Rico is 99 percent Hispanic and nearly seven out of 10 people on the island identify as white.Also, the longer Hispanics are in the United States, the less they identify as Hispanic. A 2017 Pew study found that while 97 percent of foreign-born Hispanics in America identify as Hispanic, only 50 percent of fourth-generation or higher Hispanics do.I believe that Trump’s team, if not him, understands the fissures in this immigration debate and is using them.A Quinnipiac University poll last year found that 54 percent of blacks and 55 percent of Hispanics thought immigrants’ illegal crossing of the border with Mexico was an important problem., Additionally, 31 percent of blacks and 40 percent of Hispanics believed in using the National Guard to patrol the border with Mexico, and 13 percent of blacks and 25 percent of Hispanics supported the building of Trump’s wall.A poll taken at the end of last month by Quinnipiac found that 10 percent of black voters and 29 percent of Hispanic voters said that they would definitely vote, or consider voting, for Trump in 2020. That’s in line with 2016.And it would be a mistake to simply write off 2016 because minorities, particularly young black voters, were unhappy about Hillary Clinton’s participation in championing the 1994 Crime Bill and because she used the phrase “super predator.”The front-runner among likely Democratic candidates is Joe Biden, a man who co-wrote the crime bill and was still bragging about it when he was Obama’s vice-presidential pick. Since then he has expressed regret.The front-runner among the declared candidates is Bernie Sanders, whose appeal among black voters last cycle was worrisomely weak and who shows some signs of having retained that weakness.As The Washington Post reported, Sanders held a rally in the gym of a century-old black church in North Charleston, S.C., last month. The room was packed, but, “Of the more than 1,600 people who came to see the candidate, fewer than 40 were black.”Democrats must attack the issue of black and Hispanic voters head-on and not as an afterthought. They can’t go into 2020 thinking that the surge in voter turnout in the midterms is a ward against Trump holding the numbers of blacks and Hispanics he held in 2016. During the midterms, 9 percent of blacks and 29 percent of Hispanics voted for Republicans, in line with Trump’s 2016 results.White supremacy will use any tool at its disposal to survive.Frederick Douglass wrote in “My Bondage and My Freedom” that slave owners would often grant the enslaved relief from work during the Christmas holidays. But they would also encourage drunkenness and lasciviousness, and frown upon any slave who tried to put the time to productive use. This was psychological warfare.As Douglass put it: “All the license allowed, appears to have no other object than to disgust the slaves with their temporary freedom, and to make them as glad to return to their work, as they were to leave it.”If white supremacy will use celebration to disgust, it will most definitely use desperation to divide."
231,"President Trump has adopted a blunt new message in recent days for migrants seeking refuge in the United States: “Our country is full.”To the degree the president is addressing something broader than the recent strains on the asylum-seeking process, the line suggests the nation can’t accommodate higher immigration levels because it is already bursting at the seams. But it runs counter to the consensus among demographers and economists.They see ample evidence of a country that is not remotely “full” — but one where an aging population and declining birthrates among the native-born population are creating underpopulated cities and towns, vacant housing and troubled public finances.Local officials in many of those places view a shrinking population and work force as an existential problem with few obvious solutions.“I believe our biggest threat is our declining labor force,” said Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont, a Republican, in his annual budget address this year. “It’s the root of every problem we face.“This makes it incredibly difficult for businesses to recruit new employees and expand, harder for communities to grow and leaves fewer of us to cover the cost of state government.” Or if you look at a city like Detroit, “many of the city’s problems would become less difficult if its population would start growing,” said Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economist. “All sorts of things like the hangover pension liability become much more solvable if you’re actually looking at new people coming in.”This consensus is visible in official government projections. The Congressional Budget Office foresees the American labor force rising by only 0.5 percent a year over the coming decade, about one-third as fast as from 1950 to 2007. That is a crucial reason that economic growth is forecast to remain well below its late 20th-century levels.And that, in turn, is reflected in the national fiscal outlook. There are now 2.8 workers for every recipient of Social Security benefits, a rate on track to fall to 2.2 by 2035, according to the program’s trustees. Many state pension plans face even greater demography-induced strains.In smaller cities and rural areas, demographic decline is a fundamental fact of life. A recent study by the Economic Innovation Group found that 80 percent of American counties, with a combined population of 149 million, saw a decline in their number of prime working-age adults from 2007 to 2017.Population growth in the United States has now hit its lowest level since 1937, partly because of a record-low fertility rate — the number of children born per woman. The United States increasingly has population growth rates similar to slow-growing Japan and Western Europe, with immigration partly offsetting that shift. The Trump administration has portrayed the surge of asylum seekers at the southern border as a crisis, and applied aggressive tactics to deport undocumented immigrants already in the United States. But it has also announced plans to issue up to 30,000 additional H-2B visas for temporary workers.“That immigrants keep showing up here is a testament to our freedom and the economic opportunity here,” said Matthew Kahn, an economist at the University of Southern California. If immigrants weren’t trying to come — if they believed the United States to be full — that would be a problem, Mr. Kahn said.A particular fear, said John Lettieri, president of the Economic Innovation Group, is that declining population, falling home prices and weak public finances will create a vicious cycle that the places losing population could find hard to escape.He proposes a program of “heartland visas,” in which skilled immigrants could obtain work visas to the United States on the condition they live in one of the counties facing demographic decline — with troubled counties themselves deciding whether to participate.Although some of the areas with declining demographics are hostile to immigration, others, cities as varied as Baltimore, Indianapolis and Fargo, N.D., have embraced the strategy of encouraging it.“One of the key solutions is to welcome immigrants into these communities,” said Brooks Rainwater, director of the National League of Cities’ Center for City Solutions.Many parts of the country that are growing in population and that are more economically dynamic have depended on the arrival of immigrants for that success.Sun Belt metros like Dallas and Phoenix have been built on the logic of rapid expansion — of quickly built homes, of poached employers, of new highways paved to ever-newer subdivisions. Their economic development strategy is growth. Their chief input is people — the more, the better.“Growth cities need immigrants to continue their growth,” said Joel Kotkin, executive director of the Houston-based Center for Opportunity Urbanism, which promotes policies to help cities grow. “The older historically declining cities need immigrants to reinvigorate their economies. And the expensive cities need them because, frankly, white people, African-Americans and middle-class people are leaving for more affordable areas.”As many industrial cities have lost population since the mid-20th century, Americans have built whole new metropolises on land that was virtually empty then. The Las Vegas metropolitan area, with more than two million people today, had barely 50,000 in 1950. Still, only about 3 percent of the country’s land is urbanized.America’s metropolitan areas remain among the least dense in the world, said Sonia Hirt, a professor of landscape architecture and planning at the University of Georgia. Nationwide, the United States has less than one-third of the population density of the European Union, and a quarter of the density of China.“Factually speaking, the country is not actually full — that’s impossible,” Ms. Hirt said. “The real question is, if you continue on the current path of immigration, does this bring more benefits than it brings costs?”Economists, too, argue that countries, or even cities, can’t really fill up. Rather, communities choose not to make the political choices necessary to accommodate more people. At the local level, that means neighbors may be unwilling to allow taller buildings or to invest in more schools or improved infrastructure. At the national level, it means that politicians may be unwilling to take up immigration reform, or to address workers who fear unemployment. The president’s comments echo such local fights. “We’re full” has often been a motto for people to keep out poorer renters, minority households or apartment buildings, among both conservatives and liberals. The claim can be a way of disguising exclusion as practicality. It’s not that we’re unwelcoming; it’s just that we’re full.When it comes to the economy, at least, the country looks more like one that is too empty than too full. "
232,"Mr. Trump is repeating his widely debunked claim made in his State of the Union address that El Paso transformed from “one of the most dangerous cities” into one of the safest cities in the United States after the construction of barriers at the border.El Paso was never one of the most dangerous cities in the country. It has had a consistently lower crime rate than the average among more than 20 similarly sized cities, according to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In that group, El Paso reported the second-lowest violent crime rate in 2008 — before the construction of border fencing. And after the barrier was completed, it held the rank while the violent crime rate did not change considerably.The inaccurate claim has also drawn the rebuke of Democratic and Republican local politicians alike, including Beto O’Rourke, the former Democratic congressman from El Paso, and the Republican mayor of the city.“I don’t care if the mayor is a Democrat or a Republican, they are full of crap when they say the border barrier didn’t help lower the crime rate,” Mr. Trump said, again adding falsely, “It didn’t stay the same. It went way down.”Before Mr. Trump took the stage, lawmakers in Washington reached a tentative deal on border security that included funding for physical barriers at the border and the reduction of detention space for migrants.Democrats had sought to limit the number of detention beds under the control of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, arguing that limiting the beds would force the agency to prioritize migrants with serious criminal records. Matt Albence, the deputy director of ICE, said a reduction in the number of beds would mean the release of criminals.Whether or not ICE would be forced to released hardened criminals is a prediction that cannot be fact checked, but available data suggests that most immigrants in detention have not committed serious crimes. Records obtained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University show that in June 2018, for example, ICE held more than 44,000 migrants in detention facilities across the country. Of these migrants, 58 percent had no criminal conviction and 21 percent had committed minor offenses such as traffic violations or illegal entry while 18 percent had been convicted of serious crimes.ICE has disputed that breakdown but used a broader measure for its figures: The agency said 54 percent of detained immigrants had criminal records or faced pending charges, though it did not specify what crimes they were accused of committing.Mr. Trump overestimated his crowd size and severely understated the number of people who attended a dueling rally held Monday night by Beto O’Rourke, the former Democratic congressman.A spokesman with the fire department told the El Paso Times that the arena Mr. Trump spoke at was filled to capacity at 6,500 people. Thousands more watched the rally outside, with a possible total attendance of 10,000, the spokesman said, noting that the department did not officially estimate the crowd outside.Estimates for Mr. O’Rourke’s crowd have been far higher than 200 or 300, ranging from 7,000 to 15,000. Several Democrats have introduced proposals to increase taxes, but unless the 6,500 people in the room were all among the wealthiest Americans, they would not be affected by these proposed tax hikes.Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York, suggested a top marginal tax rate of 60 or 70 percent incomes over $10 million. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is running for president, has proposed a wealth tax of 2 percent on people with a net worth above $50 million and 3 percent over $1 billion. And Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont proposed an a top estate tax rate of 77 percent on inheritances over $1 billion.For context, households in the top 5 percent earned an average income of $385,289 in 2017, according to the Census Bureau.Mr. Trump was referring to the Green New Deal, a proposal to combat climate change released by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts.In its current form, the plan is a broad outline, introduced as a nonbinding congressional resolution, and proposes projects like expanding renewable power sources, upgrading energy grids and buildings, working with farmers and ranchers to reform the agricultural sector, and investing in clean transportation and high speed rail. The legislation emphasizes that it intends to meet these goals “as much as is technologically feasible.”Though the Green New Deal would significantly alter the transportation and agriculture sectors, it does not call for the elimination of cars, airplanes or cows.Outside the text of the legislation, however, a blog post on Ms. Ocasio Cortez’s website describing the plan did note, “The Green New Deal sets a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, at the end of this 10-year plan because we aren’t sure that we will be able to fully get rid of, for example, emissions from cows or air travel before then.”Her staff has since said retracted the post and said that it was incomplete and published by accident.When President Barack Obama encouraged lawmakers to pass the Affordable Care Act during his first term, he repeatedly promised that consumers would be able to keep their doctor or health care plan under the new insurance system.Contrary to Mr. Trump’s suggestions, fact checkers and news outlets have called out Mr. Obama for failing to fulfill that pledge. The Washington Post noted in 2009 that the claim “would not necessarily be true.” Factcheck.org wrote in 2009 that the promise would not apply to everyone. PolitiFact awarded Mr. Obama its Lie of the Year, its annual selection of the most egregious falsehood, in 2013. And The New York Times called it a “broken promise” in a 2013 article on the front page.In addition, Mr. Trump repeated at least eight other claims The New York Times has previously checked:Curious about the accuracy of a claim?

233,"In Barack Obama’s second term, with his legislative agenda dead in a Republican-controlled Congress, the president turned to executive unilateralism on an innovative scale. On climate regulation and health care he used the presidential pen to pursue policies denied him by Congress, and on immigration he made a more dramatic leap — claiming a power he himself had previously abjured, and offering a provisional legal status to about half the illegal-immigrant population.At the time I called this “caesarism” — an attempt to arrogate to the imperial presidency the kind of power over domestic policy that it already claims over foreign and military affairs. And because the decay of republics is an iterative process, where each faction builds on the norm-breaking of its rivals, it was fairly obvious — well, to me, if not to his supporters — that Obama’s caesarism helped stoke the caudillo appeal of Donald Trump, who promised a cruder version of the same impatient executive ambition.Now, that caudillo spirit is taking legal form in Trump’s most serious power grab to date: the attempt to use a “national emergency” declaration — a power whose chronic abuse by presidents Congress has never bestirred itself to check — to build the border fencing that the Democratic Party and his own political impotence have denied him.[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]On the merits, anyone who opposed Obama’s moves should oppose this one as well. The scale of the policy change is smaller, but the defiance of Congress is more overt; the legal foundation might be slightly firmer (as Jell-O is slightly firmer than a pudding) but the bad faith involved in the “emergency” claim is more extreme.And in general, serious conservatives are opposing Trump. Vox co-founder Matthew Yglesias recently snarked about right-wing pundits who got “overheated about ‘Caesarism’ and ‘caudillos’” in the Obama era, mentioning me and National Review editor Rich Lowry as examples. But Lowry has written sharply against the emergency declaration, and I’ll happily endorse his point: If Obama was abusing his powers, then clearly so is Trump.But in terms of the general lure of presidential rule, the general declension of republican norms into imperial habits, I also think Trump’s caudillo act is substantially less dangerous than what his predecessors did.Here I differ not only from liberals who misremember Obama as a punctilious norm-respecter, but also from those conservatives fretting that Trump is establishing a precedent for a future liberal president to impose a Green New Deal by fiat. Not that they won’t be so tempted — but I just can’t imagine anyone looking at the political train wreck of Trump’s unilateralism and seeing a precedent worth invoking.For presidential power to meaningfully expand, it is not enough for a president to simply make a power grab. That grab needs to unite his party (ideally it would also divide the opposition), it needs to be cloaked in enough piety and deniability to find support from would-be referees, it needs to appear to be politically successful, and finally it needs to be ratified by the other branches of government, if only by their inaction.This mostly happened with the post-9/11 war powers claimed by George W. Bush’s administration: There was pushback and resistance, but many Democrats went along, Bush won re-election, and much of his war-on-terror architecture was adopted and expanded by the Obama administration.Obama’s attempt to play Caesar in domestic policy had more mixed results, since the immigration power grab was tied up by the courts until Trump’s election rendered some of it a dead letter. But Obama at least persuaded Democrats and the media to go along with his caesarism, and he established precedents that a President Hillary Clinton would have undoubtedly embraced.With Trump, though, the only clear precedent being set is one of deplorable incompetence. He’s taking unpopular action that divides his party and unites the opposition, he’s doing so with a combination of brazen hypocrisy and nonsense rhetoric that makes the power grab impossible to cloak, he’s guaranteeing himself an extended legal battle — and he isn’t even accomplishing any obvious goal (there’s a reason real immigration restrictionists are against this plan) except the personal one of saving a tiny bit of face.This spectacle will not prevent some future president from abusing an emergency declaration more effectively. But the idea that Trump’s grab enables future abuses more than the moves that Bush and Obama made is extremely dubious. If anything, precisely because his contempt for constitutional limits is so naked and his incompetence so stark, Trump has (modestly, modestly) weakened the imperial presidency by generating somewhat more pushback than his predecessors.So the emergency declaration is not itself a constitutional emergency. Rather, as often in the Trump presidency, it’s a moment that illuminates how a more dangerous would-be autocrat might someday act. It’s a weird foretaste, not the main event. A warning, not a crisis. A clownish interlude in the republic’s decline, not the Rubicon itself."
234,"WASHINGTON — The $333 billion spending package Congress passed on Thursday will probably keep the government fully funded through the end of September. But it also delivers the most stinging rebuke of President Trump’s vision for a wall along the southwestern border and for overhauling domestic programs.Here is a look at what is in the package of seven spending bills, which fund nine federal departments and multiple agencies.Instead of satisfying Mr. Trump’s demand for $5.7 billion to fund more than 200 miles of steel or concrete wall, negotiators settled on a significantly more moderate agreement: $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel-post fencing. The president rejected a practically identical offer in December, prompting a record 35-day shutdown.The agreement, tucked into a $49 billion bill funding the Department of Homeland Security, includes restrictions on where fencing can be built in the Rio Grande Valley and what can be used to build it. Only “existing technologies” are allowed, effectively prohibiting a concrete structure or any new prototypes that administration officials might try to put into place. Communities and towns along the border will also be able to weigh in on the location and design of the fencing.One sticking point in the negotiations was beds in detention centers, which effectively dictate how many unauthorized immigrants Immigration and Customs Enforcement can hold.Democrats say that by funding a daily average of 45,274 beds for detainees, officers will be forced to reduce the number of migrants in detention from about 49,000 to 40,000 by the end of the fiscal year. But with up to $750 million that can be shifted to detention centers and latitude for federal agencies in how money is used, Republicans say the number of beds could increase to as many as 58,500.The bill provides for oversight of ICE, and places numerous limits on the agency, outlining protections for pregnant detainees, requirements for publicizing data about who is in custody and prohibitions on destroying records.More than $560 million will go toward drug inspection at ports of entry, and money has been set aside for 600 more Customs and Border Protection officers. To address a backlog in the courts, the Executive Office for Immigration Review will receive $563.4 million, an increase of $59 million, for about 75 additional immigration judge teams.The agreement also includes $415 million for humanitarian relief — medical care, transportation and food for migrants — along the southwestern border.Several federal agencies covered by the homeland security bill — the Coast Guard, the Secret Service and the Transportation Security Administration among them — will receive funding increases and money for new equipment.Despite concerns that science agencies would take a hit under the Trump administration, Congress has continued to increase their funding, if incrementally.The proposal provides $985 million to the National Institute of Standards and Technology and $21.5 billion to NASA, including for activities related to moon exploration.Additional allocations include $77 million for addressing the opioid epidemic and billions of dollars to combat H.I.V., AIDS and other infectious diseases, including malaria and Ebola.While the president has made no secret of his isolationist views on foreign policy, the spending package adds hundreds of millions of dollars for international disaster assistance and foreign aid.That includes nearly an additional $1 billion toward peacekeeping activities, an additional $96 million to support United Nations missions, including in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, and an additional $1.4 billion to respond to refugee crises overseas.Global nutrition programs will receive enough money to exceed the president’s budget request by $1.2 billion.The agreement also rejected Mr. Trump’s proposal to eliminate foundations including the Asia Foundation, the United States African Development Foundation, the Inter-American Foundation and the United States Trade and Development Agency.After federal workers endured a 35-day shutdown, lawmakers were anxious to provide some relief to the some 800,000 people furloughed or forced to work without pay. Though during the shutdown Mr. Trump issued an executive order freezing pay for federal civilian workers in 2019 — fulfilling a pledge he made over the summer — Congress agreed to secure an increase of nearly 2 percent for federal civilian employees.The spending package also allocates $1 billion toward the 2020 census, and requires that the Census Bureau expand its efforts to reach hard-to-count communities. And it provides over $4.5 billion for initiatives like the Community Development Block Grant and the HOME program, which help build housing for low-income individuals.By Wednesday night, negotiators decided to keep several issues out of the final spending package to ensure as much broad support as possible.Although the Federal Emergency Management Agency will receive more than $12 billion for disaster relief, lawmakers decided against including supplemental disaster relief for areas affected last year by storms, fires and other natural disasters.Other matters that remain unresolved include back pay for federal contractors who were caught in the middle of the shutdown and an extension of the Violence Against Women Act, which expires Friday — although grants under the act are funded in the spending bill.Negotiators also plan to introduce legislation that would address Mr. Trump’s efforts to curb immigration. It would do so by restoring the crucial protections under the Temporary Protected Status program and offering additional protections to the roughly 700,000 young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, known as Dreamers."
235,"WASHINGTON — As congressional leaders urged their colleagues to support a bipartisan border deal, President Trump said on Wednesday that he did not want to see the government shut down at midnight Friday, indicating that he was leaning toward signing the compromise legislation.“I don’t want to see a shutdown. A shutdown would be a terrible thing,” Mr. Trump said, later hinting that he had “options that most people don’t understand” to build his border wall without congressional approval.The remarks, which were made to reporters in the Oval Office as Mr. Trump met with the president of Colombia, inched him toward embracing a bipartisan border deal that fell far short of his demands for wall funding. But without a shutdown as leverage, he appeared to have little choice but to sign it if it clears Congress.On Capitol Hill, 17 negotiators rushed to turn the border compromise into voluminous legislation, while both Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, encouraged their troops to support it. The 1,159-page bill and a full report from negotiators were filed Wednesday minutes before midnight; the Senate is expected to vote on the measure on Thursday, followed by the House.Both leaders acknowledged that the legislation would not satisfy every member: The border security agreement deprives Mr. Trump and his Republican base of a victory on the wall, but it gives more money for border fencing and immigration detention than the left wing of the Democratic Party wanted.At least one of the negotiators did not sign off on the spending package: Representative Tom Graves, Republican of Georgia, who said on Twitter that he felt that he did not have enough time to review the details. He did not rule out voting for it.But with the effect of the last government shutdown — the longest in the nation’s history — still fresh, few were in the mood to risk another funding lapse.“As with all compromises, I say to people, ‘Support the bill for what is in it,’” Ms. Pelosi told reporters on Wednesday. “Don’t judge it for what is not in it. We have other days to pass other legislation.”Speaking on the Senate floor, Mr. McConnell said the outcome reflected “the way it goes in divided government” and warned against letting “unrelated cynical partisan plays get in the way of finishing this important process.”The compromise measure, assembled by senior members of both parties on Monday night, includes just $1.375 billion for new fencing along the border with Mexico, far short of the $5.7 billion Mr. Trump sought for a steel or concrete wall — and less than was included in the deal he rejected in December, which prompted the shutdown.But Mr. Trump got cover from a few allies in the conservative news media and the Senate, with some lawmakers making a point of selling the benefits of the agreement to the president.Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and one of the senior members who helped put together the compromise measure, said on Twitter that he spoke to Mr. Trump after signing off on the agreement.“He was in good spirits,” Mr. Shelby tweeted. “It’s a down payment on his border wall. This is only the beginning of a multi-year effort.”White House officials are still looking at how to allocate additional money for the president’s signature campaign promise, and have considered pulling from Army Corps of Engineers projects in California and Puerto Rico. But officials cautioned that nothing had been settled on.As of late Wednesday afternoon, lawmakers and aides were working to resolve lingering issues in the spending package, which includes funding for the Department of Homeland Security and six unfinished spending bills.Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas and one of the negotiators, said there were late discussions about where new fencing could be built in the Rio Grande Valley, to address local and environmental concerns, something White House officials pushed back against. Ultimately, the new barriers cannot be built in five areas, including the National Butterfly Center in Mission, Tex.A number of extensions, including a provision that would provide back pay to federal contractors deprived of payments during the last shutdown, will not be included in the package because bicameral leadership negotiations did not result in an agreement, according to a senior Democratic aide. A Republican Senate aide said party negotiators believed that back pay could be handled by the Office of Management and Budget without Congress’s involvement.The unfinished items also include an extension of the Violence Against Women Act, which is set to expire Friday.Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that the White House had not seen the legislative text of the deal, and when aides do, “we’ll be looking for land mines.”Most Democrats indicated they would support the legislation, even before the text was finished, in part because it would stave off another government shutdown and included Democratic priorities in the other six bills.Some of the priorities include a $1 billion increase for census funding, a $1.3 billion increase for housing programs and $500 million in funding for medical support, food and clothing for migrants in detention and alternatives to detention.Federal employees will also receive a 1.9 percent increase in pay, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, told reporters, noting that he and other members would most likely pursue a higher number in the future, along with other unaddressed immigration priorities.Other liberal lawmakers expressed concerns about the funding levels for the number of beds for detained immigrants and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which some had campaigned to abolish.“I’m trying to maintain an open mind, but I need details,” said Representative Veronica Escobar, a freshman Democrat whose district includes most of El Paso.“The barriers are going to be an issue,” she added, noting that she would prefer no funding for the Department of Homeland Security until it is audited.At least one legislator, Representative Juan Vargas, Democrat of California, said he would vote against the bill, criticizing the inclusion of new steel-post fencing.“I think most people just want to get this thing over with,” he said. “I’m not one of those people.”For some Democrats, the biggest issue is detention slots under the control of the Trump administration. The agreement authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to fund about 40,000 beds for detainees, many of them in centers run by for-profit companies and ICE near the border in Texas, Arizona and California.House Democratic aides described the language as a “glide path” from the current level of 49,000 detention beds to Obama-era levels of 35,000 or fewer.But a summary of the provisions drafted by Senate Republican staff members placed the average number of beds funded under the deal at a much higher number — 45,274, including 2,500 for families. And that could rise to as many as 58,500 beds, Republican aides asserted in internal communications, because federal cabinet departments have latitude in how they use funds.Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington and a leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said she was likely to vote no on the measure because of what she believed was a “lack of accountability around the detention system.”“We’ve reduced that number over the next nine months, but the average daily population that we’re appropriating is still too high,” she said. “Unless we have a guarantee from the administration that they’re actually going to listen to what Congress does and our appropriated amounts, we still have a president using every tool at his disposal.”But the lawmakers who said they were inclined to vote against the measure were not actively seeking support for their position.Under the complex funding formula in the agreement, the Department of Homeland Security would also have “reprogramming authority” to transfer as much as $750 million from other programs to detention slots.Democrats have argued that with a new House majority, they can provide harsher oversight than their Republican predecessors and push back on that maneuvering within the department and other federal agencies.“We’re intent on making sure that this process reflects the congressional intent of where they should be on barriers, on beds, on all these issues that matter to us,” said Representative Pete Aguilar, Democrat of California and one of the negotiators."
236,"WASHINGTON — President Trump acknowledged Tuesday that closing the southern border with Mexico could damage the United States economy, but said protecting America’s security was more important than trade.In remarks from the Oval Office, Mr. Trump reiterated his threat to shut the border if Mexico, America’s third largest trading partner, cannot restrict a flow of asylum seekers trying to cross into the United States. But the president’s economic team, concerned about the damage from such a move, said it was looking for ways to limit the fallout if Mr. Trump does do so.“Sure, it’s going to have a negative impact on the economy,” Mr. Trump said, adding, “but security is most important.”“Security is more important to me than trade,” he said.Republican lawmakers, economists and business groups largely disagree with that assessment and warned this week that closing the border could cripple the flow of goods and workers and devastate American automakers and farmers, as well as other industries that depend on Mexico for sales and goods.“Closing down the border would have a potentially catastrophic economic impact on our country,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said in an interview. “I would hope that we would not be doing that sort of thing.”Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said that “a full shutdown of the U.S.-Mexican border of more than several weeks would be the fodder for recessions in both Mexico and the U.S.”Mr. Trump’s economic advisers have briefed him on the potential financial damage from a border shutdown and started looking for ways to mitigate it, including possibly keeping certain trading avenues open.Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, said Tuesday in a brief interview that the Trump administration was trying to secure the border without harming the economy.“The question is,” he said, “can we deal with that and not have any economic damage? I think the answer is we can. People are looking at different options.”Mr. Kudlow added that the administration was “looking for ways to allow the freight passage — some people call it truck roads.”“There are ways you can do that, which would ameliorate the breakdown in supply chains,” he said.But business leaders say there is no way to contain the damage from even a partial shutdown of the 2,000-mile border that the United States shares with Mexico. Nearly $1.7 billion of goods and services flow across the border daily, as well as nearly a half-million legal workers, students, shoppers and tourists, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said Monday.On Tuesday, officials with the chamber called a partial border shutdown “uncharted territory” and said such a policy would have negative economic consequences, particularly for communities along the border.“We don’t know whether that is feasible or not,” said Neil Bradley, the chamber’s executive vice president and chief policy officer.Even if it is possible, a partial shutdown would still cause significant disruptions for industries that are highly integrated across the border, including automobiles, machinery and electronic equipment.“The North American auto industry will be crippled” in a week, Kristin Dziczek, a vice president for the Center for Automotive Research, an industry research group, said in a tweet.Mr. Trump’s pledge to close the border comes in response to what officials with the Department of Homeland Security say is an increase in migrant families who are flooding America’s immigration system, leading to overflowing detention centers and mass releases of migrants.The president told reporters that if Mexico cannot restrict the flow of asylum seekers trying to cross into the United States, and if Congress cannot agree to several immigration restrictions that Mr. Trump has long pushed for, “the border is going to be closed.”While 76,000 migrants crossed the border in February, that number is nowhere near the migration levels seen in the early 2000s. And a majority of the migrants crossing the border now are Central American families looking for asylum, as opposed to Mexican individuals looking for work. Homeland security officials could quickly deport Mexican individuals seeking employment, but, by law, they cannot swiftly deport Central American families or unaccompanied children.Homeland security officials have said they expect the number of crossings to surpass 100,000 this month. And a senior department official said those traveling in and out of ports of entry were already feeling an effect: There was a three-hour wait at the port of entry in Brownsville, Tex., according to the official, and there were around 150 trucks backed up and waiting to cross at Otay Mesa, in California.On Monday, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, said she would divert up to 750 border patrol officials from ports of entry to areas in between the ports to handle large groups of migrants crossing the border. A senior homeland security official also said the administration could start closing traffic lanes at the ports.“The crisis at our border is worsening,” Ms. Nielsen said, “and D.H.S. will do everything in its power to end it.”Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and one of Mr. Trump’s external advisers, has been urging the president to ease off the threat. On Tuesday, Mr. Graham portrayed Mr. Trump’s latest broadside as less an eventuality and more a calculated bargaining position.“You are taking a bad problem and, by closing the ports of entry, you are creating another problem,” he said during an interview. “To the extent that he wants to redeploy resources to the points of entry to deal with the ungoverned spaces — that will create economic upheaval, but that will hopefully lead to a solution.”Border activity makes up a relatively larger share of Mexico’s economy than the United States’, meaning Mexico would most likely have more economic damage from a border closing, Mr. Zandi said.But that does not mean the United States would be in a winning position. Communities across the country would probably see supply chain disruptions, product shortages, seizures in stock and bond markets and a plunge in already-fragile business confidence, Mr. Zandi said. The disruption would be especially sharp in the border states of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, which all have Mexico as their No. 1 export market.Any closure could have far-ranging implications for a wide range of industries — including automotive, electronics and apparel — that source small components and deliver their products on a just-in-time basis on both sides of the border.It could also be devastating for the agriculture industry. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement began in 1994, American farmers have moved toward specializing in corn, soybeans, chicken, dairy, pork and beef to supply to Mexico, while Mexican farmers have specialized in fresh fruits and vegetables to send to the United States. Any delays in deliveries of these products could lead to near immediate price hikes and empty supermarket shelves, which would hit low-income Mexicans and Americans the hardest.Christin Fernandez, the vice president for communications at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said that slowing or halting screenings at major ports near the border would lead to product delays and potentially higher shipping costs.“The entire retail ecosystem is sustained on the expectation that America’s retailers can provide consumers with the goods they want and need, when they need it, at the best possible prices,” Ms. Fernandez said. “If our suppliers are feeling the pain, retailers will feel the pain, and, ultimately, it is consumers that will bear the burden.”Stock markets do not appear to be pricing in any risk of a border closure. The S&P 500 was essentially unchanged on Tuesday, and it remains near a six-month high."
237,"WASHINGTON — House and Senate negotiators on Monday night agreed in principle to provide $1.375 billion for fencing and other physical barriers at the Mexican border, part of a broader agreement that would stave off another partial government shutdown without funding President Trump’s wall.The agreement would allow for 55 miles of new bollard fencing, with some restrictions on location based on community and environmental concerns, according to two congressional aides, who requested anonymity to disclose details of the private negotiations. That is a fraction of the more than 200 miles of steel-and-concrete wall that Mr. Trump demanded — and 10 miles less than negotiators agreed on last summer, before Democrats took control of the House.The deal, which must still pass the House and the Senate, and secure Mr. Trump’s signature, came together just before Mr. Trump, framed by banners emblazoned with “Finish the Wall” at an event in El Paso, doubled down on his demands.“We’re building the wall anyway,” he told the crowd, saying that aides had told him that the negotiators had made progress.The funding for 55 miles of new fencing is a figure far lower than the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump had demanded and marginally less than the $1.6 billion for 65 miles of pedestrian fencing in the bill that the Senate Appropriations Committee had passed last year.In December, the president, concerned about reneging on his signature campaign promise, refused to sign onto that legislation, forcing the nation’s longest government shutdown.The negotiators also agreed to reduce the number of migrants and undocumented immigrants who can be held in detention. Democrats’ demand for a limit on how much detention space could be used for unauthorized immigrants arrested within the United States had threatened to derail the negotiations over the weekend, but lawmakers agreed to waive the demand.Instead, lawmakers agreed to adhere to levels, set by a number of detention beds, established in the previous budget. That would fund 40,520 beds, a decrease of about 17 percent from current levels, which Immigration and Customs Enforcement reached in recent months only by surpassing its funding caps.Privately, Democratic aides admitted the provision could have no impact on the number of beds ICE assigned for detainees. There is nothing to prevent Trump administration officials from funding a greater number of slots in excess of the lower target number, and then securing congressional outlays to cover those expenses, as ICE officials have done routinely in recent years, the aides said.Beyond the border barriers, the agreement, which primarily funds the Department of Homeland Security, would provide $1.7 billion more for border security, including technology at ports of entry, more officers and humanitarian aid.[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]The Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees announced the agreement, which includes seven unfinished spending bills, after three private meetings on Monday. Disaster relief for areas affected by storms and natural disasters last year will not be included, and lawmakers said they would address it separately.It is expected to be finalized as early as Tuesday, well before the Friday deadline when funding would again lapse for a number of federal agencies. With fears of another damaging shutdown, lawmakers seemed confident that they had the support of party leadership and that Mr. Trump would be willing to sign the agreement.“We think so,” Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told reporters when asked about the likelihood of the president’s signature. “We hope so.”“The specter of another government shutdown this close, I thought tonight we didn’t want that to happen,” he added later.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, had urged him to “get it done” in negotiations, Mr. Shelby said. Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York and the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, said she had been in close communication with Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and expected her support.“She has confidence that I made the right decision,” Ms. Lowey told reporters.White House officials did not respond to requests for comment about the terms of the agreement, and the president’s conservative allies on Monday night were already denouncing the deal. Sean Hannity, a Fox News commentator and a confidant of the president’s, called it “a garbage compromise.”Pentagon officials spent the weekend readying for the possibility that Mr. Trump would declare a national emergency, something that his allies said he is still considering as a means to secure border wall funding.But Republican lawmakers remained optimistic that their agreement would hold.“This has been a difficult one,” said Representative Kay Granger of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee. “I think everyone will say, ‘Good work.’”A specific point of contention had been the number of detention beds under the control of ICE, which had stalled talks over the weekend.House Democrats, urged on by immigration rights groups, had pushed hard, hoping to leverage White House fears of another damaging shutdown into a softening of the president’s hard-line immigration policies that they say have torn apart families, wrenched productive workers from the communities they have lived in for years and infused a heartlessness into official American immigration policy.The Democrats’ goal was to cut the overall number of detention beds, including those occupied by asylum seekers and people caught at the border, from its current level of around 49,000 to 34,000, the number funded during the Obama administration, Democratic aides said. That, they say, would end sweeps and roundups, and force ICE to focus on pursuing hardened criminals.“We started at zero on the wall, and we compromised a lot after that, and we are now asking them to change, too,” said Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, Democrat of California and a member of the 17-member House and Senate conference committee tasked with hammering out a compromise.Mr. Trump caught on. When Mr. Shelby presented him with the Democrats’ demand, he rejected it quickly, according to two people briefed on the exchange.“These are the people coming into our country that we are holding and we don’t want in our country,” the president told reporters at the White House on Monday. “That’s why they don’t want to give us what we call ‘the beds.’ It’s much more complicated than beds, but we call them ‘the beds.’”In private, Republicans responded with a plan that would exempt many detained immigrants from the cap, including those people either charged with or convicted of crimes, including misdemeanor drug offenses and violent felonies. That, in turn, was rejected by Democrats.“You have ICE agents picking up mothers and fathers and children in their own neighborhoods. That’s why the beds issue is so much more important than the wall,” said Ms. Roybal-Allard, whose Los Angeles-area district is 85 percent Hispanic, the highest percentage of any district in the country.The number of beds occupied by detainees fluctuates over time, influenced by a variety of factors, including ICE enforcement policies and the flow of migrants at the border with Mexico. The rate of that flow is unpredictable and determined by factors such as the performance of the economies north and south of the border, crime, gang activity and the business practices of coyotes paid to transport migrants from Mexico and Central America to California and the Southwest.The number of monthly apprehensions of migrants at the border has averaged 25,000 to 40,000 for most of the past decade, but has risen to about 50,000 over the past several months, according to statistics compiled by the Department of Homeland Security.If ICE does not have enough room to place individuals and family members they detain, they must loosen their enforcement actions, creating a powerful motive for new migrants to enter the country illegally, Trump administration officials say.“You cannot have border security, without strong interior enforcement, whether there is a wall there or not,” said Matt Albence, the deputy director of ICE, on Monday in a conference call with reporters.Republicans closed ranks to blast the plan.“This is a poison pill that no administration, not this one, not the previous one, should ever accept,” Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor. “Imagine the absurdity of this: House Democrats want to set a limit on how many criminal aliens our government can detain.”"
238,"As a political fight rages in Washington over President Trump’s demand for $5.7 billion in border wall funding, there have been spirited acts of resistance on the United States-Mexico border. Protests have been held. Resolutions passed. And initiatives funded to help the very people the wall is aimed to keep out.[This month, we’re launching a limited-run weekly newsletter about life on the border, far from the tug-of-war of Washington politics. Sign up here to receive the first issue of Crossing the Border when it launches.]Bulldozers arrived last week near the National Butterfly Center in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, signaling the Trump administration’s intention to begin construction on a steel and concrete barrier that would swallow more than two-thirds of the 100-acre wildlife refuge and botanical garden. The nonprofit center, which abuts the Rio Grande, sits on the path of a six-mile stretch of wall that has already been funded. Federal government officials had said construction was scheduled to begin this month, despite an ongoing lawsuit filed by the center more than a year ago, said the center’s director, Marianna Trevino Wright. The center planned to file a restraining order to prevent workers from beginning construction on the wall, which would rise to 36 feet in some areas.The federal government waived 28 environmental laws to expedite construction.The Rio Grande Valley is one of the most biologically diverse regions in the country and a major bird migration corridor, with more than 500 species recorded. In a GoFundMe campaign that has raised more than half of a $100,000 goal to pay for legal fees associated with ongoing litigation against the Trump administration, the center's director wrote that the issue “is not whether butterflies can fly over a wall, but whether private property (farms, businesses, homes) should be seized and destroyed for a project that does not serve the greater good or enhance national security.”In his State of the Union speech last Tuesday evening, Mr. Trump claimed the border city of El Paso, Tex., was once among America’s most violent cities — until a “powerful barrier” was constructed. And then, “immediately upon its building,” it became “one of the safest cities in our country.”But that is not true. Before border fencing was erected in El Paso, the city of about 680,000 residents had the second-lowest violent crime rate among more than 20 cities of similar size. In 2010, after the barrier was built, that rate held that spot. Residents and elected officials immediately took to social media to dispel the notion that border cities are dangerous. Mr. Trump is scheduled to hold a 2020 campaign rally Monday in El Paso, where about 26 percent of registered voters cast ballots for him two years ago. El Paso is also the hometown of Beto O’Rourke, the Democratic former congressman who has said he’s considering jumping into the crowded field of candidates vying to challenge the president. Few elected officials were enthusiastic about the president’s coming visit, with one, State Representative César J. Blanco, issuing a statement that said the president’s “fear-mongering and lies have hurt our border economy and community.” Mr. Blanco, a Navy veteran and Democrat whose House District 76 includes part of El Paso County, said the city “should not be rolling out the red carpet, so he can come lie in our backyard.”The city’s Republican mayor, Dee Margo, also quickly defended El Paso, saying on Twitter late Tuesday night that the city’s law enforcement officers kept the border community safe.Shortly before Mr. Trump appeared before Congress last week to deliver a speech that would again include arguments for a border wall, New Mexico’s governor announced she had ordered a partial withdrawal of National Guard troops from her state.“New Mexico will not take part in the president’s charade of border fear-mongering by misusing our diligent National Guard troops,” Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, said in a statement. Her decision was a reversal of her predecessor’s deployment of 118 National Guard personnel last April. And in California on Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom was expected to follow suit and order the withdrawal of nearly 400 state National Guard troops from deployment along the border with Mexico. Under a “general order” that his aides said he planned to sign, 110 California National Guard troops would be redirected to support the state’s central fire agency, Cal Fire, and another 100 would work on statewide “intelligence operations” aimed at international criminal drug gangs.In New Mexico, about a dozen guardsmen will remain in the southwestern part of the state, Ms. Grisham said, to help with humanitarian aid for migrants who cross the border into the United States. She also directed the deployment of six state police officers to assist local law enforcement officers in Hidalgo County, saying she recognized the county’s “legitimate concerns” about the number of asylum seekers arriving in the state. Hundreds of migrants have surrendered to the Border Patrol in New Mexico in recent weeks, including children in need of immediate medical care — a situation state officials say is without precedent.Prompting these trips to ever-more-remote border locations: The nearly 700 miles of border wall and fencing built since 2006, and the Trump administration’s increasingly rigid immigration policies aimed at deterring the flow of migrant families, mostly from Central America, who have streamed in from Mexico since 2014.[Read: ‘Desperation of Thousands’ Pushes Migrants Into Ever Remote Terrain]Gov. Grisham took aim at Mr. Trump’s proposed wall in a video that went viral this week.About 20,000 people live in Nogales, Ariz., and close to another half-million live across the border in Nogales, Mexico. A fence about 10 feet tall divides the two, but like most communities along the United States-Mexico border, their economies, cultures and daily lives are intertwined.In November, the United States military descended on Nogales and promptly got to work installing barbed wire at the port of entry and atop the international border wall. This month, the military added horizontal strands of wire to the United States side of the fence, from the top of the wall to the ground.Last Wednesday evening, the Nogales City Council passed a resolution condemning the installation of the wire, calling it an “indiscriminate use of lethal force” that is “typically only found in a war, battlefield or prison setting.” With its sharp razor-like blades, barbed wire is “designed to entangle its victim as the razors slice/cut deeply in to the flesh” and would kill anyone who tried to scale the wall.The City Council said it wanted the federal government to remove the wire, and has vowed to sue the Trump administration if that does not happen. The resolution came one day after Mr. Trump addressed the nation and implored Americans to support his case for a border wall. Barbed wire has been installed on fencing across Arizona, Texas and California.[Read: Deployed Inside the United States: The Military Waits for the Migrant Caravan]In California, where about 105 miles of the state’s 140-mile border with Mexico have some sort of fencing, elected officials have pushed back against the Trump administration’s pledge to fill in the spaces. Residents of Calexico, a small border town that recently saw the completion of renovations to a steel barrier, chafed at the barbed wire that also was installed, with one chalking it up to political propaganda from a White House that cannot fathom life along the southwest frontier.Earlier this month, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California asked state lawmakers to provide $5 million in immediate funding to local charities that help asylum seekers. The aid would be followed by another $20 million over three years, intended to assist groups that have helped migrants who were dropped off by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at bus stations. As the number of migrant families in recent months has overwhelmed the government’s detention facilities, the Trump administration has drastically reduced its efforts to ensure the migrants’ safety after they are released. Stepping into the void has been a growing network of charities, expanding along the border from California to Texas. [Read: As Government Pulls Back, Charities Step In to Help Released Migrants]"
239,"EL PASO — This tranquil city of bilingual trans-border commerce is where lurid fantasy meets humdrum reality. President Trump will come here Monday, risking life and limb at “our very dangerous southern border,” that “lawless” frontier facing a “tremendous onslaught.” I can reassure the president: He will be able to gaze at Mexico without breaking a sweat or putting his hairdo at risk.Trump will attribute the calm to fencing completed a decade ago and recently extended with what looks like junkyard metal. In his State of the Union address, he claimed the barrier transformed El Paso from “one of our nation’s most dangerous cities” into “one of our safest cities.” This was a lie.It incensed the mayor, Dee Margo, who tweeted: “El Paso was never one of the most dangerous cities in the U.S.” It incensed Representative Veronica Escobar, a Democrat, who accused the president in a tweet of spreading “falsehoods.” For a city of its size, El Paso has eased from pretty safe to super safe as its violent crime rate has dropped since the mid-1990s. The city’s story is not a fence story.Margo, in an interview, said: “I hope we have some adult behavior. Egos are overriding common sense and I think it’s ridiculous.” Escobar told me: “Trump’s wall obsession is his way of keeping a campaign promise to the core of his base, many of whom are xenophobic and some outright racist.”El Paso is as good a place as any to grasp America’s warped political discourse, the crazed way it’s abandoned rational debate of real problems for the sterile shrieking of tribes. The United States has a broken immigration system that’s an affront to a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws, but nobody really wants to talk about why or how to fix it.Trump is Exhibit A in the process. Someone perceived early in his campaign that immigration was an issue around which a simple galvanizing argument could be advanced that Trump might actually understand: build a wall from sea to shining sea, keep out Mexican “rapists,” have Mexico pay, and claim an invasion of brown-skinned illegals has been stopped in the name of American jobs, security and identity. As for reality, forget it.Some version of this fear-stoking fable will be repeated by Trump on Monday night at the El Paso County Coliseum. It’s no accident he has chosen this Texas border city for his first “Make America Great Again” rally of the 2020 cycle. The president will portray himself as the man standing between the country and the abyss of invasion, lawlessness and socialism. He will do so in the city of Beto O’Rourke, the charismatic former congressman weighing a presidential campaign. He will try to skewer Democrats like O’Rourke as immigrant-huggers.If Trump were interested in facts rather rabble-rousing mendacity and the theatrical stringing of concertina wire by military forces needlessly dispatched to the border, he might note the following: Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras — not Mexico — are now the overwhelming source of northward migration. Poverty, violence, corrupt governments (Guatemala’s vigorously supported by the Trump administration) organized crime and longstanding mistreatment of indigenous peoples feed the flow. A Marshall Plan for Central America would do more for border security than any barrier.So would patient, respectful diplomacy, rather than wild outbursts, with the Mexican government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who holds the key to the porous Mexican-Guatemalan border.More than 600 miles of fencing already cover about a third of the border. Trump’s wild talk of his WALL, drugs and terrorism is pure obfuscation. It ignores where a barrier might be useful, how narcotics come in, and the real sources of terrorist threats.The United States border force has been placed in an impossible situation. It was trained to deal with single Mexican males striving to escape capture. It now faces a different phenomenon: thousands of mainly Guatemalan families a month driven northward on buses and intent on presenting themselves to border guards once in.They do so in the social-media-transmitted knowledge that the zigzags of Trump administration policy (including the cruel separation of thousands of children from their parents during the “zero tolerance” interlude) have ended in a situation where these families know they will be released within 20 days by ICE and go to the back of an 800,000-person line awaiting their day in immigration court. That’s a virtual guarantee of at least two to three years in the country (though the administration is trying to make them wait in a Mexican limbo that could be nightmarish).These immigrants are no different from those who arrived at Ellis Island: They are fleeing misery and often violence in search of a better life. Some are bona fide refugees legally entitled to protection. The United States, nation of migration and churn, must treat them with humanity. Openness, not walls, has served the country and preserves its spirit.The United States is also a nation of laws. Trump has turned a serious dilemma into a theater of racist scapegoating and so served division, not needed immigration reform. No Democrat could vote to finance his bigotry; plenty of Democrats could vote for a secure border. Trump won 25.7 percent of the vote in El Paso. That’s because people on the border understand the benefits of binational flux. They see through Trump’s chest-beating America First to its un-American core."
240,"There are more than 48,000 people being held in immigrant detention in more than 200 facilities in the United States. More than two-thirds of them, according to the National Immigrant Justice Center, are confined by private companies, working on contracts with the federal government. Those numbers have ballooned in the last two years under the Trump administration, drawing new attention to the terrible conditions detainees are living in.One feature of privately run centers — the Voluntary Work Program — is the subject of six separate lawsuits, which say that privately run immigrant detention centers are coercing detainees into working for a dollar a day and punishing those who don’t. The lawsuits demand, among other things, that the practice stop and that detained workers be paid minimum wage.Congress should not wait for these lawsuits to be decided. Democrats have won the House, so even if they can’t stop the president’s anti-immigrant push, they can push to raise the obsolete and exploitative $1-a-day wage. And, just as they have rejected Mr. Trump’s request for $5.7 billion for the border wall, they should reject the request for $2.8 billion to expand detentions to 52,000 beds.Prison labor is nearly as old as the American prison system itself, and it is protected by the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery and indentured servitude except as punishment for a crime. This exception means that prisons can require their prisoners to work, even without compensation. But immigrant detention is civil confinement, not criminal. People held in these facilities are not charged with any crime; they are being detained while awaiting asylum or deportation hearings. Under Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Voluntary Work Program, however,  immigrant detention centers need not pay workers more than one dollar a day, a rate set by Congress in 1950 and codified in the 1978 Appropriations Act. It has never been increased or adjusted for inflation.Detainees say that the Voluntary Work Program is not really voluntary. If they attempt to take a day off or refuse to work, staff members punish them by withholding essential items, threatening to move them to more dangerous housing units or locking them in their cells. Wilhen Hill Barrientos, a Guatemalan asylum seeker and a plaintiff in the lawsuit against CoreCivic’s Stewart Detention Center in Georgia, said that he had to either work for a few cents an hour or go without basic things like soap, which he could get only through the commissary.According to Mr. Barrientos’s lawsuit, one night a guard awakened him for the 2 a.m. shift in the kitchen rather than his scheduled 10 a.m. shift. When he refused, the guard threatened to move him to a violence-plagued dormitory, so Mr. Barrientos acquiesced.Martha Gonzalez, from Mexico, was detained in three different CoreCivic prisons in Texas from May 2016 to August 2017 as she awaited a T-1 visa, which is granted to victims of human trafficking. She worked in the kitchen and sorted clothing. When she once tried to take a day off, she told me, the prison staff then punished her by refusing to give her basic hygiene supplies such as sanitary pads and toothpaste. CoreCivic did not respond to Ms. Gonzalez’s allegation but said that its work programs are “completely voluntary” and that “detainees are subject to no disciplinary action whatsoever if they choose not to participate in the work program.”A representative for GEO Group called the lawsuits’ allegations baseless, saying that “this is a strictly voluntary program” and that GEO Group provides hygiene products free of charge upon request. Private corporations hold less than 10 percent of the nation’s prison population, but more than 70 percent of people in immigration detention. The government pays them a fixed daily price per person, so they have an economic incentive to run their facilities as cheaply as possible, relying on detainees to cook meals, mop hallways, scrub toilets, mow lawns and even cut hair.In 2016, CoreCivic’s revenue from Stewart (where Mr. Barrientos and other detainees worked in the kitchen) was about $38 million; in 2017, contracts with ICE comprised 25 percent of its $1.76 billion in revenue. For GEO Group, ICE contracts comprised 19 percent of its $2.26 billion revenue in 2017. At the same time, the detention centers provide the barest minimum to detainees, while charging them exorbitant rates for necessities. In immigrant detention, a phone call can cost as much as $12.75 for 15 minutes. Four ounces of toothpaste sells for $11.These two corporations have become the giants of the private prison industry. Between 2016 and 2018, CoreCivic spent $2.8 million in lobbying and over $700,000 on campaign contributions while GEO Group spent $4.4 million in lobbying and $2.5 million on campaign contributions. Each company also donated $250,000 to Mr. Trump’s inauguration.They blame the 1978 Appropriations Act for the low wages. As GEO Group puts it, “The wage rates associated with this federal government program are stipulated under long-established guidelines set by the United States Congress.” That is true. If Congress instead forced these companies to pay the federal minimum wage, their profit margins would drop dramatically.But the dollar-a-day rule has stalwart defenders in Congress. In response to a class-action lawsuit in which formerly detained immigrants said they were forced to work, 18 Republican congressmen sent a letter on March 7, 2018, to the attorney general at the time, Jeff Sessions, the head of ICE and the secretary of the Department of Labor, exhorting those agencies to help GEO Group defend itself. “Unless your agencies act to intervene in these lawsuits, immigration enforcement efforts will be thwarted, and the end result will be millions of dollars of unnecessary loss to the federal government in terms of additional expenses for immigration detention,” they said. In other words, they worried that if the private prisons were forced to pay reasonable wages, the companies would pass on those costs to the federal government.The lawsuits are not pushing to end the Voluntary Work Program altogether. They understand that it allows people who are in detention to buy things they need and keep in touch with their families by phone, which becomes even more urgent as the number of families torn apart by detention increases. Instead, the lawsuits are pushing for an end to exploitation and a fair wage for their work.Yes, paying detainees a minimum wage would make these facilities much more expensive to operate. But if privately run detention centers rely on a business model based on forced labor, perhaps they should not exist at all."
241,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump would not commit in an interview aired Sunday to making public the results of the special counsel’s investigation into Russia’s ties to his campaign, adding that it was time to “get rid” of the inquiry.In the interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Mr. Trump reiterated his belief that the attorney general would determine whether the public would see the results of the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. But he would not say whether he would be comfortable with the results being made public.“I don’t know,” the president said. “It depends. I have no idea what it’s going to say.”The law does not require the Justice Department to release a report, and Mr. Mueller has been silent on the issue. Last month, Trump advisers were pleased that William P. Barr, Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, opened the door to the possibility that the special counsel’s report could be shielded from the public during a Senate confirmation hearing.Mr. Trump’s wide-ranging interview with Margaret Brennan, the show’s host, was conducted days after the acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, said the investigation was nearing its end, and amid stagnant negotiations with Democrats over Mr. Trump’s demand for a border wall. Mr. Trump indicated at various points in the interview that he would use the power of his office to solve that matter and others facing his presidency.Among those matters, the president appeared to suggest, are national security and the military. He called the use of military force against Venezuela “an option.” And he indicated that he would like to keep troops in Iraq — a striking departure from his push to withdraw from Afghanistan and Syria — to “keep an eye” on Iran.“It’s perfectly situated for looking at all over different parts of the troubled Middle East rather than pulling up,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re going to keep watching and we’re going to keep seeing and if there’s trouble, if somebody is looking to do nuclear weapons or other things, we’re going to know it before they do.”On the border wall fight, the president reiterated his belief that “we have now set the table” to take action after a short-term deal to fund part of the government — a deal struck to end the longest government shutdown in history — expires on Feb. 15. In an interview with The New York Times on Thursday, Mr. Trump suggested that he had successfully made the case to Americans that the problem at the border was enough to constitute declaring a national emergency, and that Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, was doing a “disservice” to the country — both points he again made on Sunday.“People that didn’t have any idea,” Mr. Trump said. “They didn’t have a clue as to what was happening. They now know exactly what’s happening.”Mr. Trump is expected to make immigration a cornerstone of his State of the Union speech, which is scheduled for Tuesday. In the interview with CBS, Mr. Trump once again accused Democrats, in particular Ms. Pelosi, of ignoring urgent problems at the border, which included human trafficking and what Mr. Trump called an “invasion” of human traffickers into the country.Though Mr. Trump seems intent on ignoring congressional negotiations, lawmakers insisted on Sunday that they were still trying. Senator Richard C. Shelby, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a member of the committee working to reach a deal, admitted that it was too early to say whether the negotiations could be successful.“I think that the president is dead set on keeping his campaign promise,” Mr. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” He acknowledged that Mr. Trump probably had some legal merits for declaring a national emergency over the border wall, but he pleaded for the committee to be allowed to do its work.“If people leave us alone,” Mr. Shelby added, “we’ll get this done by Wednesday night.”He said that the committee had invited experts with knowledge of the southwestern border to testify this week on exactly what is needed for border security. Mr. Shelby expressed optimism that hearing from those experts “could move us off of” the semantic debate over a wall or fencing.“It’s a question of how do we get off the politics and on to the substance,” he said.Other members of the bipartisan committee — Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas, and Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota — doubled down on their respective party’s positions on “Fox News Sunday.” Mr. Cuellar, who represents parts of the border, dismissed the president’s reasoning for the wall as built on “a false premise.”In the CBS interview, Mr. Trump fought back against criticism of his wall and other policies. He responded to warnings that his administration was risking a resurgence of terrorist groups by promising the rapid withdrawal of troops from Syria and Afghanistan by saying that he “ran against 17 Republicans” and won.“I’ll leave intelligence there,” Mr. Trump said, “and if I see nests forming, I’ll do something about it.”Last week, Mr. Trump showed similar defiance in suggesting that his intelligence chiefs “go back to school” for issuing a threat assessment saying that North Korea was unlikely to give up its nuclear program and that Iran is not, for now, taking steps necessary to make a bomb.Mr. Trump said that he would ultimately rely on his own counsel if he disagreed with intelligence assessments.The president also indicated that the power of his affectionate letter writing with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, might persuade Mr. Kim to drop his nuclear plans. Mr. Trump has at least six letters from Mr. Kim that he enjoys sharing with people who visit him in the Oval Office.“We have had tremendous correspondence that some people have seen and can’t even believe it,” Mr. Trump said. “Now that doesn’t mean we’re going to make a deal. But certainly I think we have a very good chance of making a deal.”Other leaders did not receive such praise. Mr. Trump said that he had declined a meeting with Nicolás Maduro, the embattled president of Venezuela, days after the Trump administration said it recognized Juan Guaidó, the 35-year-old opposition figure, as the country’s rightful leader.“I decided at the time, ‘no,’ because so many really horrible things have been happening in Venezuela when you look at that country,” Mr. Trump said.With his cabinet in flux, Mr. Trump dismissed as “fake news” the reports that Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, had asked Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state and his most visible emissary in negotiations with North Korea, to consider leaving to run for a Senate seat in Kansas.Mr. Pompeo confirmed that discussion over a week ago. The secretary of state said that he had appreciated the call, but that he had a “very full plate.”The CBS interview was broadcast during the president’s first visit in months to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, where he spent Saturday golfing with Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus. On Sunday, the president hit the golf course again amid planning for his annual Super Bowl party.The president told CBS that he loved to watch football, but that he would not encourage his youngest son, Barron, 12, to participate in such a dangerous sport."
242,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon is poised to send at least 2,000 more active-duty troops to the southwestern border, Defense Department officials said Tuesday, deployments that have already cost the military hundreds of millions of dollars and thrust the department into the center of the debate over border security and President Trump’s proposed wall.The acting defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, told reporters that the United States would be sending “several thousand” additional troops to provide more support for the Department of Homeland Security’s border patrol efforts. Defense Department officials later said that they expect that number to be around 2,000.That would come on top of the 2,400 troops who are there now, bringing the deployed number at the border close to the high of 5,900 that it reached in the weeks surrounding the midterm elections in November.The deployment of several thousand military troops to secure the southwestern border will total more than $600 million by the end of the fiscal year in September, Pentagon officials also told the House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday.The deployment of active-duty troops through the end of January is estimated to cost $132 million, said Vice Adm. Michael Gilday, the director of operations for the joint staff. The cost of the National Guard’s operations at the border through the fiscal year, he estimated, will cost $550 million.Since Mr. Trump declared what he called a national security crisis at the border that warranted the deployment of active-duty troops, the Defense Department has sought to limit their role. But the administration has kept them in the mix. The additional troops will be used to install concertina wire and provide more surveillance of the border area, Mr. Shanahan said.Mr. Shanahan replaced Jim Mattis, who resigned in December as defense secretary, in a rebuke of much of Mr. Trump’s national security policy.At one point last year, Mr. Trump described a “wall of people” to stop caravans of Central American refugees and called for up to 15,000 troops to defend the border. The Pentagon reluctantly sent 5,900, then cut that number quickly back to 2,400. The president also spoke of telling the military to respond to migrants throwing rocks as if they were rifles.But the deployments can go only so far. The Posse Comitatus Act, dating to Reconstruction, bars American forces from engaging in law enforcement activities within the borders of the United States.Democrats say the deployments — especially the ones just before the midterms — were flagrantly political.“I am extremely concerned that we preserve the reality and perception that the U.S. military is apolitical,” said Representative Elissa Slotkin, Democrat of Michigan. “It is hard to feel it wasn’t political given how close it was to the midterms.”Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, upon being told that Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, declined his invitation to testify on the issue of border security, cried foul.“Your attempt to use the President’s recent shutdown as an excuse not to testify before Congress prior to the impending shutdown is outrageous,” Mr. Thompson wrote to Ms. Nielsen in a letter on Tuesday.Appearing before the House committee for the first time since Democrats took control this month, Admiral Gilday and John Rood, the under secretary of defense for policy, defended the deployments and said the military’s presence have yielded “very successful” results.“We believe that our military’s presence and support has served to increase the effectiveness” of operations at the border, Admiral Gilday said, adding that the Defense Department has a “long history” of supporting efforts to secure American borders.“We’re not trying just to have a photo op down there,” he continued.As negotiators from the House and the Senate begin meeting this week to hash out a plan to secure the southwestern border and fund the government, Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee seized on the Pentagon’s cost estimates to press for more border security funding.“We’re here at this moment in time because we failed to provide adequate resources” to the Department of Homeland Security, said Representative Paul Mitchell, Republican of Michigan.Democrats on the committee remained skeptical.It is “unclear why this is an appropriate use of the military’s time and resources,” said Representative Adam Smith of Washington, the chairman of the committee. “It appears service members are laying concertina wire and performing other tasks that are better suited for civilian law enforcement agencies.”Admiral Gilday said active-duty troops were deployed before the midterms because thousands of migrants were “massing” along the border. The Trump administration chose to send troops because they could be deployed more quickly than the National Guard, he said. The Department of Homeland Security is currently tracking three migrant caravans containing 12,000 people moving toward the border, Mr. Rood said.Democrats pressed Defense Department officials to identify which projects would be affected if Mr. Trump declares a national emergency and moves funds to build a border wall. Mr. Rood declined to answer, and added that the department had “only done the preliminary preplanning” for such an event.“We are supporting our federal partners on the border, and that mission has been extended until September,” said Lt. Col. Jamie Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. “We are currently sourcing the units involved and there will be an increase of a few thousand troops.”"
243,"WASHINGTON — Hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to work on Monday with a presidential promise of a paycheck “very quickly” but no guarantee that they will be working in three weeks, when a temporary stopgap of funding expires.President Trump and congressional Democrats arrived at a short-term agreement late on Friday, reopening the government after 35 days and the longest government shutdown in history. Lawmakers have until Feb. 15 to reach a compromise on the Republican request for billions of dollars to be allocated for a border wall — a wall Democrats have refused to fund.Referring to the odds that a deal could be struck over that time, Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal on Sunday, “I personally think it’s less than 50-50.” Mr. Trump said he would use emergency powers to fund the wall if an agreement could not be reached.In a stark reminder that federal employees were returning to work with the knowledge that they might be forced to go without a paycheck once again next month, one federal agency, the Department of Agriculture, updated its employee information website and said, “We will also leave some of the shutdown-related material up for a period time, should you need to refer back to it.”Richard Nagle, a lawyer with the Environmental Protection Agency in Chicago, said returning to work after a mandatory furlough required some digging out.“It’s triage,” he said, eyeing his email inbox. “I’m going to go through the ones that are screaming for attention. I haven’t been on voice mail yet, but I’m sure that’s capped out at 32 messages.”In the first hour of his day, one question seemed to be echoing through the halls: What did you do?Colleagues were sharing stories of how they passed the time while they were furloughed. Pretty much everyone confessed to sleeping a little later than usual. Basements were cleaned out, digital photos were organized, hardwood floors were scrubbed until they were gleaming.Some employees took road trips, visiting extended family in Michigan or driving down to Memphis, eight hours away. Anything to stave off the boredom and anxiety of being home, unpaid, during a Chicago winter.As employees streamed into the office, managers stood in the lobby, handing out informational papers on things to know: how to apply for back pay, what to do if you forgot your passwords. Some supervisors brought in sweet treats. There were nudges about projects that had been put on hold — and, in some cases, forgotten — and hurried meetings to figure out what could be accomplished before the next potential shutdown.At a Federal Emergency Management Agency office in Fort Worth, some employees felt like they were racing against the clock.“They’re trying to get as much work as they can get done before flood season, tornado season and hurricane season,” said Steve Reaves, a safety officer for FEMA who also leads the union for FEMA employees. “With us, it’s do as much we can before they try to do this again.”Senior officials on Monday both welcomed their workforces and tried to reassure them about the weeks to come.“I encourage you all to take time to talk to each other about the past few weeks and be transparent with your supervisors about any hardships,” Brock Long, the FEMA administrator, wrote in an email on Monday morning. “I also want to be clear that there is no higher priority than to guarantee, for those who missed paychecks, that you get paid as quickly as possible.”But Mr. Long acknowledged that reopening the government was not as simple as turning a light switch.“While there is important work to be done, I want to make sure that you are set up for success before jumping into your normal assignments,” he wrote. “Please allow time for updates and reboots to computers, addressing expired passwords, syncing mobile devices, managing benefits and organizing your work space. Supervisors have been provided checklists that should be helpful. Again, please also take the time to listen and support each other.”Ryan Baugh, a Department of Homeland Security statistician and a steward for the American Federation of Government Employees, said the possibility that there could be another shutdown had a damaging effect, raising questions about what could realistically be scheduled — meetings, trainings, projects — given the uncertainty.“We’ll work hard for three weeks, and then we’ll see what happens,” he said. “You could still use the word ‘hostage.’ We’re still the bargaining chip here.”The morning commute on Monday in the Washington area was once again bustling after an eerily quiet month of little road traffic during peak travel hours and open seats on trains and buses.At a Metro station near the Environmental Protection Agency’s headquarters in Washington, a small group of environmental activists with the nonprofit group Mom’s Clean Air Force welcomed E.P.A. employees back to work with cinnamon rolls.“Welcome back! Cinnamon roll?” Elizabeth Brandt, a field organizer for the group, chirped as employees rode up the Metro escalator. Ms. Brandt, holding her daughters, Valencia, 5, and Natalia, 3, said that having grown up next to a toxic cleanup site in Tacoma, Wash., it was important to her to make sure the agency’s workers knew their work was valued.“I don’t often get a chance to thank people who do that work the way I thank our pediatrician and the people who give my kids shots,” she said.E.P.A. employees for their part said they were relieved to be back to work yet anxious that the reprieve from the partial government shutdown could be short-lived.“Most of us cannot afford to be without pay for a month,” said Denise Walker, an agency lawyer. “It’s very stressful for people.”The National Park Service reopened on Sunday, but prospective visitors were encouraged to check with individual parks to make sure they were indeed receiving visitors. Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo were set to reopen on Tuesday.Federal workers who had turned to food banks to feed their families continued to struggle to make ends meet as they returned to work on Monday. Some federal employees have been working without pay for weeks. And many federal contractors are not expected to be paid at all for the days the government was closed.Jamie Rodny, an investigator at the Housing and Urban Development office in Los Angeles, said she was both excited to return to work and scared she would be facing the same situation in three weeks. She was told she would not see a paycheck on Monday, and said her branch chief told her that he had heard they might get paid on Thursday.Ms. Rodny, who works for the Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity division, which oversees the enforcement of federal housing laws, said she arrived at her office to find frantic emails and voice mail messages from people whose cases she was forced to drop when the government closed. Now, as she returns these messages, she expects to hear that some of those complainants were evicted over the past 35 days or are facing debts because of the forced lull in their cases.“Where do I start,” she asked.Ms. Rodny spoke at the Women’s March in Washington earlier this month, after she was approached by her labor union, the National Federation of Federal Employees, about the financial and emotional pain of workers affected by the shutdown. Her family lives paycheck to paycheck, she said, and during the break in pay, they used their credit cards for as many purchases as possible, which resulted in her credit score dropping. She said they were able to make their mortgage payment because of donations they received through a GoFundMe campaign. She recently started an activist group called “Stop Government Shutdowns Forever.”The president promised the 800,000 employees who had been furloughed or forced to work that they would be paid “very quickly or as soon as possible,” without providing a specific date. The White House Office of Management and Budget directed agencies to prioritize pay and benefits after reopening.Some federal agencies worked through the weekend in an effort to get paychecks to their workers as soon as possible. The Department of Agriculture instructed its employees to file their time sheets by noon on Monday and pledged to resume direct deposits into bank accounts by Thursday. On Sunday, the commissioner of the Customs and Border Protection agency, Kevin K. McAleenan, addressed employees on Twitter to say that the agency had already approved a majority of the timecards and pledged to work to make sure everyone is paid soon.Aware of the looming Feb. 15 deadline, some lawmakers are trying to pass a law that would outlaw future government shutdowns.“Shutting down the government should be as off limits in budget negotiations as chemical warfare is in real warfare,” Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said on Friday."
244,"WASHINGTON — The Senate is poised as early as Tuesday to act on a Trump-backed measure to end the partial government shutdown, but a bill promoted as a compromise to pair the president’s wall with legal protections for some immigrants would also severely restrict migrants’ ability to claim asylum, drawing fierce opposition from immigrant rights groups.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, is planning on Tuesday to put the measure on the Senate’s agenda, setting up a likely vote on Thursday, absent any agreement from Democrats to act on it sooner. But its prospects in the Senate are dim, and with the shutdown now in its fifth week, 800,000 federal workers are almost certain to miss their second paycheck on Friday.The 1,031-page bill, made public on Monday evening by the Senate Appropriations Committee, would fund shuttered federal agencies through the end of the fiscal year. It includes $5.7 billion for the border wall that Mr. Trump has proposed and large increases for detention of and removal of immigrants, as well as three-year provisional protections for 700,000 of the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers, and 300,000 immigrants mostly from Latin American countries who have been living in the United States under Temporary Protected Status.But while Republicans say the protections are drawn from the Bridge Act, a bipartisan measure, that bill would in fact protect hundreds of thousands more Dreamers, who were brought to the United States illegally as children. The Republican proposal would shield only those who applied for and received work permits under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, created by President Barack Obama, which Mr. Trump rescinded in 2017.[Senate leaders have reached a deal that can end the government shutdown by the weekend.]Federal court decisions have kept DACA in place, and on Tuesday, the Supreme Court again declined the Trump administration’s request to review the legality of the program, almost certainly keeping it in place for the rest of the year. That decision by the court significantly devalued Mr. Trump’s overture to Democrats resisting wall funding.The new Senate measure also includes several provisions that are meant to make it more difficult for migrants to claim asylum in the United States, a legal process that allows people fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries to seek refuge. The changes have been top priorities of Stephen Miller, the conservative White House aide who crafted much of Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda.It would bar Central American children from seeking asylum in the United States, instead requiring them to apply in their own countries, in what the legislation describes as a program that “reduces the incentive for such persons to make the dangerous journey to the United States southern border to request asylum.”But Democrats and immigrants’ rights advocates denounce the plan as cruel. While the Obama administration created a similar program to expedite the claims of Central American children seeking asylum, it never moved to block such minors from applying inside the United States.“These are children who are often desperately fleeing terrible violence back home,” said Representative Diana DeGette, Democrat of Colorado. “They are literally running for their lives and asking for our country to help. Instead of offering them help, this proposal would require border officials to turn a deaf ear to their desperate pleas and send these kids back to the very places they just risked their lives to escape.”A separate provision would allow immigration authorities to quickly remove Central American minors seeking asylum in the United States, a change to an anti-child-trafficking statute that some scholars said would violate international law.“In effect, we are looking at the rapid expulsion of these children,” said Greg Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “The effect of the law will be to send people back into harm’s way, which would be a violation of international law.”The measure also adds a high bar for asylum claims across the board, mandating that they be deemed “in the national interest.” It would introduce a host of new grounds for deeming an asylum claim “frivolous,” including if the migrant seeking protection was also trying to obtain work authorization, had used a fraudulent document — knowingly or unknowingly — or did not file in a timely way.Republicans are arguing that the bill would do precisely what Democrats have been demanding: reopen the federal government immediately. As an added sweetener to Democrats, the measure also includes $12.7 billion for disaster relief, and would renew the Violence Against Women Act, which authorizes and funds services for victims of domestic violence — and expired at the end of last year.But the Senate math does not work in Mr. McConnell’s favor. He would need seven Democrats to join with all 53 Republicans for the measure to pass. But there are no more than a handful of Democrats in Republican-leaning states — Senators Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Doug Jones of Alabama and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia — who might vote in favor.A spokesman for Mr. Manchin said the senator would remain undecided until he saw the text of the measure. Ms. Sinema and Mr. Jones have not announced their intentions.House Democrats are also planning this week to bring up a package of legislation to reopen the government and provide some funding for border-related operations, including infrastructure improvements at ports of entry and immigration judges. They are still weighing whether to bring up their own border security proposal as part of a measure to fund the Department of Homeland Security. But given that none of their plans include money for a wall, Mr. McConnell has said he will not bring them up in the Senate."
245,"WASHINGTON — As the partial government shutdown took hold over the holidays, President Trump seemed to express wonder at being alone in the White House with little but the cheeriness of heavily armed guards to keep him warm for the better part of a week.“I was waving to them,” Mr. Trump said just after New Year’s Day. “I never saw so many guys with machine guns in my life. Secret Service and military. These are great people.”Mr. Trump’s “Home Alone”-like Christmas tale has hardened into a 20-day standoff as relations between his administration and Congress over his $5 billion demand for a border wall grow ever frostier. The White House has stopped paying its water bill. Desks of some furloughed employees, whose job can include such drudgeries as helping their bosses work the copy machine, sit empty in the West Wing.And the Secret Service agents Mr. Trump was so impressed with, down to the officers who check IDs and wave black SUVs in and out of the gates surrounding the complex, are all working unpaid — everyone in the Secret Service is, according to an official at the agency.However, the agency said, “those employees who are performing emergency work involving the safety of human life or the protection of property, the majority of the Secret Service work force, must continue to report to work.”With paychecks failing to fatten the bank accounts of some 800,000 federal workers, the pain of this partial shutdown bit into all corners of America — even the White House, where there is often very little sympathy for those whose job it is to keep Washington running. Only 156 of the Executive Mansion’s 359 full-time employees are allowed to report for duty because their work is considered essential, according to a government contingency plan.But multiple administration officials have stressed this week that despite the shutdown, it is still business as usual. The janitors are emptying the trash and vacuuming offices. The Navy-run White House mess is still serving food — this week, chicken and dumpling soup was on the menu, after leaner offerings including fruit, nuts and other snacks were presented last week on an abbreviated schedule because of the new year.Still, while Trump administration officials emphasize the normality, others who have endured lengthy shutdowns warned of the broader effects on the White House staff, including an inevitable slowdown in accomplishing important policy decisions with fewer workers.“I don’t think people appreciate how isolated you feel,” Jennifer Palmieri, a former communications director for President Barack Obama and a former aide in the Clinton White House, which owns the current record — 21 days — for a shutdown, an unfortunate benchmark Mr. Trump is poised to pass if the impasse continues.Ms. Palmieri said the two shutdowns she experienced were “distinct in my mind as extraordinary moments because there are so few people around and because the stakes are so high.”During a shutdown during the Obama administration in 2013, Ms. Palmieri recalls that she and other workers were forced to bring in their own food, feed the occasional hungry reporter with instant macaroni and cheese fished out of desk drawers, and cart out their own trash.Emptying her own trash was not her biggest concern.“You can get caught up in winning this fight to the detriment of a lot of other policy,” Ms. Palmieri said, “and also your own political capital for the long term.”Bracing for a fight has not always appeared to be a particular concern for aides in this White House, which tends to function in a state of personnel flux and operates with a trench-warfare mentality in the best of times.At the center of the operation, after all, is a commander in chief who emphasizes the importance of never backing down, and Mr. Trump, who is said to be exploring ways to circumvent the need for Congress to provide money by declaring a national emergency — has given every indication that he doesn’t care how long this fight goes on.But some of the president’s furloughed aides are among those who are not able to communicate with others using work phones or email, or seek outside income, rules that have spanned administrations. It all sounds familiar to Cody Keenan, a former speechwriter for Mr. Obama. Mr. Keenan recalled that he was able to continue commuting to his West Wing office during the shutdown in 2013, but many other staff members, including fellow speechwriters, most of whom were stationed in the adjacent Eisenhower Executive Office Building, could not.“Our teams were hit really hard,” Mr. Keenan said in an email. “My speechwriters were furloughed, and we were legally barred from contacting each other until the shutdown ended. Not being paid was especially hard on younger staff who didn’t have any savings yet. But there’s nothing you can do.”Federal employees are counting on getting back their lost pay at some point, but contracted workers could face a different outcome. A spokeswoman for the General Services Administration said that facility managers — considered federal employees — and many contracted janitors and maintenance workers in some offices are still working, but was not able to say whether the contractors would eventually receive their pay.“If they are contractors,” said Amanda Osborn, a spokesman for the agency, “their pay is determined by the status of their contract.”Besides the issue of paying workers, other practical matters at the White House have been left unattended for now.Days after the shutdown took hold, representatives from the Treasury Department left notice with DC Water, the Washington water utility, that the federal government’s $16.5 million quarterly water bill would not be fully paid, leading to a lively discussion among the DC Water Board about at what point a client’s water could be cut off, according to a report from the news website WAMU.It turns out the board will let this one slide.“We are not turning off water to the White House,” Vincent Morris, a DC Water spokesman, said in an email. The outstanding tab: $5 million.Lengthy shutdowns can be disastrous for the White House for other reasons.The last time a shutdown went on for this long, President Bill Clinton put himself on the long road to impeachment when he approached a young intern named Monica Lewinsky in an empty corner of the West Wing. Nonessential employees had been sent home, unpaid interns were brought in to work, and the rest is bitter history.The Obama administration barred interns from coming to work during a shutdown, and the Trump White House’s new class of interns has not yet started, according to a senior official.(“It’s a smart move not to” allow them in, Leon E. Panetta, Mr. Clinton’s former chief of staff during the shutdown, said in an interview.)On Thursday, as the most recent shutdown approached the 21-day mark, Mr. Trump was grudgingly coaxed from the White House. He took a handful of people still working in the White House with him aboard Air Force One to Texas, where he met with border security officials and people whose lives had been affected by the scourge of illegal immigration, not a nagging shutdown.At least seven senior aides were aboard the flight, including Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser; Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his press secretary; Bill Shine, his deputy chief of staff for communications; Mick Mulvaney, his acting chief of staff; and Stephen Miller, a senior White House adviser and architect of the administration’s “zero tolerance” immigration policies.Some may have seen it as a way for the president to break out of his self-imposed shutdown isolation and learn about its effect on legions of federal workers, some of whom are back home, standing sentry on his front lawn. But Mr. Panetta warned that it might have had another effect.“The primary danger is that the president feels that somehow whatever he’s doing he’s winning,” Mr. Panetta said, “and tries to tell himself that it’s the other side that’s going to break first.”"
246,"MCALLEN, Tex. — It was dark in the stash house where they kept her, the windows covered so no one could see inside. At first, the smugglers had her cook for the other migrants who had recently crossed illegally into the United States. Then they took her to a room upstairs, locked the door and began taking turns with her.It was the summer of 2014, and Melvin, a 36-year-old mother of three, had just completed the journey from her native Guatemala, crossing the Rio Grande on a raft before being led to the house in the Texas border city of McAllen.For weeks in that locked room, the men she had paid to get her safely to the United States drugged her with pills and cocaine, refusing to let her out even to bathe. “I think that since they put me in that room, they killed me,” she said. “They raped us so many times they didn’t see us as human beings anymore.”On America’s southern border, migrant women and girls are the victims of sexual assaults that most often go unreported, uninvestigated and unprosecuted. Even as women around the world are speaking out against sexual misconduct, migrant women on the border live in the shadows of the #MeToo movement.[Read: In a Border Courtroom, a Migrant Woman Confronts Her Biggest Fear]The stories are many, and yet all too similar. Undocumented women making their way into American border towns have been beaten for disobeying smugglers, impregnated by strangers, coerced into prostitution, shackled to beds and trees and — in at least a handful of cases — bound with duct tape, rope or handcuffs.The New York Times found dozens of documented cases through interviews with law enforcement officials, prosecutors, federal judges and immigrant advocates around the country, and a review of police reports and court records in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. The review showed more than 100 documented reports of sexual assault of undocumented women along the border in the past two decades, a number that most likely only skims the surface, law enforcement officials and advocates say.In addition, interviews with migrant women and those working with them along the border point to large numbers of cases that are either unreported or unexamined, suggesting that sexual violence has become an inescapable part of the collective migrant journey.[Read the Newsletter: Yes, There Was Duct Tape: The Harrowing Journeys of Migrants Across the Border. Sign up for Crossing the Border here]President Trump has used the threat faced by migrant women to make his case for a border wall. “One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico,” he said in January — an estimate that appears to have originated from some limited surveys, one of them by Doctors Without Borders, of women traveling through Mexico.But less understood is that the violence that befalls migrant women happens not just during the perilous journey through Mexico: Much of it happens after women reach the supposed safety of the United States.In July, a 23-year-old Honduran woman told the authorities that she was sexually assaulted in a bedroom closet by a smuggler who had helped her and her sister cross into the South Texas city of Mission. The following month, a sheriff’s deputy in San Antonio was charged with sexually assaulting the 4-year-old daughter of an undocumented Guatemalan woman and threatening to have her deported if she reported the abuse. In 2017, a guide leading a group of migrants through the Tohono O’odham Nation’s reservation in Arizona raped a woman from El Salvador twice during a seven-day desert hike, threatening to leave her stranded if she resisted. “I hope I leave you pregnant so you have one of my kids,” he said, the woman told the authorities.In 2016, a migrant woman fled a stash house in the South Texas city of Edinburg, where she said she had been raped by a smuggler who brandished a machete. In West Texas that same year, two teenage girls reported that they had been sexually assaulted by a Customs and Border Protection officer, who they said forced them to strip, fondled them, then tried to get them to stop crying by offering chocolates, potato chips and a blanket. In an unusual turn, the girls filed legal claims against the federal government, which settled the case in 2018 for $125,000.At least five of the women who were assaulted — in one case, bound with duct tape, raped and stabbed — were attacked not by migrant smugglers, who are often the perpetrators, but by on-duty Border Patrol agents and Customs officers.Experts say the actual number of sexual assaults is almost certainly much higher than those documented by prosecutors and the police, because most attacks are never reported. And such attacks don’t end at the border. Women have reported being assaulted in immigration detention facilities, and the federal government over a recent four-year period has received more than 4,500 complaints about the sexual abuse of immigrant children at government-funded detention facilities.The Times interviewed eight migrant women from Central America who were sexually assaulted between 2013 and 2016 — women still struggling with nightmares, depression and in some cases, thoughts of suicide. One reported that she was attacked in Mexico; six said they were assaulted in South Texas. One said she was attacked in both Mexico and South Texas. The oldest victims were in their early 40s when they were attacked; the two youngest were 14.Most of their attackers were never prosecuted or identified, and The Times was not able to independently verify the women’s accounts. But all eight women either gave sworn testimony or submitted statements under penalty of perjury to the federal government in order to qualify for visas, and cooperated with the police in the investigation of their cases.They described a netherworld of fear that coexists with the bustling life of American cities up and down the border. One woman told of being held prisoner in a house that had been turned into a makeshift brothel in McAllen, a city of 143,000 in the Rio Grande Valley. “Nueva carne” — new meat, the smugglers said as she and other migrant women were led into the house, said the woman, Lucy, 45, a migrant from Honduras who, like others interviewed, did not want her last name used.She said a series of men came into the house over the next several days and raped her. “Because I didn’t want to let them, they tied my feet together and my hands behind my back,” Lucy said.Gladys, 45, a mother of four from Guatemala, said she was kidnapped by armed smugglers after crossing the border and jumped out of a car to escape, but was captured again. For days, she was held prisoner at a stash house in McAllen and forced to have sex with six men. “I thought it would be better if I died when I fell from the car,” she said.Law enforcement officials on the border said they had made arrests in many of the cases brought to them and would pursue more if they could. But the majority of women who have been assaulted do not report it, often because their attackers threaten to expose their immigration status — or worse — if they do. One woman, raped repeatedly at gunpoint in a stash house in Phoenix in 2005, said her attacker threatened to sell her 3-year-old daughter if she reported him. Those who do go to the authorities may not know the names of their attackers, or even where the assault occurred. Smugglers make sure their clients are unsure of their whereabouts; if they are detained by Border Patrol, they won’t be able to pinpoint where they were held.[Read: Open Wounds, Head Injuries, Fever: Ailing Migrants Suffer at the Border]The women are powerless by almost any measure. Most of the eight interviewed now live in the United States after receiving the victim-related visas. They work in stores, restaurants and factories, most barely making a living. Their English is limited. Many of them have not even told their families what happened.“They don’t have many defenses,” said Jesus R. Romo Vejar, an Arizona lawyer who has represented many migrant women victimized by sexual assault. “Undocumented women and children are the most unprotected of human beings.”Here are some of their stories.Lucy, 45, was raped while being forced to work at makeshift brothels, first in Mexico and then in McAllen. When we got to the house, there were many women. It was a big house. I couldn’t see everybody’s face, but there were different women in different rooms for prostitution. I wanted to flee but I was afraid they were going to kill me. They just told us, “You guys don’t have money, so you have to pay with your body.”When we crossed the river, there was a man waiting, a white guy with tattoos. He was in a truck. We got into the truck. He brought us into a house in McAllen. When we got there, the guy started talking and he said that I was new meat.When they wanted to have sex with me they had to tie me up because I wasn’t cooperative. They tied my feet together and my hands behind my back and then they’d have sex with me from behind.Before, I could not talk about this. I would have panic, really serious panic. I didn’t want to leave the house. I didn’t want to talk to anybody. I thought that everyone in the world saw me as a prostitute. I come from a poor family but a very decent family.It has affected me, yes. But not anymore. I’m kind of enraged. Those guys have mothers and daughters. What they did to us is what they did to women.Melvin, 36, was raped and forced into prostitution in a locked room at a stash house in McAllen.I lost count of how long I was there for. It wasn’t me anymore. I think that since they put me in that room, they killed me. They have no mercy. They don’t care that you’re a mother, that you have family. They see someone who doesn’t matter to them.And I still remember while I was with them there, it was my birthday, and I didn’t want to, not that day. And I remember that he grabbed me and at one point bit me, and when I arrived at the detention center, I still had the bite marks. I told them that it was my birthday. And according to them, the rape that day was for my birthday.I tried to commit suicide three times. Because you can’t live with all of that. And every time I closed my eyes, the men would appear. You’d shower. You’d close your eyes. They were there. I didn’t want to live with that in my head anymore. But here I am.J.E., 19, and two other migrants were kidnapped in South Texas by a Border Patrol agent, Esteban Manzanares, when J.E. was 14. He raped her in his apartment in Mission, Tex., and later committed suicide.He took me and tied me up to a tree. He said he would come back. I was thinking about my little brother, who’s in Honduras, and I’d never see him again. He was about 10, I think. It was hours.He undid me from the tree and put me in the car. In the apartment, there were two beds on top of the other, children’s bunk beds, and ropes there, too. They were shoelaces. For my wrists and my feet.My mind was blank. I was trying to understand everything. I didn’t know what to do. My feet were tied up. I would look at him and he had a gun. And that frightened me. I asked him why, and he answered me that he was doing this to me because I was the prettiest one of the three.There are people who sort of discard you when they know what happened to you. But the majority of my girlfriends do know so they can understand what I went through, and they support me.V.E.M.L., 39, was raped in the South Texas brush by a smuggling guide. She was apprehended, detained at the Hutto detention center in Taylor, Tex., and later deported.I knew that they were the ones who were going to take me across, so I knew that I had to stay with them. I never learned his name. I felt nervous about him. He was very strange. I wasn’t sure if he was on drugs. He always stood up and sat down, and stood up and sat down.The older one walked ahead. The younger one said, “Come with me.”I said, “Where are we going?” And he said, “We’re going to catch up with them ahead.”He bit my mouth so I could not cry out. I was scared that it might occur to him to kill me.Afterwards, he told me to hurry up or he would leave me there on the ground. The guys in the group start saying, “Immigration! Immigration!” I ran toward Immigration. I wanted to get away. But then when they took me and put me in the car, I felt frustrated and alone. I just felt like I couldn’t stop crying. They were all men agents. They kept asking me why I was crying and I couldn’t explain.When they brought me to Laredo, I told a doctor what happened. He said, “Don’t feel like you’re the only one that this happened to. This has happened to many other women.”Cindy, 26, and her son Samuel stayed at a stash house in Mexico while waiting to cross the border. She and another woman were raped by a smuggler, and she learned after being apprehended by Border Patrol that she was pregnant. Samuel is now 8. His little brother, to whom Cindy gave the biblical name of Adonai, is 2.When he entered the room, he had the gun. He took the children out. He had the gun and he pointed the gun at my head when he was attacking us. First he abused me and then he abused her. We’re in his power and we feel like we’re disposable. We can’t do anything because it’s like they tell us, they can kill us and nobody will say anything.It wasn’t until that test that I knew I was pregnant. In that moment, it was like I had been marked. I had been marked because of what had happened to me, that violation.I wanted to kill myself. Going to the psychologist, that’s what helped me heal. She told me that we had to talk about it, we had to think about it, and we had to learn to live with our lives moving forward, even with what happened.My son, I realized he was an innocent bystander in this situation and that it wasn’t his fault. My motivation to keep going in life are my two kids. I thank God because everything that I suffered, they’re the happiness that came out of that."
247,"WASHINGTON — Along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico, which sprawls across four states and nine House districts, a single seat is held by a Republican: Representative Will Hurd of Texas.And Mr. Hurd, a former undercover C.I.A. officer who barely won re-election in Texas’ 23rd District, the largest of the nine, has emerged as perhaps the most persistent critic in his party of President Trump’s wall.Drawing upon his years undercover and his work in the private sector, Mr. Hurd has a starkly different vision for the southwestern border: fiber optic cables, sensors, radar, drones, increased staffing — but not the concrete or steel barrier that Mr. Trump has demanded before he reopens the government.He has joined Democrats eight times this month to vote to reopen the government, without wall funding.“Nobody likes being the cheese that’s standing alone,” Mr. Hurd said in an interview with The Daily, The New York Times’s podcast. “I have a unique perspective because I have so much border, because I have an entire career dealing with these issues. That is more important than any kind of political calculation.”“My specific role has always been to articulate the problems to a level of specificity that people can understand and then give the on-the-ground perspective and experience on what the solutions can be,” he added.Specificity, in this case, lies in the architecture of what Mr. Hurd describes as a “smart wall,” a wish list of technology and upgrades that would protect more than 800 miles of the southwestern border that demarcates the southern side of his district. He would dispense with the concrete wall or steel slats that Mr. Trump has advocated in raucous rallies, in favor of more advanced measures, including “a fiber optic cable from sea to shining sea.”“Let’s make sure we’re using the right tool in the right place,” Mr. Hurd said. “We should be thinking about all these different technologies and how they should be used, and when I describe this, nobody disagrees.”He added, “A wall from sea to shining sea is the most expensive and least effective way to do border security.”He is not, as his staff readily acknowledges, inclined to broadcast his perspective or obsessively rope in votes for his cause. He has not sought opportunities to directly lobby the president to endorse the technological barriers he has envisioned. (Mr. Hurd noted that the “key players” are all cognizant of his position.)Instead, he is content to remain on the periphery of the House Republican Conference, educating his colleagues, extending invitations to visit the border and voting the way he believes the majority of his constituents want him to. That is what resonates in a district that encompasses a large population of cybersecurity professionals — parts of San Antonio and rural areas — and has flipped five times between the two parties since the early 1990s.“My boss is not the president,” Mr. Hurd said. “My boss is not the speaker. My boss is not the minority leader. My bosses are those 800,000 people that I represented and sent me up here.”Aides say he often requests analysis of his personal outreach, including social media data and telephone town halls, that quantify who is following his work and their responses — metrics that inform his support of legislation on Capitol Hill, regardless of the party line or pressure from the presidential Twitter feed.“You can’t take a vocal minority as an indication of the epicenter of where people feel,” Mr. Hurd said. The mix of Republicans and Democrats in his district, he said, “believe that we should be able to secure our borders, and they think that’s a mix of tools that is necessary to do that.”His ability to deftly navigate the electoral perils of his district and retain a place on Capitol Hill has surprised both his party allies and his opponents across the aisle. His margin of victory in November was so slim — a little over 1,100 votes — that Mr. Hurd’s Democratic opponent attended new member orientation before conceding to Mr. Hurd.“I don’t know what it is, but it is clearly working for him,” said Colin Strother, a Democratic strategist in Texas. He added, “I’m sure among Republicans, there are people who aren’t happy that he’s not on board.”Conservatives acknowledge that Mr. Hurd is an asset to their conference; he has secured a temperamental electorate for now, and his intelligence, experience and status as the lone black Republican in the House chamber make him invaluable.“He just approaches it differently than most members,” said Matt Mackowiak, a veteran Republican strategist in Texas. “He’s also given the benefit of the doubt because of how difficult that district is.”Regardless of ideological differences, most Republicans express respect for Mr. Hurd’s knowledge, work ethic and dedication to the people he represents. In an announcement naming Mr. Hurd as a new member of the influential House Appropriations Committee, Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, hailed him as “one of the most innovative and entrepreneurial members” in Congress. Democratic colleagues hear a border security solution that resonates with their own border constituents.“He knows what he’s talking about,” said Representative Juan C. Vargas, a Democrat whose district traverses the California-Mexico border. “He hangs on because he’s smart and knows security.”Representative Pete Aguilar, Democrat of California, first reached out to Mr. Hurd to collaborate on legislation last year that would have secured a path to citizenship for so-called Dreamers, young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, while enhancing border security. The two men now text with each other so frequently that Mr. Aguilar jokes that his wife is a little jealous of their friendship.“Even members of Democratic leadership really respect how supportive he is in finding a solution on this issue,” Mr. Aguilar said.“It’s not lost on anyone on our side of the aisle,” he added, about how Mr. Hurd has crossed party lines to support bipartisan ideas on immigration and rebuff the president’s demands for a wall at the border."

249,"Washington used to know how to have a serious debate about border security.Republicans demanded more money for Border Patrol agents and necessary fences. Democrats argued for better surveillance technology and more resources at the ports of entry. The two parties squabbled over how much to spend, how to pay for it and how it all fit into the broader struggle to overhaul the nation’s broken immigration system.But President Trump has demolished the decades-old, bipartisan understanding about how to bargain over the border. In Mr. Trump’s world, there are no alternatives that can form the basis of a legislative give-and-take, much as his allies and adversaries might hope for them. For the president, the only way to stop what he calls an “onslaught” of illegal immigrants is to erect a massive, concrete or steel barrier across the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico.“Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!” he tweeted last month.By conjuring images of a towering stone edifice around a medieval fortress — and branding those on the outside as invaders threatening to bring crime, drugs and disease to the United States — Mr. Trump has transformed what used to be a complicated, nuanced negotiation into a take-it-or-leave-it demand, laced with xenophobia, that has shuttered nearly a quarter of the government for weeks.“He turns a debate that is fundamentally about more or less, measured in dollars, and makes it a debate that is wall or not,” said Frank Sharry, a pro-immigration activist who has battled over border security for decades in the nation’s capital. “It’s become cartoonish.”For decades, immigration has been an emotional and bitterly fought battle in Washington and around the country. But even so, there has been a consensus among most Republicans and Democrats that securing the southern border requires a mix of costly strategies. That included a large number of Border Patrol agents posted at key points along the vast stretch of land from San Diego to Brownsville, Tex., fences in urban areas and barriers to stop vehicles from crossing and high-tech surveillance gear to alert the Border Agents to the presence of migrants and drugs.Until Mr. Trump was elected, the sticking points had largely been about other parts of the broader immigration debate — cracking down on people who stay longer than their visas allow; preventing companies from hiring illegal immigrants; expanding opportunities for legal immigration; and providing status to those already in the country illegally, including immigrants brought to the United States as children.Such a comprehensive deal is completely out of reach now. But Mr. Trump’s behavior during the past several weeks suggests that even reaching a smaller, more targeted agreement on security arrangements at the border is more elusive than ever before.The current government shutdown, which began just before Christmas, is now the longest one ever in United States history. In the 22 days since the government shut down, there have been virtually no negotiations by congressional lawmakers or the White House. There have been no marathon, pizza-fueled sessions in back rooms at the Capitol. Lawmakers have not traded detailed proposals with each other. Mr. Trump refused to give an inch in his Oval Office speech, and has spent more time in an extended photo-op at the border than he has at the negotiating table.It has all left veterans of past border debates exasperated and frustrated.“We know how to secure borders,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who was a top aide to Senator Marco Rubio in 2013 when the Republican senator from Florida helped lead the last major, bipartisan effort to overhaul immigration. “The 2013 immigration plan had what everybody agreed was the most effective way possible to secure borders and other points of entry.”With the backing of President Barack Obama, a bipartisan group of eight senators that year succeeded in passing a comprehensive overhaul of the nation’s immigration system. But the legislation, which passed with 68 votes, prompted fierce opposition from conservative Republicans, who condemned it as amnesty for 11 million undocumented immigrants. It was never brought up for a vote in the House.Still, the Senate legislation was an indication of where the two parties could agree on border security. It doubled the number of Border Patrol agents, from 19,000 to almost 40,000, an increase that even the authors of the proposal agreed was overkill but was designed mostly as an enticement to win Republican support.Senators from both parties also agreed on money for technological improvements along the border. The bill allocated $3.2 billion for drones, infrared ground sensors and long-range thermal imaging cameras to give Border Patrol agents advance notice when migrants cross illegally, especially at night. It also included money for an electronic employment verification system for all employers and upgrades at airports to catch immigrants who overstay their visas.And the consensus included some physical barriers — what Mr. Trump might call walls and others would call fencing. Years earlier, the Secure Fence Act of 2006 allocated money to build about 650 miles of barriers along the border. The 2013 bill, had it been signed into law, would have increased that total to almost 700 miles, mostly along the eastern half of the border with Mexico.Almost all of the fencing that Congress has approved has already been built. In populated areas, the fence is tall and steel or chain-link and designed to keep people out. In other places, the barrier is nothing more than short, metal poles spaced out to keep vehicles from driving through, or low, wooden fences that run alongside pedestrian paths.In 2011, a Government Accountability Office report concluded that despite 649 miles of completed fencing, the “the southwest border continues to be vulnerable to cross-border illegal activity, including the smuggling of humans and illegal narcotics.”The report recognized that barriers have mostly not been built in the vast, empty stretches in Texas, where rivers and mountains as natural borders have prevented cars from crossing into the United States and made the trek by foot difficult, if not impossible. But Mr. Trump seizes on conclusions like the G.A.O. report’s about the continued influx of illegal immigrants at the southern border as proof that he is right in demanding a continuous wall.In remarks to reporters after a meeting with Democrats at the White House earlier this month, Mr. Trump insisted that the only way to prevent immigrants from crossing between the 25 official ports of entry is to erect fences everywhere else.“We can’t let gaps. Because if you have gaps, those people are going to turn their vehicles, or the gangs — they’re going to coming in through those gaps,” the president said. “And we cannot let that happen.”But there continue to be questions about the wisdom of building a wall from “sea to shining sea,” even from inside Mr. Trump’s administration.A different G.A.O. report, released last year, examined the preliminary cost estimates by Customs and Border Protection of what it would cost to extend the wall along the entire border. The report criticized the border agency, saying that the cost estimates did not take into account that costs would vary depending on the kind of terrain where they were built.In recent days, the rhetoric between the two sides has become more strident than ever. Mr. Trump and his Republican allies have pointed out that Democrats supported fencing in the past, though they purposefully ignore the context of those votes and the difference between the fencing that Democrats supported and the all-or-nothing wall that the president has demanded.Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has called the wall “immoral,” cementing her position against it.“At this point, the idea we could overlook the rhetoric and get a deal done is much harder,” Mr. Sharry, the pro-immigration activist, said."

251,"Update: Steve King was removed from his committee assignments over the comments made in this article. Years before President Trump forced a government shutdown over a border wall, triggering a momentous test of wills in Washington, Representative Steve King of Iowa took to the House floor to show off a model of a 12-foot border wall he had designed.And long before Mr. Trump demonized immigrants — accusing Mexico of exporting criminals and calling for an end to birthright citizenship — Mr. King turned those views into talking points, with his use of misleading data about victims of undocumented immigrants and demeaning remarks about Latinos.Immigration is Mr. Trump’s go-to issue, his surest connection to his most faithful supporters, and his prime-time address on Tuesday night underscored his willingness to use fear and misleading statements  to appeal to voters — just as he did with warnings about a migrant caravan before the midterm elections.The Republican Party hadn’t always intended to go this route: Officials tried for years to come up with broad-based immigration reform that would appeal to growing numbers of Latino voters. But Mr. Trump’s preoccupation with the wall and anti-immigrant politics reflects how he has embraced the once-fringe views of Mr. King, who has used racist language in the past, promotes neo-Nazis on Twitter and was recently denounced by one Republican leader as a white supremacist.With the federal government in a third week of paralysis over a border wall, Mr. Trump’s positions are a reminder of how Mr. King’s ideology and his language maligning undocumented residents helped shape the Republican message in 2016 and 2018 and define Mr. Trump’s agenda and prospects for re-election. Mr. King may have been ostracized by some Republicans over his racist remarks and extremist ties, but as much of the nation debates immigration, his views now carry substantial influence on the right.Early in Mr. Trump’s term, the president invited Mr. King — who was long snubbed by establishment Republicans like the former House speaker John A. Boehner — to the Oval Office. There, the president boasted of having raised more money for the congressman’s campaigns than anyone else, including during a 2014 Iowa visit, Mr. King recalled in an interview with The Times.“Yes, Mr. President,” Mr. King replied. “But I market-tested your immigration policy for 14 years, and that ought to be worth something.”Mr. King, a 69-year-old former bulldozer operator with a combative manner, who has been elected nine times, helped write the book on white identity politics that are ascendant in Mr. Trump’s Republican Party. That provides both a template for Mr. Trump and a warning.Mr. King’s full-throated embrace of nativism has long found a supportive constituency in the rural Midwest, the region that was a key to Mr. Trump’s 2016 victory and represents his most likely path to re-election.But at the same time, Mr. King’s margin of victory in 2018 shrank to its narrowest in 16 years. He made national headlines for endorsing a Toronto mayoral candidate with neo-Nazi ties and for meeting with a far-right Austrian party accused of trivializing the Holocaust. On Twitter, he follows an Australian anti-Semitic activist, who proposed hanging a portrait of Hitler “in every classroom.” And in October, the chairman of the Republican House elections committee, Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, condemned Mr. King, saying, “We must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms.” Mr. King lost corporate agriculture donors like Purina, Land O’Lakes and Smithfield. He dropped from an 18-point lead over his Democratic opponent in his internal polls to barely squeaking out a three-point win on Election Day. On Wednesday, Mr. King drew a formidable challenger for his Fourth District seat in the 2020 Republican primary: Randy Feenstra, an assistant majority leader in the State Senate, who said Mr. King had left Iowa “without a seat at the table” because of “sideshows” and “distractions.’’Mr. King, in the interview, said he was not a racist. He pointed to his Twitter timeline showing him greeting Iowans of all races and religions in his Washington office. (The same office once displayed a Confederate flag on his desk.)At the same time, he said, he supports immigrants who enter the country legally and fully assimilate because what matters more than race is “the culture of America” based on values brought to the United States by whites from Europe.“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” Mr. King said. “Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?”After this article was published Thursday, Mr. King issued a public statement calling himself a “nationalist” and defending his support of “western civilization’s values,” and said he was not an advocate for “white nationalism and white supremacy.” “I want to make one thing abundantly clear: I reject those labels and the evil ideology they define,” he wrote.Mr. King’s influence over national politics derives from his representation of the reddest district in the first presidential nominating state. Nearly all the 2016 Republican presidential contenders sought his blessing at a forum he hosted in Des Moines in January 2015, Mr. Trump included.“Donald Trump came to Iowa as a real nonideological candidate,” Mr. King recalled. Mr. Trump’s first hire in Iowa, Chuck Laudner, was a former chief of staff to Mr. King. Mr. Trump’s first Iowa rally directly followed a visit to the Mexican border.The previous year, Mr. Trump had visited to endorse Mr. King’s re-election. As the congressman warned of scenarios like Islamic State terrorists or even Africans with ebola illegally entering the country, Mr. Trump listened and nodded. When he stepped to the microphone, he echoed Mr. King.“Well, border security is a very big issue,” he said. “People are just flooding across.”Tom Tancredo, a former Colorado congressman who once held the most conservative views in official Washington on immigration, calling for a moratorium on even legal immigrants, said he “handed the baton to Steve King” when he left the House in 2008.David Johnson, a former Republican state senator from Mr. King’s district, said he heard in the president’s rhetoric a direct echo of Mr. King. “They belong to the same subset of white nationalists who are afraid of how the country is changing,” he said.Mr. King was born in Storm Lake, Iowa, and attended high school in nearby Denison, then a nearly all-white rural farming region, where his father managed a state police radio station.After founding an earth-moving company, Mr. King ran successfully for the State Senate in 1996. His most notable legacy from six years in the Legislature was a law making English the official state language. It was a time when packinghouses and other agricultural employers had dropped wages, and Latino migrants increasingly were taking jobs that no longer attracted native-born Iowans.Elected to Congress in 2002, Mr. King attracted the attention of hate-watch groups like the Anti-Defamation League as he spoke increasingly about preserving “Western culture” or “Western civilization.” The groups consider those buzzwords that signal support to white nationalists, along with an obsession with birthrates and abortion rates among different ethnic groups.“He uses the concepts of either ‘culture’ or ‘civilization’ to obfuscate that he’s talking about whiteness and race,” said Lawrence Rosenthal, chairman of the Berkeley Center for Right-Wing Studies.In 2011, Mr. King objected to the Affordable Care Act’s mandate to cover contraception. “That’s not constructive to our culture and our civilization,” he said in a speech in the House. “If we let our birthrate get down below the replacement rate, we’re a dying civilization.”Mr. King seems further emboldened during the Trump presidency.In an interview in August with a far-right web publication in Austria, Mr. King displayed a deep familiarity with racist tracts and ideas embraced by white supremacists.He spoke of “the Great Replacement,” a conspiracy theory on the far right that claims shadowy elites are working behind the scenes to reduce white populations to minorities in their own countries.“Great replacement, yes,” Mr. King said in the interview. “These people walking into Europe by ethnic migration, 80 percent are young men.”The accusation that a “great replacement” of whites is underway — which conspiracy theorists often link to prominent Jews like George Soros — animated the torch-carrying white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017, who chanted, “You will not replace us” and “Jews will not replace us.”Mr. Trump’s refusal to condemn the marchers, and his insistence that there were “very fine people on both sides,” was cheered by neo-Nazi websites.In Mr. King’s interview with the Austrian website, he repeated his yearslong critique of multiculturalism.“What does this diversity bring that we don’t already have? Mexican food. Chinese food,” he said. “Those things, well, that’s fine, but what does it bring that we don’t have that is worth the price?”In recent years, Mr. King has forged alliances with far-right European leaders, including Marine Le Pen of France and Geert Wilders of the Netherlands, one of the most anti-Muslim politicians in Europe, who calls for closing mosques.Ahead of Dutch elections in March 2017, Mr. King endorsed Mr. Wilders in a tweet, saying, “We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.”Amid an ensuing controversy, he claimed the tweet wasn’t about race. Virulent white supremacists, however, heard otherwise.“Steve King is basically an open white nationalist at this point,” wrote Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer.Mr. Anglin and others celebrated that Mr. Trump’s election had made once-fringe beliefs about ethnonationalism acceptable to mainstream politicians.As Republicans have morphed from the party of George W. Bush, who sought legal status for 12 million undocumented immigrants, to the party of Mr. Trump and Mr. King, some party leaders fear for the future in a nation where Hispanic voters are a rapidly growing electorate.“Great damage has been done,” said Carlos Curbelo, a moderate Republican who lost a South Florida congressional seat in the midterms. “For anyone who cares about having a small-government, free-enterprise party in America that can aspire to win national elections, it’s a real concern.”Mr. Curbelo, who tried to forge compromise on immigration in the House last year, said Mr. Trump told him privately, including on Air Force One, that he wanted a deal with Democrats.But the president is paralyzed by the far right, Mr. Curbelo said. “He’s terrified of losing his base and the so-called conservative media.”Last week, as the new Congress was sworn in, Mr. King sat on his side of a chamber sharply delineated by demographics. The Democratic majority included record numbers of African-Americans and women, including the first Native American and the first Muslim women. Mr. King’s side was mostly people who look like him.“You could look over there and think the Democratic Party is no country for white men,” he said."
252,"MCALLEN, Tex. — President Trump was briefed near a county park on the Rio Grande on Thursday on the perils of drugs and violence seeping across the Mexican border. But the river he visited has seen its share of both treachery and normalcy.Just a few months earlier, a short walk from the spot where Mr. Trump stood, two retired Border Patrol agents had set off from the park in their boat. They were testing a new engine in anticipation of a fishing trip. They cracked open some Bud Lights, but the engine died while they were on the water, and on-duty Border Patrol agents, old friends of the guys in the boat, sped out on the river to give them a tow.There were no migrants apprehended, no heroin seizures. It was just one ordinary, leisurely moment on a border that hums with a continuing stream of migrants — and the easy rhythms of day-to-day life — amid a swirling national controversy over proposals to extend a massive wall along its banks.The border depicted by the president and the one lived by most McAllen-area residents are two very different places. The collision between the border’s reality and how it is being portrayed for those thousands of miles away came sharply into focus on Thursday during Mr. Trump’s trip to McAllen, where he met with local, state and federal officials amid protests and counterprotests.Mr. Trump carried his message of border security to a majority-Hispanic city of 142,000 that has been on the front lines of the surge in Central American families coming into the United States.Preliminary plans are underway to expand some border fencing in parts of the Rio Grande Valley, but McAllen has a well-honed infrastructure to handle migrants, both legal and illegal. Many here have been frustrated that the city has become the symbol of a faraway political debate so entrenched it has shut down parts of the federal government.“On the one hand, I don’t like my city being portrayed as if there’s a crisis and unrest, when the reality is we’re one of the safest cities in the U.S.,” said Monica Stewart, a longtime resident and small-business owner who has advised lawmakers on border security and international trade issues.Ms. Stewart does not believe the border wall Mr. Trump wants to build is necessary, and said there were better ways to improve border security using technology.McAllen — which was named for the family that settled in the area in the early 1900s — is a largely blue city, with scores of Hispanic Democrats who help run its municipal agencies, courts, schools and businesses. Many of them were critical Thursday of the president’s visit and said they believed he had manufactured a border crisis to sell his plan for a wall.But McAllen and the larger Rio Grande Valley region are also home to small but vocal numbers of Hispanic conservatives. Many are from middle-class Mexican-American families who have lived in the area for generations and do not identify with the Central American migrants fleeing poverty and violence.Like much else about life on the border, McAllen is never quite what people imagine it to be.One of the most frequent places to run into Border Patrol agents in McAllen is not on the border itself but at Wingstop or Buffalo Wings & Rings. McAllen has synagogues and country clubs. Its biggest employer is the local school district and community college. Its tallest building is the 17-story Chase Tower, home to real estate developers and Senator Ted Cruz’s district office.And its politics are far from predictable.As the president traveled through town, all he had to do was look out the motorcade’s windows to see a mix of opposition and support for his visit. Parts of the route were lined with protesters who waved signs — “Our home is not a crisis” and “No al muro” (Spanish for “No to the wall”) — and with Trump supporters who had their own signs.At one moment on the protester side, police officers wrestled at least one person to the ground as tempers flared.The McAllen police said two people were arrested following a confrontation between Trump supporters and protesters.Joe Cantu, a 75-year-old Trump backer who wore a red Make America Great Again hat and matching T-shirt, parked at a mall near the airport and was preparing to join a crowd of fellow supporters who gathered to cheer the president’s visit. Some held flags and signs reading “Build the Wall” and “Latinos for Trump.”“Hell yeah, we need a wall,” said Mr. Cantu, a South Texas native who is the former police chief of the nearby town of San Juan.Mr. Trump at one point walked over to dozens of supporters gathered at the airport.“Oh, I like that,” Mr. Trump said when a supporter handed him a military baseball cap with “Trump” emblazoned on the front.Joaquin Zamora, a city commissioner who was part of a contingent of officials and supporters who greeted Mr. Trump at the airport, said he was proud to have the president of the United States visit the city where he was born and raised. But he did not completely support Mr. Trump’s plan to build a wall in a region that thrives on binational commerce and trade.“I think over all it’s not the neighborly thing to do with our neighbors to the south,” said Mr. Zamora, 47, who is also a Hidalgo County prosecutor. “You shouldn’t be using immigration to shut down the government to get what you want. Certainly I think there’s other ways to go about it.”Mr. Zamora said he hoped the president’s visit would help dispel, not fuel, misconceptions about the city.“We’re a wholesome community,” he said. “We’re an American city that’s on the border. What we don’t want is the perception that we’re a dusty border town with burros and carts, AK-47s being fired every 30 minutes and Molotov cocktails being thrown. Because that’s not what’s happening in McAllen.”The county park adjacent to where Mr. Trump got his briefing, known as Anzalduas Park, lies directly along the Rio Grande, and on Thursday, for the presidential visit, it was closed to the public.City residents said the last time that happened for a presidential visit was in 2006, when President George W. Bush held a news conference there. It is, they said, a place where families go on weekends for barbecues and gatherings, and one of its defining features is that just across the river, on the Mexican side, families fill the banks for their own barbecues and gatherings.They are so close, united by a river, that they could wave at one another. Sometimes, they do just that."

254,"It’s funny that we’re still talking about the physical features of what President Trump wants or will settle for on our country’s southern border — about whether it will be concrete or steel, solid or slatted, a fancied-up fence or, in Nancy Pelosi’s hilariously acerbic dig, a “beaded curtain.” Because it’s not really a wall that Trump is after, if indeed it ever was. It’s a victory for victory’s sake. It’s a show of his might. It’s proof of his potency. Of course he discussed it in a much different manner on Tuesday night, when, for the first time during his presidency, he formally addressed Americans from the Oval Office in prime time. He spoke of a “crisis of the heart” on the border. He spoke of a “crisis of the soul.” He mentioned drugs, crime, Americans who have lost their lives because of undocumented immigrants and Americans who have lost their jobs to them. It was an epic threat that he painted — and a grossly exaggerated one. Whatever it takes to deliver on a promise that he should never have made.Whatever it takes to salvage his pride.The longer his stalemate with Democrats in Congress grinds on, the clearer that becomes. Seldom has a president’s ego been this tender, and seldom has it required so much shoring up. There’s not enough concrete in creation for that job. Network executives had little choice but to grant him access to the airwaves. He had never made such a request before, so it’s not like this particular grandstanding is habitual.[Go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with Frank Bruni’s candid reflections on politics, culture, higher education and more every week. Sign up for his newsletter.]And had the networks refused him, they would have handed him a cudgel in the culture wars that he would have used the same way that he governs — shamelessly, putting his ludicrous claims of martyrdom above any national interest. Better for the networks to go along, with a plan in place to check his assertions rigorously and call out his lies immediately. Even this deep into a presidency of such incompetence and amorality, he deserves a hearing; that’s how the rest of us demonstrate the very respect for traditions and norms that he refuses to show. But he doesn’t deserve an unfiltered one. That’s the road to autocracy.Trump isn’t selling something that the country really needs, and that’s why he and his allies have to lard the pitch with lies. According to The Washington Post Fact Checker, there are more bogus claims and hallucinated menaces when he talks about immigration and the border than when he talks about anything else.He insists that would-be terrorists see a porous southern border as a welcome mat, but that’s bunk: Most try to get into the United States by plane and are apprehended at airports. He wildly inflates the amount of crime committed by undocumented immigrants and just as wildly overstates the effect a border wall might have on the country’s opioid crisis. He did this again on Tuesday night, even though he wasn’t speaking off the cuff, in a revved-up style, at one of his rallies. He read prepared remarks, and still there was fiction aplenty in them.Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, who were given time immediately following Trump to present a rebuttal, clearly expected and were ready for that. In ticking off reasons that an expensive and expansive border wall wasn’t needed, Pelosi kept saying, “the fact is,” “the fact is.” It was a mantra meant to humiliate Trump, which is a sport that she is developing an ever greater taste for.When it comes to the border and the wall, Trump’s willful estrangement from reality is so profound that network executives and newspaper editors spent part of Tuesday in strategy sessions about how to respond to his inevitable barrage of falsehoods. Should there be a crawl of words on the bottom of the television screen to correct him in real time? Could fact checkers work speedily enough to post rebuttals online within minutes of his misrepresentations, before they took root? This is where we find ourselves. Other presidents have been untrustworthy, and others have had to be called out on it. But not like this. This is surreal.It’s a function of, more than anything, his ego, his vanity, to which the television networks, furloughed federal workers — all Americans — are hostage. He’s not remarkable among presidents in having a high opinion of himself and in desperately wanting others to share it. A robust measure of arrogance and some degree of neediness are what make the grind of the campaign trail and the glare of the media bearable. And all presidents want to rack up triumphs that make them look and feel large. But none in my lifetime has spun so many falsehoods in the service of that. None has been so naked in his hunger for that heft.To live with his resounding defeat by that “nasty woman” in the popular vote, Trump had to invent the specter of millions of illegally cast ballots. He never did produce any evidence of that. To not feel eclipsed by President Barack Obama, he claimed there was a media conspiracy to undercount his inauguration crowd. But photographs don’t lie. Not the way a president does.The day after his inauguration, in a visit to the C.I.A. headquarters, against a backdrop of stars that symbolized men and women who had been killed on the job for America, he used his remarks to tally his appearances on the cover of Time magazine. “I think we have the all-time record,” he said, but “we” as usual meant “I.” There’s no occasion unsuitable for bragging, no mission more vital than the exaltation of Trump. When, over the recent Christmas holiday, he at last paid a visit to a combat zone and spoke to American troops in Iraq, he seemed less intent on thanking them for their service than in having them thank him. He dwelled on a pay increase that they had received and claimed — erroneously — that they had gone without one for 10 years, until he came along.“We got you a big one,” he said. “I got you a big one. I got you a big one.” I. Big. That’s the Trump credo in two words. And that, at this point, is the point of the wall. I. Big. “It’s like a manhood thing for him,” Pelosi reportedly told House Democrats in a closed meeting last month. “As if manhood could ever be associated with him.”But bigness eluded Trump on Tuesday night. He came across as cramped, frustrated and forced to plead when he’d much rather command. He’s bunched up and boxed in. And the rest of us are yoked to this crazy, self-affirming monument that’s a barrier only to reason and responsible government."
255,"President Trump on Friday said that he was considering the declaration of a “national emergency” along the border with Mexico, which he apparently believes would allow him to divert funds from the military budget to pay for a wall, and to use military personnel to build it. While it is hard to know exactly what the president has in mind, or whether he has any conception about what it would entail, one thing is clear: Not only would such an action be illegal, but if members of the armed forces obeyed his command, they would be committing a federal crime.Begin with the basics. From the founding onward, the American constitutional tradition has profoundly opposed the president’s use of the military to enforce domestic law. A key provision, rooted in an 1878 statute and added to the law in 1956, declares that whoever “willfully uses any part of the Army or the Air Force” to execute a law domestically “shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years” — except when “expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.”Another provision, grounded in a statute from 1807 and added to the law in 1981, requires the secretary of defense to “ensure that any activity (including the provision of any equipment or facility or the assignment or detail of any personnel)” must “not include or permit direct participation by a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps in a search, seizure, arrest, or other similar activity unless participation in such activity by such member is otherwise authorized by law.” In response to the Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans, Congress created an express exception to the rules, and authorized the military to play a backup role in “major public emergencies.” But in 2008 Congress and President Bush repealed this sweeping exception. Is President Trump aware of this express repudiation of the power which he is threatening to invoke?The statute books do contain a series of carefully crafted exceptions to the general rule. Most relevantly, Congress has granted the Coast Guard broad powers to enforce the law within the domestic waters of the United States. But there is no similar provision granting the other military services a comparable power to “search, seize and arrest” along the Mexican border. Given Congress’s decision of 2008, this silence speaks louder than words. Similarly, the current military appropriations bill fails to exempt military professionals from criminal punishment for violating the law in their use of available funds.It is, I suppose, possible to imagine a situation in which the president might take advantage of the most recent exception, enacted in 2011, which authorized the military detention of suspected terrorists associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban. But despite President Trump’s unsupported claims about “terrorists” trying to cross the border, it is an unconscionable stretch to use this proviso to support using the military for operations against the desperate refugees from Central America seeking asylum in our country.It is even less plausible for the president to suspend these restrictions under the National Emergencies Act of 1976. From the Great Depression through the Cold War, presidents systematically abused emergency powers granted them by Congress in some 470 statutes, culminating in the Watergate fiasco. In response, the first section of the 1976 act terminated all existing emergencies and created a framework of checks and balances on the president’s arbitrary will. If President Trump declared an emergency, Section Five of the act gives the House of Representatives the right to repudiate it immediately, then pass their resolution to the Senate — which is explicitly required to conduct a floor vote within 15 days. Since President Trump’s “emergency” declaration would be a direct response to his failure to convince Congress that national security requires his wall, it is hard to believe that a majority of the Senate, if forced to vote, would accept his show of contempt for their authority.The Supreme Court’s 1953 decision in Youngstown v. Sawyer would be critical in Congressional consideration of such a decision. In a canonical opinion by Justice Robert Jackson, the court invalidated President Truman’s attempt in 1952 to use his powers as commander in chief to nationalize steel mills in the face of labor strikes. The decision imposed fundamental constitutional limits on the president’s power to claim that a national emergency — in this case, the Korean War — allowed him to override express provisions preventing him from using those powers domestically.The law is clear; how it would play out is less so. But undoubtedly, we would see a period of passionate debate on Capitol Hill, with scores of representatives, from both parties, condemning the president’s move as an unconstitutional abuse of his powers as commander in chief. This would play out in public, with millions of service members watching closely. They would immediately be obliged to decide whether to obey President Trump — and risk criminal punishment. For the president to put these men and women in such a position, simply out of petulance over congressional opposition, would be especially unconscionable. Should the president proceed, he should ask the Office of Legal Counsel to issue an opinion explaining to service members why they would not be “willfully” acting illegally if they heeded the president’s command. But we know this president well enough to know that will not happen. Instead, he will likely take the most irresponsible path possible, issuing his “national emergency” through a tweet or a question-begging written pronunciamento. Recall how legally flawed his first stabs at the so-called travel ban were; if anything, his willingness to seek legal advice, and the ability of those around him to provide it, has declined since then. What this all adds up to is a potential crisis much graver than whatever immigration emergencies the president has in mind: A legally ignorant president forcing our troops to choose between his commands and the rule of law in a petty political struggle over a domestic political question."
256,"WASHINGTON — A coalition of 16 states, including California and New York, on Monday challenged President Trump in court over his plan to use emergency powers to spend billions of dollars on his border wall.The lawsuit is part of a constitutional confrontation that Mr. Trump set off on Friday when he declared that he would spend billions of dollars more on border barriers than Congress had granted him. The clash raises questions over congressional control of spending, the scope of emergency powers granted to the president, and how far the courts are willing to go to settle such a dispute.The suit, filed in Federal District Court in San Francisco, argues that the president does not have the power to divert funds for constructing a wall along the Mexican border because it is Congress that controls spending.[Read the full lawsuit here.]Xavier Becerra, the attorney general of California, said in an interview that the president himself had undercut his argument that there was an emergency on the border.“Probably the best evidence is the president’s own words,” he said, referring to Mr. Trump’s speech on Feb. 15 announcing his plan: “I didn’t need to do this, but I’d rather do it much faster.”The lawsuit, California et al. v. Trump et al., says that the plaintiff states are going to court to protect their residents, natural resources and economic interests. “Contrary to the will of Congress, the president has used the pretext of a manufactured ‘crisis’ of unlawful immigration to declare a national emergency and redirect federal dollars appropriated for drug interdiction, military construction and law enforcement initiatives toward building a wall on the United States-Mexico border,” the lawsuit says.Congress is on its own separate track to challenge the president’s declaration. The House of Representatives, now controlled by Democrats, may take a two-prong approach when it returns from a recess. One would be to bring a lawsuit of its own.Lawmakers could also vote to override the declaration that an emergency exists, but it is doubtful that Congress has the votes to override Mr. Trump’s certain veto, leaving the courts a more likely venue.Joining California and New York are Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon and Virginia. All have Democratic governors but one — Maryland, whose attorney general is a Democrat — and most have legislatures controlled by Democrats.[Read the first edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]The dispute stems from steps Mr. Trump said he would take after lawmakers granted him only $1.375 billion for new border barriers, legislation he signed last week to avoid another government shutdown.Mr. Trump asserted the power to tap three additional pots of money on his own: $600 million from a Treasury Department asset forfeiture fund for law enforcement priorities; about $2.5 billion from a military antidrug account, most of which would first be siphoned from other military programs the Pentagon has yet to identify; and $3.6 billion in military construction funds he said he could redirect by invoking an emergency-powers statute.Presidents have invoked emergency-powers statutes nearly five dozen times since Congress enacted the National Emergencies Act of 1976, but never before has one been used to make an end-run around Congress after it rejected funding for a particular policy.But as the debate over Mr. Trump’s action shifts to courtrooms, legal experts warned that its fate may turn less on such high constitutional principle and more on complex legal issues — from whether plaintiffs can establish that the case is properly before the courts, to how to interpret several statutes.“Even though Trump’s political maneuver to get around an uncooperative Congress looks like it stretches the Constitution, the questions presented in court will raise ordinary and complicated issues of administrative law,” said Peter M. Shane, an Ohio State University law professor and co-author of a separation-of-powers casebook.Two cases had already been filed after Mr. Trump’s announcement on Feb. 15 — one by the nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen, representing several Texas landowners and a Texas environmental group, and the other a case jointly brought by the Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife and the Animal Legal Defense Fund.At least two other lawsuits are expected to be filed later this week. The American Civil Liberties Union has announced its intention to file a case, but has not yet publicly identified its client. The other case will be brought by Protect Democracy, another watchdog group, and the Niskanen Center, a center-right policy institute, on behalf of El Paso County and the Border Network for Human Rights.Many critics have challenged whether an emergency truly exists on the Southern border that a wall would solve, pointing to government data showing that the number of people crossing illegally has dropped significantly over the past generation and that most drugs are smuggled through ports of entry.The president has argued, without proof, that the emergency declaration is warranted because the migrants “invading” the United States across the Mexico border have caused epidemics of crime and drug use.Legal specialists expected the Justice Department to urge a court not to consider facts about the border or Mr. Trump’s words, but rather to defer to the president’s decision. The courts have a long history of being reluctant to substitute their own judgment for the president’s about a security threat.The Trump administration will have a powerful argument to invoke: In the National Emergencies Act, Congress defined no standard for what conditions have to be met before a president may determine that a qualifying crisis exists.But before a judge could weigh whether Mr. Trump invoked the statute legitimately, he or she would have to decide whether the dispute is properly before the court in the first place.Plaintiffs will need to establish standing by showing that they are suffering some particular injury from what Mr. Trump is doing. Several of the lawsuits involve people who own land or represent communities along the Mexican border in Texas, where Mr. Trump has put the focus of his emphasis on the need for more barriers.But it is not clear whether any of the fencing will be built in California or New Mexico, two of the states in the lawsuit, and it certainly will not be built in other states involved in the litigation, like New York, New Jersey or Hawaii.Mr. Becerra, California’s attorney general, suggested that plaintiffs in the states’ lawsuits have standing for reasons that are unrelated to whether any portions of Mr. Trump’s wall will be built in their territory, arguing that “the president’s unconstitutional action could cause harms in many parts of the country.”People in California and other plaintiff states could “lose funding that they paid for with their tax dollars, money that was destined for drug interdiction or for the Department of Defense for military men and women and military installations,” he said in the interview.Further complicating matters, the administration has said it intends to spend the funds in sequence, starting with the $1.375 billion Congress appropriated, and reaching the emergency-power military-construction fund last. The Justice Department is likely to argue that if no disputed spending is imminent, the case is not ripe for litigation and should be dismissed.Ian Bassin, the executive director of Protect Democracy, said that El Paso County would probably argue that its economy was being harmed by Mr. Trump’s emergency declaration because it wrongfully signaled to businesses and potential tourists that they should stay away.The Justice Department declined to comment on the wave of lawsuits. Mr. Trump has said he expected to be sued and to lose in lower courts, but he predicted he would eventually prevail before the Supreme Court.But plaintiffs can also challenge whether the administration is interpreting several statutes correctly.The provision that gives the secretary of defense authority to transfer some Pentagon money into the antidrug account Mr. Trump is then planning to tap, for example, says its authority may be used “in no case where the item for which funds are requested has been denied by the Congress” — raising the question of whether extra funding for border barriers counts as such a forbidden item.And the emergency-powers statute Mr. Trump plans to use permits military construction spending in an emergency that requires the use of the armed forces for projects “to support such use.” That has been used before to build up foreign military bases in a war effort, but litigants challenge whether a permanent wall to help civilian agencies police the border qualifies under that wording.“Judges will certainly be aware of the larger institutional context when they address those technical issues, but that awareness will not, by itself, determine how the legal questions get resolved,” Mr. Shane said."
257,"LONDON — President Trump’s push for a border wall hints at a problem that populist leaders are facing across the Western world.After a year of setbacks, populist leaders and parties are trying to rejuvenate their fortunes by revitalizing the sense of crisis on which they thrive. But as with Mr. Trump’s demand for a border wall — which has brought a two-week government shutdown — this may say more about populism’s weakness than its strength.Immigration and terrorism crises, which aided populism’s world-shaking rise in 2016, have waned. Populists have faced disappointing election results in Germany, the United States and even Poland, shattering the image of the movement’s inevitability and its claims to represent true popular will.The West’s populist leaders and parties have grown defensive, retreating into ever-starker messages of us-versus-them. The approach excites their most dedicated followers. But it can be risky, forcing voters to pick sides at a moment when the populist right holds declining appeal.Cas Mudde, a Dutch political scientist and leading scholar of populism, has predicted that the movement’s once-meteoric rise will become “modest” and “uneven” in 2019, with more setbacks ahead.Populism is hardly dying. It holds power in the United States, Italy and a few Eastern European countries, as well as meaningful parliamentary minorities in much of Western Europe, where populist parties now reliably win about one in six votes.Still, without a crisis to justify populism’s hard-line policies, its message has been stripped down to its most core element: opposition to liberal ideals of pluralism, multiculturalism and international cooperation.The result is a new phase in the populist era, one that will test populism’s appeal — and that of its ideological rival, postwar establishment liberalism — as never before.This story, playing out across Western democracies, may be encapsulated best by the still-unfolding drama of Mr. Trump, the government shutdown and the border wall.Two years after he won the presidency, threats supposedly posed by immigration and terrorism in the United States have not materialized.Illegal immigration continued its 10-year decline. A spate of terrorist attacks inspired by the Islamic State occurred before Mr. Trump took office.Americans lost enthusiasm for strict policies like Mr. Trump’s promised wall on the Mexican border, which polls poorly. Republicans suffered a devastating defeat in the midterm elections. Mr. Trump’s divisive message, rather than pulling more voters in, had pushed some away.But populists, who thrive on conflict against an existential threat, cannot bend with popular will as easily as mainstream parties. Rather than giving up on his wall and compromising his vision, Mr. Trump has dug in.Populists in Europe had a similarly rocky year.In Britain, support for Brexit has slipped below 50 percent. Polls suggest a majority of voters want a second referendum. Brexit hard-liners in the governing Conservative Party tried and failed to eject Theresa May, the prime minister, over her support for a softer Brexit.In Germany, the rise of Alternative for Germany, a far-right party, has stalled. It performed worse than expected in elections in the border state of Bavaria, where immigration is a major issue, and worse than it fared a year earlier.When Bavaria’s center-right party tried to co-opt the populist message and challenge Chancellor Angela Merkel over immigration, it suffered election losses. Ms. Merkel survived, her approval rating spiked and she lined up a centrist successor.Many Western populists are falling back to their message of besiegement and threat, as much out of the paranoid worldview that is central to populism as out of any conscious strategy.Brexit hard-liners are pointing to the 470 people who illegally crossed the English Channel by boat last year, a drop in the bucket compared with the hundreds of thousands of arrivals to Europe in 2015 and 2016. Mr. Trump has claimed, with no hard evidence, mayhem at the Mexican border.But dividing the world into us versus them works only if voters want to belong to “us” and oppose “them,” typically establishment elites and cultural outsiders.In Europe, many more voters have had contact with migrants since 2016, which research suggests can lessen fear and resentment. In the United States, the buoyed economy has undercut fears of economic competition from immigrants.One of the countries most often cited as a populist success last year may also underscore the movement’s challenges.The Sweden Democrats, a populist party, won 17.5 percent of the vote, its highest share ever, in a national election in September. If populists could surge this high, this fast even in Sweden, a bastion of liberalism, surely it represented a global shift.But polls tell a different story.Support for the Sweden Democrats has not grown since the end of 2015, just as the refugee crisis began tapering off. And the party’s share of the vote last year was only slightly more than that of Dutch far-right populists in 2017, which had been considered a disappointing setback for the movement.Sweden’s experience may suggest that Western populists rose only with the refugee and terrorism crises and that, as those crises have faded, populism has stalled out well below the numbers needed for it to sustainably hold power.A review of populism’s global performance, conducted by Jordan Kyle and Limor Gultchin of the London-based Institute for Global Change, reached a similar finding.Populists today hold 20 governments worldwide — the same number they held in 2010, have held most years since and have never surpassed. What we perceive as a new wave may in fact be populism shifting out of poorer countries, often in Latin America, where they have since suffered setbacks, to the West.But there is another way to read cases like Sweden: not as the populist wave cresting, but as the liberal consensus breaking. Even if populists win power only occasionally, struggle in office and mostly consign themselves to an angry minority, that they play any role at all represents a seismic change.Their rise, even if it never progresses much further, could still reshape Western politics in ways we are only beginning to understand.Stripped of claims to be responding to an immigration crisis, the populist message is taking on a certain clarity — and proving an enduring, if narrow, appeal.Though these parties surged in support only recently, their slow but steady rise dates to the 1960s, when postwar liberalism took hold.Ever since, they have used crises to hit on deeper fears of demographic and cultural change brought about by liberalism. And they have channeled opposition to an establishment consensus that called it taboo to question liberal ideals.There has always been some discomfort with the aspect of liberalism that populists are most aggressively challenging: the notion that democracies must extend rights and protections to outsiders.Western populists have surfaced that discomfort and given it voice. By winning at least enough votes to force the world to listen, they have opened up space for Western voters to reject liberal strictures explicitly.Parties like the Sweden Democrats and Alternative for Germany may no longer have much hope of leveraging crises to win power outright. But there appears to be enough latent opposition to liberalism to keep populists well involved in politics.Border crises, real or imagined, are ideal for this message. They highlight aspects of liberalism that people find most objectionable: promises to protect outsiders, demands that countries compromise sovereignty and the softening of fixed, racially defined national identities.So perhaps when Brexit hard-liners or Bavarian populists play up border crises that may seem exaggerated they are speaking to a deeper concern among their small but dedicated base.That may be enough to keep them in national legislatures and conversations. Even if populists in the West never advance beyond their heights in 2016, they will remain in a strong position to challenge liberalism’s postwar hold over Western democracies.Even in countries like Germany or France, where centrist leaders hold power, the establishment party system has collapsed. Seva Gunitsky, a University of Toronto political scientist, has argued that the distinction between democracy and authoritarianism is already blurring, with more elected leaders taking on the tools and tactics of strongmen.Postwar liberal democracy is simply too new of a system, scholars of democracy say, to know whether it can survive these challenges. We may look back at 2016 as a populist blip associated with one-off crises, or as the beginning of a process of chipping away at liberal democracy from within.“For anyone who was hoping for a break in the hectic politics of the past years,” Mr. Mudde wrote in his assessment of populism’s prospects, “2019 won’t be it.”"
258,"WASHINGTON — President Trump agreed on Friday to reopen the federal government for three weeks while negotiations continued over how to secure the nation’s southwestern border, backing down after a monthlong standoff failed to force Democrats to give him billions of dollars for his long-promised wall.The president’s concession paved the way for the House and the Senate to both pass a stopgap spending bill by voice vote. Mr. Trump signed it on Friday night, restoring normal operations at a series of federal agencies until Feb. 15 and opening the way to paying the 800,000 federal workers who have been furloughed or forced to work without pay for 35 days.The plan includes none of the money for the wall that Mr. Trump had demanded and was essentially the same approach that he rejected at the end of December and that Democrats have advocated since, meaning he won nothing concrete during the impasse.Mr. Trump presented the agreement with congressional leaders as a victory anyway, and indicated in a speech in the Rose Garden that his cease-fire may only be temporary: If Republicans and Democrats cannot reach agreement on wall money by the February deadline, he said that he was ready to renew the confrontation or declare a national emergency to bypass Congress altogether.“We really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or steel barrier,” Mr. Trump said. “If we don’t get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on Feb. 15, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and Constitution of the United States to address this emergency.”[President Trump’s emergency powers, explained.]But Mr. Trump has already adopted some of the language that his Democratic adversaries have used during the longest shutdown in history. He conceded that “we do not need 2,000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea — we never did” and invoked the utility of “smart walls” that substitute some physical barriers for drones and other sensors. The semantic evolution provides both the president and Democrats with a face-saving way forward if they want it.The surprise announcement was a remarkable surrender for a president who made the wall his nonnegotiable condition for reopening the government and a centerpiece of his political platform. Some immigration hard-liners that make up a key part of his political base were incensed by the capitulation.“Good news for George Herbert Walker Bush: As of today, he is no longer the biggest wimp ever to serve as President of the United States,” the commentator Ann Coulter, who has aggressively pushed Mr. Trump to keep his campaign promise on the wall, wrote on Twitter.On Capitol Hill, though, jittery lawmakers from both parties greeted the news with relief. Mr. Trump relented as the effects of the shutdown were rippling with ever greater force across the economy, with fallout far beyond paychecks. On Friday, air traffic controllers calling in sick slowed air traffic across the Northeast; hundreds of workers at the Internal Revenue Service also did not show up; and the F.B.I. director said he was as angry as he had ever been over his agents not being paid.“None of us are willing to go through this again,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, referring to a half-dozen Republicans who voted on Thursday for a Democratic measure to reopen the government for two weeks. “And it’s not just a few of us. There are a great many in our conference that feel pretty strongly.”[How the shutdown reordered American life.]Democrats, who declined to revel in their clear victory, said they would work in good faith to strike a deal on border security. They have raised their offer on border security funding considerably and toughened their rhetoric on stopping illegal immigration.But Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated plainly that any compromise would not include money for a new border wall, which Democrats view as ineffective and overly costly even though many have supported border fencing in the past.“Have I not been clear on a wall?” Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. The two have repeatedly said they would support allocating additional money for technology and increased patrols along the border, like the ones Mr. Trump referenced on Friday.The cease-fire should pave the way for Mr. Trump to deliver his State of the Union address to Congress after all, but Ms. Pelosi said it would not be held this Tuesday, as originally scheduled. She had rescinded her invitation this week to come to the House chamber until the government was reopened, and on Friday, she said she would work with Mr. Trump to find a new date.“The State of the Union is not planned now,” Ms. Pelosi said. “When government is open we will discuss a mutually agreeable date.”As he announced the deal, Mr. Trump paid tribute to the federal workers who have endured five weeks without pay, expressing sympathy for them in a way he had not until now. “You are fantastic people,” he said.He promised to ensure that workers would be compensated for the paychecks they have missed since the shutdown began in late December “very quickly or as soon as possible.” To that effect, the Office of Management and Budget circulated a letter to affected agencies and departments on Friday afternoon instructing management to prepare for an “orderly reopening” and to prioritize pay and benefits for workers.But other costs will be more permanent. Many federal contractors do not expect to be repaid for their work during the shutdown. Its compounding effects will ultimately cost the federal government more money than if it was open. And though the long-term economic damage caused by the shutdown remains to be seen, it appears that at the very least the short-term pain was more costly than a down payment on the border wall.According to an analysis from Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, the United States economy lost at least $6 billion in the five weeks the government was partly shuttered — more than the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump had requested to build a steel or concrete barrier at the border.Mr. Trump offered no explanation for his surrender, nor did he acknowledge that it was one. On Twitter on Friday night, he said: “This was in no way a concession. It was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the Shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days, if no deal is done, it’s off to the races!”During the president’s speech earlier in the day, cabinet officials and White House aides lined the sides of the Rose Garden and applauded him. Mr. Trump began his remarks as if he had actually emerged victorious, saying that he was “very proud to announce” what he called “a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government.”Few lawmakers even in the president’s own party saw it that way.“I hail from a state that is very supportive of the president and border security with barriers, so that is a consideration for me, but there are a lot of other strategies we could employ that would work better” than a shutdown, said Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia.With polls showing the president enduring most of the blame by the public, Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, pressured Mr. Trump to agree to the temporary truce. Over the next three weeks, a House-Senate conference committee representing both parties will negotiate a border security plan, but if it fails to reach a consensus, government agencies could close again.The president’s concession came a day after two competing measures to reopen the government failed on the Senate floor. A Democratic bill, which would have reopened the government with no strings attached, received more votes than the bill backed by Mr. Trump, which included temporary protections for some undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion for his proposed border wall.Mr. McConnell and Mr. Schumer huddled on Thursday night after the failed votes to discuss a path forward. Mr. Schumer rejected the idea of offering a down payment for the wall to reopen the government and pitched Mr. McConnell on what ultimately became the agreement with Mr. Trump, according to a senior Democratic aide.Mr. McConnell, who viewed the shutdown as unnecessary from the start, found Mr. Trump eager to end the impasse, and in a series of calls, they ironed out the details. To the Republican leader, it was a way to ease much of the pressure on federal workers and get the Senate back to work.As late as early Friday morning, Mr. Trump appeared intent on declaring a national emergency at the border alongside the agreement to reopen the government, but Mr. McConnell and White House officials encouraged him to drop the idea, according to people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to discuss them.Republican leaders tried to rally their members during a closed policy luncheon before Thursday’s votes. But even as Republicans prepared to support Mr. Trump’s plan, the signs of mounting frustration after weeks of inaction were evident.Republican senators rose one by one to voice concerns about the effect on federal workers and the lack of forward momentum in an impasse that felt unbearable. They swore they would never stand by another government shutdown.“We’ve already lost,” lamented Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, according to people familiar with the remarks. “It’s a matter of the extent we want to keep losing.”At another point, during an exchange first reported by The Washington Post, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, vented at Mr. McConnell for putting Republicans in the position of having to vote on two competing approaches to reopen the government — one Republican and one Democratic — without consulting them first.“You put us in this position,” Mr. Johnson said, according to one of his aides.Mr. McConnell, who had largely been absent from negotiations to reopen the government until late last week, responded, “Are you suggesting I’m enjoying this?”"

260,"LENEXA, Kan. — State Senator Dinah Sykes, a Democrat for three whole weeks, told the retirement home residents that she had felt ignored by Republican leaders. She said that she remained a political moderate. She promised that her views on policy hadn’t changed when she quit the Republican Party, only the letter beside her name.But just like America, and just like Kansas, the roomful of Ms. Sykes’s constituents was divided.“You flipped — I’m disenfranchised,” said Kent Crippin, 82. “And I’ve been a Republican all my life.”Another man told her, “I still feel betrayed, and I won’t make the mistake of voting for you again.”Ms. Sykes choked back tears as she responded. “If I’m not re-elected, that’s O.K., but I did what I felt was right,” she said. “I’m sorry I’ve hurt you.”Ms. Sykes is one of four state lawmakers in Kansas who switched allegiances last month, walking away from the Republican Party that has controlled this state’s Capitol and dominated its politics for years. The defections won’t affect control of the Legislature — Republicans have plenty of votes to spare in Topeka — but they reveal a larger problem for the party as 2020 approaches, and one that reaches well beyond Kansas.The departures reflect a political shift in suburban areas of Kansas, a state that surprised political experts by electing a Democrat as governor in November. That shift is part of a larger realignment in traditionally Republican suburbs across the country, where long-marginalized Democrats are now ascendant and where voters who are upset with President Trump, especially women, have punished some moderate Republican candidates.All four of the lawmakers who announced in December that they were becoming Democrats are women, and all four are from Johnson County, just outside Kansas City, Mo. They each said that distaste for Mr. Trump and unease with Kansas’ increasingly conservative Republican Party contributed to the decision to leave.Centrist Republican lawmakers in Johnson County have found themselves facing a painful choice: Leave the state’s dominant party and alienate loyal voters, or remain Republican despite clear shifts to the left in their districts.“I’ve got constituents saying, ‘We’re cool with you, but how can you be associated with this?’” said State Representative Stephanie Clayton, describing the pressure she faced before leaving the Republican Party in December, a month after she was re-elected as a Republican.Ms. Clayton, who first registered with her former party as a teenager and once led a local Young Republicans chapter, said there had been a “tremendous amount of energy being spent on my part saying, ‘I’m not one of those Republicans.’”Twenty percent of all Kansans live in Johnson County. It is quintessential suburbia: Big houses, bigger parking lots, low crime. The county has always been more politically mixed than Kansas’ bright-red rural areas, but it has been friendly turf for Republicans, especially those bringing messages of fiscal prudence and limited government. In 2012, Mitt Romney carried Johnson County by 17 percentage points.But even as Mr. Trump has expanded Republicans’ reach into some areas, he has become a liability for the party in some well-educated, affluent suburbs. In Johnson County, where the majority of residents over 25 have a college degree and the median household income exceeds $80,000, Mr. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by just 3 percentage points.“Some of the rhetoric nationally has been pretty ugly, especially around the #MeToo movement and the way that our president speaks about women,” said Catherine Barrett, 28, a Republican from Lenexa, a suburb in Johnson County, who supported Mrs. Clinton in 2016. Ms. Barrett said she voted for Ms. Sykes for State Senate when she ran as a Republican, “and I’ll be happy to vote for her as a Democrat.”The political shift in Johnson County seems to be accelerating. Democrats carried the county in four out of five statewide races in 2018. Gov. Laura Kelly’s 17-percentage-point margin in the county was crucial to her flipping the governorship to the Democrats. And Kevin Yoder, a four-term Republican congressman from Johnson County who had always coasted to re-election, was decisively beaten by Representative Sharice Davids, a Democrat who became the first openly gay Kansan in Congress and one of the first two Native American women in the House.“I think there was a lot of pushback that kind of jumped on the national bandwagon of anti-Trump,” said Kelly Arnold, the chairman of the Kansas Republican Party, which retained large majorities in both chambers of the State Legislature. “I think the Democrats did a pretty good job convincing swing voters we need something new.”Across the country, Democrats made inroads in 2018 in suburban areas where they had long struggled. Near Minneapolis and St. Paul, two Republican congressmen lost their seats. Outside Chicago, Democrats took two congressional districts from Republicans and helped vote out Illinois’s Republican governor. And in suburban Orange County, Calif., one of the most famous Republican bastions of the 20th century, Democrats flipped four congressional seats.In Kansas, Mr. Trump is by no means the only force stirring political turmoil. Sam Brownback, the Republican governor who resigned last year to become a United States ambassador, was deeply unpopular in the state after pushing a philosophy of fiscal austerity over several years; his approach to school funding and a tax-cutting plan that led to revenue shortfalls and service cuts angered many residents.Last year’s Republican nominee for governor, Kris W. Kobach, who got his political start in Johnson County by serving on the Overland Park City Council, put off some suburban voters with his strident language about illegal immigration and his public embrace of Mr. Trump. (Mr. Kobach also raised eyebrows by showing up at a parade in Shawnee, in Johnson County, with a replica machine gun mounted on his Jeep.)All the while, a longstanding split between conservative and moderate Republicans in Kansas has grown increasingly contentious.“Conservatives, or the further-right faction of the Republican Party, have continued and continued and continued to try to force those of us of the moderate mind out of the party,” said State Senator Barbara Bollier, a retired anesthesiologist from Mission Hills who was the first of the four Johnson County legislators to announce that she was becoming a Democrat.Along with Ms. Sykes, Ms. Clayton and Ms. Bollier, the other Kansas lawmaker who changed parties was State Representative Joy Koesten, who lost the Republican nomination to a conservative challenger in last year’s primary. Ms. Koesten announced that she was becoming a Democrat a few weeks before her term ended.Some conservatives sounded untroubled by the exodus of moderate lawmakers, who had frequently voted with Democrats in the Legislature even before changing parties. Some conservatives even saw the switches as an opportunity, freeing the Republican Party to run more conservative candidates in those districts.Bob Cook, who has lived in Johnson County for decades, said he had seen his once reliably Republican area make “a 180-degree swing” as younger residents moved in.Parents of school-age children in particular have become a significant political force on issues surrounding education in the county’s Shawnee Mission and Blue Valley school districts, which are consistently among the state’s best.“I don’t think that the entire suburbs are all of a sudden blue,” said Liz Benditt, a leader of Education First Shawnee Mission, a group of mothers formed after the 2016 election that endorsed a mixed list of Democrats and moderate Republicans in legislative races last year. “I just think there’s more openness to talking about things we disagree about and finding common ground.”For decades, Democrats were so toothless in Kansas that many left-leaning residents registered as Republicans so they could vote for moderates over conservatives in the party’s primaries, where most of the real decisions were made. As of last fall, the Republican Party had a 75,000-person advantage in registration in Johnson County. But some of those registered Republicans said the Trump and Brownback eras were pushing them away.“The national politics around the party are such that I could not support it any more, publicly,” said Erin Thompson, 41, a lawyer and Roeland Park City Council member who did not run for another term as her precinct’s Republican committeewoman.The four lawmakers who changed parties gave similar accounts.They said they felt unwanted by Kansas Republicans and out of step with Mr. Trump’s priorities. Several grew frustrated when voters expected them to weigh in on whatever the president was saying on Twitter, or when questions about Mr. Trump dominated their interactions with voters while canvassing.In the end, said Ms. Sykes, who faced the testy reception at the retirement home, “I had to do what I could do to look at myself in the mirror.”"
261,"WASHINGTON — Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said on Wednesday that she would be willing to endorse any bipartisan border security agreement that emerges from House-Senate negotiations, leaving the success of those talks largely hinging on President Trump’s endorsement.With administration officials on Capitol Hill for the State of the Union address on Tuesday, Ms. Pelosi said she told Vice President Mike Pence that she hoped the White House would adhere to “the same hands-off policy” and let the bipartisan group of House and Senate lawmakers come to their conclusion ahead of the Feb. 15 deadline to keep the government fully funded.Mr. Trump has repeatedly scorned the talks as a “waste of time” if a final agreement produced by the group, known as a conference committee, does not satisfy his $5.7 billion demand for a wall at the southwestern border. But Ms. Pelosi offered her unqualified support.“If left to their own devices, if they have a bipartisan agreement, I will support it,” Ms. Pelosi told reporters on Wednesday, adding that she had offered the same assurance to Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and a member of the committee.“Left to their own devices, I think they could have an agreement” by Friday, she added.That might be optimistic. Leaving a classified briefing with committee members and Customs and Border Protection agents, Representative Kay Granger of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, offered a slightly more pessimistic prediction.“No,” Ms. Granger said when asked if there was a chance to reach an agreement by Friday. But a deal by next week, she said, was “absolutely” possible.Mr. Shelby told reporters after the meeting that he hoped a final piece of legislation could be produced by Monday and voted on later next week. Staff members, he said, were again expected to work through the weekend.“Time’s fleeting, and time’s ticking,” said Mr. Shelby, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.The classified briefing with career officials, organized by Mr. Shelby, was supposed to detail the immediate needs of law enforcement at the southwestern border. But lawmakers emerged without a consensus on physical barriers, only with renewed insistence that a final deal needs to include money for some kinds of physical structures as well as technology and manpower.Ms. Granger, who took a brief trip to a handful of cities along the border this week with her House Republican colleagues on the conference committee, conceded to reporters on Tuesday that the structure described by the officials she met would be best categorized as fencing. But she did not retreat from her insistence that physical structures needed to be a part of the final deal.Those on the trip “came back and said, ‘If we’re going to do it right, it has to be some kind of physical barrier,’” she said, singling out the examples of bollard fencing she saw.The group visited McAllen, Tex., along with Representative Henry Cuellar, a Democrat and fellow committee member whose district includes the city. They also toured the border in El Paso and San Diego.“The priority is a physical barrier, a change in the system and enough people that our professional security can do their jobs,” Ms. Granger said.Some of the conclusions that Ms. Granger described seemed to align with those of some of her colleagues, who emerged from the closed meeting describing a solution that encompasses both physical barriers and enhanced technology at the southwestern border.“They don’t rule out barriers, they don’t rule out fences, but technology was their first priority,” said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois. But a tangible combination of all of those, he said, was still unclear.Even if an agreement is reached, Mr. Trump could follow through on his threat to declare a national emergency and try to build the wall by shifting money from other projects. If lawmakers miss the deadline, another lapse in funding could shutter parts of the government just weeks after the end of the country’s longest shutdown.“Obviously, it would be great if the president decided to sign the bill,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said on Tuesday. “I think we don’t know yet what his view is on this.”A short-term spending bill could extend the deadline for negotiators, but multiple lawmakers have said they dread the prospect of again punting on a final spending bill.Mr. Trump’s decision to refrain from threatening a national emergency or a shutdown in his State of the Union address offered a glimmer of hope.“He never used the word shutdown, which I think is very significant,” Mr. Cuellar said in an interview after the president’s speech. “I think that sends out a signal to the Republicans to say, ‘Work something out.’”“I think that there is a path forward, but people need to understand we are not going to do the $5.7 billion,” he added on Wednesday. “I think we all agree that it has to be a comprehensive thing.”"
262,"WASHINGTON — One thousand new customs officers at ports of entry, imaging technology to scan every vehicle coming into the country, increased spending on the Coast Guard, Secret Service and other agencies, and new technology at mail processing facilities to find fentanyl and other opioids — but nothing for a wall at the southwestern border.House Democrats laid out the general terms of their offer for toughening border security on Wednesday as House and Senate negotiators met for the first time to find a deal before Feb. 15 that can prevent another government shutdown. But the Democrats’ opening bid showed how far the parties have to go in the next two weeks, and no one seems sure of what President Trump will or will not sign.“Border security is more than physical barriers, and homeland security is more than border security,” said Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, Democrat of California and the chairwoman of the Appropriations subcommittee that deals with homeland security. She later told reporters after the meeting that while Democrats have supported funding fencing in the past, they wanted to examine technological innovations that could be used in place of fences.Mr. Trump, weighing in on the negotiations hours before they were scheduled to begin, warned on Twitter that if the group was not “discussing or contemplating a Wall or Physical Barrier, they are Wasting their time!”While not yet finalized, the House Democratic proposal served as an opening bid. The emphasis was on technology and improving existing operations, such as expanding the Border Patrol’s air and marine operations, increasing “risk-based” targeting of passengers and cargo at ports of entry, bolstering the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s preparedness programs, improving the Transportation Security Administration’s threat detection capabilities at security checkpoints and even funding a new Coast Guard polar icebreaker.“Nothing can be considered in a vacuum,” Ms. Roybal-Allard said. “More funding for one priority means less for others.”“There are serious homeland security vulnerabilities for which we will have no funding if the president gets his way,” she added.Democrats also insisted on their own priorities beyond homeland security. They proposed new funding to improve Customs and Border Protection’s care for migrants in the agency’s custody, expanding an “alternatives to detention” program at Immigration and Customs Enforcement to keep families together while reducing the number of ICE detention beds and requiring more frequent detention-facility inspections.Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, declined to say whether Democrats would block any money for barriers or fencing, telling reporters after the meeting that “everything is on the table” and that she did not want to get ahead of the negotiations. A day earlier, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the No. 5 Democrat in the House, told reporters that the party would be “willing to support fencing where it makes sense” if derived from “an evidence-based fashion.”During the meeting, however, there was little mention of a wall. Republicans spoke of physical barriers placed, as Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, put it, “where it makes sense.”Representative Tom Graves, Republican of Georgia, said, “I suspect we might have some discussions about terminology and the words we use.”“Whether it’s deterrents, whether it’s obstructions, whether it’s walls, whether it’s barriers, I think we’re all here for a very narrow scope,” he added.Lawmakers from both parties signaled that they would be open to a broad package that combined the smart technology promoted by Democrats and the physical barriers that could pacify Mr. Trump.“I think it’s going to take a comprehensive approach,” Senator Richard C. Shelby, an Alabama Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told reporters. “And I think that would be part of it.”Some members on the committee raised the prospect of visiting the border. Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas and the only member of the committee from a border district, displayed photos of the mountains and rivers stretching through the Texas border as he argued that a wall would not work.But after a bruising and record-breaking shutdown, the 17 negotiators said they wanted to prove that bipartisan success was possible.“Doing our job means by definition nobody gets everything they want,” said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri. “This is our first real test.”Across the Capitol, senators from both parties agreed that any kind of deal would be preferable to another shutdown.“I’m for narrow or broader,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said on Tuesday when asked what he felt was an appropriate scope for a final deal. “I’m for whatever works that prevents the level of dysfunction we’ve seen on full display here the last month.”But lawmakers disagreed on the mechanism to prevent another funding lapse.Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and a member of the negotiating panel, known as a conference committee, told his colleagues that if their final deal included language that “put an end to government shutdowns once and for all, count me in.”Multiple lawmakers have also introduced legislation that would prevent funding lapses if spending bills were not completed in time. Among them: a bill that Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, has introduced every session since 2012 that would automatically continue funding for a short time without a formal spending bill; and the Stop Stupidity Act proposed by Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, which would automatically maintain funding for all aspects of the government except the executive and legislative branches.But prominent Democrats in the House, including Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, and Ms. Lowey rejected such automatic stopgap spending measures as a dereliction of Congress’s constitutional power of the purse.“Congress ought to do its job,” Mr. Hoyer told reporters on Tuesday. “I personally am reticent about automatic bills that in effect take Congress out of having to make decisions.”Even a ceremonial resolution declaring that “shutdowns are detrimental to the nation and should not occur,” proposed by Representative Jennifer Wexton, Democrat of Virginia, failed to win the two-thirds majority required to pass it Wednesday under expedited House rules.Only 21 Republicans voted for the resolution, and 163 opposed it. Several Republicans had lobbied for the removal of certain language singling out Mr. Trump for his role in forcing the government shutdown, Ms. Wexton said, and members of the hard-line Freedom Caucus took to the floor to protest the resolution.But even with the offending language removed, an overwhelming majority of the Republicans voted against the ceremonial measure and subsequently in favor of keeping the shutdown tool alive as a bargaining chip. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, condemned the resolution on the House floor as “a glorified press release.”"
263,"In the early months of the Trump administration, with the president no longer running his family business, his eldest sons embarked on a plan to roll out two new hotel lines in dozens of American cities. It reflected the ambitions of “the next generation of the company,” President Trump’s son Eric said at the time.Now, in a striking reversal, the Trump Organization is no longer pursuing the signature initiative, according to company officials.Plans for the two hotel chains, Scion and American Idea, are to be shelved indefinitely, most likely for the remainder of the presidency. As a practical matter, that means calling off just one agreement, in Mississippi, though two years ago the Trump Organization said it had as many as 30 potential deals in the pipeline.The retrenchment comes as the company faces growing scrutiny from federal prosecutors and congressional investigators, and as a former employee, Michael D. Cohen, heads to prison for multiple crimes. With Democrats now in control of the House of Representatives, any new hotel deals could have provided investigative fodder for critics of the president.“We live in a climate where everything will be used against us, whether by the fake news or by Democrats who are only interested in presidential harassment and wasting everyone’s time, barraging us with nonsense letters,” Eric Trump said in a statement. “We already have the greatest properties in the world and if we have to slow down our growth for the time being, we are happy to do it.”The decision to walk away from the hotel plans is the latest and clearest sign of the perils of running a family business whose owner occupies the White House. As Eric Trump and his brother Donald Jr. downsize the Trump Organization’s hotel ambitions, the president has lamented the toll that elected office has taken on the company. “I lost massive amounts of money doing this job,” he told The New York Times in a recent interview. “This is one of the great losers of all time.”Some of those losses stem from an ethics code that Mr. Trump was encouraged to adopt: It has prevented the company from doing new business abroad during his presidency, halting the global growth that for years brought in millions of dollars in fees. But other wounds have been more directly self-inflicted. In the United States, where the company intended to open the Scion and American Idea hotels, Mr. Trump’s divisive rhetoric and polarizing politics have turned his brand into a target for opponents.The Trump Organization, which the president continues to own, faced local opposition to potential Scion deals in cities like Dallas and St. Louis. Some potential development partners were also scared away by the prospect of intense media coverage and legal and financial vetting from the company’s outside ethics adviser, people briefed on the matter said.The people said that as of Thursday the Trump Organization was walking away from more than a dozen potential deals in Washington, D.C., and at least five states.The only new hotel deal the Trumps had announced was in the Mississippi Delta, a remote region unlike anywhere the company had done business. The Trumps planned to collaborate with local hoteliers, the brothers Dinesh and Suresh Chawla, on one Scion and as many as three American Idea hotels.In a statement about parting ways with the Chawlas, the Trump Organization left open the possibility of reviving the Scion and American Idea brands. Donald Jr. and Eric Trump praised the Chawlas and the would-be Scion property, predicting it would still be “an absolutely spectacular project.”Dinesh Chawla, whose company plans to move forward on the hotels without the Trumps, declined to comment beyond the statement. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, and it is unclear whether the Trumps were required to compensate the Chawlas in some way for pulling out. In the joint statement, the Chawlas said, “We understand their position completely.”The failure to launch was hardly foreseen in June 2017, when the Chawlas appeared at Trump Tower in New York to announce the partnership. Donald Jr. told the story of how the families originally met — the Chawlas’ immigrant father had sought business advice decades earlier from Donald J. Trump, who surprisingly returned the call.Then, at the end of the event, Eric Trump spoke optimistically about the company’s new direction. “You just wait to see what we do,” he teased a crowd of hotel executives, channeling his father’s flair for salesmanship.While the retreat from Scion and American Idea is a setback for the company, it also signals that the Trump presidency takes priority over the Trump bottom line.Long before Eric Trump’s statements on Thursday, some senior executives at the Trump Organization expressed concern that expanding the hotel operation could backfire and reflect poorly on the president, according to the people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it. The executives worried that any potential new deals could lead to accusations that the company — and its owner — were profiting from the presidency.In late 2017, Eric Trump foreshadowed a shift in strategy, indicating in an interview that the company would concentrate on its existing golf, real estate and hotel properties.“If we have to take a break for an eight-year period of time or a four-year period, then it is what it is,” he said, referring to new business opportunities.At the outset of the presidency, Mr. Trump’s sons inherited a company that was coming off a decade of growth, having opened a slate of golf courses and luxury hotels from Chicago to Las Vegas. Marketing deals put the Trump name on properties around the world, as well as on suits, mattresses and a host of other products.The presidency proved to be a game changer.The Trump name became so toxic in some places that the company was paid to remove it from hotels in Toronto and New York. The majority owner of the Trump hotel in Panama took a more drastic step, ordering the T-R-U-M-P letters pried off the property with a crowbar.In the last two years, the company has also been under scrutiny from federal investigators and Democrats in Congress, particularly after Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to arranging hush money payments during the presidential campaign to two women who said they had had affairs with Mr. Trump. The Trump Organization reimbursed Mr. Cohen for one of those payments, and is itself a focus of the ongoing investigation.The company has also faced a torrent of negative media coverage, most recently over revelations, first reported in The Times, about its employment of undocumented workers. The reports, which prompted a review of its properties’ staffs and the firing of more than two dozen workers, came at a time when Mr. Trump was denouncing illegal immigration as a threat to national security.Still, the presidency has not put a damper on all aspects of Mr. Trump’s business. Some international deals that were in the works before the election have moved forward, including a Trump-branded hotel in Vancouver and a golf course in Dubai that opened in early 2017, and other plans that are still underway in India, Uruguay and the Philippines.The Trump International Hotel in Washington, which opened in 2016, has surpassed expectations, with its lobby regularly packed with Republican officials and operatives. It has also caused headaches for the company, having prompted lawsuits claiming that Mr. Trump is illegally profiting from the presidency. Two cases now working their way through the courts focus on whether patrons of his hotels hail from overseas or state governments, a potential violation of the emoluments clauses of the Constitution.Mr. Trump brushed off those concerns in the recent interview with The Times, suggesting that any new business dealings were more than offset by lost opportunities. During the presidential campaign, about six months before his surprising victory, Mr. Trump told The Times that he had about 120 deals in the pipeline. His executives had been working on hotel projects across the globe, including in Israel, Saudi Arabia and China.After the election, the self-imposed prohibition on new development in foreign countries caused the Trump Organization to cancel some proposed deals and its pipeline to rapidly shrink, the company has said. Just before taking office, Mr. Trump said his company had turned down a potentially lucrative deal in Dubai.Closer to home, where fewer restrictions applied, the company focused on the prospect of new hotel lines in cities such as Cincinnati, Nashville and Valley Forge, Pa.The hotels were intended to target an audience different from the patrons of the existing five-star Trump properties. The Scion, a four-star line, would be a hipper boutique option. American Idea, a chain of budget-friendly hotels, would feature hints of Americana. Scion was announced before Mr. Trump’s election, and the concept for American Idea materialized after the Trumps spotted an opportunity during the campaign to expand into farther-flung markets with fewer hotel options.Potential partners, though, were put under a microscope.The company aborted a Scion deal that was under discussion in Dallas, after The Times reported that the prospective partner had ties to Russia and Kazakhstan and the Trumps’ outside ethics adviser raised questions about the potential deal. The Times also reported that the Chawlas, the partners in Mississippi, had turned to the state government for millions of dollars in support through a tax rebate program.New business activity slowed even further last year, and the company announced no new hotel deals. The Trump Organization briefly managed a Livingston, N.J., hotel owned by the family of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, and were in talks to open a Scion on the Jersey Shore that the Kushners would have owned. Both of those endeavors fell through.The Mississippi hotels seemed to be the exception. Though they were far behind schedule, the hotels showed signs of progress last year, including laying the foundation for some of the buildings.Trump hotel executives visited Mississippi and spent considerable time working with the Chawlas to revise the plans for the hotels.The Chawlas, in the statement, left open the possibility of doing business with the Trumps in the future. “We hope that when the time is right,” they said, “we can work with Trump Hotels again.”"
264,"President Trump has addressed the nation in prime time from the Oval Office, delivered remarks from the Rose Garden, met with Democrats in the Situation Room and traveled to the border with Mexico to make his case that the government would not reopen unless he got funding for a border wall.Thirty-five days into the shutdown, the president announced on Friday from the Rose Garden that the government would reopen until at least Feb. 15, giving Congress time to work out a deal on border security.He did not get any funding for a wall. And on Friday, he did not advance any new arguments for building one. In fact, many of the claims he made were recycled heavily from previous comments and contained many of the same misstatements and exaggerations. Also notable was something Mr. Trump did not say, namely that Mexico would pay for the wall, one of the most often repeated, and unsupported, claims he has made on the border funding dispute.The essence of Mr. Trump’s pitch for a border wall — that a porous border had led to a crime and drug epidemic — remained unchanged.Last year, he said, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement “removed 10,000 known or suspected gang members like MS-13 and members as bad as them.” (This is exaggerated; the agency reported it had removed 5,872 “known or suspected” gang members in the 2018 fiscal year.)In addition, Mr. Trump repeated the statistic that in the past two years, ICE “arrested a total of 266,000 criminal aliens inside of the United States, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes and 4,000 homicides or, as you would call them, violent, vicious killings.” The figures include both charges and convictions, and each arrest may represent multiple offenses. The most common charges were traffic violations and drug and immigration offenses.“Drugs kill much more than 70,000 Americans a year and cost our society in excess of $700 billion,” the president said. The figures are accurate for overdose deaths and the economic costs of addiction. But a border wall would do little to prevent the 35 percent of overdose deaths involving prescription opioids or the $627.5 billion in costs incurred because of tobacco, alcohol and prescription drug addiction.Still, the president pressed the case.“I believe that crime in this country can go down by a massive percentage if we have great security on our southern border,” Mr. Trump said. “I believe drugs, large percentages of which come through the southern border, will be cut by a number that nobody will believe.”The claim that a wall would lead to a huge decrease in crime is not supported by statistics. Construction of a wall would not suddenly remove millions of undocumented immigrants already in the United States, and there is no evidence of a causal link between immigration and crime. As for drugs, 90 percent of heroin coming into the United States enters through the southern border. But it is mostly smuggled through legal ports of entry and not wall-less areas. Most Fentanyl arrives in the United States from China through the mail.Though border crossings have been declining for nearly two decades, Mr. Trump continued to stress the need for a border wall with exaggerated data and overstated claims.“Last month was the third straight month in a row with 60,000 apprehensions on our southern border,” he said. “Think of that. We apprehended 60,000 people.”That monthly figure for October and November — data for December was not yet publicly posted — includes the 51,000 people caught illegally crossing the border, as well as the 9,000 to 10,000 people who attempted to enter through legal ports of entry but were deemed “inadmissible” each month. In the 2018 fiscal year, apprehensions at the border averaged 33,000 per month.And he recounted with graphic detail what happens to victims of smugglers: “Women are tied up. They’re bound. Duct tape put around their faces, around their mouths. In many cases, they can’t even breathe. They’re put in the backs of cars or vans or trucks. They don’t go through your port of entry. They make a right turn going very quickly.”It is possible that Mr. Trump learned of a duct-taping case from law enforcement officers, but more than a dozen experts in human trafficking told The Washington Post and The Toronto Star that they had not witnessed or heard of such an episode.For emphasis, he added, “It’s at the worst level — human trafficking — in the history of the world.” Millions of Africans were forcibly enslaved and trafficked during the 15th and 18th centuries.Mr. Trump thanked federal workers for their sacrifice and support: “Not only did you not complain, but in many cases, you encouraged me to keep going because you care so much about our country and about its border security.” Whatever Mr. Trump may have personally heard, polls have shown the opposite — most civil servants have overwhelmingly opposed the shutdown.Beyond federal workers, he said, Republicans and Democrats — and, by extension, the American people — are “for complete border security, and they have finally and fully acknowledged that having barriers, fencing or walls — or whatever you want to call it — will be an important part of the solution.”A Washington Post poll this week noted that surveys have “consistently showed that a majority of Americans do not support the wall.” The Post-ABC News poll found that 54 percent of Americans oppose the project, while 42 percent support it, unchanged from a survey two weeks ago.On Friday, the president said, “We do not need 2,000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea — we never did.” He added that he had never proposed such a thing. Dozens of times during the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump promised to build a wall along the southwestern border, usually saying it would be 1,000 miles long at varying heights and costs. At times, the building materials changed. He mentioned concrete, steel and, at one point, even a wall that would have solar panels. But a wall and the unsupported pledge that Mexico would pay for it were foundational elements of his campaign, and Mr. Trump has continued to make similar assertions throughout his presidency."
265,"President Trump leaned hard on the strength of the American economy during his second State of the Union address on Tuesday, but with a blend of precise statistics and gauzy superlatives that are much more difficult to measure.He also returned to a theme that dominated the second year of his presidency — a quest for a border wall with Mexico to cope with what he said is a crisis of crime and drugs in the United States caused by illegal immigration.The two issues dominated his address, which in tone was more measured than his biting Twitter feed, but in substance contained numerous claims that were false or misleading.Here is what Mr. Trump said and how it stacked up against the facts. [Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]“The U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world.”The American economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in the third quarter of 2018. Growth in Latvia and Poland was almost twice as fast. Same for China and India. Even the troubled Greek economy posted stronger growth. And a wide range of economic analysts estimate that the growth of the American economy slowed in the fourth quarter, and slowed even further in the first month of 2019. “We recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods — and now our Treasury is receiving billions and billions of dollars.”Since Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on certain imports from China — and imported steel and aluminum from around the world — federal tariff revenues have increased. Revenues from customs duties, which include tariffs, rose by $13 billion in the third quarter of 2018 compared with a year earlier, the Commerce Department reported. Technically, that money is paid by Americans who bring the goods across the border, and it is often passed on to American consumers in the form of higher prices.“My administration has cut more regulations in a short period of time than any other administration during its entire tenure.”The Trump administration has slowed the pace of adopting new rules, and it has moved to roll back some existing or proposed federal regulations, particularly in the area of environmental protection. The White House claimed that as of October, a total of $33 billion worth of future regulator costs had been eliminated. But experts say the scale of the rollbacks in the Trump era still does not exceed extensive cuts in federal rules during the Carter and Reagan administrations, when rules governing airline, truck and rail transportation were wiped off the books, among other changes. “We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs — something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.” The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that since January 2017, when Mr. Trump took office, the economy has added 4.9 million jobs, including 454,000 jobs manufacturing jobs. Far from being “impossible,” that is closely comparable to the pace of job creation during some two-year periods during the Obama administration, and significantly slower than the pace of job creation in manufacturing in the 1990s.Wages were “growing for blue-collar workers, who I promised to fight for. They are growing faster than anyone thought possible.”Wages are rising faster for construction and manufacturing workers than workers in service occupations, according to the Labor Department.“More people are working now than at any time in our history.”While the total number of people working in the United States is higher than ever, it is not because of the president’s policies. It is because more people than ever live in the United States. “The border city of El Paso, Tex., used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation’s most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country.” El Paso was never one of the most dangerous cities in the United States, and crime has been declining in cities across the country — not just El Paso — for reasons that have nothing to do with border fencing. In 2008, before border barriers had been completed in El Paso, the city had the second-lowest violent crime rate among more than 20 similarly sized cities. In 2010, after the fencing went up, it held that place.“San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country. In response, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.” Border apprehensions decreased by 91 percent in the San Diego sector between the 1994 fiscal year, right after the original border fencing was completed, to the 2018 fiscal year. But, according to the Congressional Research Service, that fence alone “did not have a discernible impact” on the number of immigrants crossing the border into the United States illegally. “As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States.”At the end of January, a new caravan of thousands of migrants from Central America was headed north, and some of the travelers said they intended to try to cross into the United States. But many in the caravan have said they plan to remain in Mexico, thanks in part to policies put in place by the new Mexican government. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has made it easier for Central Americans to get visas and work in Mexico. President Trump’s warnings of an imminent invasion from new caravans is overstated.“I hope you can pass the U.S.M.C.A. into law, so we can bring back our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words: Made in the U.S.A.”The revised trade deal with Canada and Mexico, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, does include provisions that are intended to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States — like minimum wage provisions for some auto manufacturing. But some economists have said those provisions could ultimately push more manufacturing — and jobs — outside North America. The deal does allow American farmers to sell more dairy products to Canada. But the trade pact has yet to be approved by Congress, and both Democrats and Republicans say that is unlikely to happen without significant changes.""When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Just two years ago. Today, we have liberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters.” The Defense Department reports that the Islamic State now controls only around 20 square miles of territory in Syria, down from 34,000 in 2014. But many of the gains against the Sunni extremist caliphate began under President Barack Obama, with the Trump administration continuing Obama administration policy. And the top American military commander in the Middle East told a Senate hearing on Tuesday that the Islamic State could return if the United States and its allies abandoned the fight. In December, Mr. Trump announced he was withdrawing American troops from Syria.“We condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.”This has become a popular talking point among American conservatives. It is true that the rule of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela has brought that country to economic ruin. Inflation is at astronomical rates, and ordinary people are struggling to get basic food and health supplies. Three million citizens have fled. Some of the collapse can be traced to Mr. Maduro’s economic policies, which do fall under the broad label of socialism. But analysts say that corruption, the lack of rule of law and the absence of democracy — all the hallmarks of a dictatorship — have played just as big or larger roles. “If I had not been elected president of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea.""In 2016, at the end of the Obama administration, there was no sign that the United States and North Korea were about to go to war, though Pyongyang had been conducting nuclear tests and Mr. Obama had continued economic sanctions. In Mr. Trump’s first year in office, he increased tensions with North Korea by attacking its leader, Kim Jong-un, in a series of Twitter posts, which prompted hostile statements from Pyongyang. Mr. Trump wrote that North Korea’s actions would be met with “fire and fury” and called Mr. Kim “Little Rocket Man.” Analysts said at the time that the chances of war between the two nations had grown because of these exchanges.“Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments from birth.”On Jan. 22, the 46th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s landmark decision Roe v. Wade, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, Democrat of New York, signed the Reproductive Health Act. The new law ensures a woman’s right to an abortion in New York if Roe v. Wade were to be overturned. It does not broadly allow abortions until shortly before birth, as Mr. Trump suggested. Instead, it will allow for an abortion after 24 weeks to protect the mother’s health or if the fetus is not viable. Under the prior law, abortions were allowed after 24 weeks only if the woman’s life was in jeopardy.“We had the case of the governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth.”In an interview last month, Gov. Ralph Northam said that he supported a late-term abortion bill that would loosen restrictions on the procedure, and allow women to consult with a doctor on an abortion up to, but not including, the time of birth.The governor, a pediatric neurologist, also talked about some of the dangerous medical emergencies that pregnant women could face, such as carrying a nonviable fetus. He said that in such a case, the mother would deliver the infant and then, “the infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.” While Mr. Northam was talking about an end-of-life care discussion in the case of a child that would not live, Republicans seized on his remarks as evidence that Mr. Northam supported killing babies after their birth.Reporting was contributed by Eileen Sullivan, Michael Tackett, Linda Qiu, Edward Wong, Eric Lipton, Eric Schmitt, Adam Liptak, Binyamin Appelbaum, Caitlin Dickerson, Charlie Savage, Coral Davenport, Glenn Thrush, Helene Cooper, Jim Tankersley, Julian E.

266,"SAN DIEGO — Migrants who are allowed to remain in the United States to pursue asylum are usually given a choice when they are released from detention in San Diego: Go to the Greyhound bus station and fend for themselves, or try to find a cot and a shower at a local shelter.One way or another, once the migrants have been dropped off by discreet white Immigration and Customs Enforcement vans in border towns across the Southwest, they are no longer the federal government’s problem.President Trump has tried and failed to end a practice he derisively calls “catch and release,” and thousands of undocumented migrants apprehended at the border every month are still being granted routine entry to the United States while their cases are processed by immigration courts.But as the number of migrant families in recent months has overwhelmed the government’s detention facilities, the Trump administration has drastically reduced its efforts to ensure the migrants’ safety after they are released. People working along the border say an ever larger number of families are being released with nowhere to stay, no money, no food and no means of getting to friends and relatives who may be hundreds or thousands of miles away.Federal officials say they are unable to do more to help the migrants, and local governments have often been hesitant to get involved because of cost and potential liability.Stepping into the void has been a growing network of charities, expanding along the border from California to Texas. Dating back well into the Obama administration, when the surge in migrant families began, these churches and other nongovernmental organizations have strung together millions of dollars worth of assistance to help keep migrants off the streets and speed their reunion with family members in the United States.“The government isn’t doing anything — it’s been a total make-it-up-as-we-go thing,” said Kevin Malone, one of the founders of the San Diego Rapid Response Network, a consortium of faith-based nonprofits in the area. “People are working 24 hours a day trying to make this happen. Everyone is strapped.”While there has never been a good solution to the issue of what to do with migrants after they are released by immigration agents, recent steps by the Trump administration have exacerbated the situation.Undocumented migrants are held initially at Border Patrol and ICE facilities as their claims for asylum are registered. Previously, government agents would help coordinate plans for their release, contacting family members in American cities and helping secure transportation, even sometimes paying for bus tickets. When charity-operated shelters were full, government agencies sometimes held them a little longer, until they could be transferred.Those practices, known collectively as “safe release,” ended in October, according to a statement from ICE, because the agency has become overwhelmed by the number of migrants it has to process.Part of the problem, government officials say, is that the courts have established a limit of 20 days for holding migrant children in detention, and the government has a very limited number of detention facilities that can handle both adults and children. An earlier attempt to detain them separately was struck down by the courts and rescinded. Waiting to coordinate releases with charity shelters can result in migrant families being held in detention for too long, officials say.“After decades of inaction by Congress, the government remains severely constrained in its ability to detain and promptly remove families with no legal basis to remain in the U.S.,” the agency said. “To mitigate the risk of holding family units past the time frame allotted to the government, ICE has curtailed reviews of post-release plans from families apprehended along the southwest border.”Yet those now trying to help the migrants say the government has abandoned its moral responsibility to make sure they are released safely.Under President Obama, the government also had no infrastructure to provide services to newly released migrants; instead it relied on a cooperative relationship with private shelter operators. Now, the shelter operators say, that cooperation has become fraught.Some charity networks have had to quickly become experts in refugee aid in American border towns. They provide showers, nutrition and clean clothes. Many “guests,” as the volunteers call the migrants, arrive hungry, sick or traumatized. They need fresh diapers for their infants and clean clothes for their older children.The sole shelter in San Diego, run by Jewish Family Service of San Diego, has processed nearly 5,000 asylum applicants since it began operating two months ago. It was built “on a wing and a prayer,” according to Mr. Malone, and has had to move five times to find adequate space. Newly arrived migrants are provided with austere blue cots, portable showers and donated bread and fruit. They are also screened for illnesses.Kate Clark, the director of immigration services at Jewish Family Service, said the organization stepped in nine weeks ago when it learned migrants were being “dumped at the border.” But despite California’s political leaders talking about being receptive to migrants, “every single night, our ability to ensure that none of the migrants are sleeping on the street is questionable, because of the capacity of our shelters,” Ms. Clark said.Their operating costs run between $350,000 and $400,000 a month, largely raised by faith organizations and a GoFundMe account. Still, on days when 100 or more refugees are dropped off, they have little option, because of capacity constraints, other than to turn away families and leave them homeless.“It’s been a difficult couple of years, but there’s never been anything like this,” said Etleva Bejko, the director of refugee services at the organization.The charities have also had to learn how to cope with the illnesses that migrants can develop during the difficult journey from Central America, which many make on buses and on foot.Marcela Wash, a registered nurse who has helped treat migrants in San Diego, said that many arrive dehydrated and in various states of medical distress. Rashes, scabies, and respiratory infections have been extremely common, she said. She estimated that 80 percent of the women she saw had lice.“Their journeys were hard, of course, but many of these things they caught either at a shelter in Tijuana or in detention,” she said.Once migrants are healthy enough to travel, the shelter pays to transport them to join relatives wherever they are in the country, while their cases proceed in court.Some border towns have a more established base of nonprofit assistance for migrants, but they too have seen demands grow in recent months.In El Paso, the Annunciation House has coordinated migrant releases with ICE for years. The migrants typically stay for a few days at the charity’s main building or at one of nearly two dozen churches, hotels and other sites that are part of its shelter network. In recent months, the charity has been assisting about 2,200 migrants a week in El Paso.On a recent afternoon, the shelter’s headquarters, a red brick building about a mile from the border, bustled with activity, part migrant dormitory, part cafeteria and part triage center. Upstairs, a worker holding bundles of laundry walked past family dorm rooms with bunk beds, as the aroma of a dinner being prepared filled the halls. Downstairs, migrant families waiting for a ride to the bus station kept busy by helping to unload a UPS truck parked outside. A new batch of donations had arrived, to add to the towers of Amazon boxes full of clothing and other goods that people around the country had donated.The cost of these operations can be crushing. In just two Texas border regions — the El Paso and McAllen areas — several Catholic groups, charities and local governments have spent roughly $2 million in recent years on migrant relief efforts.On Friday, Ruben Garcia, the director of Annunciation House, was preparing to pay for several rooms at a hotel for the next seven days to handle an overflow of migrants from their shelter. The tab came to about $14,000. Depending on the number of migrants ICE releases, the shelter’s hotel expenses can climb as high as $150,000 a month.Bureaucracy and politics can tie up more significant investments at the local level. Mr. Malone, the executive director of the San Diego Organizing Project, said San Diego municipal and county officials have suggested to him they have been waiting for the state to officially declare a crisis to lend a hand. He presumed that had to do with the bottom line.“It became just a bunch of people pointing fingers,” said Mr. Malone. “And at the end of the day, the other question was, ‘Who is going to pay the check?’ That’s the real reason that no one talked about.”The California Department of Social Services gave the shelter $500,000, but the money could only be used for “case management,” including intake, registration and “know your rights” orientations. It could not be used for most of the shelter’s operating costs, or for transportation costs for the migrants, one of the primary needs. San Diego County has provided medical guidance and nursing and support staff.“We want to help prevent a crisis,” Mr. Malone said. “It’s been our crisis, and I’ve been telling them, soon it’s going to be yours.”Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The city of McAllen, Tex., which has seen the largest number of migrant families during the recent surge, has contributed $517,000 since 2014 toward a relief effort run largely by Catholic Charities.In El Paso, city leaders were forced to act after federal officials made a series of unannounced nighttime releases of hundreds of migrants during Christmas week. The city officials put migrants on municipal buses to keep them warm, took them to shelter sites and coordinated the response with the local Office of Emergency Management. El Paso officials were told that none of the cost would be reimbursed by the federal government.“It’s kind of hard to ask the federal government for emergency relief when they’re creating the problem to begin with,” Dee Margo, the mayor of El Paso, said at a recent City Council meeting.Mr. Garcia, who runs Annunciation House, said that in October, for the first time since 2014 that he could remember, there were several releases of migrants onto the streets of El Paso without any coordination.“I started getting calls from the police department, and everybody and their grandmother was calling me to figure out what was going on,” he said. “I wish to God you could get into one of their offices to ask them, ‘What in the world were you thinking when you did that? What was the objective?’”"
267,"This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.White nationalism lost in federal court yesterday.Judge Jesse Furman blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to add a question to the 2020 census asking about citizenship status. Furman “found that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross violated federal law by misleading the public — and his own department — about the reasons for adding the question,” Dara Lind of Vox writes.Ross claimed, laughably, that the citizenship question would help the Trump administration enforce voting rights. In truth, it was designed to intimidate Latinos — both legal and illegal — into not responding to the census. The resulting undercount would then reduce the political representation of immigrant-heavy regions and cause them to receive less federal funding.[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]The citizenship question, Paul Waldman writes in The Washington Post, is part of “a broader effort on the part of Republicans to put a thumb on the electoral scale in every way they possibly can, whether it’s extreme gerrymandering, voter suppression efforts targeted at minorities, or the use of the census to make Republican victories just that much more likely.”Yesterday’s ruling isn’t the final word. The Trump administration will likely appeal, and the appeal will likely reach the Supreme Court, where Republican-appointed justices hold a five-to-four majority.But there is some reason to hope the justices will avoid an obviously partisan decision. Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, the two newest conservative justices, have previously taken a dim view of federal officials who exceed limits on their power, The Daily Beast’s Jay Michaelson explains. “While it’s always possible that the Court’s conservatives will vote ideology over principle … their particular judicial philosophies do not bode well for the Trump administration’s brazen defiance of administrative law,” Michaelson writes.A side note: Given the combination of his census exploits, his lies about those exploits and his shady stock trades, Ross may now deserve consideration if my colleague Gail Collins revisits her analysis of the worst Trump Cabinet member. His case is helped by the fact that some of his even more corrupt colleagues have recently departed the administration.Barr’s barWilliam Barr’s answers about the Russia investigation weren’t great. Barr — the nominee for U.S. attorney general — told senators yesterday that he would not necessarily recuse himself from a case even if ethics officials found him to have a conflict of interest. And Barr refused to commit to a public release of Robert Mueller’s findings.Yet I was still more encouraged than alarmed by yesterday’s confirmation hearing. At this point, I have extremely low expectations for Cabinet officials selected by President Trump. Barr beat these expectations by saying he would allow Mueller to finish his investigation of Trump. He also came off as substantially more competent and professional than much of the Trump team.And once Mueller does finish his investigation, I think it’s unlikely that his findings will remain secret, regardless of what Barr tries to do. Mueller is a savvy political operator who understands how to use court filings and other means to inform the public of his work. Now that Democrats hold the House, they will also be able to help prevent the findings from remaining secret.“The idea an unclassified Mueller report won’t end up at least de facto public strikes me as totally ridiculous,” tweeted the Georgetown political scientist Matt Glassman yesterday. “To sit on this thing would be almost instantly unsustainable politically.”The crucial thing at this point is that Mueller be able to continue his work unimpeded. Given Barr’s past criticism of the investigation — which Andrew Cohen of the Brennan Center for Justice explains in Slate — he doesn’t deserve the benefit of the doubt. But his remarks yesterday were somewhat better than I had feared.The Brexit messA quick word on the big parliamentary defeat for Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan: Both the cancel-Brexit crowd and the Brexit-without-conditions crowd are feeling hopeful that they can prevail. This confidence has meant neither side has been willing to support May’s more moderate — but still radical — version of Brexit.Britain’s political leaders are now sharply divided among these three broad camps, and none of them has a majority in Parliament. The next steps are uncertain. Any of the three sides could still prevail. If the Brexit-without-conditions side does, Britain could be in for a lot of pain.(And, yes, today’s newsletter is unusually long, because yesterday was unusually newsy.)"
268,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s repeated threat to declare a national emergency so he can build his border wall without congressional approval has been denounced by Democrats as extreme and an overreach. But it could be the only politically realistic way out of the shutdown crisis in the nation’s capital.“I think we might work a deal, and if we don’t, I may go that route. I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Wednesday. “My threshold will be if I can’t make a deal with people that are unreasonable.”If the president does invoke emergency powers to circumvent Congress, it would be an extraordinary violation of constitutional norms — and establish a precedent for presidents who fail to win approval for funding a policy goal.But Mr. Trump’s threatened move offers both sides a face-saving solution in the budget standoff between the president and congressional Democrats that has prompted a partial government shutdown, which, if it lasts to Saturday, will be at 22 days the longest in American history.Both sides have taken absolutist positions that leave no room for the kind of split-the-difference compromise that usually ends budget impasses. Mr. Trump refuses to accept anything less than his demand for about $5 billion in wall spending, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said his wall along the southern border would be immoral.But Mr. Trump’s claim that he can and may attempt to build his wall another way opens the door for him to sign a spending bill with no wall funding, reopening the government without capitulation by either side.While any such move by Mr. Trump is certain to prompt outrage from his critics and wild approval from his supporters, there is good reason to believe that it is unlikely to result in much immediate change. His push for a wall would be channeled into a lengthy court fight, keeping lawyers far busier than construction workers, at least initially, as his term ticks away.“We’re going to be in 2020 before this gets resolved,” said Walter E. Dellinger III, a former solicitor general in the Clinton administration, adding: “If they are just planning where to build slats, judges are unlikely to decide that requires expedition in the Supreme Court. I think they would recognize the wisdom of going slow.”If, in the end, the Supreme Court were to rule that emergency-power laws give Mr. Trump authority to proceed, he would probably face still more litigation with property owners over whether the government may use eminent domain to force them to sell their border lands. There may be little time left in his term after all that to add more than a few miles, if any, of barriers to the 1,954-mile border, which already has 654 miles of fencing.And if the court instead eventually ruled against him, Mr. Trump could honestly tell his supporters that he tried, and then vow to renew the push if he is re-elected. Indeed, he has suggested that he would relish still having the issue of wall to once again rev up supporters in the campaign. He wrote on Twitter late last month that Democrats may have enough votes to stop his wall, “but we have the issue, Border Security. 2020!”In the meantime, the shutdown that is threatening to last for months could end. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors could once again receive their wages and pay household bills. National parks could reopen and be cleaned. Needy families could keep receiving food assistance. Across the economy, farmers and businesses that depend on government actions could proceed with work they need to be handled.“It’s a way to get past an ugly fight in a way that allows the dust to settle and passions to cool while moving on,” said Bruce Buchanan, an emeritus professor of political science at the University of Texas at Austin.If Mr. Trump does invoke emergency powers, fierce criticism would follow. Of the 58 times presidents have declared emergencies since Congress reformed emergency-powers laws in 1976, none involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval. Chris Edelson, an American University government professor and author of a 2013 book, “Emergency Presidential Power: From the Drafting of the Constitution to the War on Terror,” said he could recall no such instance in the first two centuries of American history, either.The precedent Mr. Trump would establish raises the risk of longer-term damage to the American constitutional system, undermining people’s confidence in the country’s democracy, said Elizabeth Goitein, who oversaw a recent study of presidential emergency powers for the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.“It is a crisis when the president of the United States flouts the role of Congress and abuses his powers in order to get around the will of Congress and to undermine the democratic process for lawmaking set forth in the Constitution,” she said.Ms. Goitein and other experts who have studied emergency-powers laws have said there are serious — if not dispositive — arguments that Mr. Trump’s legal team can make that at least two such statutes could be used to erect border barriers by redirecting military construction funds that can be freed up, in a presidentially declared emergency, to build something Congress has not approved.But she and others maintain that it would be an abuse of power for Mr. Trump to proclaim that there is a national emergency along the southern border that justifies a wall. The number of people illegally crossing the border is far lower than it was a generation ago. The recent phenomenon of caravans of Central American migrants largely consists of people who present themselves to border officials and request asylum.And despite repeated false claims by Trump officials that terrorists are infiltrating the country across the border, including by the thousands, no one in the modern era who committed a terrorist attack on domestic soil has turned out to have sneaked in via Mexico.Many legal experts nevertheless expect that in the inevitable litigation, the Justice Department would pressure judges not to even consider the facts, arguing that courts must defer to the president’s judgment about whether an emergency exists rather than substituting their own thinking.But even though courts have traditionally given substantial deference to the president’s determinations in security matters, Mr. Dellinger said that should not be true within the executive branch. He said it was the obligation of senior Justice Department officials who review the legality of proposed government actions — the head of the Office of Legal Counsel, Steven A. Engel, and the acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker — to independently assess whether there really is a justifiable basis to declare an emergency, and if there is not, to tell Mr. Trump no, or resign.“If there is not, in fact, a persuasive basis for this being the kind of national emergency that was contemplated by Congress, and it is nevertheless approved by the Department of Justice, what is the rule-of-law cost? What kind of slope does that start us down?” Mr. Dellinger said. “One question is whether there is some other way out of this current mess that doesn’t involve such a cost to the rule of law.”"
269,"The federal government received more than 4,500 complaints in four years about the sexual abuse of immigrant children who were being held at government-funded detention facilities, including an increase in complaints while the Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant families at the border was in place, the Justice Department revealed this week.The records, which involve children who had entered the country alone or had been separated from their parents, detailed allegations that adult staff members had harassed and assaulted children, including fondling and kissing minors, watching them as they showered, and raping them. They also included cases of suspected abuse of children by other minors.From October 2014 to July 2018, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a part of the Health and Human Services Department that cares for so-called unaccompanied minors, received a total of 4,556 allegations of sexual abuse or sexual harassment, 1,303 of which were referred to the Justice Department. Of those 1,303 cases deemed the most serious, 178 were accusations that adult staff members had sexually assaulted immigrant children, while the rest were allegations of minors assaulting other minors, the report said.“The safety of minors is our top concern when administering the UAC program,” Jonathan H. Hayes, the acting director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, said in a statement, using an abbreviation for unaccompanied children. “None of the allegations involved O.R.R. federal staff. These allegations were all fully investigated and remedial action was taken where appropriate.”[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]The records do not detail the outcome of every complaint, but they indicate that some accusations were determined to be unfounded or lacking enough evidence to prosecute. In one case, a staff member at a Chicago detention facility was accused in April 2015 of fondling and kissing a child and was later charged with a crime. The report did not state whether that person had been found guilty.The documents, first reported by Axios, were made public by Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida, the night before a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday about the Trump administration’s policy of family separations at the southern border. That policy, which was put in place last spring, resulted in more than 2,700 children being separated from their parents under President Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy of prosecuting anyone caught crossing the border illegally, including those with families seeking asylum on humanitarian grounds.For most of the four years covered by the report, the number of allegations made to the Office of Refugee Resettlement stayed about the same from month to month. But the number of complaints rose after the Trump administration enacted its separation policy. From March 2018 to July 2018, the agency received 859 complaints, the largest number of reports during any five-month span in the previous four years. Of those, 342 allegations were referred to the Justice Department, the report showed.During the hearing on Tuesday, a discussion of the records sparked a heated exchange between Mr. Deutch and Cmdr. Jonathan White of the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, who last year repeatedly warned a top official in Health and Human Services that the family separation policy could permanently traumatize young children.As Mr. Deutch read some of the report, Commander White interjected, “That is false!”He later apologized, claiming that a “vast majority of allegations proved to be unfounded.” He said he was unaware of any accusations against staff members that were found to have merit."
270,"I’d like to apologize to all the “banana republics” I’ve offended over the decades with snarky references to their dysfunction. This is karma: I now live in a nation where a petulant president has shut down much of the most powerful government in the world — so the White House isn’t even paying its water bills.The government has shut down before, under presidents of both parties. But this shutdown is particularly childish and unnecessary; to revise Churchill, rarely have so many suffered so much at the hands of so few.It’s difficult to pick the craziest of the arguments that President Trump is making about the shutdown — there’s a vast buffet of imbecility to choose from — but here’s my good-faith effort.1. This is a crisis! Terrorists are crossing the border! Rapists!This is more like a lull than a crisis. The number of people apprehended at the border remains near a 45-year low. From 1972 on, there were more apprehensions every single year than there were in 2017.As for terrorists, experts say that there isn’t a single known case of a terrorist sneaking into the United States along unfenced areas of the southern border. Ever.2. Only a wall can do the job. A big beautiful wall that stops people and drugs.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was wrong to describe a wall as “an immorality,” for we need border security, and a wall in some places can be effective. But a great majority of the undocumented immigrants in the country didn’t arrive by sneaking across the border, but rather came legally, often at airports, and overstayed their visas. The most beautiful of walls wouldn’t stop them.Likewise, drug smuggling is a real problem, but narcotics have mostly been smuggled in on trucks, cars and airplanes at official ports of entry, or through tunnels under the border, or through the postal system — not by individuals crossing remote parts of the border.“The Daily Show” dug up a 2004 college graduation speech in which Trump counseled perseverance of just the kind that makes walls, by themselves, not terribly effective: “Never, ever give up. … If there’s a concrete wall in front of you, go through it, go over it, go around it, but get to the other side of the wall.” 3. But this is a humanitarian issue!Yes, it is. The most egregious humanitarian concern has been Trump’s brutal policy of separating children from parents at the border.“Kids are still being separated,” Lee Gelernt of the A.C.L.U. told me. Mostly the government does this when it says that a parent has a criminal history, but the offenses sometimes were minor or unsubstantiated.Meanwhile, the government shutdown causes other tragedies. For example, even in normal times 3,000 people a year die in the United States from food-borne illness, yet the Food and Drug Administration has now had to stop most routine food inspections, with inspectors sent home on furlough. The result may well be more people getting sick or dying from food poisoning.4. The president doesn't need Congress. After all, he's the president!Plenty of people would be a bit relieved if Trump took the dubious route of declaring a national emergency and trying to steal, er, divert money intended for disaster victims to pay for his wall. It might be a way out of our national stalemate, allowing the government to reopen.But look, folks, when we welcome our president doing something possibly illegal, as he unjustly takes money from disaster victims, that just confirms that we have a crisis — not at the border but in Washington.Trump’s wall isn’t about governing but about creating a political symbol and rallying his base. The problem is that it’s an expensive symbol.By my calculations, the $5.7 billion could send 100,000 at-risk American kids to a high-quality preschool for a year AND provide Pell grants for 100,000 students to attend college for a full four years, with enough left over to ALSO provide a year’s comprehensive treatment to 115,000 Americans struggling with opioid addiction.5. Anyway, Mexico will pay for the wall.Trump repeatedly declared that Mexico would pay for the wall, and he still insists that Mexico will pay for it indirectly “many, many times over.” So I have a solution to the whole mess.Since Mexico will pay for the wall eventually, the problem now is one of cash flow. Fortunately, we have financial instruments to deal with precisely this issue.I propose that Trump pay the $5.7 billion himself, and then the U.S. will repay him (with a nice interest rate) as the Mexican payments for the wall pour in. The Federal Reserve can verify the Mexican income stream and forward the sums to Trump.Since he’s so confident that the wall will pay for itself, he should be delighted with this option. Right, Mr. President?"

No matter how serious the subject, they are an opportunity for politicians to use the tools of entertainment — lighting, setting, writing, delivery — in the service of persuasion.Neither President Trump nor the Democratic congressional leaders did a particularly effective job last night, in their dueling speeches about the government shutdown. Trump is almost comically stiff while reading a pre-written speech. He spent much of his Oval Office address squinting in the camera, as if he couldn’t read his teleprompter, and — as social media noted — he audibly sniffed after many of his lines.Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, for their part, crowded next to each other at a single podium — an awkward set-up that, as Clare Malone of FiveThirtyEight pointed out, is likely to be parodied on Saturday Night Live this coming weekend.It’s unlikely that either performance was effective enough to move public opinion. “Literally no one will remember the Trump speech one week from now. (Same goes, obviously, for the Democratic response),” wrote MSNBC’s Chris Hayes.If last night helped either side, it was probably the Democrats, mostly because they remain in the better position on the fight over the border wall. “Schumer’s doing a nice job painting Trump into the shutdown corner here. Democrats are happy to reopen the government and keep negotiating on the border. Trump isn’t. That’s the winning position,” wrote Vox’s Ezra Klein.Related: In The Washington Post, Marc Thiessen makes the case that Trump was effective. I disagree, on both tactical and substantive grounds, but Thiessen’s piece gives you a sense of what the other side is saying this morning. Trump avoided some of his most blatant lies about immigration and the border wall last night, but the entire premise of the speech — a crisis! — was false. Vox’s Dara Lind has a good explainer.The weak presidentAlaska’s Lisa Murkowski became the latest Republican senator yesterday to support reopening the government without funding for Trump’s border wall. She joins Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado.Yes, all of them are operating partly out of opportunism. They are no doubt afraid of Trump’s unpopularity, both overall and on this issue, and all three face re-election campaigns in 2020. But their distancing themselves from Trump still matters. He is a weak president, and he seems to be getting weaker.Reader feedbackTheda Skocpol, the Harvard professor who studies political movements, wrote me with some thoughts about yesterday’s newsletter on gerrymandering, and I think it’s worth quoting her note in full: That’s yet another reason for a federal law restricting gerrymandering.And although he didn’t contact me directly, another Times reader apparently had some detailed thoughts about my column from this past weekend. "
273,"WASHINGTON — President Trump doubled down on one of the biggest gambles of his presidency on Tuesday night with a televised appeal to pressure Congress into paying for his long-promised border wall, even at the cost of leaving the government partly closed until lawmakers give in.Embarking on a strategy that he himself privately disparaged as unlikely to work, Mr. Trump devoted the first prime-time Oval Office address of his presidency to his proposed barrier in hopes of enlisting public support in an ideological and political conflict that has shut the doors of many federal agencies for 18 days.In a nine-minute speech that made no new arguments but included multiple misleading assertions, the president sought to recast the situation at the Mexican border as a “humanitarian crisis” and opted against declaring a national emergency to bypass Congress, which he had threatened to do, at least for now. But he excoriated Democrats for blocking the wall, accusing them of hypocrisy and exposing the country to criminal immigrants.[Read our fact checks of Mr. Trump’s speech.]“How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?” Mr. Trump asked, citing a litany of grisly crimes said to be committed by illegal immigrants. Asking Americans to call their lawmakers, he added: “This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.”Democrats dismissed his talk of crisis as overstated cynicism and, with polls showing Mr. Trump bearing more of the blame since the partial shutdown began last month, betrayed no signs of giving in. The White House earlier in the day dispatched Vice President Mike Pence and others to Capitol Hill to try to shore up Senate Republicans, who are growing increasingly anxious as the standoff drags on.In their own televised response on Tuesday night, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, accused the president of stoking fear and mocked him for asking taxpayers to foot the bill for a wall he had long said Mexico would pay for.“President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government,” Ms. Pelosi said.In taking his argument to a national television audience and on a trip to the Texas border he plans to take on Thursday, Mr. Trump hoped to reframe the debate. After spending much of the first two weeks of the shutdown cloistered in the White House, he has now opted to use the powers of the presidency to focus public attention on his ominous warnings about the border.[Full transcripts: Trump’s speech and the Democratic response.]Yet privately, Mr. Trump dismissed his own new strategy as pointless. In an off-the-record lunch with television anchors hours before the address, he made clear in blunt terms that he was not inclined to give the speech or go to Texas, but was talked into it by advisers, according to two people briefed on the discussion who asked not to be identified sharing details.“It’s not going to change a damn thing, but I’m still doing it,” Mr. Trump said of the border visit, according to one of the people, who was in the room. The trip was merely a photo opportunity, he said. “But,” he added, gesturing at his communications aides Bill Shine, Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Kellyanne Conway, “these people behind you say it’s worth it.”Mr. Trump plans to head to the Capitol on Wednesday to attend a Senate Republican lunch and later will host congressional leaders from both parties to resume negotiations that so far have made little progress. Mr. Trump has insisted on $5.7 billion for the wall, while Ms. Pelosi said she would not give him a dollar for a wall she has called “immoral.”In a nod to Democrats, Mr. Trump spent the first half of his talk on the humanitarian situation at the border before even mentioning the wall, expressing sympathy for those victimized by human smugglers. “This is a humanitarian crisis — a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul,” he said.Even so, he directly took on Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer. “The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized,” he said.Mr. Trump has made the wall the singular focus of his presidency as he enters his third year in office. His promise to erect a “big, beautiful wall” along the border became perhaps the most memorable promise on the campaign trail this fall, eliciting chants from supporters of “build the wall,” and he has been frustrated by his inability to deliver on it.But his alarming description of a “crisis” at the border has raised credibility questions. While experts agree there are serious problems to address, migrant border crossings have actually been declining for nearly two decades. The majority of heroin enters the United States through legal ports of entry, not through open areas of the border. And the State Department said in a recent report that there was “no credible evidence” that terrorist groups had sent operatives to enter the United States through Mexico.At one point in his speech, he even suggested that Democrats had signaled that they would accept his wall if redesigned. “At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall,” he said, even though Democratic leaders have made clear they oppose the barrier regardless of the material.Even so, Democrats, many of whom like Mr. Schumer voted in 2006 for 700 miles of fencing along the border, did not want to conduct the debate on Mr. Trump’s terms. Instead, they focused attention on the damaging effects of the shutdown, already the second longest in American history. About 800,000 government employees are either furloughed or working without pay, in addition to hundreds of thousands of contractors.House Democrats planned to approve individual spending bills this week that were intended to reopen closed departments one at a time in hopes of putting Republicans on the defensive, but Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has said he would not put any bill on the floor without Mr. Trump’s explicit support.Senate Democrats took to the floor on Tuesday to pressure Mr. McConnell and vowed to block consideration of other legislation until the government is reopened.Mr. McConnell fired back, noting the 2006 legislation. “Maybe the Democratic Party was for secure borders before they were against them,” he said. “Or maybe they’re just making it up as they go along. Or maybe they are that dead-set on opposing this particular president on any issue, for any reason, just for the sake of opposing him.”But two more Republicans, Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, spoke out on Tuesday in favor of reopening the government while negotiations over border security continue. “I think we can walk and chew gum,” Ms. Murkowski told reporters.Ms. Capito expressed frustration with the shutdown and “how useless it is,” indicating that she might support reopening the government while wall talks continue. “I mean, I think I could live with that, but let’s see what he says tonight,” she said before the speech.That makes five Republican senators who have expressed such a position, which if combined with a unanimous Democratic caucus would make a majority to reopen the government if Mr. McConnell were to allow a vote.Allies of the president warned fellow Republicans to stand with Mr. Trump. “If we undercut the president, that’s the end of his presidency and the end of our party,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said on Fox News after the speech.The political nature of the fight was hard to miss. Just hours before he went on air, Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign sent out a fund-raising email asking supporters to raise $500,000 by the time his speech began. On the other side, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a possible candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination next year, offered his own response after Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer.For all of the pyrotechnics of competing national speeches, it seemed like a political Kabuki dance that by the end of the evening had changed no minds in Washington.Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the No. 5 House Democrat, who perhaps most succinctly summed up his party’s response: “We are not paying a $5 billion ransom note for your medieval border wall,” he wrote on Twitter, with a castle emoji. “And nothing you just said will change that cold, hard reality.”If Democrats do not approve money for the wall, Mr. Trump has threatened to declare a national emergency and proceed with construction without Congress, a move that could provoke a constitutional clash with the legislative branch over the power of the federal purse. While some legal experts said the president has a plausible case given current law, it would almost surely generate a court challenge.Even some Republicans warned against it. Senator Susan Collins of Maine said that although the law provides the president with emergency powers, “the administration should not act on a claim of dubious constitutional authority.” She added, “It should get authorization from Congress before repurposing such a significant sum of money for a border wall.”The wall is popular with Mr. Trump’s base, but the public at large holds the president responsible for the shutdown, according to polls. In a Reuters-Ipsos poll, 51 percent of respondents said that Mr. Trump “deserves most of the blame,” up four percentage points from earlier in the crisis, while 32 percent pointed the finger at congressional Democrats.Moreover, the public seems to have grown weary of the impasse. Seventy percent of registered voters in the latest The Hill-HarrisX poll favored a compromise, while just 30 percent said sticking to principles was more important than reopening the government.The president’s use of the Oval Office for the speech stirred some debate, with critics asserting that a setting more typically used for occasions of war or other national security crises was being turned into a partisan platform. The subsequent joint statement by Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer was the first time opposition leaders were given national airtime to respond to a president in the Oval Office.Not counting speeches to Congress, Mr. Trump had made only five formal addresses to the nation before Tuesday night, three of them in prime time and none from the Oval Office, according to Mark Knoller, a longtime CBS News journalist who tracks recent presidential history. Mr. Trump’s previous prime-time speeches were to introduce his two Supreme Court nominations and to announce his decision to send more troops to Afghanistan.By contrast, President Bill Clinton gave 16 addresses to the nation over eight years, 14 of them from the Oval Office. President George W. Bush gave 23 such addresses, six from the Oval Office, and President Barack Obama gave 12, with three from his office."
274,"WASHINGTON — America will get its first taste of divided government under President Trump this week when a Democratic House tries to wrest control of the political agenda from Mr. Trump, who appears determined to keep the focus on border security, immigration and his “big, beautiful” wall.After the midterm elections ushered in the most diverse freshman class in history, House Democrats intend to put a spotlight on the issues that worked well for them during the campaign: diminishing the influence of the wealthy and connected, expanding voting rights, lowering prescription drug costs and passing a bipartisan infrastructure bill.Mr. Trump, on the defensive and presiding over a federal government that remains partially closed, is trying to stomp on that message. On Tuesday, as the government shutdown was in its 11th day, Mr. Trump invited congressional leaders of both parties to a briefing on border security Wednesday afternoon. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Tuesday night that Mr. Trump would attend.It would be the first visit by Democratic leaders to the White House since Dec. 11, when the president told Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer he would be “proud to shut down the government for border security.”Mr. Trump appeared to make a gesture of peace ahead of Wednesday’s meeting.“Border Security and the Wall ‘thing’ and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker!” he said Tuesday on Twitter. “Let’s make a deal?”Just what deal Mr. Trump had in mind was not clear. While Ms. Pelosi has repeatedly signaled she would like to find a compromise that would allow the government to reopen, she has also made it clear that a wall cannot be part of any such deal, whether or not that leads to a messy start to her speakership.After she is elected speaker on Thursday, she hopes to introduce a transparency-in-governing measure to portray Democrats as a responsible governing party and draw a contrast between them and Mr. Trump’s scandal-ridden administration. The measure would require disclosure of shadowy political donors, end gerrymandering of congressional districts and expand voting rights.But their first order of business will be reopening the government, as Ms. Pelosi said Tuesday on Twitter in response to Mr. Trump.The president “has given Democrats a great opportunity to show how we will govern responsibly & quickly pass our plan to end the irresponsible #TrumpShutdown,” she said, “just the first sign of things to come.”Democrats also intend to use their first months in the majority to push for a bipartisan infrastructure bill and legislation to lower prescription drug costs, issues that they believe will have bipartisan appeal.The Democrats plan to pass two bills on Thursday. The first includes six bipartisan spending measures that would fully fund agencies like the Interior Department and the Internal Revenue Service through the end of the fiscal year in September. The second would fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8, with $1.3 billion for fencing but no money for a wall on the Mexican border.With the plan facing a shaky future in the Senate and an intransigent president, some rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties are suggesting that a deal to revamp the nation’s immigration laws, pairing border security and protections for some undocumented immigrants, may be the way out of the stalemate.“How about comprehensive immigration reform?” Representative Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, said on CNN on Tuesday, when asked how Democrats intend to compromise with Mr. Trump.One of Mr. Trump’s closest allies, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, has revived his long-stalled immigration proposal to marry $5 billion for the wall with immigration law changes that might appeal to Democrats, including three-year renewable work permits for young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, known as Dreamers.Mr. Trump has raised the prospects of broader talks on Twitter. “We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,” he said last week. “Hard to believe there was a Congress & President who would approve!”Mr. Trump has also claimed, somewhat misleadingly, that Democrats had already voted for a wall.“I’m in the Oval Office,” he tweeted on Monday. “Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the Wall. You voted yes in 2006 and 2013.”He was referring to the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along 700 miles of the southern border, and to a 2013 comprehensive immigration bill. That bill passed the Senate with 68 votes but did not make it out of the House. It combined the Republican priority of enhanced border security with the Democratic goal of offering legalization and a pathway to citizenship for the nation’s 11 million undocumented immigrants.Democratic leaders are wary of any immigration negotiations with Mr. Trump, whom they view as an unreliable partner. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the new chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said in an interview on Tuesday that Democrats would not again broach immigration before the government is reopened.“We do have a broken immigration system that needs to be fixed in a sustainable and bipartisan way,” Mr. Jeffries said. “However, it’s impossible to have a mature conversation about comprehensive immigration reform in the midst of a reckless Trump shutdown sparked by his desire to build a medieval border wall.”Democrats have not forgotten that a year ago, when they talked to Mr. Trump about DACA, he promised to work with them on a “bill of love,” only to back away, prompting Mr. Schumer to declare that negotiating with Mr. Trump was like “negotiating with Jell-O.”Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, said the challenge lies with the Republican majority in the Senate.“If you want to get a bipartisan immigration bill in the coming months, you’re going to have to have Republican senators willing to work across the aisle to get things done,” Mr. Van Hollen said. “I don’t think they can give President Trump the pen to write every word of legislation.”At the same time, Democratic leaders will face pressures of their own, from a freshman class packed with first- and second-generation immigrants, Latinos and immigrant advocates. House Democratic leaders and their staffs have indicated to immigration advocates that they plan to act on legislation to protect immigrants who face an imminent threat of deportation after the shutdown is over. That proposal would grant permanent residence to DACA recipients and to others who came under Temporary Protected Status, which Mr. Trump has also moved to rescind.“What we want in 2019 is early action on a bill that combines a permanent solution for Dreamers and for T.P.S. holders,” said Frank Sharry, the executive director of America’s Voice, an immigrant advocacy group.Democrats have already begun strategizing privately around such a bill, which would most likely pass the House with little to no Republican support. But Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, has shown little appetite for politically tricky measures that divide Republicans or put them at odds with Mr. Trump — particularly on immigration.The issue could expose fissures among Democrats as well. Liberals are agitating for measures such as abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency that carries out deportations, or killing funding for immigration detention beds and enforcement agents.But Democratic congressional leaders and many rank-and-file members, including freshmen elected in districts carried in 2016 by Mr. Trump, say they are all for border security and enforcement, as long as it is effective and reasonable.Broader immigration legislation “would be nice, if we had a reliable person at the other side of the table to negotiate with,” said Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia. “I wouldn’t be so bold as to predict a magic bullet.”"
275,"Ever since Donald Trump’s upset victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016, much of the media attention has been on how Democrats need to reconsider their strategy for winning voters in future elections, particularly Obama-to-Trump voters. But the results of the 2018 midterm elections suggest that Republicans have some soul-searching to do as well.They lost the popular vote in six of the last seven presidential elections and suffered battering losses in the House in 2018. Republican strategists must grapple with how to keep their party viable nationally, and our data suggests that Trumpism may continue to hurt them in the future.It has flown under the radar a bit, masked perhaps by the switch of millions of Barack Obama’s voters into Mr. Trump’s column, but in 2016 Mr. Trump did not receive support from a large segment of voters who pulled the lever for Mitt Romney in 2012. In fact, our data shows that 5 percent of Romney 2012 voters stayed home in 2016, while another 5 percent voted for Mrs. Clinton. These voters tended to be female, nonwhite, younger and more highly educated — the very voters Republicans feared would be alienated by a Trump victory when he was seeking the party’s nomination.Most strikingly, one-third of 2012 Romney voters who were under 40 in 2016 did not vote for Mr. Trump, but rather stayed home, voted for Mrs. Clinton or voted for a third-party candidate. Among the under-40 Romney voters who supported Mr. Trump in 2016, 16 percent appear to have defected from the party to vote for a Democratic House candidate in 2018. Of course, we don’t know how they will vote in 2020, but what this means is that in the past two elections Republicans may have lost more than 40 percent of Romney voters born after 1976.Republican House candidates performed worse among 18- to 39-year-olds than they have in decades. The voters Mr. Trump and his party lost in 2016 and 2018 represent the future of American politics. If the Republican Party becomes the party of the past — that is, of aging white men with less education — it could make winning elections increasingly difficult.To explore the characteristics and attitudes of these voters, we used data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a large survey with a sample of more than 64,000 adults. We focus on three groups in this essay: Romney-to-Trump voters, Romney-to-Clinton voters and Romney-to-nonvoters. (We used validated voter turnout data rather than self-reported turnout, which tends to overstate actual voter participation.) Four primary characteristics distinguished deserters from the 2012 Romney coalition: gender, race, level of education and age.Defectors were disproportionately women; 63 percent of Romney-to-Clinton voters were female compared with 46 percent of Romney-to-Trump voters. Romney-to-nonvoters were 54 percent female.Perhaps unsurprisingly, given Mr. Trump’s rhetoric, Mr. Trump shed a large share of 2012 Romney voters of color — precisely the type of voters that Republicans have been struggling to attract for some time. Among Romney-to-Trump voters, 91 percent were white (the breakdown for Romney-to-nonvoters was very similar, with 89 percent white). However, among Romney-to-Clinton voters, the nonwhite share was twice as large, 20 percent.Mr. Trump also lost support from Romney-supporting college-educated voters. While only one in four Romney-to-Trump voters had a college degree, 39 percent of Romney-to-Clinton voters did, and 31 percent of Romney-to-nonvoters were college-educated.Crucially, the Trump campaign alienated a lot of younger-to-middle-aged voters who had turned out for Mr. Romney in 2012. Four percent of Romney-to-Trump voters were under 30 years old in 2016. In contrast, 18 percent of Romney-to-Clinton voters were under 30, as were 21 percent of Romney-to-nonvoters. Each of these patterns should raise red flags for Republicans, even more so after 18- to 29-year-olds went from supporting Mrs. Clinton by a 25-point margin in 2016 to supporting House Democrats by a 44-point margin in 2018, according to the voter file firm Catalist. But it is the graying of the Republican coalition that is arguably the biggest threat to the party’s prospects. It is true that on average, older people are more reliable voters than younger people. But the partisan identities and voting behaviors that people adopt early in the life cycle tend to stick, becoming routines that people carry on for the remainder of their lives. In addition, according to Data for Progress research, 30 percent of millennial Republicans prefer the Republican Party over Mr. Trump “somewhat” or “strongly,” while 65 percent prefer Mr. Trump “somewhat” or “strongly” (compared with 80 percent of boomer Republicans and 81 percent of so-called silent Republicans).Can Republicans solve their demographic problem? A look at issue preferences indicates wooing back defectors will be difficult. On crucial issues facing the country, Romney-to-Clinton voters, Romney-to-nonvoters and Americans over all hold positions that are relatively far from Romney-to-Trump voters.Take two issues that have become central to Mr. Trump’s presidency: immigration and trade. Seventy-four percent of Romney-to-Trump voters support deporting undocumented immigrants, but only 35 percent of Romney-to-Clinton voters (and 62 percent of Romney-to-nonvoters) do. The average citizen is in between Romney-to-Clinton voters and Romney-to-nonvoters, with 44 percent supporting deportation.Similarly, while 27 percent of Romney-to-Trump voters supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, 63 percent of Romney-to-Clinton voters (and 53 percent of Romney-to-nonvoters) did. In short, the 2012 Romney voters who did not vote for Mr. Trump have views that are pretty distant from the emerging Republican consensus that drove Mr. Trump’s victory and has been a central component of his presidency.Mr. Trump may have won the White House with a thin margin built on winning over just enough Obama voters in the right places. But this victory may ultimately have come at the expense of the Republican Party’s long-term electoral prospects. To win some of the Romney coalition back, Republicans would need to moderate their stances on some key issues, like immigration and trade, and, of course, exactly the opposite is happening. Republican strategists will continue to work to expand on Mr. Trump’s success, but their task will get harder and harder if Mr. Trump continues to move the party away from public opinion. "
276,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to decide whether the Trump administration may add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census questionnaire that will be sent to every household in the nation.The court’s move added a highly charged and consequential blockbuster to what had been a fairly sleepy term. The justices have mostly avoided controversy while they adjusted to the new conservative majority created by the arrival in the fall of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.The federal government has long gathered information about citizenship, but since 1950, it has not included a question on it in the forms sent once a decade to each household. Last month, a federal trial judge blocked the Commerce Department from adding the question, saying that the process that led to the decision was deeply flawed.The Supreme Court stepped in before any appeals court had ruled on the matter, and it put the case on an unusually fast track. The Supreme Court’s speed was almost certainly a result of a looming deadline — the census forms are set to be printed in June.Without immediate action from the court, the solicitor general, Noel J. Francisco, told the justices, “the government will be disabled for a decade from obtaining citizenship data through an enumeration of the entire population.”The Supreme Court scheduled arguments for late April, and it is expected to rule before the end of June.The case — United States Department of Commerce v. New York, No. 18-966 — is the latest test of the scope of executive power in the Trump era. Last year, the justices upheld President Trump’s authority to restrict travel from several predominantly Muslim countries. More recently, the court rejected the administration’s request to reinstate a ban on asylum claims by immigrants who cross the southern border illegally.On Friday, Mr. Trump said he expected his declaration of a national emergency to build a border wall to be challenged in court. He predicted that the administration would lose in the lower courts but prevail in the Supreme Court.The census case has its roots in the text of the Constitution, which requires an “actual enumeration” every 10 years, with the House of Representatives to be apportioned based on “the whole number of persons in each state.”“By its terms, therefore, the Constitution mandates that every 10 years the federal government endeavor to count every single person residing in the United States, whether citizen or noncitizen, whether living here with legal status or without,” Judge Jesse M. Furman of the Federal District Court in Manhattan wrote last month in his decision, setting out the consensus view.Critics say that adding the question on citizenship would undermine the accuracy of the census because both legal and unauthorized immigrants might refuse to fill out the forms. By one government estimate, about 6.5 million people might decide not to participate.That could reduce Democratic representation when congressional districts are drawn in 2021 and affect the distribution of hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending. Judge Furman found that were the question added, Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas would risk losing seats in the House and that several states could lose federal money.Dale Ho, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged the addition of the citizenship question, said that it “would cause incalculable damage to our democracy.”“The evidence presented at trial exposed this was the Trump administration’s plan from the get-go,” Mr. Ho said.Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, has said that he ordered the question to be added in response to a December 2017 request from the Justice Department, which said that data about citizenship would help it enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965.In a detailed decision after an eight-day trial, Judge Furman concluded that Mr. Ross had dissembled, saying that “the evidence is clear that Secretary Ross’s rationale was pretextual.”“While the court is unable to determine — based on the existing record, at least — what Secretary Ross’s real reasons for adding the citizenship question were, it does find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that promoting enforcement of the” Voting Rights Act, or V.R.A., “was not his real reason for the decision,” Judge Furman wrote. “Instead, the court finds that the V.R.A. was a post hoc rationale for a decision that the secretary had already made for other reasons.”Judge Furman had called for Mr. Ross to be questioned under oath, but the Supreme Court blocked that order in October. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, said the court should have gone further, shutting down all pretrial fact-gathering in the census case. Justice Gorsuch added that there was no indication of bad faith in Mr. Ross’s conduct.“There’s nothing unusual about a new cabinet secretary coming to office inclined to favor a different policy direction, soliciting support from other agencies to bolster his views, disagreeing with staff or cutting through red tape,” Justice Gorsuch wrote at the time. “Of course, some people may disagree with the policy and process. But until now, at least, this much has never been thought enough to justify a claim of bad faith and launch an inquisition into a cabinet secretary’s motives.”In November, the Supreme Court rejected a request from the Trump administration to halt the trial, over the dissents of Justices Thomas, Gorsuch and Samuel A. Alito Jr.In his ruling last month, Judge Furman relied on evidence in the so-called administrative record, meaning the materials the government said Mr. Ross had considered before making his decision.Evidence presented at the trial showed that Mr. Ross had wanted to add the question long before the request from the Justice Department. The letter from the Justice Department, Judge Furman wrote, was an attempt “to launder their request through another agency — that is, to obtain cover for a decision that they had already made.”Documents disclosed in the case showed that Mr. Ross had discussed the citizenship issue early in his tenure with Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist and an architect of the Trump administration’s tough policies against immigrants, and that Mr. Ross had met at Mr. Bannon’s direction with Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state and a vehement opponent of unlawful immigration.“In a startling number of ways,” Judge Furman wrote, “Secretary Ross’s explanations for his decision were unsupported by, or even counter to, the evidence before the agency.”Judge Furman ruled that the administration had violated federal statutes. But he rejected a constitutional challenge based on equal protection principles, saying that there was not enough evidence in the record to conclude that Mr. Ross had intended to discriminate against minorities and unauthorized immigrants.The lawsuit challenging the addition of the question was filed by New York, other states, localities and advocacy groups. They said that asking the question was a calculated effort by the administration to discriminate against immigrants.“Adding a question about citizenship to the census would incite widespread fear in immigrant communities and greatly impair the accuracy of population counts,” Letitia James, New York’s attorney general, said on Friday after the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.In urging the Supreme Court to review Judge Furman’s decision, Mr. Francisco, representing the Trump administration, wrote that Mr. Ross had wide discretion over the census that could not be second-guessed by courts. He added that questions about citizenship have often been asked of at least a sample of the population in many earlier censuses and are commonplace in ones conducted by other developed democracies."
277,"WASHINGTON — President Trump will declare a national emergency as early as Friday to bypass Congress and build his long-promised wall along the nation’s southwestern border even as he agreed to sign a spending package that does not finance it, White House officials said Thursday.The announcement came just minutes before voting began on the spending measure, which then cleared both houses, ending a two-month war of attrition that closed much of the federal government for 35 days and threatened a second shutdown on Friday. The Senate passed it 83 to 16, and the House followed later in the evening, 300 to 128.But if he declares a national emergency to access billions of dollars for his wall, Mr. Trump could instigate a constitutional clash over who controls the federal purse and test the bounds of presidential authority in a time of divided government. Democrats and some Republicans instantly condemned the move, with some vowing to challenge it through legislation and lawsuits.[Trump will declare a national emergency. What happens next?]The president’s plan would combine money included in the spending package for fencing along the border with funds that he can divert from other programs using traditional presidential discretion on top of still other money he would tap by declaring an emergency.Altogether, an administration official said, Mr. Trump would be able to dedicate about $8 billion for barriers, more than the $5.7 billion that Congress refused to give him.“President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action — including a national emergency — to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border,” said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. “The president is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border and secure our great country.”Mr. Trump’s announcement capped hours of last-minute drama as he came under pressure on Thursday morning to not sign the spending legislation from conservative figures like Laura Ingraham, who denounced it on Twitter as a “monstrosity” and a “Total SCAM!”A balky president was concerned that signing the measure could impose restraints on his ability to tap other funds and was urged by his chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to tell Republican leaders to instead pass a short-term bill to keep the government open while reopening negotiations, according to a Republican briefed on the situation.Such a move would have unraveled the delicate bipartisan balance favored by Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, who wanted to move beyond the wall fight. In a telephone conversation on Thursday, Mr. Trump asked Mr. McConnell whether the spending measure included any hidden provisions or “land mines,” and the senator reassured him it did not, according to a person familiar with the call.Similarly, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, and White House lawyers told him that he could still move money around, and Ms. Nielsen said that the spending package was actually better than a short-term measure. Mr. McConnell argued that it was a win over Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Ultimately, Mr. Trump was persuaded to sign the bipartisan spending measure after all, and at least some close to the president doubted that he was ever really wavering and instead was just enjoying the suspense.But Mr. McConnell chose not to take a chance, rushing to the floor and interrupting a colleague’s speech to announce Mr. Trump’s decision, in effect locking it in before he could change his mind.In agreeing to end the spending fight for now, however, Mr. Trump essentially started a new one with his vow to declare a national emergency, one that crosses party and ideological lines as liberals and conservatives alike objected to what they called presidential overreach.Seven Senate Democrats, including four announced or possible presidential candidates, immediately introduced legislation intended to block Mr. Trump from diverting money from disaster relief for the wall. Some House Democrats, including Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, began endorsing a joint resolution to essentially nullify a national emergency declaration.A parade of liberal advocacy organizations sent out pre-written statements promising to challenge any such declaration in court as “an outrageous abuse of power” by an “unstable and increasingly autocratic” president, as one of the groups, Public Citizen, put it.“The president is doing an end run around Congress,” Ms. Pelosi told reporters. She suggested that Mr. Trump was setting a precedent for future Democratic presidents to act on issues like gun control — precisely the scenario that scares Republicans.“You want to talk about a national emergency, let’s talk about today,” Ms. Pelosi said, reminding Mr. Trump that it was the anniversary of the shooting massacre last February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Seventeen students and staff members were killed. “That’s a national emergency. Why don’t you declare that emergency, Mr. President? I wish you would.”Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, echoed her criticism and said Congress would defend its prerogatives. “The public was more opposed to the emergency declaration than they were to the wall,” he said in a brief interview. “And they were opposed to the wall.”About a half-dozen Senate Republicans quickly spoke out against the move, as well. “I don’t think this is a matter that should be declared a national emergency,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. “We as legislators are trying to address the president’s priority. What we’re voting on now is perhaps an imperfect solution, but it’s one we could get consensus on.”Senator Susan Collins of Maine said such a declaration was “of dubious constitutionality,” while Senator Marco Rubio of Florida called it “a bad idea.” Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said, “We have a government that has a Constitution that has a division of power, and revenue raising and spending power was given to Congress.”Still, other Republicans backed Mr. Trump, including an ally, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, who faces re-election next year. “He feels that declaring a national emergency gives him that flexibility that he wants and needs, so I’m supportive of that,” Ms. Capito said of the president.“For goodness’ sake, we tried for 35 days in December and January, right, to get the Democrats to do what everyone knows needs to happen except Democrats,” said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio. “I support the national emergency declaration 100 percent.”Among the Republicans who privately warned Mr. Trump against an emergency declaration was Mr. McConnell, who expects that House Democrats will pass a resolution terminating it in a form that the Republican leader cannot block from a floor vote. At least five or six Republican senators are likely to vote against the president, making a majority along with the Democrats, and potentially forcing Mr. Trump to veto it.[Read the first edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up for it here.]A person familiar with the discussions said that Mr. McConnell said that he has warned Mr. Trump that he has less than two weeks to try to persuade wavering Republicans to support his national emergency effort, otherwise he will face the prospect of a bipartisan rebuke by Congress.The spending legislation that passed on Thursday drew strong bipartisan votes in a Congress that has been deeply divided along party lines. In the House, 213 Democrats and 87 Republicans voted yes, meaning that Democrats were unable to pass it by themselves because they lost 19 of their own. Most Republicans, 109 in all, voted no.Ms. Pelosi, using nearly a dozen pens to sign the final bill, applauded the bipartisan majority, calling it “quite a remarkable show.”In the Senate, most of the 16 no votes were by Republicans, along with four Democratic presidential candidates — Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.The package includes the seven remaining bills to keep the remainder of the government open through the rest of the fiscal year at the end of September. House and Senate negotiators unveiled the 1,159-page bill on Wednesday just before midnight, leaving little time for lawmakers to actually digest its contents.The border security compromise tucked into the bill is perhaps the most stinging legislative defeat of Mr. Trump’s presidency. It provides money for 55 miles of steel-post fencing, essentially the same deal that Mr. Trump rejected in December.The measure prohibits construction in certain areas along the Rio Grande Valley and includes a provision, pushed by Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas, granting communities on the border time to weigh in on the location and design of the fencing.The bill also prohibits funds from being used to keep lawmakers from visiting and inspecting Department of Homeland Security detention centers, following a number of highly publicized instances where Democratic lawmakers tried to visit detention centers and were turned away.Lawmakers were drawn by the other six parts of the spending package that finance a number of agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service, which is in the middle of tax-filing season, and the Commerce Department. Allocations include $77 million to address the opioid epidemic, as well as money for natural disasters, including nearly $4 billion to wild-land fire programs and $12.6 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster relief fund.The package also negates an executive order that Mr. Trump signed to freeze pay for federal civilian workers, and instead extends a 1.9 percent pay increase. Vice President Mike Pence, cabinet officials and other high-level political appointees will receive raises of about $10,000 a year that had been frozen during the shutdown.Negotiators failed to resolve other matters, including back pay for federal contractors caught in the middle of the shutdown and an extension of the Violence Against Women Act, which expires Friday — although grants under the act are funded in the spending bill.Mr. Trump’s aides have told him he can add to the $1.375 billion by reallocating money from other related programs using his traditional discretion but a national emergency would allow him to access even more money. Exactly how that would work was still being debated; there were multiple drafts of the emergency order circulating within the government this week.A Defense Department official said one likely scenario would be to divert up to $2.5 billion in counternarcotics funds to the Army Corps of Engineers. The administration would then transfer existing federal land along the border to the Defense Department and acquire or condemn private land.The Army Corps could then go ahead and build a wall or other barrier to secure the Defense Department’s property using the newly diverted funds. Dozens of miles of barrier could be built this way, according to the official, who asked not to be identified discussing alternatives before the White House was ready to disclose a specific plan.Legal experts have said Mr. Trump can muster serious arguments that he can declare a national emergency under current law, but it would almost surely prompt a court challenge from critics arguing that he is usurping two centuries of congressional control over spending.Under Article I of the Constitution, Congress has the power to appropriate funds. “No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law,” it says.But Congress has passed laws in the past providing presidents with authority in national emergencies, laws that remain on the books. Indeed, 31 national emergencies declared by Mr. Trump and his predecessors remain active.Legal challenges could ultimately lead to a confrontation at the Supreme Court. The court is led by a five-member conservative majority, but it has shown skepticism of presidential excesses in recent years, reining in both President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama when the justices concluded they had overstepped their authority."
278,"WASHINGTON — President Trump declared a national emergency on the border with Mexico on Friday in order to access billions of dollars that Congress refused to give him to build a wall there, transforming a highly charged policy dispute into a confrontation over the separation of powers outlined in the Constitution.Trying to regain momentum after losing a grinding two-month battle with lawmakers over funding the wall, Mr. Trump asserted that the flow of drugs, criminals and illegal immigrants from Mexico constituted a profound threat to national security that justified unilateral action.“We’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and we’re going to do it one way or the other,” he said in a televised statement in the Rose Garden barely 13 hours after Congress passed a spending measure without the money he had sought. “It’s an invasion,” he added. “We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country.”But with illegal border crossings already down and critics accusing him of manufacturing a crisis, he may have undercut his own argument that the border situation was so urgent that it required emergency action. “I didn’t need to do this, but I’d rather do it much faster,” he said. “I just want to get it done faster, that’s all.”The president’s decision incited instant condemnation from Democrats, who called it an unconstitutional abuse of his authority and vowed to try to overturn it with the support of Republicans who also objected to the move.“This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a joint statement.Mr. Trump’s announcement came during a freewheeling, 50-minute appearance in which he ping-ponged from topic to topic, touching on the economy, China trade talks and his coming summit meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. The president again suggested that he should win the Nobel Peace Prize, and he reviewed which conservative commentators had been supportive of him, while dismissing Ann Coulter, who has not.Sounding alternately defensive and aggrieved, Mr. Trump explained his failure to secure wall funding during his first two years in office when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress by saying, “I was a little new to the job.” He blamed “certain people, a particular one, for not having pushed this faster,” a clear reference to former Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, a Republican.Mr. Trump’s assertions were replete with misinformation and, when challenged by reporters, he refused to accept statistics produced by his own government that conflicted with his narrative.“The numbers that you gave are wrong,” he told one reporter. “It’s a fake question.”On point after point, the president insisted that he would be proved correct. “People said, ‘Trump is crazy,’” he said at one point, discussing his outreach to Mr. Kim. “And you know what it ended up being? A very good relationship.”[President Trump declared a national emergency. What happens now?]Mr. Trump acknowledged that his declaration of a national emergency would be litigated in the courts and even predicted a rough road for his side. “Look, I expect to be sued,” he said, launching into a mocking riff about how he anticipated lower court rulings against him. “And we’ll win in the Supreme Court,” he predicted.Indeed, Public Citizen, an advocacy group, filed suit by the end of the day on behalf of three Texas landowners whose property might be taken for a barrier. California and New York likewise announced that they will sue over what Gov. Gavin Newsom of California called the president’s “vanity project,” and a roster of other groups lined up to do the same. “Fortunately, Donald Trump is not the last word,” said Mr. Newsom, a Democrat. “The courts will be the last word.”Among those predicting a flurry of judicial decisions against Mr. Trump was George T. Conway III, a conservative lawyer and the husband of Kellyanne Conway, the president’s counselor. “If he knows he is going to lose,” Mr. Conway, a vocal critic of Mr. Trump, wrote on Twitter, “then he knows he is violating the Constitution and laws he has sworn to uphold.”The House Judiciary Committee announced Friday that it would investigate the president’s emergency claim, while House Democrats plan to introduce legislation to block it. That measure could pass both houses of Congress if it wins the votes of the half-dozen Republican senators who have criticized the declaration, forcing Mr. Trump to issue the first veto of his presidency.The emergency declaration, according to White House officials, enables the president to divert $3.6 billion from military construction projects to the wall. Mr. Trump will also use more traditional presidential discretion to tap $2.5 billion from counternarcotics programs and $600 million from a Treasury Department asset forfeiture fund.Combined with $1.375 billion authorized for fencing in the spending package passed on Thursday night, Mr. Trump would have about $8 billion in all for barriers, significantly more than the $5.7 billion he unsuccessfully demanded from Congress.The president opted not to tap hurricane relief money from Texas or Puerto Rico, an idea that had generated angry complaints from Republicans. But he expressed no concern that diverting military construction money would delay projects benefiting the troops like base housing, schools and gyms. “It didn’t sound too important to me,” he said.Neither the White House nor the Pentagon had yet identified which projects may be shelved as a result, but Pentagon lawyers and other officials planned to work over the weekend to identify which construction funds would be diverted.The declaration also provided that land may be transferred to the Defense Department from other federal agencies or from privately purchased or condemned land. The next step would be to secure those lands, where the Pentagon would erect barriers. The declaration gives Patrick Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, broad latitude to carry out this process.Most Americans oppose Mr. Trump’s emergency declaration, according to polls. One released this week by Fox News found 56 percent against it, including 20 percent of Republicans.Mr. Trump’s desire for approval by Fox and other conservative news outlets was on display when he identified various pundits as supporters, naming Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Tucker Carlson and Rush Limbaugh, although he insisted that “they don’t decide policy.”But Ms. Coulter, who has viscerally attacked Mr. Trump for caving on the wall, has clearly gotten under his skin. “I don’t know her,” he said before quickly correcting himself. “I hardly know her. I haven’t spoken to her in way over a year.” He noted, though, that she was an early predictor of his election victory. “So I like her, but she’s off the reservation,” he said. “But anybody that knows her understands that.”Ms. Coulter fired back shortly afterward. “The only national emergency is that our president is an idiot,” she said on KABC radio in Los Angeles.White House officials rejected criticism from across the ideological spectrum that Mr. Trump was creating a precedent that future presidents could use to ignore the will of Congress. Republicans have expressed concern that a Democratic commander in chief could cite Mr. Trump’s move to declare a national emergency over gun violence or climate change without legislation from Congress.“It actually creates zero precedent,” Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, told reporters. “This is authority given to the president in law already. It’s not as if he just didn’t get what he wanted so he’s waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money.”Presidents have declared national emergencies under a 1970s-era law about five dozen times, and 31 of those prior emergencies remain active. But most of them dealt with foreign crises and involved freezing property, blocking trade or exports or taking other actions against national adversaries, not redirecting money without explicit congressional authorization.White House officials cited only two times that such emergency declarations were used by presidents to spend money without legislative approval — once by President George Bush in 1990 during the run-up to the Persian Gulf war, and again by his son, President George W. Bush, in 2001 after the terrorist attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.In both of those cases, the presidents were responding to new events — the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and Al Qaeda’s assault on the United States — and were moving military funds around for a military purposes. Neither was taking action specifically rejected by Congress.In Mr. Trump’s case, he is defining a longstanding problem at the border as an emergency even though border apprehensions have actually fallen in recent years, to 400,000 in the last fiscal year from a peak of 1.6 million in the 2000 fiscal year. And unlike either of the Bushes, he is taking action after failing to persuade lawmakers to go along with his plans through the regular appropriations process.[Read the first edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up for it here.]The spending package passed Thursday by Congress included none of the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump demanded for 234 miles of steel wall. Instead, it provided $1.375 billion for about 55 miles of fencing. Mr. Trump signed the package into law on Friday anyway to avoid a second government shutdown after the impasse over border wall funding closed the doors of many federal agencies for 35 days and left 800,000 workers without pay.For weeks, Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky urged Mr. Trump not to declare a national emergency, but the president opted to go ahead anyway to find a way out of the political corner he had put himself in with the failed effort to force Congress to finance the wall.Mr. McConnell privately told the president that he would support the move despite his own reservations, but warned Mr. Trump that he had about two weeks to win over critical Republicans to avoid having Congress vote to reject the declaration.Mr. Trump was among those Republicans who criticized President Barack Obama for using his executive authority to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation after failing to persuade Congress to do so. “Repubs must not allow Pres Obama to subvert the Constitution of the US for his own benefit & because he is unable to negotiate w/ Congress,” Mr. Trump tweeted in 2014.But Mr. Trump sought to drive home the personal toll of illegal immigration, inviting to the Rose Garden several relatives of Americans killed by people in the country without authorization. Some of the relatives, known as “angel moms,” stood up holding pictures of loved ones who had died.“Matthew’s death was preventable and should have been prevented,” one of the women, Maureen Maloney, said in an interview after the event. Her son Matthew Denice, 23, was killed in 2011 in a motorcycle accident in Massachusetts after colliding with an automobile driven by an undocumented immigrant. “He should have never been here in the first place,” she said. “If he wasn’t here, it wouldn’t have happened.”"
279,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]HOMER, N.Y. — The fears weigh on Mike McMahon: If one of his undocumented workers gets a traffic ticket, it could prompt an immigration audit of his entire farm. If another gets detained by immigration agents at a roadside checkpoint or in a supermarket parking lot, the rest may flee. And if his undocumented work force disappears overnight, there is no one to replace them.“It keeps me up at night,” said Mr. McMahon, who owns a dairy farm south of Syracuse. “There are people out there who just say, ‘Send them all back and build a wall.’ But they would be facing empty shelves in the grocery store if that were to happen.”It has long been an open secret in upstate New York that the dairy industry has been able to survive only by relying on undocumented immigrants for its work force. Now, this region has become a national focal point in the debate over President Trump’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants and their role in agriculture.The tensions have escalated to such a degree over the last year that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo described federal agents as reckless, accusing Immigration and Customs Enforcement of violating the rights of farmers in pursuing undocumented immigrants.Mr. Cuomo was responding to a high-profile raid on a dairy farm, during which a farmer was briefly handcuffed after protesting that ICE agents were mistreating one of his workers. The farmer claimed ICE did not have a warrant to enter his farm.Mr. Cuomo is a Democrat, but Republicans who represent upstate New York in Congress have also come to the defense of the farmers.The pressures here reflect broader challenges facing farmers across the country who rely on undocumented workers. The farmers are struggling with a shrinking labor pool as fewer migrants cross illegally into the country and migrants who are long-term residents become too old for field work.This year the labor shortage has been compounded by Mr. Trump’s trade war and extreme weather, forcing some small farmers to switch to higher-value crops, to reduce their acreage and to consider selling their farms.If anything, the situation in upstate New York is more difficult.Smaller dairy farmers here have been some of the hardest hit by tougher immigration enforcement because their workers are subject to scrutiny from both ICE and the border patrol, which is allowed to operate within 100 miles of the border — in this case, with Canada.Agriculture contributes an estimated $37 billion to New York’s economy and is responsible for nearly 200,000 jobs.“We are seeing that the immigration enforcement is having a tremendous enforcement impact on farm workers, on farms,” said Mary Jo Dudley, director of the Cornell Farmworker Program. “For many farmers, there’s no alternative labor force.”To search private property like a farm, ICE needs a warrant that shows reason to believe a particular undocumented immigrant is living or working there. But if undocumented workers leave the farm to go to a grocery store, they can be approached by ICE agents in a parking lot or a roadside checkpoint, detained and deported.[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]Advocates for undocumented immigrants said ICE agents target immigrants indiscriminately in these public spaces. But ICE disputes those claims.“ICE continues to focus its limited resources first and foremost on those who pose the greatest threat to public safety,” said an ICE spokesman, Khaalid Walls. “ICE only conducts targeted immigration enforcement. The agency does not conduct raids or sweeps that target aliens indiscriminately.”Supporters of stricter immigration policies said they were sympathetic to the plight of small farms. But they pointed out that the farms’ reliance on inexpensive, undocumented labor would handicap American agriculture in the long term.They argue that while immigration crackdowns could force farms to consolidate and mechanize and may be hard for individual farmers, it would make the industry more competitive globally.“The more productive policy response would be subsidized loans to invest in machinery for small-scale farmers, rather than revising how we import foreign workers and perpetuating the labor-intensive old-fashioned way of doing business,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director for the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors restricting immigration.Dairy farmers face particular challenges because without American workers, they have no alternative to migrant labor. The government program that brings in legal temporary workers does so only for seasonal workers and dairy farming is a year-round activity.In Washington, lawmakers representing dairy-heavy districts have tried to reform the legal foreign workers program to include year-round dairy workers.But so far, efforts have fallen short. These lawmakers are caught between staunch conservatives who consider any reprieve a form of amnesty and Democrats who want more comprehensive immigration reform, which would also address the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, and immigrants with Temporary Protected Status.“We’ll have detractors on both sides,” said Representative Chris Collins, a Republican in western New York.Still, Mr. Collins said, a solution is urgently required to keep dairy farms afloat while the political impasse over a comprehensive immigration package drags on. “There’s not a single person representing dairy that doesn’t understand it’s a crisis, a true crisis,” he said.He plans to introduce legislation in the coming weeks that would offer temporary employment authorization to year-round farmworkers on dairies as a stopgap measure.Deportations have been a concern for New York’s farmers and farm workers since the early 2000s, when the sudden enforcement of immigration laws led to a rash of immigration enforcement activities on farms across the state. After the Obama administration narrowed the pool of immigrants ICE prioritized for deportation, some sense of security returned to upstate farming communities, which was shattered when Mr. Trump took office.“We had heard things were starting to get bad, some wineries in the area and quite a few in the Finger Lakes started losing workers. It was almost immediately after Trump took office that ICE started snagging people,” said Kelly Raby, a vineyard owner in Lewiston.Last fall, Victor Pacheco, the foreman on Ms. Raby’s family farm for 23 years, was detained by ICE agents and deported to Mexico.Ms. Raby has struggled to find a foreman skilled enough to manage her vineyard, where the grapevines are now dusted in a light coat of snow and in need of winter pruning. This has left her uncertain about the future of their family farm and the president she helped vote into office.“I still agree with Trump in a lot of ways, but I’m more on the fence about him now,” Ms. Raby said. “I don’t want to lose the immigrants who are working here and growing our food.”Over the last 50 years, American farms have relied on two labor forces: migrants who settled in the United States during the migration wave of the 1960s and 1970s; and those who stayed temporarily, illegally crossing the border for each harvest season. But today, permanent migrants who settled are reaching their 60s, fewer and fewer seasonal migrants are coming to the United States, and enforcement operations are driving the few migrants left out of the state.“Today you go to work and you don’t know if you’ll come back home and be with your family again,” said Eladio Beltran, an immigrant from Mexico who works in an apple orchard in Albion. He is currently awaiting deportation proceedings after being pulled over by state troopers and taken into ICE custody.“Being undocumented and living in New York State is not worth it anymore,” he said.For dairy farmers like Mr. McMahon, if even one of his migrant workers leaves, the absence has a drastic effect on his 2,300-acre farm operation. He depends on having enough workers for round-the-clock shifts, seven days a week. They keep this schedule year-round, he said, to ensure his roughly 800 cows are milked three times a day, their calves are fed, and all cows are medically cared for.“What we really want is some kind of method of getting foreign workers legally,” Mr. McMahon said from his farm in Homer, about 30 miles south of Syracuse.Owners of apple orchards and vineyards, who can afford to, have also started turning to the H-2A program, the legal foreign worker program that brings agricultural labor to the United States for temporary work.Critics of the program argue that workers are often exploited by employers and risk deportation if they complain about mistreatment. Farmers complain that it is costly, complicated and laden with bureaucracy.“We didn’t really have a choice but to use to H-2A,” said Mark Nicholson of Red Jacket Orchards, which switched to using the program last year. “When the system works, it answers one of our biggest challenges to staying in business — and that’s having a reliable source of skilled farm labor. But when it doesn’t work, it dooms us to the same risk as before.”If the issue of undocumented farm workers is left unaddressed, there will be an impact across the supply chain. “There will be long-term consequences that not only our farms will deal with, but consumers will have to deal with as well,” said Steve Ammerman, the senior associate director of public policy at the New York Farm Bureau.Without a legal alternative to informal migrant labor, the competition between dairy farms to retain migrant workers is so fierce that farm owners, once notorious for underpaying and mistreating workers, are now improving working conditions and wages to entice employees to stay on their farms, workers said.Victor Cortez is an immigrant who has worked on a dairy farm in western New York for 18 years. A few years ago, farm owners “wouldn’t let us leave the farm,” he said, adding, “They wouldn’t pay us as much as they promised they would.”“But the good thing about it now,” he said, “is that we get paid more and this farmer is good to me.”"
280,"This week, students took on some challenging topics via our writing prompts, including the debate over the border wall, sexual abuse allegations against R. Kelly, and the relationship between the news media and the president.As always, we were impressed with their thoughtfulness, humility and sharp analyses. But what really impressed us was how many students took the time to read and reply to each other’s comments with both disagreement and approval. Most readers offered substantial and civil rebuttals, responses we know are not always easy to give to issues as complicated and emotional as these.Below, we’ve rounded up the best of the comments on two of these topics, along with some more lighthearted teenage musings about dream travel destinations.We’re so happy to welcome new classes from Downers Grove, Ill.; Sarah E. Goode STEM Academy in Chicago; and Tallahassee, Fla. this week — and we want also to give a special shout out to the students at the Julia R. Masterman School in Philadelphia, who wrote excellent comments across all our prompts this week.Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted.__________The government shutdown and debate over a border wall have dominated headlines for the past few weeks. Following President Trump’s prime-time address to the nation on Jan. 8, we asked students what they thought about the standoff between Mr. Trump and Congress and how they hoped it would be resolved.The majority of students took issue with the impasse, but a few defended Mr. Trump’s steadfastness. Others suggested ways the deadlock could be resolved and how the $5.7 billion Mr. Trump wants for the border wall could be better spent. We highlight some of the best-argued and most interesting ideas in our roundup below.Weighing the costs and benefits of a government shutdownIn the midst of the government shutdown, there is a looming humanitarian crisis. However, it is not a scourge of illegal immigrants entering the US and committing unspeakable atrocities, but the roughly 800,000 federal employees who are not reviving paychecks as a consequence of government shutdown. Each day it stretches on, their situation grows more perilous as they are forced to draw from financial savings that should be utilized for retirement or sending their children to college. It is absolutely abhorrent that almost one million people are having their livelihoods put on hold because the president does not want to negotiate.The wall is perhaps the most ridiculous and controversial border control proposition created in the last fifteen years. In its full form, it would cost American taxpayers upwards of 50 billion dollars, and it has no guarantees of effectiveness. There is no denying that the US-Mexico border has an issue with illegal immigrants, but this is no way of solving the issue, a multifaceted, extremely complex problem that has continually defied resolution. A simple wall will not remedy the conundrum faced by both US and Mexican authorities. In summary, the cost for the border wall, in both monetary and humanitarian terms, is far too high to justify its creation. Instead, it would be exponentially more useful to explore alternate, less belligerent methods of border control that can be more universally agreed upon and implemented.— Jake Hession, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, N.C.Robert Frost once wrote, “Good fences makes good neighbors,” so do good walls … The United States government does not need the added work of taking care of all of these illegal immigrants, who sneaked here to flea danger in their country. Not only is it fair to the U.S. government, but it is also unfair to the many people trying to enter the country legally, who have been waiting for years only to have to wait longer because of these illegal immigrants. Many people are making the argument that government workers are not being paid for their work, however, these workers do get backpay as compensation for the money they lost during that time. This one bit of information makes that argument almost completely irrelevant.— Jonah A., Masterman SchoolIn all honesty, I am a supporter of the border wall. However, the recent actions and behavior Mr. Trump has displayed in order to fund the wall is absolutely not justified. A leader is supposed to unify the hoi polloi, not divide us even further, but Mr. Trump has failed to do this. Instead of offering himself to the United States, Mr. Trump has decided to offer the United States for his own desires. This is wrong, and it’s not okay. 800,000 Americans are struggling to survive without a paycheck because of one man’s selfishness. Some of these citizens also have families to feed, many with young children.— G Jap, Masterman School, Philadelphia, Penn.I agree with the president in this matter. I understand that a lot of people are not being paid for their work, but sometimes that just has to happen for the greater good. The border will decrease a lot of illegal immigration, which should be our priority … The government shutdown provided a lot of the fund to build/reinforce the border already, and I’m not saying it’s a good thing, but all of the funds are essential to a safe border. The Democrats have a false sense of security, thinking that we are already protected well enough from illegal immigration. But that is false. Hundreds or even thousands of people cross the border every passing day, and they are not doing anything to stop it … The border needs its funds in order to keep doing its job— David W. the great, the great land of earthGovernment spending and the wallDonald Trump’s prime-time address did not sway my opinion at all. I still believe the wall is unnecessary money to take from America that could be used to help the people in Flint, Michigan or a year’s worth of housing for every homeless person in the US. There are much more urgent and important matters that the president has sidelined to focus on his wall.— Angela Xhori, Julia R. Masterman, PhiladelphiaI believe that yes our border needs protection just not keeping everyone out with a huge wall. What I feel would be more warranted would be background and weapon checks on those coming into the USA to ensure the safety of the country.— Reza Chity-Guevara, Masterman, Philadelphia, Penn.I believe that the wall is a terrible idea. With the money the government would be spending on the wall, 1.4 million people could get health care, double funding for mental health, and double funding for environmental causes. This wall won’t fix anything, it will just prove America avoids their problems and builds barriers. New problems would arise with the wall. For example, people could destroy parts of the wall or dig under it. This is basically throwing money out of the window.— Molly Flaxman, Masterman School, PhiladelphiaWhy isn’t 5 billion dollars being spent in the cities that suffer from a drug epidemic. Why not 5 billion dollars to the homeless, orphanages, hospitals, schools, medicine, and more. Spend the money on what you really need to help this country. What does the wall benefit. Not schools, not research centers, not even care centers … That money can be used to make places for those immigrants who have crucial reasons to be leaving their own home … Spend money on the violence of our cities. Young teens killing each other … spend money on educating the young people who will become our caretakers in the future. If you really want to make america better that’s how you make “america great again”. Not with a wall.— Jenesis Moreno, Masterman, Philadelphia, Penn.Democrats and Republicans need to work togetherI think putting a wall on the border is not going to solve all the problems. I also think as a country, we should put our differences aside and work together. America has a greater destiny and purpose and should be an example for future generations. If we act as we do now, the future leaders will act worse seeing our behavior and political thinking. Even though political views have split the country tremendously over the past 3 years, our main goal is to keep this country the best and running. Now the Republicans and Democrats are wasting every precious second and because of this, many families are suffering and the national parks are slowly getting destroyed.— Eleena John, Masterman, Philly, Penn.Trump is not willing to negotiate, but neither is Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer. They are saying that they do not want the wall under any circumstance. All three of them are resisting each other and the U.S. citizens are paying for it (or not getting payed. Whatever floats your boat). I hope this will end by the Republicans giving in, and the loads of money will be spent on different issues like global warming, while still not letting all the illegal immigrants in.— Arjun Ahya, Masterman School, Philadelphia, Penn.__________Last week, the Times Travel section published its annual “52 Places to Go” piece and announced the travel writer who would travel to and write about all 52 spots. In this Student Opinion question, we asked students which of these destinations they’d most like to visit and whether they would want the job of the 52 Places Traveler.Of the “52 Places to Go in 2019,” students were most excited about visiting the Setouchi Islands in Japan. Other top spots included: Puerto Rico; the Islands of Tahiti; the Ontario Ice Caves; and Panama. They also recommended several places not on the list, including Ghent, Belgium; the Galápagos Islands; Pittsburgh; and the Great Wall of China. Below, they tell us why.Where students want to visit and whyEvery single place in the list provided looked absolutely breathtaking and incredible, and while there were so many choices, I found myself stopping to take a closer look at Aberdeen, in Scotland. While it may not have been as beautiful or exotic as some of the other destinations on the list, I have always found myself to be fascinated with all things Scottish. I love how the Scottish accent flows, and I have always been amazed by the landscapes and “lochs” in Scotland. What made this location appear even more impressive to me was the old fashion trains, which combine two things I love: old fashioned vehicles and overnight train rides!— Lily Chancey, Philadelphia, MastermanIf I could travel to one of the places on the list, I would prefer to go to the Setouchi Islands in Japan. Before I even went through the list, I already had a passion to go to Japan for a trip. I wanted to see Japan’s beautiful nature and try some of their traditional foods. Setouchi Triennale 2019, a major art fair interests me considering it will be held at Teshima and Honjima which are less frequented to create a balance between the nature and the art. There are so many different places to go, some focusing on the natural beauty of Japan like cycling on trails with citrus trees and olive groves. I would love to ride a sea plane with Setouchi Sea Planes to take scenic flights to small and larger islands. The food that I could try on the trip also inticesme considering I could try authentic Japanese food. Japan seems like an ideal place for me to travel and relax to have a fun time in a calm place.— Janey L., Julia R. Masterman, PhiladephiaIn my lifetime, I have visited five of the seven continents. Travelling has always lead me blindly into the most thrilling and unique experiences. I will take any chance I get to pack my bag and experience a new lifestyle, and I am constantly searching for ways to broaden my cultural horizon. There was one destination included in the article that sounded very rare and intriguing: Isla Palenque, Panama. When reading the description, the part that caught my attention was “the resort grows some of its own food, has furniture made from fallen trees and maintains a no-plastics policy, including subbing papaya shoots for straws.” It would be a totally new experience for me to “live off the land”, and get away from all of the sounds overpopulation.— Haven Habrat, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, N.C.My biggest dream is to travel. Having never left the country, I rely on the internet and experiences from friends to tell me about the world outside of the US. Last year I got to know two foreign exchange students that had come to the US for a year and it only fueled my passion for travel. It amazes me how different cultures are and I want to learn about them all.The Tatra Mountains in Slovakia caught my attention. I live in a port city, right by a beach community so it’s always fairly warm. It would be interesting to go to a place that has snow and it’s sweltering hot for 75% of the year. Also there are many outdoor activities that I have never tried before (due to lack of snow) like snowboarding, skiing, snow tubing, etc.— Paige Phillips, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, N.C.I am your average student, stressed from the amount of homework and the constant pressure I’m always under. I will live in my little bubble for most of the year forgetting that there is an entire world out there to explore. After reading the fifty two recommended places I found The Islands of Tahiti to be one of the places I want to explore. I have always wanted to live on the water and be able to experience something that I could not find anywhere. What made it stand out was “Tahiti’s clear, warm waters offer views of more than 1,000 species of marine life.” This would be something you would only receive once in a lifetime and living on the water while seeing more than a thousand species of marine life is something extraordinary.— Talia Porzio, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, N.C.Traveling is one of the best ways to learn. You are exposed to different cultures, as well as encounter the history embedded to the place. One of the proven best ways to learn is to experience what is being taught. Personally, I would love to visit the Setouchi islands in Japan, Thailand, or Danang in Vietnam. My mom was born in Vietnam but was raised in America, a result of being forced to flee during the war. It would be so nice to go and revisit some of the few memories she has as well as enrich my knowledge in the culture.— Hope A, Masterman, PhillyOn being the 52 Places TravelerHaving a job as the 52 place traveler sounds phenomenal because you would get to take a break and visit places that your heart desires. In addition, all you have to do is write about your experiences. Everything is taken care of, and it would just be a extremely long vacation. Although this job sounds great, there are also downfalls. You may have to be away from your family and friends, and that can always make you feel lonely. Though there are downfalls, this job still sounds great. Sometimes you have to sacrifice things in life, so that you can get another.— Sophia, MastermanIt might be fun to go 52 different places, but if you even spend 3 days there, plus a day for flying there, that’s four days. Multiplied by 52 is 208 days - almost 2/3 of the year. I don’t think I would want to spend that much time away from home because there are a lot of aspects of my home that I really enjoy. In conclusion, I probably wouldn’t want to travel somewhere for more than 1.5 months. And only up to 1.5 months if it’s really fun.— Samuel, MastermanI would absolutely love to have a job that travels 52 places, that is like a dream job! You have the opportunity to experience the world and do things others dream to do. The only challenging thing about this job might be leaving your family for long periods of time, however what you gain from traveling the world is absolutely worth it.— Elodie Poussard, MassachusettsI would be absolutely ecstatic about being the 52 Places traveler. That opportunity to connect with people different from you, and learn something new is once in a lifetime. It would be so fun to meet people, visit historic places, eat new foods, and really learn about a new culture. I think the challenging part would be a language barrier, but that would never stop me from enjoying myself. I’m sure I can communicate well enough with hand jesters and google translate.— Bailey Dyer, Florida High School, Tallahassee, Fla.__________In our most popular Picture Prompt of the week, “Tight Rope,” we asked students to study the image above and interpret it in light of current events.They came up with a variety of nuanced explanations, but all seemed immediately to grasp the theme of the Frank Bruni column that inspired our prompt: the relationship between President Trump and the news media. Of the many wonderful comments we got, we chose those that were grounded in the illustration’s visual evidence and drew clear connections to specific events or issues — especially because, having just judged our own Student Editorial Cartoon Contest, we know it is this kind of thinking that results in sophisticated winning work like this.Here is what students came up with:Walking a fine lineI believe that this picture is commenting on the difficult job of our press. In America, the press has to try so hard to stay neutral, not supporting one side over the other… I know that newspapers and magazines have to walk a fine line (or tightrope) when it comes to publishing. It is either exposing the truth or risking large scale retaliation from the readers and people in power.— Sam Doyle, Philly PhillyI think that this image is trying to represent how on edge the news feels today. President Trump has repeatedly said that today’s new is the enemy of the people, and whenever he doesn’t like something on the news he calls it fake news. It shows how careful the reporters have to be. In the image they have to be careful to stay on balance and not fall, but in real life they have to make sure they say the right things so they don’t get President Trump mad. It must feel like walking on eggshells around him … Reporters today have to balance on a tightrope to get to talk to Trump without him calling them fake news or the enemy of the people, and that’s not how things are supposed to be in a Democratic country.— Ami S, Masterman, PhiladelphiaI assume the guy with the tanned face and blonde hair is President Trump so I feel like the picture is showing the dangers of news outlets reporting on President Trump. It’s almost like a “tight rope” that you are crossing when it comes to him and the controversy your news outlet can start. I feel like the people on the other side of the tightrope are news reporters that are passed all the controversy with Trump and some of them may even support him. This may be the reason why he is depicted talking to them, when in other situations he is ignoring the reporters that confront him. This picture shows the other news reporters on the rope who may be in the controversy and their news outlet may be undergoing some type of drama with Trump and have to record him from a distance.— Abdoul Diallo, Julia R. Masterman, PhiladelphiaI believe that this picture prompt represents how difficult it is for reporters and journalist just to talk to President Trump. A reporter’s job is to get information from a person, but when the person is not cooperative then this cold be a rather hard job. We all know that Trump is not easy to interview because he cuts people off and sometimes turns questions around. I can recall he even kicked a journalist out of a news conference for asking a question about a topic Trump was very strict on (Immigration). So when a reporter is trying to ask the President something its like they are walking on a tightrope because you never know how he could possibly lash out.— Jack Dunphy, PhiladelphiaSeeking the truthI think that this image is saying how maybe Donald Trump is keeping the truth away from us. He is making reporters and other people who are trying to figure out what s going on work very hard to get it. I feel this picture saying that he is hiding what he is doing and only a few people who are determined will continue to try to get to it. My opinion on what I think is this messages is why not tell them what is happening you are the president but it is still our lives, your people should know what is going on.— Sierra McKinley, Philadelphia, Penn.In this illustration, Donald Trump is on one side while reporter are trying to get to him on a tightrope. I think the tightrope represents how hard reporters try to figure out what is happening in the Trump presidency. There are so many secrets and things that we don’t know especially in the Trump presidency because of all of the things that have happened during his term and all of the lies he has told. We need to know the truth, and it’s these reporter’s jobs to tell us what’s going on.— Maia Keenan, Masterman, PhiladelphiaWe think this image depicts reporters trying to ask questions and will risk everything to know the truth and reality. The reporter holding the microphone is asking risky questions, especially because all of the other reporters could fall if he asks something that Donald Trump finds offensive. Finally, everyone in the image can only move forward because if they go back everyone falls but Trump is isolated.— Hall MS EL Masters, Corte Madera, Calif.The media circusWhen I look at this picture it reminds me of the media image in America, and how it is so focused on Donald Trump. Since the presidential election all that has been in the news is Donald Trump, has been the on the headline of the news so many times that I can’t even keep track anymore. We have been so focused on what he is doing that we are missing out on all the other stuff that is happening in America like all the mass shooting that are constantly happing in America or the mass population homeless people that we have on our streets. They say that he is digging this country into a deeper hole but what they don’t say is that the media is there with him helping him dig this ever-growing hole.— Niara Hughes, Masterman, Philadelphia, Penn.… The image shows how Donald Trump is trying to get attention, even if people are risking their lives at the same time (for example, the government shutdown). He thinks his wall is more important than the people of America.— Maya Kowal, Masterman School, Philadelphia, Penn."
281,"WASHINGTON — President Trump delivered a message of bipartisan unity on Tuesday night in his first address to Congress in the new era of divided government, but signaled that he would continue to wage war for the hard-line immigration policies that have polarized the capital and the nation.In a nationally televised speech that toggled between conciliation and confrontation, Mr. Trump presented himself as a leader who could work across party lines even as he pressed lawmakers to build a wall along the nation’s southwestern border that leaders of the newly empowered congressional Democrats have adamantly rejected.“We must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution, and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise and the common good,” the president said. “Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future.”Any hopes for a newfound spirit of cooperation, however, seemed elusive as the president and Democrats spent the hours before, during and after the address exchanging partisan political fire, making clear that ritualistic calls for across-the-aisle collaboration were unlikely to transform an environment that has turned increasingly toxic.Republicans jumped to their feet at the president’s calls to curb immigration, limit late-term abortions and ensure that the United States does not turn to socialism, even chanting “U-S-A, U-S-A” a couple of times as if at a Trump campaign rally. “That sounds so good,” he exulted.Speaker Nancy Pelosi, sitting behind Mr. Trump for the first time, and other Democrats largely remained in their seats without applauding and expressed only tepid enthusiasm even for his mention of goals intended to appeal to them, like infrastructure and paid parental leave. Ms. Pelosi maintained a polite, even amused smile on her face for much of the speech.But the evening was filled with political theater as the president introduced World War II veterans, Holocaust survivors, the Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, a 10-year-old cancer survivor, a police officer shot seven times at last fall’s synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh and the teary-eyed relatives of a couple killed by an illegal immigrant, all sitting with the first lady, Melania Trump.The change in the power structure in a Capitol long dominated by men was on display as Ms. Pelosi and scores of House Democratic women wore white, the color of the suffrage movement, reflecting the fact that 131 women were sworn into the new Congress, the most in American history.When Mr. Trump noted this breakthrough, the women leapt to their feet, cheering, dancing and high-fiving each other. “That’s really great,” he said. “Congratulations.”He made no direct mention of the issues that may yet come to dominate the year, such as the Russia investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, or the parallel inquiries that House Democrats intend to conduct into his campaign’s ties with Russia and efforts to impede investigations.Instead, he alluded to them only in passing, but pointedly. “An economic miracle is taking place in the United States,” he said, “and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations.”But Mr. Trump indicated no retreat from his almost singular pursuit of a border wall, directly taking on Ms. Pelosi, who has called it “immoral.” He devoted 15 minutes of the hour-and-22-minute speech to immigration with no concession to Democratic priorities like a path to citizenship for immigrants brought into the country illegally as children.“This is a moral issue,” Mr. Trump said as Ms. Pelosi sat unmoved behind him. “No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration,” he added. “Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.”In the official Democratic response, Stacey Abrams, who lost a close race for governor of Georgia in November, scorned the idea of unity from a president who has practiced the politics of division. “We know bipartisanship could craft a 21st-century immigration plan,” she said, “but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart.”Ms. Abrams, who is African-American, challenged Mr. Trump’s history of racial provocation, saying, “We must hold everyone from the highest offices to our families accountable for racist words and deeds and call racism what it is — wrong.”The president’s speech, built on a theme of “choosing greatness,” came at a pivotal moment halfway through the president’s term as he seeks to regain momentum after the midterm election defeat that handed control of the House to Democrats and after his failed effort to use a partial government shutdown to extract money for the wall.Stung by his retreat on the government shutdown, Mr. Trump has hardly been in the mood for collaboration with the other party. As he and his team drafted his address in recent days, he has groused about the text, complaining that it was too gentle on Democrats, according to people briefed on the matter.The president insisted on sharpening some of the lines in the speech and rebuffed aides, who urged him to congratulate Ms. Pelosi on her ascension to the speakership.During an off-the-record lunch for television anchors on Tuesday before the speech, Mr. Trump offered scathing assessments of a number of leading Democrats, including some lining up to run against him next year.He dismissed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as “dumb,” called Senator Chuck Schumer of New York a “nasty son of a bitch” and mocked Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia, who he said “choked like a dog” at a news conference where Mr. Northam tried to explain a racist yearbook photograph, according to multiple people in the room.Democrats did not wait for the address to pan it. “It seems every year the president wakes up and discovers the desire for unity on the morning of the State of the Union, then the president spends the other 364 days of the year dividing us, and sowing a state of disunion,” Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor. He added, “The blatant hypocrisy of this president calling for unity is that he is one of the chief reasons Americans feel so divided now.”Mr. Trump fired back at Mr. Schumer via Twitter. “I see Schumer is already criticizing my State of the Union speech, even though he hasn’t seen it yet,” the president wrote. “He’s just upset that he didn’t win the Senate, after spending a fortune, like he thought he would. Too bad we weren’t given more credit for the Senate win by the media!”Mr. Trump arrived at this point in his presidency with the approval of just 37 percent of the public, according to Gallup. In the past four decades, the only times a president headed into a State of the Union address with as little or less support were in 1983 when Ronald Reagan was struggling with a painful recession and in 2007 and 2008 when George W. Bush was trying to turn around the Iraq war.Mr. Trump is the only president in the history of Gallup polling to have never drawn the support of a majority of the public at any point in his first two years in office. But while he is the fourth president in a row to lose at least one house of Congress during a midterm election, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both bounced back to win re-election, and Mr. Trump has privately expressed confidence that he will, too.After presidents suffer setbacks in midterms, they often reach out to the victorious opposition with words of conciliation, however artificial or short-lived they may be. In Mr. Trump’s case, he opened this period of partisan power sharing with a relentless confrontation over his proposed border wall, resulting in a record-breaking 35-day partial government shutdown.That impasse nearly cost Mr. Trump his opportunity to deliver his State of the Union address, as Ms. Pelosi refused to let him come to the House chamber as long as federal agencies were closed and workers unpaid. Mr. Trump backed down and accepted a measure reopening the government for three weeks, but negotiations in the interim have made no more progress toward winning money for his wall — and the government could close again on Feb. 15.Given that, Mr. Trump’s calls for unity were almost surely destined to fall on deaf ears. Even Republicans have publicly rebuked him lately for his plans to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan, and party leaders have pressed him not to declare a national emergency bypassing Congress to build the wall.Among those invited by the president to join the first lady during the speech was Joshua Trump, a sixth-grade student from Wilmington, Del., who “has been bullied in school due to his last name,” according to the White House.Democrats were making points with their guests, as well. Among those they invited were air traffic controllers who went unpaid during the government shutdown, illegal immigrants who worked at Mr. Trump’s properties and transgender soldiers who will be banned under the president’s new policy.In addition to Ms. Abrams, other Democrats sought to get in on the action. Senator Kamala Harris of California, who is running for president, delivered her own response shortly before the speech, while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who may also run, delivered his afterward.In his address, Mr. Trump assailed Democrats like Mr. Northam for comments in support of easing restrictions on late-term abortions and called for federal legislation cracking down on such procedures, a nod to Mr. Trump’s conservative base. He made no mention of the racist medical school yearbook picture that has threatened Mr. Northam’s political career, after aides cautioned him about raising that issue.Mr. Trump also sought to frame the opposition Democrats as too extreme, suggesting that the country was in danger of a socialist takeover. “Here in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” he said, as Republican lawmakers booed. “We are born free and we will stay free. Tonight we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.”The president highlighted what he sees as the accomplishments of his first two years in office, including a growing economy, rising energy production, increased military spending, deregulation and tax cuts. He pressed Congress to approve his new trade pact with Canada and Mexico updating the North American Free Trade Agreement.Mr. Trump did not outline the traditional laundry list of new initiatives, the way other presidents have, but he did plan to make a national commitment to end transmission of the virus that causes AIDS, with a goal of stopping its spread in the United States by 2030. He repeated past calls for bipartisan measures to rebuild “America’s crumbling infrastructure,” curb the cost of prescription drugs and approve paid parental leave.The president also talked about his goal of bringing an end to the “endless wars” in places like Syria and Afghanistan, the threat he sees from Iran and his bid to force President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela to step down. He announced that he would meet for the second time with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, in Vietnam on Feb. 27-28 to seek his nuclear disarmament.Mr. Trump ended his address with an uncharacteristic effort at poetry, an ode to America and its common purpose. “I am asking you to choose greatness,” he said. “No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.”"
282,"This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.First, Obamacare marches on: In the latest sign of the law’s success, Maine has become the 36th state to expand Medicaid, thanks to the insistence of the state’s voters.Janet Mills, Maine’s new Democratic governor, implemented the expansion more than a year after voters approved it in a ballot referendum. The previous governor — Paul LePage, a Republican — had refused to honor the referendum’s result. As a result of Mills’s move, more than 500 Mainers gained health insurance, and many more will be covered in coming years.The larger lesson is to avoid despair. Changing laws is hard work, often involving years of frustration. But it really is possible for politics to improve people’s lives. Congratulations to all of the voters, activists, politicians and medical professionals in Maine who kept fighting for this change.[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]Let’s make a dealShould Democrats be willing to bargain on the border wall — say, win big progress on other parts of immigration policy in exchange for wall funding? I asked this question on Twitter yesterday, and the roughly 1,500 responses were split almost evenly between yes and no.I was struck by the even split, because it’s consistent with my own conflicted feelings. There is a real case for bargaining. The wall would not transform this country’s immigration policy, and it’s plausible that President Trump would agree to real concessions — like legal status for the young immigrants known as Dreamers — for wall funding.Yesterday, a group of Republican senators began pushing for a deal broadly along these lines. The editorial boards of The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune and The New York Post all favor such a compromise. It could also protect immigrants from Haiti, Honduras and El Salvador who are fleeing natural disasters and whose protected status Trump has revoked, writes Ali Noorani for CNN. My own view is that Democrats should remain open to a deal, but not put too much hope in it. For one thing, the chances seem slim that Republicans will make big enough concessions, given the hardline immigration positions of top Trump advisers.For another, I worry about the political effect of rewarding Trump’s tactics on the wall. Remember, he canceled a deal to keep the government open that both Republican and Democratic members of Congress agreed to. He did so in large part because Fox News hosts and other conservative pundits began making fun of him. And his case for the border wall is based on a torrent of lies.“To those who say, ‘Trump should give DACA, Pelosi should do the wall,’ we must say a clear, ‘No.’” Reverend William Barber tweeted yesterday, referring to the policy that would make Dreamers legal. “The wall isn’t negotiable b/c it’s based on lies, racism & white nationalism.”The Democrats’ best bet is probably to force Trump to end this mess himself, likely through a legally questionable declaration of emergency. That declaration would be the subject of a legal fight, and it would create some political risks for Trump. He is apparently considering taking money away from disaster relief in Florida and elsewhere, which doesn’t seem like the smartest move given the state’s electoral importance.The shutdown isn’t going well for Trump. Voters mostly blame him, polls show. Republicans in Congress are grumbling. If Democrats are tempted to make a deal, it needs to be a very favorable one.Pop-culture postscript: A reader points out that the wall fight echoes a “House of Cards” plot line. In season 3, the president diverts money from disaster relief to pay for a jobs program that Congress refused to fund. House of cards, indeed."
283,"Bret Stephens: Gail, the word is that Robert Mueller may soon send his report to Attorney General William Barr. Do you expect a bombshell, a dud — or just a lot more confusion, depending on what Barr makes public and what Congress chooses to do with its conclusions?Gail Collins: Well, we’ve already got indicted minions. As to Trump himself, I feel very safe voting for “a lot more confusion.” Just on general principles. The Trump presidential campaign was knee-deep in conflicts of interest, many of them involving Russia. But given the man’s general disorganization, I find it hard to imagine the report picking him out as the sinister, canny leader who was orchestrating everything behind the scenes.Still feeling that the real disaster for Trump is going to come with the investigations into his business practices in New York. How about you?Bret: That’s my guess, too. Trump’s $100 million inauguration committee looks like a giant pay-to-play scheme. I still think his alleged campaign-finance violations in connection to the Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal payoffs are criminal and impeachable. And who knows what else Mueller’s investigation have dredged up about Trump family values.Gail: The family that stays together preys together …Bret: And vice versa. That said, if Mueller finds no clear and credible evidence of collusion or cooperation between the Trump campaign and Russia, it will be a major political victory for the president and a liability for his detractors. Fairly or not, it will call all the other investigations into question, however credible or serious they may be.That’s one of the reasons I’ve been leery of investing too much political capital in wondering what Trump might have done behind people’s backs. It’s what he does every day in plain sight that is much more concerning.Gail: Even if the Mueller investigation fails to produce, we’ll still have a bunch of congressional committees digging up dirt. But I know that’s not as satisfying for a conservative Trump-hater. You’re right that there’s plenty to investigate in his normal day-to-day life. Which horrible things the president has done lately seem most appalling to you?Bret: Well, that list is long. But let me start by praising Trump on a couple of fronts. I think he’s shown moral leadership on Venezuela, by getting much of the world to recognize Juan Guaidó as the legitimate president and drawing attention to the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding under the Maduro regime. And I’m also glad he’s partially reversed course and will keep at least some troops in Syria. I hope he winds up withdrawing none of them so long as they can help protect our Kurdish friends and deter our Syrian, Iranian, Russian and Turkish foes.O.K. Now to the rest. His declaration of a national emergency over border-wall funding is a threat to constitutional government and the separation of powers and sets a precedent that both sides will abuse if the Supreme Court doesn’t stop it.Gail: No disagreement on the national emergency. The fact that you haven’t seen a major uprising of Republicans over that is proof that there’s no real Republican Party anymore, only Trumpism.And I’m looking forward to the next Democratic president declaring that climate change is a national emergency …Bret: His unloading on The New York Times as “a true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE” is an assault on the First Amendment and the safety of journalists, including us. His hankering for a deal — any deal — with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un so that he can win a Nobel Peace Prize is a danger to peace and stability in Asia.Gail: Our publisher really called Trump out on the danger he is creating for journalists. It’s perilous enough reporting from trouble spots around the globe without having the president of the United States cheerleading for the enemies of a free press.Bret: His desire to start another trade war with Europe, this time over cars, is a threat to global growth and another nail in the coffin of trans-Atlantic unity. His nonstop lies and exaggerations and demagoguery about the purported evils of illegal immigration are an insult to our intelligence and devastating to the G.O.P.’s chances of ever again being a majority party.Gail: I love it when you get on a roll like this. Keep going.Bret: And his overall comportment continues to be a foul stain on the office of the presidency, a moral embarrassment to a majority of Americans, and a blot on the record of liberal democracy. How about you?Gail: Well, you’ve kind of run the table. But I’d add his attempts to undermine women’s reproductive rights. The assault on Planned Parenthood isn’t just about abortion, it’s about the far right’s hatred of anything that gives women the power to decide if and when they want to get pregnant. Can’t tell you what a deep irony it is to have this guy leading that crusade.Bret: I’d call it hypocrisy, not irony, but I’m being pedantic.Gail: And everything about guns and domestic violence. Many people have taken note of the fact that the president tweeted out about the Smollett scandal and the suit against The Washington Post by the Kentucky high school student who was involved in that incident with a Native American in Washington. But not a twittery word about the white supremacist Coast Guard officer who has been accused of stockpiling weapons to murder newscasters and liberal politicians. When reporters asked him about it, all Trump could come up with was, “I think it’s a shame.” That’s the kind of thing you say when a politician gets caught cheating on his wife, not when you’re talking about a self-declared white supremacist intent on a politically inspired mass slaughter.Bret: The Smollett and Covington High stories are fascinating in a cultural sense, mostly for what they tell us about our current culture of victimhood and the assumptions too many people, including too many in our profession, make about who is the victim based on current stereotypes. But the case of the Coast Guard officer is genuinely terrifying given that it comes on the heels of the Florida mail bomber, the Pittsburgh mass killer and the California man charged last year with phoning in death threats to journalists. That’s a terrifying reality of the culture war from which most of the right prefers to look away.Gail: Not long before he announced that he was running for president, Trump went to an N.R.A. convention and got a wild, massive reception. Right then I knew he was going to be a huge gun-rights supporter, no matter what he had believed before.When he was running against Hillary Clinton I thought he was terrible, but not nearly as terrible as he turned out to be. Kind of amazing. Did you foresee all of this?Bret: Partly. I wrote more than a dozen columns for The Wall Street Journal during the last presidential campaign, denouncing his bigotry, lawlessness, ignorance and demagoguery. He vindicates my first impression with his every foul tweet. I think he’s debasing our political culture in ways we will be living with, and suffering from, for at least a generation. And he’s becoming a role model of sorts for other populist demagogues around the world, from Brazil to Italy.Gail: Well, I wrote a lot about what a jerk he’d been in New York for the last 30-odd years. I guess I didn’t take him seriously enough because he’d always behaved like such a fool.Bret: On the other hand, the world didn’t end with his presidency. The economy is robust, we haven’t stumbled into a catastrophic war (yet), and democracy is still alive and well considering all the Democrats planning to run against him. That isn’t to say things might not still go horribly wrong, only that the habit of comparing Trump to despots of yore is off the mark and undermines the case against him.Gail: Right. He’s our own special unique despot wannabe.Bret: But can I switch the subject? Last week The Times ran an eye-opening story on Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, basically to the effect that she is a truly horrible boss, with some of the highest staff turnover in the Senate. From a policy standpoint she’s my favorite Democrat in the race, but this is a serious issue for her candidacy. How do you think voters should factor that into their considerations?Gail: I’m playing the wait-and-see card. We’re undoubtedly going to find out unpleasant things about a lot of the candidates as we go along. But that story about her using her comb to eat a salad on an airplane and then giving it to her aide to wash is going to … resonate.Your position is that you’ll vote for whoever the Democrats nominate, even if it’s a modern-day Attila the Hun, right?Bret: Definitely not! Of course I can’t vote for Trump under any circumstance. But I would never vote for Bernie Sanders, who seems to think bread lines are a good thing because they’re egalitarian. I couldn’t vote for Elizabeth Warren, either; she’s too far to my left and her prevarications about her ancestry are morally insulting and intellectually embarrassing. I have personal reservations about Cory Booker, stemming from his deceits as mayor of Newark, and Kamala Harris, stemming from her behavior as a prosecutor. If any of them is the nominee, I will probably write in Bill Weld or John Kasich or Larry Hogan — middle-of-the-road Republicans or former Republicans who know how to win over Democrats and could govern from the center.Gail: Ah, I remember many Republicans who had those sentiments: Trump was appalling and impossible to support, but Hillary Clinton was too far a bridge to cross. And so they voted for people like Gary Johnson, the Libertarian. Which meant they helped put Trump in office.Bret: I voted for Hillary Clinton, even though I had plenty of reservations. But there’s no way I’m going to follow Democrats jumping off the cliff on the left because I’m angry at Republicans for jumping off the cliff on the right.Gail: Really, I have to warn you. If I hear any Trump-hater talking about writing in his mother’s name or the Green Party name or Howard Schultz I immediately decide this is a person who would rather have four more years of Donald Trump than compromise his principles by voting for a deeply imperfect Democrat.Bret: I’m already compromising many of my usual political principles by voting for centrist Democrats, never mind the real lefties. I could vote for Joe Biden, though I doubt he’ll get the nomination, or Senator Michael Bennet from Colorado (our boss’s brother), or any other middle-of-the-road Democrat. That category included Klobuchar, but I have a problem with people who are horrible bosses and don’t have the good sense to use their fingers to eat the way I do.But let’s talk about something our readers really care about: the Oscars. Did you watch? Did your favorites win?Gail: I believe this is the first year ever that I’ve seen all the movies nominated for best picture, and best actress and best actor — and pretty much everything. This is all about avoiding Donald Trump. Since he’s been president I’ve instinctively organized my life around trying to forget about current events for at least a few hours a day. It’s the same reason I’ve been watching football for the first time in my life.But about the winners — I like watching people be genuinely surprised, so I really enjoyed seeing Olivia Colman win for playing the dotty queen in “The Favourite.” How about you?Bret: I saw only a few of the films. But I was thrilled with the win for “Free Solo,” the documentary about climber Alex Honnold that I wrote a column about last year. And I was deeply moved by “Roma.” I grew up in Mexico City, and the movie perfectly captured a world I know very, very well. Nice to see that in this accelerated age of ours there’s still appreciation for a film that takes it slow and goes deep.Gail: And while we’re talking about awards that made me happy — congratulations on winning the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, Bret! I’m so glad your fight for immigrant rights is being recognized. You deserve it. And as a bonus, I can’t think of anything that would irritate Donald Trump more.Bret: Thanks, Gail. Of course I’ll be bringing my mom to the ceremony. This year will be her 69th as an immigrant in this country."
284,"In case you haven’t noticed, long-established political parties across the democratic world are blowing up, with Britain’s Labour Party just the latest to fracture. Could America’s parties be next?Could we have our first four-party election in 2020 — with candidates from the Donald Trump far right, the old G.O.P. center right, the Joe Biden center left and the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez far left all squaring off, as the deepening divides within our two big parties simply can’t be papered over any longer? It’s not impossible.Indeed, two phrases recently in the news that touch on core principles of the Democratic and Republican Parties are like fuses that could ignite much larger explosions in the coming year. Those phrases are: “unwilling to work” and “national emergency.”On Feb. 7, Ocasio-Cortez’s congressional office sent out an F.A.Q. explainer of the Green New Deal that she’s proposing. The initiative aims “to mobilize every aspect of American society … to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and create economic prosperity for all.”I admire that goal and the huge energy she’s brought to it among young people. But one version of her office’s F.A.Q. stated that the Green New Deal would guarantee, among other benefits, “Economic security to all who are unable or unwilling to work.”Economic security for people “unwilling to work”? Who’s going to sign up for new taxes to support people unwilling to work or be retrained?When some commentators called this out, Ocasio-Cortez’s team said the F.A.Q. was an unfinished draft that never should have been released. I don’t buy it. It was also too late. That phrase — economic security even for people “unwilling to work” — was not just noted by conservatives. It rattled some center-left Democrats as well, because it hinted that the party’s base had moved much farther to the left in recent years than they’d realized, and it highlighted the most important fault line in today’s Democratic Party — the line between what I’d call “redivide-the-pie Democrats” and “grow-the-pie Democrats.”Grow-the-pie Democrats — think Mike Bloomberg — celebrate business, capitalism and start-ups that generate the tax base to create the resources for more infrastructure, schools, green spaces and safety nets, so more people have more opportunity and tools to capture a bigger slice of the pie.Grow-the-pie Democrats know that good jobs don’t come from government or grow on trees — they come from risk-takers who start companies. They come from free markets regulated by and cushioned by smart government.The wisest grow-the-pie Democrats have also learned something from the past few years: The benefits of Nafta, open trade with China and the rise of the digital economy — while vital for creating economic growth — don’t just automatically trickle down, any more than G.O.P. tax cuts did. They require trade insurance and surge protectors, free community college, portable health care coverage and pensions, and a very intentional strategy to more equitably spread the benefits of growth among bosses, workers and shareholders.Redivide-the-pie Democrats — think Bernie Sanders — argue that after four decades of stagnant middle-class wages — and bailouts for bankers and billionaires but not workers in 2008 — you can’t grow the pie without redividing it first. Inequality is too great now. There are too many people too far behind.The decision by Amazon to scuttle its big expansion in New York City marks the first big clash this election season between grow-the-pie Democrats, who insisted that tax breaks for Amazon would pay for themselves, and redivide-the-pie Democrats, who saw Amazon as pitting their community in a race to the bottom with other communities over which could lavish more subsides on a tech behemoth that didn’t need them.In truth, the episode was a huge failure of imagination by both sides. Virginia got it right, explained Amy Liu, urban affairs expert at the Brookings Institution, in an essay last week in The Times. Yes, it gave Amazon some $500 million in subsidies, but the state offered twice that amount in new investments in local transportation and schools to create a strong pipeline of technically skilled workers — something that will benefit the entire community for years.As for the G.O.P., it’s divided between a “limited-government-grow-the-pie” right — but one that wants to just let capitalism rip — and a “hoard-the-pie, pull-up-the-drawbridge” Trump-led far right.The limited-government-grow-the-pie faction is itself split between the Never Trumpers — who’ve refused to prostitute themselves to Trump’s serial lying, cozying up to Russia and other madness — and those who’ve hitched a ride on Trump’s wagon to get their tax cuts, conservative judges and deregulation.But Trump’s decision to declare a “national emergency” on the Mexico border has violated the party’s most core principle of limited government. In doing so it’s opened a fissure between the old limited-government-grow-the-pie Republicans and the anti-immigrant hoard-the-pie, pull-up-the-drawbridge Trumpers.The early signs are that the limited-government types — led by Mitch McConnell — are so morally bankrupt, after having sold their souls to Trump for two years, they’ll even abandon this last core principle and go along with Trump’s usurpation of Congress’s power of appropriation.Stay tuned. Over the years our two parties have usually managed to handle deep fractures. This time may be different.The level of outrage in both bases is sky high: Their ability to express that outrage through weaponized social networks, talk radio and cable television is powerful and pervasive, and the three accelerations — in globalization, technology and climate change — we’re going through are stressing everyone and demanding very different political choices.So here’s my hunch: The 2020 U.S. election will be unlike any in my lifetime.Think about it. Ever since World War II until the early 21st century, the major political parties in the West were all built on a set of stable binary choices: capital versus labor; big government/high regulation versus small government/low regulation; open to trade and immigration versus more closed to trade and immigration; embracing of new social norms, like gay rights or abortion, and opposed to them; and green versus growth.Across the industrial world parties mostly formed along one set of those binary choices or the other. But that is no longer possible.What if I am a steelworker in Pittsburgh and in the union, but on weekends I drive for Uber and rent out my kid’s spare bedroom on Airbnb — and shop at Walmart for the cheapest Chinese imports, and what I can’t find there I buy on Amazon through a chatbot that replaced a human? Monday to Friday I’m with labor. Saturday and Sunday I’m with capital.My point? Many of the old binary choices simply do not line up with the challenges to workers, communities and companies in this age of accelerating globalization, technology and climate change, but national governments are so paralyzed by partisanship that they can’t adapt. And most families are too weak to manage these forces and pass along the American dream to their kids.Fortunately, though, all is not lost. Creative adaptation is happening in many of America’s counties, cities and towns, where trust is much higher. The most successful are forging what I call “complex adaptive coalitions,” where business, labor, philanthropists, social entrepreneurs, educators and local government all network together to create jobs, attract businesses, grow housing, fix potholes and improve schools.These coalitions are not focused on splitting the differences between the old right-left binary choices. They’ve actually moved to a totally different grid — one that asks every day on every issue: “What works? Find it and share it, so we can get the best out of these accelerations in technology, globalization and climate change and cushion the worst for the most people in our community.""Oxford economist Eric Beinhocker recently pointed out to me research that says there are only two ways to cure political tribalism: “A common threat or a common project.” We need a common project, and it’s obvious: Build a new foundation for the middle class. Ultimately that requires the local and the national levels to work together. But for now we should be glad that it’s at least happening at the local level.Don Baer, who served as President Clinton’s communications director, has a bumper sticker for anyone who wants to run for president in 2020 on the grid of rebuilding our country through complex adaptive coalitions — but it will take your whole bumper:“Make America work again, for those who are willing to work and for those who are willing to work together.”"
285,"A difficult situation for migrant children in government custody could grow more challenging if the largest provider in the overburdened shelter system were to lose its grants.The provider, Southwest Key Programs, faces mounting pressure after a video of staff members abusing children surfaced last month and the Justice Department opened an investigation into its finances. State and federal officials have cracked down on suspected malfeasance at shelters in the past year, closing multiple facilities, including two run by Southwest Key, and moving children elsewhere.But taking any broader action on Southwest Key, a nonprofit that houses almost a third of detained migrant youth, would be a balancing act for officials as they tried to avoid tipping an overstressed system into chaos. Without adequate shelter space, minors remain stuck at border stations ill-equipped to care for them. After the recent deaths of two children in Border Patrol custody, the stakes have never been clearer.About 12,400 migrant children are now housed across roughly 100 permanent sites and two temporary ones. That’s down from the record level of almost 15,000 last month, largely because the Trump administration relaxed its rule requiring fingerprints for every member of a household sponsoring a child.By any measure, Southwest Key is the industry juggernaut. The Austin-based charity operates 24 permanent facilities in Texas, Arizona and California. One of those is the nation’s largest permanent shelter, a converted Walmart Supercenter in Brownsville, Tex., that can house more than 1,400 minors.Southwest Key, which has pulled in $1.7 billion over the past decade, is being investigated by the Justice Department after a New York Times article documented possible financial improprieties and poor management. The charity stockpiled tens of millions in taxpayer dollars with little government oversight, possibly engaged in self-dealing with top executives and paid them significantly higher than the federal salary cap for migrant shelter grants.But if the federal government revoked its grants, there would not be enough room in the crowded system to absorb the children under its care. Officials would need to find another provider to take over Southwest Key’s shelters, or find new facilities altogether.Maria Cancian, a former deputy assistant secretary for policy in the Administration for Children and Families, said if a large provider had lost its contracts under her watch, she would try to maintain as many of the provider’s staff and facilities as possible.“The logical thing to do to maximize safety and minimize waste of public funds would not be to immediately shut down an enormous number of shelters,” Ms. Cancian said. “The best course of action would be to figure out a plan for transitioning those facilities and transitioning those personnel.”The Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency that oversees migrant shelters as part of the Administration for Children and Families, declined to speculate on Southwest Key’s grants. In response to a question asking if the agency had a plan if the charity were to lose its grants, a spokeswoman said the agency was always planning for unforeseen events.A Southwest Key spokesman, Jeff Eller, said the charity had had no discussions about losing its grants with the Office of Refugee Resettlement or about its shelter licenses with officials from Texas, Arizona or California. He said the charity was focused on providing “the best care possible” for children.Last year, the government cut off the contracts of another major shelter provider, International Educational Services, over suspected financial improprieties. Juan Sanchez, who founded Southwest Key and still runs it, also helped establish I.E.S., although he has not had a role there for decades.The closing of I.E.S. facilities was carried out haphazardly, straining the system for months. As many as 620 children needed to be rehoused; most landed in Southwest Key facilities.Comprehensive Health Services, a for-profit company based in Florida that ran one of the temporary shelters, leased three former I.E.S. shelters, all in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, and then received a new government contract. Many original staff members were rehired.Two Southwest Key facilities closed last year — including the shelter where staff members were caught on video abusing children — as part of a settlement with Arizona after the charity failed to provide proof that its workers had received required background checks. Those shelters could house more than 500 children. Southwest Key’s six remaining shelters in Arizona also can no longer accept new children until the state says otherwise.If the government ends up seeking a provider to take over Southwest Key’s remaining shelters, Comprehensive Health Services, a workplace medical contractor that has provided support during emergencies, is a likely alternative. But the company has also been accused of improperly handling government money.In February 2017, Comprehensive Health Services paid a settlement of almost $4 million over improperly charging the government for medical screenings. The company said the overbilling was a mistake.The country’s second-largest provider, a San Antonio-based nonprofit called BCFS, seems unlikely to take over all Southwest Key’s shelters. Its primary focus has long been disaster relief and international aid, and the nonprofit has faced daily protests for running a sprawling tent city in Tornillo, Tex.The government may also try to delay deciding on Southwest Key contracts until it reduces the number of children in federal custody — or, at the least, reduces the number of children placed with Southwest Key.A major reason for the shelters’ overcrowding was the administration’s decision in June to require fingerprints for every member of a household that wanted to care for migrant children. As fingerprinting slowed placement, the average length of time children spent in shelters stretched from about a month to nearly two.In December, the Trump administration relaxed the fingerprinting requirements. The tent city, scheduled to close by Jan. 15, has already been reduced from 2,850 children to 1,500. In November, Southwest Key housed as many as 5,000, but as of Friday, there were only 3,900.Still, the temporary shelter run by Comprehensive Health Services is expanding, from a capacity of 1,350 to 2,350 children."
286,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]The newly emboldened Democratic-led New York State Legislature waded into the battle over immigrants’ rights on Wednesday, approving a bill that for the first time offers undocumented students access to state financial aid and scholarships for higher education.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has confirmed he will sign the measure into law.The Dream Act is the latest in a wave of state-level protections for immigrants as blue state legislatures increasingly seek to act as a counterbalance to President Trump’s federal immigration policies. These issues are also expected to play a prominent role in the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential primary, with candidates who are courting liberal activists supporting the state measures.After New York Democrats won control of the State Senate in November for the first time in a decade, protections for immigrants became a legislative priority. They included permitting undocumented residents to obtain state driver’s licenses and reducing maximum jail sentences for certain misdemeanors that could otherwise lead to deportation.“It took us almost a decade to get the Dream Act, and it’s going to take another five, 10, 20 years to undo the damage that Washington is causing our families,” said Assemblywoman Catalina Cruz of Queens, who was born in Colombia and came to New York as an undocumented child.Even as the bill gained passage, the New York Immigration Coalition and other advocates were pushing for lawmakers to “dream bigger” and address issues like expanded funding for immigrant legal services and health care for immigrants.All these measures, lawmakers say, could act as a bulwark against Republican efforts in Washington and the ongoing standoff over the nation’s southern border.“The election of Trump and the fact that he made immigration a central theme of his presidency has made immigration a more prominent issue at the state level,” said Muzaffar Chishti, the director of the Migration Policy Institute at the New York University School of Law. “In some ways, blue states are now competing with each other to provide a higher level of protection to immigrants.”The New York bill will affect an estimated 146,000 young people who were educated in New York public schools but have been ineligible to receive financial aid under federal and state law, according to analysis by the New York State Youth Leadership Council and N.Y.U. Law School’s Immigrant Rights Clinic.“These young undocumented immigrants will work, they will pay taxes, they will buy products, and the greater earning capacity they have the more taxes they will pay,” said Democratic State Sen. Luis Sepúlveda. “This is one piece of legislation where we must get beyond the anti-immigration fervor created by President Trump and see the benefits educating these young people has for our state.”But many Republicans say that the measure diverts funds away from legal residents and comes at the expense of taxpayers.“How am I supposed to tell families in my Senate district that adequate state aid to help afford college isn’t available for them, but it is available for others who are in this country illegally?” said Republican State Sen. James Seward.The move on financial aid for undocumented immigrants comes during a week in which the Legislature and Governor Cuomo continued to make headway on a list of liberal measures that had long been blocked while Republicans controlled the State Senate for most of the last decade.On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo signed the Reproductive Health Act, to expand rights to abortion. New York’s abortion laws had not been updated since 1970, three years before Roe v. Wade. The measure moves abortion regulations from the state penal code to the health code, recognizing abortion as a public health issue rather than a crime from which the state had carved out exclusions.In passing the state Dream Act, New York joined California, Texas, New Mexico, Washington, Oregon and Minnesota, which have already passed similar legislation offering undocumented students access to state-funded financial aid; a dozen states have ensured undocumented immigrant residents can obtain driver’s licenses; and a handful have provided pathways for immigrants to secure professional and occupational licenses.Only three states have enacted provisions that proactively prohibit undocumented students from accessing in-state tuition rates, and two, Alabama and South Carolina, prohibit those students from even enrolling at a public postsecondary institution.The Dream Act’s passage reflected the Democratic Party’s turn to the left on immigration, an issue party leaders once handled gingerly out of fear of angering some white voters.But Mr. Trump’s incendiary language on race, the increasingly diverse nature of the Democratic voter base and the party’s success in multiethnic cities and suburbs have convinced many party leaders that they are both morally right and on safe political ground when they side with undocumented immigrants.The party’s 2020 presidential hopefuls — including some who once held more hawkish views on immigration, like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York — are already moving to reassure liberal activists on the issue in an effort to protect themselves in the 2020 campaign.It is a strikingly different scenario than during the 2008 Democratic primary, when White House hopefuls wrestled with whether undocumented immigrants should be allowed to obtain driver’s licenses. Several candidates, including then-Senator Hillary Clinton of New York, were torn between pleasing their core voters and scaring off swing voters in a general election.The center of gravity has now shifted so that few Democratic presidential candidates would hesitate to embrace such measures as providing the undocumented drivers licenses or in-state tuition benefits. The only question now is how best to counter Mr. Trump’s hard-line immigration policies, and the debate has moved toward whether agencies like the Immigration and Customs Enforcement should exist at all.Democrats in the New York Legislature first introduced the Dream Act in 2013, but the legislation was narrowly defeated in the Senate. Since that time, Democrats have included it in New York state budget proposals, only to have it repeatedly negotiated out of the budget.“There is a backlog of progressive legislation that the new Democratic majority can finally prioritize,” said Democratic State Senator Jessica Ramos. “We might not have jurisdiction over immigration laws themselves, but there is still a lot we can do as a state to protect our diversity.”Though the state already allows all students who graduate from high school in New York to pay in-state tuition at the City University of New York and the State University of New York, the Dream Act extends state financial aid to all students who meet the Tuition Assistance Program requirements, opens 529 tuition savings accounts to all New York youth and establishes a commission to raise private funds for college scholarships to be offered to the children of immigrants.Still, the Republican minority that opposed the Dream Act argues that it creates a greater tax burden on already stressed middle-class taxpayers and puts the needs of undocumented immigrants above those of American-citizen students.“Middle-class families across New York continue to struggle with high tuition costs and oppressive taxes,” said Republican Assemblywoman Mary Beth Walsh. “As state representatives, it is our duty to ensure that our state government operates in the best interests of New York’s families” and not undocumented immigrants, she said.Until now, many young undocumented students could not afford to attend universities, despite aspiring to higher-education degrees; the Immigration Policy Center estimates that because of financial constrains, only 5 to 10 percent of the 4,500 undocumented students who graduate from New York high schools each year go on to pursue college degrees.“When I came here I found out how hard it would be to go to college as someone who is undocumented,” said Richard Salinas, an 18-year-old high school student in Queens who came to the United States four years ago. “I wouldn’t be able to get any help, and my mom can’t afford it and my dad can’t afford it.”“This changes everything for me,” Mr. Salinas said."
287,"One night a year, during the State of the Union address, President Trump sets aside his affinity for combat to offer up 90 minutes of stand-up comity to a national audience.“The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda,” Mr. Trump said, opening his speech on a conventionally presidential note on Tuesday. “It is the agenda of the American people.” A couple of hours earlier, during a private lunch with network anchors that did not stay private long, Mr. Trump called Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, “nasty,” described former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as “dumb,” ripped into Senator John McCain, and derided Senator Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas.”The speech itself, embedded with patriotic language and delivered in a reassuring tone, veered between two moods — combative and conciliatory — reflecting a president at a crossroads ahead of an uncertain 2019.Here are four takeaways.For more than a month, Mr. Trump has threatened to invoke a state of emergency along the southern border with Mexico, in an attempt to circumvent Congress, which has refused to give him $5.7 billion for a border wall.But it was not until this week that Senate Republicans — many of whom vehemently oppose the idea on the grounds that it tramples legislative prerogative — made it clear that diverting funding from other projects for a wall, in the name of a national emergency, was a nonstarter.For the moment, Mr. Trump heeded their wishes. The emergency declaration was not among his demands for increased border security.It was, to a significant degree, an act of political self-protection.At the weekly Republican Senate lunch held in the Capitol a few hours before Mr. Trump’s speech, Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority whip, was asked about the likelihood of the president invoking emergency powers. Mr. Thune replied by saying he believed that the president would avoid a confrontation with his own party because too many Republicans opposed it — and it would take only four Republican defections to pass a measure opposing the move.Mr. Trump would do the right thing, he predicted, because “all you have to do is count to four,” Mr. Thune quipped, according to a person in attendance.Mr. Trump began the night by optimistically playing up “a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it.”And he expressed support for a variety of popular initiatives that enjoy widespread popularity among Democrats, including new funding to eradicate AIDS, a campaign to reduce childhood cancers and yet another commitment to try to fix the country’s “crumbling infrastructure.”Then, about 15 minutes into the address, Mr. Trump hit on an issue foremost in his consciousness — the looming threat of congressional investigations into his conduct.First, he offered what amounted to a plea for the new Democratic majority in the House to avoid “ridiculous partisan investigations” and cautioned his enemies not to seek “revenge” against him.Then came the bluntest of threats to the woman sitting behind him, Speaker Nancy Pelosi: “If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn’t work that way!” he said.“We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad,” he said.Already facing a divided Congress, Mr. Trump has been rebuked by members of his own party in recent days over his decision to pull troops from Syria and his demands for a border wall.In response, he invoked two issues that have been used to rally divided conservatives for decades — the fights against abortion and socialism.“There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days,” he said, referring to efforts by Democrats in New York and Virginia to loosen restrictions on abortion rights.In recent days, Republicans on Capitol Hill have been circulating talking points urging them to highlight plans by Democrats, including the freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, to increase taxes on the wealthy.“Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” Mr. Trump said. “America was founded on liberty and independence — and not government coercion, domination and control.”Mr. Trump dedicated several minutes to listing his economic accomplishments on behalf of women as he faced row upon row of seats occupied by Democratic women wearing white, in a visual demonstration of their unprecedented power in a House run by one of their own.“No one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year,” said Mr. Trump, who seemed genuinely surprised by the thunderous applause it evoked from women on both sides of the aisle.“You weren’t supposed to do that,” said the president, who went on to praise the record-breaking election of 117 women to Congress in 2018.That, too, garnered a hearty ovation. He has a long way to go, however.Recent polls show that large majorities of women disapprove of his performance.With 10 days left for Congress to pass a border security package and avert another government shutdown, Mr. Trump devoted a significant portion of his speech to making the case for his signature campaign proposal: a wall at the southern border.“This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall,” he said, adding, “Simply put, WALLS WORK and WALLS SAVE LIVES.”But as Mr. Trump raised the time frame to keep the government fully funded, the Democrats tensed and Republicans continued to applaud. Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, buried her head in her hands. As he detailed a litany of familiar talking points about caravans marching toward the United States, there was a disgruntled round of groans, punctuated by a couple boos as they looked around at each other, shaking their heads.[Trump wants a border wall. Here’s what’s in place already.]Representative Veronica Escobar, Democrat of Texas, whose district includes most of El Paso, was visibly angry after Mr. Trump referenced her district and the decrease in crime. She appeared to mouth that it was safe before the wall and after the wall. “Oh my God, oh my God,” she mouthed to her colleagues, her arms crossed as other representatives looked over in her direction.There were also some unhappy murmurs when he described the increase in troops at the southern border and scoffs at his description of the “savage MS-13 gang.”The audience for Mr. Trump’s State of the Union address looked like a striking sea of white, with Democratic women — many dressed in white in a nod to the women’s suffragist movement — sitting together. Midway through the president’s speech, they did something completely unexpected: They stood up and cheered.“No one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year,” Mr. Trump said, prompting the women to roar their approval. After all, many of them had new jobs, in the House, which they took from men.“You weren’t supposed to do that,” the president said, smiling.“All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the work force than ever before,” Mr. Trump went on, adding, “Don’t sit yet. You’re going to like this.”And then he delivered his biggest applause line: “Exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before.”It was a striking moment for a president who has been routinely accused of misogyny, who paid hush money to a pornographic film actress and a Playboy model and who spoke in vulgar terms as he admitted on videotape that he had sexually assaulted women.Stacey Abrams, the former minority leader of the Georgia legislature, narrowly lost her bid to be the first African-American female governor in the South, but it was the way she lost — amid charges of voter suppression and vote rigging — that really rankled.In choosing Ms. Abrams to give the Democratic response, her party’s leaders were tapping a crusader for voting rights, and that is what she delivered.“While I acknowledged the results of the 2018 election here in Georgia, I did not and we cannot accept efforts to undermine our right to vote,” Ms. Abrams said. “This is the next battle for our democracy, one where all eligible citizens can have their say about the vision we want for our country. We must reject the cynicism that says allowing every eligible vote to be cast and counted is a ‘power grab.’ Americans understand that these are the values our brave men and women in uniform and our veterans risk their lives to defend.”She also tackled race, even as a Democratic governor, Ralph Northam of Virginia, fights for his political survival after photos of a man in black face and another in a Ku Klux Klan robe emerged in his medical school yearbook.“We fought Jim Crow with the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, yet we continue to confront racism from our past and in our present,” she said, “which is why we must hold everyone from the very highest offices to our own families accountable for racist words and deeds — and call racism what it is: wrong.”Mr. Trump plans to sit down with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, this month in Vietnam, a country chosen as a neutral location for their second nuclear summit meeting, but one that also has plenty of symbolic significance.Mr. Trump hopes the meeting will jump-start a diplomatic effort that has stalled since their first encounter, last June in Singapore. While North Korea since then has refrained from overtly provocative actions like testing nuclear warheads or ballistic missiles, it has yet to agree to actually give up any piece of its atomic arsenal.“Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong-un is a good one,” Mr. Trump said. “Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27th and 28th in Vietnam.”After spending the first portion of his speech patting himself on the back for what he views as his administration’s accomplishments, including low unemployment, Mr. Trump issued a stern warning to the Democrats now in charge of the House.“An economic miracle is taking place in the United States — and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations,” he said. “If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn’t work that way!”Speaker Nancy Pelosi smirked behind him. Representative Adam Schiff of California, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, smiled. He has already begin examining whether money laundering could have motivated Mr. Trump’s coziness with Russian oligarchs.This year’s State of the Union address was the second longest in recorded history, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The project’s data dates to 1964. Tonight’s address surpassed Mr. Trump’s first State of the Union speech by about two minutes, but falls short of former President Bill Clinton’s 2000 address by about six minutes.President Trump delivered a message of bipartisan unity on Tuesday night in his first address to Congress in the new era of divided government, but any hope of enduring harmony was dispelled long before he arrived at the Capitol.Mr. Trump, who has warred with Democrats for weeks over his plan to build a wall along the nation’s southwestern border, hoped to use the nationally televised speech to present himself as a leader who can work across party lines even as he continued to press lawmakers to give him money for the barrier.“Together, we can break decades of political stalemate,” Mr. Trump told lawmakers from the rostrum of the House of Representatives. “We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future. The decision is ours to make.”Mr. Trump signaled that he would not back off his hard-line immigration policies that have polarized the country. “No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration,” he was to add, according to excerpts released by the White House. “Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.”Read more from Peter Baker.Speaker Nancy Pelosi was spared any discomfort that might have come with the ritual introduction of the president of the United States. The president jumped the gun.Before she could utter the traditional, “Ladies and gentlemen, I give to you the president of the United States,” Mr. Trump had already started speaking.While Mr. Trump forgot to have Ms. Pelosi introduce him, another Republican president — George W. Bush — made a big deal of Ms. Pelosi’s introduction of him in 2007, the year she first became speaker.“Tonight, I have a high privilege and distinct honor of my own — as the first president to begin the State of the Union message with these words: Madam Speaker,” Mr. Bush said then.[Fact Check: What President Trump Got Right and Wrong in His Speech]"
288,"Walls protect. Walls divide. Both these statements are true. Yet perhaps no issue represents the deep political chasm separating this country as a wall — a “big, beautiful wall” in the words of President Trump.In this lesson plan, students move past the political rhetoric to analyze the function and symbolism of a border wall. They learn about what’s in place already along the United States-Mexico border, they find out what life in the borderlands is like, they learn more about border security and they consider walls as symbols. Then, if you would like to go further, we invite your students to compare President Trump’s proposed wall to other historic walls, from China to Berlin, and we offer a related Student Opinion question about the shutdown and the wall that students can answer._________Ask students to respond to the following prompt:Both of the following statements are true.Walls protect.Walls divide.Which statement do you think is more true? Explain why.Then have students share their answers as a class.If you are feeling a little more adventurous, you can have students stand up and respond to this same prompt using a barometer activity. Tape two signs, “Walls Protect” and “Walls Divide,” on opposite ends of the classroom. Ask students to stand along a continuum between the two signs based on how strongly they feel about their answer to the prompt. Give them a minute to find their spot along the continuum, then have students share what they think and why._________For the main part of this lesson, we propose a stations activity. Depending on your goals, however, you may simply choose to do one of these stations, such as the first one about what is currently in place at the United States-Mexico border, as a whole class activity. Each station has one main resource, or set of resources, accompanied by questions for writing and discussion, as well as suggestions for further research if there is time. The activity concludes with a writing activity in which students reflect on what they learned and what they think.Station 1: The Current U.S.-Mexico BorderInstructions: Close your eyes. Imagine what you think the 1,954-mile United States-Mexico border looks like.Then scroll through this NYTimes.com interactive to learn about what security measures are already in place at the border.Then, answer these questions:1. Describe the current United States-Mexico border as if you were telling a friend who had no idea what the border was like.2. Describe the current United States approach to controlling who and what passes across the border with Mexico.3. Imagine what you think the 5,525-mile United States-Canada border looks like. Then look at some photographs documenting that border. How is the United States’ northern border different from its southern border? Why do you think it is so different?4. Do you think the current approach to United States border security is effective? What ideas do you have to make it more effective? 5. Do you think all, some or no national borders around the world should have walls or fences separating countries? Why?Here are additional resources showing what the United States-Mexico border looks like:“Before the Wall: Life Along the U.S.-Mexico Border”Station 2: Life Along the BorderAccording to this 2014 data from the Mexican government, the total population that lives in cities and counties along both sides of the United States-Mexico border is 14 million people and an estimated one million people legally cross the border every day.What is life like along the border? Watch this video about two towns separated by the United States-Mexico border, Douglas, Ariz., and Agua Prieta, Sonora. Then answer these questions:1. How has life in these two towns changed since a border fence was erected in the past decade?2. How do these towns collaborate and maintain ties even though a border fence separates them?3. The binational event in the film features jaguars. What do jaguars symbolize in relation to the border?Here are additional resources showing life in the borderlands:“Life in Tijuana Means Negotiating ‘La Línea,’ an Always Present Wall”“Crossing With Faith” (3-minute film)“Dealing on Both Sides” (3-minute film)“Far From Washington, the Routine Symbiosis of the Border Plays Out in Texas and Mexico”“Is the Border in Crisis? ‘We’re Doing Fine, Quite Frankly,’ a Border City Mayor Says”Station 3: A Wall as Public PolicyFirst, look at the graph above about illegal border crossings from 2000 to 2018. Then look at the graph below, about people apprehended or turned away at the border between 2005 and 2018.What do you notice going on? What do you wonder? What story might these two graphs tell?Now look at two more graphs, about the immigrant population and the violent crime rate, from 1980 to 2016.What do you notice about these two graphs? What story might they tell?Update, Jan. 15: Here are more Times graphs that help to show what’s taking place at the southern border.Then, read the introduction of this article debunking some of the rhetoric about “illegal” or “undocumented” immigrants in the United States. It begins:Then answer these questions:1. How many undocumented immigrants are living in the United States?2. How do advocates see this group of people?3. How does the White House view this same group?4. From where do they come? List the top six countries of origin.If you have more time, choose one or more of the other five sections in the same article to read: “Strong American Ties,” “Criminal Records,” “Overstayed Their Visas,” “Repeat Crossers” and “Asylum Seekers.” For each section you read, write two things you learn or that surprise you.Here are additional resources related to people and things crossing the border illegally: “By Land, Sea or Catapult: How Smugglers Get Drugs Across the Border” “The Number of Undocumented Immigrants in the U.S. Has Dropped, a Study Says. Here Are 5 Takeaways.” “The Wall and the Shutdown, Explained”Station 4: The Psychology of WallsWalls aren’t just tangible objects we can touch. They can also have real psychological power.Costica Bradatan, a professor in the Honors College at Texas Tech University, wrote about the power of walls back in 2011, in advance of the 2012 presidential election. Read the following excerpts from his essay, and decide if they feel relevant today:He continues:Then answer these questions:1. Costica Bradatan asserts that a good deal of the power of walls and fences come from their psychological power. What does he mean? To what extent do you agree?2. He argues that walls are not built for security, but instead for a sense of security. Why does he make this distinction? Do you agree?3. Do you think walls have a different psychological effect from fences? Or are they really just the same thing with a different name?Station 5: A Political SymbolHours before a partial government shutdown kicked in at midnight on Dec. 22, President Trump released a video reiterating his demand for additional funding for a “wall or a slat fence or whatever you want to call it.” He said, “We need a great barrier.” In the video, he claimed: “It’s very dangerous out there. Drugs are pouring in, human trafficking, so many different problems, including gangs like M.S. 13. We don’t want them in the United States.” The White House previously declared there is a “crisis at the border.”The Times Editorial Board counters Mr. Trump’s claim that border security is a crisis in this editorial, writing:Writing in National Review, a conservative magazine and website, Jonah Goldberg agrees that the wall is in fact a big symbol: “Trump’s wall is now an entirely symbolic affair.” He continues: “The symbolism is more important than the reality. Indeed, the president has offered to compromise, saying that we don’t have to call it a wall and it doesn’t even have to really look like one. But that doesn’t matter either, because for Democrats, any structure that the president could claim victory over would be a defeat.”Answer these questions:1. Do you agree that the border wall has become a political symbol for both the president’s supporters and opponents? Why?2. As of Jan. 3, parts of the United States government were closed because the president and Congress could not agree on the president’s demand for $5 billion in funding to begin construction of a border wall. Do you think the two branches of government will be able to get past this impasse? Should either side compromise? And if yes, what should a compromise look like? 3. In its editorial, the Times Editorial Board suggests the need for sensible border security investments and immigration reform. In his essay, Mr. Goldberg writes that the symbolism of the wall fight has made immigration policy itself “something of an afterthought.” First, do you agree with either or both of these positions? Second, do you think the president and Congress will be able to move past the shutdown standoff to address larger issues related to immigration? Why or why not?4. Walls also can have great symbolic power. The Department of Homeland Security unveiled eight wall prototypes in October 2017, which President Trump visited six months later. None of these prototypes have been selected, and no wall has been built. But these eight prototypes have symbolic power.Choose one of these eight prototypes and explain what you think it symbolizes from two points of view: first, for the president and his supporters, and second, for the president’s political opponents.Now, look at some proposals that weren’t selected, including a 2,000-mile pink wall, a shopping mall and a detention center. Again, choose one proposal and explain the symbolic value for both the president’s supporters and opponents.Here are additional resources related to the wall as a political symbol:National Review | “Shutdown Symbolism” National Review | “The Irrational Allergy to the Wall” “End of Government Shutdown May Depend on the Definition of ‘Wall’”Conclusion and ReflectionAfter students have completed the four stations, have them discuss what they learned and what surprised them. Then, ask them to write a response to the warm-up prompt, using evidence from the four stations.Walls protect. Walls divide. Which statement do you think is more true when it comes to the United States-Mexico border? Explain why.As an alternative, students can draw their own editorial cartoon offering commentary on the issue._________Going Further: Research Other WallsIn May 2016, in the middle of the last presidential campaign, The Upshot featured 16 walls and fences from history and today. The article begins:Select one of the walls included in the article and find out more about the following:1. Why was the wall built?2. How was it built? Of what material?3. To what extent did the wall fulfill its purpose?4. What, if any, unintended consequences did the wall have?5. What is the wall’s legacy? How is it viewed today?"
