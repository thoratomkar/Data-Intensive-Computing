washington  president trump unleashed an offensive on monday to persuade americans that a humanitarian and security crisis on the southern border must be addressed before a government shutdown can end  announcing a prime time address for tuesday and a trip to the border later in the week vice president mike pence briefed reporters on the status of negotiations in a hastily arranged session  part of an orchestrated effort to sway balking democrats who say the government should reopen while they wrangle over mr  trumps demand for  5 7 billion to begin his border wall the shutdown  heading into day 18  has become a critical test for mr  trump  who campaigned as a master negotiator and deal maker but so far has achieved virtually no agreements with democrats  already  it is the second longest breakdown in government funding in the nations history  affecting about 800 000 federal workers  many of whom will miss their first paycheck this week  the president has offered little to his democratic adversaries to lure them to the table now  he will try to use a broad based public appeal to raise the pressure senate democrats  for their part  were moving to halt legislation to pressure republicans to reopen the government  starting tuesday  and late monday  the democratic leaders of the house and senate released a joint statement demanding equal television time democrats must immediately be given equal airtime  said the leaders  speaker nancy pelosi of california and senator chuck schumer of new york  they said that if his past statements are any indication  mr  trumps address will be full of malice and misinformation the vice president  while conceding that no progress was made in weekend negotiations with senior democratic staff members  said democrats did not dispute our facts about what he called a humanitarian and security crisis  democrats and immigration advocates have argued that the administration has vastly overstated the scope of the border situation democrats said mr  pence appeared to be misrepresenting their position  while they agreed there was a crisis at the border  one senior senate democratic official said  they see it as a humanitarian rather than national security issue  as such  democrats view mr  trumps proposed wall as an expensive and pointless response that does nothing to address the needs on the ground several aides briefed on the weekend negotiations said the white house appeared eager to promote agreement on almost anything in lieu of any real progress between the two sides that has led mr  trump to consider using a presidents emergency powers to order that the wall be built but mr  pence said the white house was bargaining in good faith  the administration has now provided democrats details they were seeking about how any border security money would be spent  and officials have incorporated at least one democratic idea  to allow migrant children seeking asylum to apply in their home countries rather than make a treacherous journey to the united states border the question i have is  when are the democrats going to start negotiating  mr  pence said the administrations credibility continues to suffer  as democrats call out mr  trump for falsehoods about the crisis  such as his assertion that former presidents had told him privately that they should have built the wall  on monday  former president jimmy carter joined the list of presidents who said they had never discussed a border wall with mr  trump with talks to end the shutdown at a standstill  mr  pence said the president had directed the office of management and budget to take steps to mitigate its effects  including an order to the internal revenue service to issue tax refunds  under previous shutdown plans  and interpretations of federal law  the i r s  was prohibited from dispensing tax refunds when congress had not approved money to fund the treasury department  as is the case now on capitol hill  democrats tried to use leverage of their own to force senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  to come to the table and pressure mr  trump  on monday  democrats said they would vote against advancing a package of bipartisan middle east policy bills slated for consideration this week unless republicans allowed a vote on bills to reopen shuttered federal departments already passed by the house  a decision that could scuttle its prospects if democrats stick together senate democrats did not indicate whether they are ready to block other bills  but their position raised the prospect that a significant portion of the chambers work could halt until the senate gets to vote to reopen the parts of the government now closed the house  under ms  pelosi  passed a package of bills on thursday  the day democrats took control of the chamber  to reopen the one quarter of the government without funding mr  trumps wall  but mr  mcconnell has refused to consider them  insisting that he will not bring up any legislation that does not have mr  trumps explicit support unfortunately  president trump keeps rejecting the bipartisan house passed bills  which have already received strong bipartisan support in the senate  to reopen the government  ms  pelosi and mr  schumer wrote  instead  he is still demanding that american taxpayers pay at least  5 7 billion for his wall  which cant pass either chamber of congress and of course mexico is not paying for it is unclear what effect the democratic screw tightening will have on mr  mcconnell  a political tactician who sees little benefit in entering the shutdown fray republicans in the chamber turned the blame around on democrats if its all about defeating president trump and embarrassing him politically  which seems to be the focus of ms  pelosi and senator schumer  then obviously were not going to get a deal anytime soon  said senator john cornyn  republican of texas democrats in the house were preparing their own steps  intended to pull more moderate republicans to their position  the rules committee will start the process of passing individual appropriations bills to reopen the government on tuesday  beginning with legislation that would fund the treasury department  including the i r s mr  trumps request that the major networks broadcast his speech live set off a day of tense deliberations at abc  cbs  nbc and fox  by monday evening  they had all agreed to broadcast the presidents address live at 9 p m  eastern  cable news channels  including cnn and fox news  will also carry the speech some journalists worry that handing mr  trump a chunk of network prime time could allow the president to assert falsehoods to tens of millions of viewers  but several network producers said privately on monday that they were uncomfortable turning down the president amid a national event affecting millions like the government shutdown  declining mr  trumps request could also open the networks to accusations of partisan bias ted koppel  the veteran abc anchor  said in an interview that given that mr  trump had not previously requested time for an oval office speech  the networks ought to give him the benefit of the doubt when the president of the united states asks for airtime  youve got to do it  mr  koppel said  if what he has to say is clearly just in his self interest and does not address the greater national interest  then the next time the white house comes around  i might not be inclined to offer it in the recent past  white house requests to interrupt prime time programming on the nations broadcast networks were rare and usually reserved for moments of national import  like the death of osama bin laden  and networks usually granted the requests  there have been instances  however  where such requests were rejected by producers as insufficiently newsworthy  in 2014  the networks declined a request from the obama administration to air his speech about using executive action to change immigration policy the acting white house chief of staff  mick mulvaney  has for days told other white house officials that a presidential address would be a way for mr  trump to try to recast the narrative around the shutdown fight on monday  sarah huckabee sanders  the white house press secretary  announced mr  trumps plans to travel thursday to the border  which would be the 20th day of the partial government shutdown if an agreement between congress and the white house is not reached .
london  in an apparent effort to bolster his case for a wall along the mexican border  president trump pointed on wednesday to examples of walls going up around the world  especially barriers built in europe  as proof that they work heres an assessment of those claims while governments around the world have built or planned to build 77 walls  about seven such barriers are not expected to materialize anytime soon  said elisabeth vallet  a researcher at the university of quebec in montreal who keeps a tally of such construction  seventy walls is closer to the truth  she said  europe has built about 1 000 kilometers  or just over 620 miles  of walls since 2015  ms  vallet said  the white house did not respond to questions about the source of the numbers the president cited in his tweet  some observers on social media speculated that he had been watching a report on fox business that examined the issue the night before what mr  trump may think of as a big  beautiful wall  whether made of concrete or steel slats  would not fit the definition in europe  most of the walls he referred to on the continent are  in fact  different styles of fences with masonry foundations  and not all of them were designed with migration in mind  countries like austria  bulgaria  greece  hungary and slovenia have built walls since 2015 to quell the flow of migrants arriving mainly from the middle east via the balkan route  but ukraine and the baltic states that share borders with russia have started raising barriers to mark their territories in response to perceived threats of invasion from their larger neighbor  almost a third of the walls in the world are designed to keep the neighbor out  ms  vallet said  much like the desert terrain along the united states border with mexico  the perilous seas  not walls  have been the main obstacle for people trying to get to europe  the continent has gone beyond building walls to impede the arrival of undocumented migrants  frontex  the european unions border agency  and national governments raised a security apparatus that is often referred to as fortress europe it includes naval patrols and surveillance on the mediterranean  where most migrants try to cross into europe  european governments work with countries like libya  morocco and turkey to try to deter migrants from attempting deadly sea crossings  last year  an estimated 150 000 illegal crossings were detected on the external borders of the european union  according to frontex   the same person may attempt the crossing and be counted in different locations   this was 25 percent less than in 2017  and the lowest level in five years still  far right politicians like prime minister viktor orban of hungary have promoted the specter of an impending migration crisis  accompanied by xenophobic rhetoric  to justify funds for border protection   read more about whether europe is still facing a migration crisis  the boosting and militarization of border security has led to a higher death toll for forcibly displaced persons  according to a report released in may by the transnational institute  a research and advocacy institute in another report on border walls  researchers at the institute looked at maritime barriers in the mediterranean and considered them as significant or more significant than land barriers on the european continent  walls have worked for politicians who used them as a means to mobilize supporters  but not to deal with the problem of migration  nick buxton  a researcher with the institute  said by phone  you can build more and more walls until youre a completely walled society  but all youre doing is making it more and more dangerous  he said  people will find ways to cross walls  the fence around the entrance of the tunnel providing the only land access to britain from continental europe has failed to deter illegal crossings  last year  about 500 migrants  10 times as many as in 2017  attempted to cross the perilous waters of the english channel from france  more than half completed the journey reports of smugglers operating around most of these points of access suggest to researchers that walls alone cannot solve the problem  every time you have a border fence and no public policy that is dealing with the root problem  it is as if you were inviting organized crime to the table  ms  vallet said  ms  vallet said she could not think of historical examples of walls that work  she noted that both the great wall of china and the maginot line in france  each built at great expense  ultimately failed to stop invaders  .
the crowdfunding platform gofundme said that more than  20 million in donations were slated to be refunded after a campaign to raise  1 billion for the trump administration to build a wall on the border with mexico had fallen well short of its goal the fund raising campaign  which began last month  had gone viral as president trumps attempt to get congress to pay for the wall fueled a heated political dispute and resulted in a partial shutdown of the federal government more than 325 000 donors had pledged in the gofundme campaign that the organizer  a veteran from florida named brian kolfage  said would have been used for president trumps border wall but in a note posted on the campaigns website on friday  mr  kolfage said the federal government would not be able to accept the donations anytime soon mr  kolfage said in an interview that donating to the government would have required approval from congress and that he knew that a democrat controlled house would not give its approval instead  mr  kolfage said  he has formed a florida based nonprofit organization called we build the wall that will use donations to finance a private effort to build parts of the wall where private landowners allow construction gofundme donors would have to proactively choose to redirect their money to the nonprofit  otherwise  they would be refunded mr  kolfage said he did not know exactly how many donors would want to redirect their money nor how many landowners would want parts of the wall constructed on their properties when americans see us completing real miles of beautiful wall  we know that we will raise the many billions we need to finally secure the entire border  mr  kolfage said on the updated gofundme campaign page the department of homeland security and the trump administration did not respond to requests for comment on friday evening on the possibility of a privately funded effort to build the wall typically  gofundme campaigns can still collect money even if they do not meet their goal but bobby whithorne  a spokesman for gofundme  said in a statement on friday that mr  kolfages original campaign page had said if we dont reach our goal or come significantly close we will refund every single penny and that 100  of your donations will go to the trump wall  if for any reason we dont reach our goal we will refund your donation mr  whithorne said that since the campaign was not going to reach the  1 billion goal  and that both gofundme and mr  kolfage had determined the money raised could not be given to the federal government  gofundme had contacted all donors to the original campaign about the refund donors can ask for a refund immediately  mr  whithorne said  but if they do not choose to redirect their money to the nonprofit  they will automatically receive a refund in 90 days immigration advocacy groups had condemned the gofundme campaign as a xenophobic result of fearmongering about immigrants  some had started competing fund raising campaigns to raise money for refugee and immigrant center for education and legal services  a texas nonprofit known as raices jonathan ryan  president and chief executive of raices  said that despite the change in mr  kolfages campaign  the original critiques of it still stand its a difference without a change  mr  ryan said  the wall remains the wrong direction for us as a country  something that will not help advance any of our national interests and that would only serve to further harm vulnerable refugees and immigrants seeking protection in our country this week  mr  trump appeared on television in an attempt to pressure congress into paying for the border wall  characterizing the situation at the mexican border as a humanitarian crisis that was exposing the country to crime  drugs and terrorism experts  however  point out that migrant border crossings have been declining over about two decades  the state department said in a recent report that there was no credible evidence that terrorist groups had sent operatives to enter the country through mexico .
president trump has addressed the nation in prime time from the oval office  delivered remarks from the rose garden  met with democrats in the situation room and traveled to the border with mexico to make his case that the government would not reopen unless he got funding for a border wall thirty five days into the shutdown  the president announced on friday from the rose garden that the government would reopen until at least feb  15  giving congress time to work out a deal on border security he did not get any funding for a wall  and on friday  he did not advance any new arguments for building one  in fact  many of the claims he made were recycled heavily from previous comments and contained many of the same misstatements and exaggerations  also notable was something mr  trump did not say  namely that mexico would pay for the wall  one of the most often repeated  and unsupported  claims he has made on the border funding dispute the essence of mr  trumps pitch for a border wall  that a porous border had led to a crime and drug epidemic  remained unchanged last year  he said  immigrations and customs enforcement removed 10 000 known or suspected gang members like ms 13 and members as bad as them   this is exaggerated  the agency reported it had removed 5 872 known or suspected gang members in the 2018 fiscal year  in addition  mr  trump repeated the statistic that in the past two years  ice arrested a total of 266 000 criminal aliens inside of the united states  including those charged or convicted of nearly 100 000 assaults  30 000 sex crimes and 4 000 homicides or  as you would call them  violent  vicious killings  the figures include both charges and convictions  and each arrest may represent multiple offenses  the most common charges were traffic violations and drug and immigration offenses drugs kill much more than 70 000 americans a year and cost our society in excess of  700 billion  the president said  the figures are accurate for overdose deaths and the economic costs of addiction  but a border wall would do little to prevent the 35 percent of overdose deaths involving prescription opioids or the  627 5 billion in costs incurred because of tobacco  alcohol and prescription drug addiction still  the president pressed the case i believe that crime in this country can go down by a massive percentage if we have great security on our southern border  mr  trump said  i believe drugs  large percentages of which come through the southern border  will be cut by a number that nobody will believe the claim that a wall would lead to a huge decrease in crime is not supported by statistics  construction of a wall would not suddenly remove millions of undocumented immigrants already in the united states  and there is no evidence of a causal link between immigration and crime  as for drugs  90 percent of heroin coming into the united states enters through the southern border  but it is mostly smuggled through legal ports of entry and not wall less areas  most fentanyl arrives in the united states from china through the mail though border crossings have been declining for nearly two decades  mr  trump continued to stress the need for a border wall with exaggerated data and overstated claims last month was the third straight month in a row with 60 000 apprehensions on our southern border  he said  think of that  we apprehended 60 000 people that monthly figure for october and november  data for december was not yet publicly posted  includes the 51 000 people caught illegally crossing the border  as well as the 9 000 to 10 000 people who attempted to enter through legal ports of entry but were deemed inadmissible each month  in the 2018 fiscal year  apprehensions at the border averaged 33 000 per month and he recounted with graphic detail what happens to victims of smugglers  women are tied up  theyre bound  duct tape put around their faces  around their mouths  in many cases  they cant even breathe  theyre put in the backs of cars or vans or trucks  they dont go through your port of entry  they make a right turn going very quickly it is possible that mr  trump learned of a duct taping case from law enforcement officers  but more than a dozen experts in human trafficking told the washington post and the toronto star that they had not witnessed or heard of such an episode for emphasis  he added  its at the worst level  human trafficking  in the history of the world  millions of africans were forcibly enslaved and trafficked during the 15th and 18th centuries mr  trump thanked federal workers for their sacrifice and support  not only did you not complain  but in many cases  you encouraged me to keep going because you care so much about our country and about its border security  whatever mr  trump may have personally heard  polls have shown the opposite  most civil servants have overwhelmingly opposed the shutdown beyond federal workers  he said  republicans and democrats  and  by extension  the american people  are for complete border security  and they have finally and fully acknowledged that having barriers  fencing or walls  or whatever you want to call it  will be an important part of the solution a washington post poll this week noted that surveys have consistently showed that a majority of americans do not support the wall  the post abc news poll found that 54 percent of americans oppose the project  while 42 percent support it  unchanged from a survey two weeks ago on friday  the president said  we do not need 2 000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea  we never did  he added that he had never proposed such a thing  dozens of times during the 2016 campaign  mr  trump promised to build a wall along the southwestern border  usually saying it would be 1 000 miles long at varying heights and costs  at times  the building materials changed  he mentioned concrete  steel and  at one point  even a wall that would have solar panels  but a wall and the unsupported pledge that mexico would pay for it were foundational elements of his campaign  and mr  trump has continued to make similar assertions throughout his presidency .
washington  before it became the chief sticking point in a government shutdown drama that threatens to consume his presidency at a critical moment  president trumps promise to build a wall on the southwestern border was a memory trick for an undisciplined candidate as mr  trump began exploring a presidential run in 2014  his political advisers landed on the idea of a border wall as a mnemonic device of sorts  a way to make sure their candidate  who hated reading from a script but loved boasting about himself and his talents as a builder  would remember to talk about getting tough on immigration  which was to be a signature issue in his nascent campaign how do we get him to continue to talk about immigration  sam nunberg  one of mr  trumps early political advisers  recalled telling roger j  stone jr   another adviser  were going to get him to talk about hes going to build a wall talk mr  trump did  and the line drew rapturous cheers from conservative audiences  thrilling the candidate and soon becoming a staple of campaign speeches  chants of build the wall  echoed through arenas throughout the country now  mr  trumps fixation with a border wall  the material embodiment of his keep them out immigration agenda  has run headlong into the new realities of divided government  pitting him against democrats who reject the idea out of hand  the impasse is particularly remarkable given that even some immigration hard liners do not regard the wall as their highest priority and fear that mr  trumps preoccupation with it will prompt him to cut a deal that trades a relatively ineffectual measure for major concessions on immigration ive always thought it created a danger that he would trade almost anything in order to get the wall  i think thats still a potential danger  said mark krikorian  the executive director of the center for immigration studies  a group that argues for less immigration  im still worried about that now that fear has been realized at times when mr  trump has explored a deal with democrats on granting permanent legal status for undocumented immigrants brought to the united states as children  known as dreamers  the president has always walked away at the last moment from committing to preserving the deferred action for childhood arrivals program  known as daca  but on friday  fair  an anti immigration group  warned him again that it would be a mistake to many conservative activists who have pressed for decades for sharp reductions in both illegal and legal immigration  and some of the republican lawmakers who are allied with them  a physical barrier on the border with mexico is barely relevant  little more than a footnote to a long list of policy changes they believe are needed to fix a broken system the disconnect is at the heart of the dilemma facing mr  trump as he labors to find a way out of an impasse that has shuttered large parts of the government and cost 800 000 federal employees their pay  having spent more than four years  first as a candidate and then as president  whipping his core supporters into a frenzy over the idea of building a border wall  mr  trump finds himself in a political box of his own making in transforming the wall into a powerful emblem of his anti immigration message  mr  trump has made the proposal politically untouchable for democrats  who have steadfastly refused to fund it  complicating the chances of any compromise as a messaging strategy  it was pretty successful  mr  krikorian said  the problem is  you got elected  now what do you do  having made it his signature issue  trump handed the democrats a weapon against him the dynamic has been on vivid display this past week as mr  trump has argued that there can be no deal to reopen the government unless his wall is paid for  while democrats  now in control of the house  have refused in ever sharper terms a wall is an immorality  its not who we are as a nation  speaker nancy pelosi said on thursday  this is not a wall between mexico and the united states that the president is creating here  its a wall between reality and his constituents  his supporters last month  in private comments to democratic lawmakers after an oval office confrontation with mr  trump  ms  pelosi said the wall was like a manhood thing for him yet it has also become an outsize symbol in the other direction for democrats  many of whom supported at least some sort of barrier along the border in the past but now cast mr  trumps wall as a travesty  sixty four democrats in the house and 26 in the senate voted in 2006 for the secure fence act  which provided for hundreds of miles of fencing along the border  among them were senators barack obama  hillary clinton  joseph r  biden jr  and chuck schumer the only things that have changed is the situation at the border is worse and donald trump got elected  said kellyanne conway  the presidents counselor ms  conway said mr  trump had become so committed to a wall because it would not only prevent the entry of many illegal immigrants and stem the flow of drugs  but also discourage migrants from coming in the first place the reason hes focused on the wall is he thinks you need a very robust physical barrier at the border that you cant climb over  slide under  drive through or walk around  she said  he believes its got to be something thats a deterrent that stops people from taking these perilous journeys beyond the symbolism  democrats now argue that a wall is an expensive and ineffective means of curbing illegal immigration  the majority of undocumented immigrants are people who overstay visas  not people who sneak across the border  a report released in march by democrats on the senate homeland security committee found that border patrol agents on the front lines said they needed more technology and additional personnel to curb illegal immigration and drug traffic  with less than one half of one percent mentioning a wall mr  schumer  now the senate democratic leader  has insisted for two years that any spending agreements contain language barring federal money for mr  trumps wall  republican leaders went along each time  even as the president became increasingly irate  once coming close to vetoing a spending package on the day of the white house signing ceremony while most republicans refuse to say so publicly for fear of angering mr  trump  many share the view that the wall is only a piece  and nowhere near the most important one  of a broader set of actions needed to overhaul the immigration system  including cuts to legal immigration  tighter standards for granting asylum and better enforcement mick mulvaney  mr  trumps acting chief of staff  gave voice to that position in 2015  when he was a congressman from south carolina  telling a local radio station that mr  trump  at the time a presidential candidate  had an overly simplistic view of tackling immigration the fence is an easy thing to sell politically  mr  mulvaney said then  its an easy thing for someone who doesnt follow the issue very closely to say  oh  well  that will just solve everything  build the fence  the fence doesnt solve the problem just to say build the darn fence and have that be the end of an immigration discussion is absurd and almost childish  mr  mulvaney said john f  kelly  mr  trumps former chief of staff  enraged mr  trump last year when he privately told a group of democratic lawmakers that the president had not been fully informed when he proposed a border wall during his campaign  and had since evolved under mr  kellys tutelage  the wall is the wall  the president responded in an angry tweet contradicting his top aide to be honest  its not a wall  mr  kelly said in an interview with the los angeles times last month as he prepared to leave the white house  adding that the administration had abandoned the idea of a solid concrete wall early on  his comments prompted another irate tweet from mr  trump  an all concrete wall was never abandoned  he wrote mr  trump himself has at other times said he is not necessarily wedded to a concrete wall but open to different forms of barriers at different points along the border  including steel slats  i never said  im going to build a concrete wall  he said on friday  rewriting history  i said im going to build a wall numbersusa  another conservative group that presses for stricter immigration policies  circulated an article last month suggesting that mr  trump drop his wall demand in favor of a plan to mandate that all employers use e verify  an electronic system that checks immigration status for prospective employees the wall has sucked political capital from the pursuit of other  and arguably better  means to deter illegal immigrants  wrote heather mac donald of the manhattan institute yet mr  trump has tethered himself to the wall and shows no sign of letting go ann coulter  who along with rush limbaugh  matt drudge and other conservative commentators has pressed mr  trump to live up to his campaign promise  said the focus on the wall was not to be to the exclusion of other policies aimed at stemming illegal immigration we want that stuff too  but we also want a wall  she said in an email on friday  the chant at every campaign rally wasnt  enforce e verify  tax remittances  she added  referring to a proposal to tax cash payments sent by immigrants to their families in mexico and central america advisers said the president became absorbed by the idea of a wall because it was the most memorable and tangible promise he made while stumping for the white house in 2016 he wants to call it a wall because thats what he campaigned on  said christopher ruddy  the chief executive of newsmax and a friend of mr  trumps  hes very obsessed about carrying out his campaign promises  i think to a degree thats unhealthy  but thats important to him  and thats not a bad thing mr  ruddy and some other advisers argue that mr  trump has more room to maneuver than he thinks  because his base would accept his word that some form of additional security along the border was the equivalent of a wall in terms of effectiveness listening to rush limbaugh and ann coulter on this is a mistake  mr  ruddy said  i dont think the presidents base moves even one inch from him even if he doesnt get a wall  they know where his heart is  they know where his mind is michael dantonio  a biographer of mr  trump  said the wall appealed to the builder and brander in him  i think he hears the beep  beep  beep of a cement truck backing up and the product being poured and the wall rising  mr  dantonio said  he can grasp that stuff  he loves it it would be a presidential legacy that future generations could see and touch  an accomplishment that would last for ages  i think hed like it being called the great wall of trump  mr  dantonio said  with a plaque to the president who built it every mile or so the simplicity of the concept made it a powerful sales pitch on the campaign trail  its a four letter thing  mr  dantonio said  its an idea that can be expressed in a single word  and i think that has great appeal to him as a marketer  its sort of crooked hillary or lock her up  but its even better .
good thursday morning  here are some of the stories making news in washington and politics today                       president trump stormed out of a white house meeting with congressional leaders  calling it a total waste of time  after speaker nancy pelosi said she would not fund a wall on the southern border  in a luncheon with senate republicans  mr  trump warned that he was still considering declaring a national emergency to build his border wall without congressional approval  if the president invokes emergency powers  it could be a mutually face saving way to reopen the government  but also a violation of constitutional norms  mr  trumps relentless demands for a wall could divide democrats over border security alternatives  so they are sticking to what unifies them  reopening the government  shutting down the government isnt cheap  here are some of the ways it raises costs  bill shine  the white house deputy chief of staff for communications  has been mostly missing in action amid the government shutdown  now  the president doubts whether mr  shine can deliver on his early promise to provide good headlines  the washington metro area is home to the largest number of federal workers in the country  and as their paychecks begin stopping  the negative effects threaten to spread across the region  democrats are eager to use their house majority to investigate mr  trump  they have a plan  but it may take a while to build up steam  house democrats have summoned steven mnuchin  the treasury secretary  to deliver a classified briefing about the trump administrations plans to end sanctions on companies linked to a russian oligarch  rod j  rosenstein  the deputy attorney general who had been overseeing the russia investigation  is expected to leave the justice department after mr  trumps choice for attorney general is confirmed  tom steyer  the california billionaire who has crusaded for mr  trumps impeachment  said he would not run for president in 2020  he is instead focusing his efforts on toppling mr  trump before the election  a long running dispute between a nevada man and the california tax authorities made its third appearance at the supreme court  prompting arguments about the power of precedent and the limits of state sovereignty  gov  ron desantis of florida signaled that he planned to suspend sheriff scott israel of broward county over the bungled police response to the shooting last year at marjory stoneman douglas high school                      todays on politics briefing was compiled by isabella grulln paz in new york were you forwarded this newsletter  subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox is there anything you think were missing  anything you want to see more of  wed love to hear from you  email us at onpolitics nytimes com .

on tuesday  the house will try to override the first veto of mr  trumps presidency and rescue congresss bipartisan bid to block the presidents national emergency declaration  which mr  trump wants to use to siphon military funds from projects like camp lejeunes reconstruction to build a wall on the mexican border last month  democrats appealed to republicans  with only limited success  to vote down the presidents emergency on the lofty grounds of constitutional prerogative and congresss control of federal spending  this time  on the veto override  their appeal is more parochial  look where the wall money will come from a bipartisan majority of congress went on record in voting to rebuke this ill conceived idea  said senator jack reed of rhode island  the top democrat on the senate armed services committee  now that members of congress can see the potential impact this proposal could have on projects in their home states  i hope they will take that into consideration before the vote to override the presidents veto the expansive list of defense department projects targeted for possible cuts   12 9 billion in all  spans nearly all 50 states and more than two dozen countries where troops are stationed  fire station repairs  new schools and training complexes are all slated for potential funding delays to fulfill mr  trumps intent to take up to  3 6 billion in military construction funds for the wall  so are plans for camp lejeunes new water treatment facility what may seem small is large to others  said monique gibbs  39  a jacksonville  n c   native who works with survivors of trauma and abuse on monday  patrick m  shanahan  the acting defense secretary  authorized the first transfer of defense department money to fencing construction at the southwestern border  up to  1 billion from military personnel funding toward the construction of 57 miles of border wall  improving roads and adding lighting in yuma  ariz   and el paso  according to a letter sent to the department of homeland security that transfer was made without having to use the emergency declaration  but the defense department is rushing to sign contracts on several projects  hoping that will protect them before officials turn to military construction funds to fulfill the presidents request  but some projects would be hit if the emergency decree survives its congressional rebuke and court challenges  and delays could be consequential for service members and their families national guard officials are scrambling to award money to build a  9 million fire rescue station in peoria  ill   before it is lost to the border and locals are left with an outdated fire station  built in 1992 and incapable of providing 24 hour support at fort campbell  ky   home of the historic 101st airborne division  base housing and maintenance facilities are throwbacks to the 1950s  the structures have slowly degraded under the rapid deployment tempo of the wars since the sept  11  2001  attacks  according to congressional aides who recently toured the facility  and without congressional intervention  construction on a  63 million middle school will be delayed and base officials will likely repurpose an aging high school in the interim in jacksonville  there is discomfort among residents that money for camp lejeunes projects could be delayed for a wall more than a thousand miles away john henley  a defense contractor here  doubted the financial feasibility of mr  trumps signature campaign promise  but he also was resigned to a local hit i hate to make it so nonchalant  a building or two may fall down before they get repaired  mr  henley  34  said as he polished off a black cherry and grape snow cone a couple miles from camp lejeune  but  he added  were a resilient type efforts to turn the list into political ammunition against republicans are particularly pointed in north carolina  where senator thom tillis  a first term republican  is running for re election next year  mr  tillis publicly outlined his intent to vote against mr  trumps national emergency declaration last month in a washington post opinion piece last month that dwelt on his constitutional responsibilities then  just before the vote last week  he changed his mind and voted with the president already  the state democratic party has blasted out emails detailing which north carolina projects were on the list  including the camp lejeune water treatment facility  and condemning mr  tillis for putting his political career ahead of the well being of local military families  that fund raising email sparked more than double the average amount in donations  according to a person familiar with the results this definitely damaged senator tilliss re election concern in a way thats unique  more so than the government shutdown or some of the past votes he took  said robert howard  a spokesman for the north carolina democratic party  citing the potential effect on camp lejeune  fort bragg and other military bases  we very much understood what the emergency declaration could mean to our state mr  tillis said on monday that he was concerned about the potential threat to the projects  but added  i feel like the critical needs  well be able to secure funding im not worried about that  mr  tillis said when asked about democrats weaponizing his vote and the threat to north carolina projects  theyll always be looking for ammunition republican strategists and several conservative voters said his flip flop suited them fine im glad he changed his mind  said ann sulliview  68  speaking ahead of a republican convention in wayne county  where officials emphasized the need to keep both the senate and the presidency in republican control  but  she conceded  he was going to catch flak for that either way he went patrick gallagher  a wayne county chiropractor  agreed  we put him in office because hes going to help the republican party  he said  the fact that he had a change of heart shows that he reflected back on why hes there  hes not there to thwart what were trying to accomplish potentially losing money for military projects  he acknowledged  is not the best for the state  but he said it was something he and other conservative voters could accept for mr  trump and his wall i think we would give that up to do the greater good  dr  gallagher said  its not the best  but were forced to do that republican lawmakers who voted against the national emergency declaration found that sentiment prevalent when they returned to their districts  senator roy blunt  republican of missouri  was disinvited from a republican dinner after his vote against the emergency declaration  the kansas city star reported and at a town hall style meeting in spokane  wash   on monday  representative cathy mcmorris rodgers told about 20 constituents that her vote for the resolution of disapproval  a difficult vote for me  she repeated  was a vote against a president trying to secure taxpayer funds without congressional approval  not against a border wall  some applauded her resolve  but others were unconvinced of her support for mr  trumps border security vision i appreciate your vote  but i disagree  said kerry schmidt  62  theres a lot of people fighting against it  where are the people fighting for it .
after prompting the longest government shutdown in history  president trumps divisive proposal for a border wall has taken a back seat in recent days for negotiators in congress who are seeking to avoid another crippling closure  the latest talks have focused on another immigration issue that has exploded in recent months  record numbers of migrants being held in cramped detention centers under orders to end the process that the president calls catch and release  the authorities have arrested and jailed tens of thousands of migrants since mr  trump took office  and republicans would like it to stay that way democrats argue that ordinary immigrants around the country are being unnecessarily plucked from their families and jailed  and newly arrived migrants are being forced to wait unreasonable lengths of time in harsh detention centers at issue is how much money the budget should provide for detention  without more money  the authorities will have to scale back on arrests well be releasing gang members  well be releasing individuals convicted of domestic violence and drug crimes  said matthew albence  deputy director of immigration and customs enforcement  we will not be able to respond to as many calls as we do today  and in fact  in many of these calls  were going to tell them  just release them  because we have no choice democrats point out that more than a quarter of current ice detainees are not subject to mandatory detention under the law both republicans and democrats are citing competing data to claim that the new budget proposal advances their goals  heres what the plan really says months of brinkmanship between congress and the white house over the border wall have distracted from the issue of detention  which has now reached a breaking point  with the authorities being urged by the white house to arrest more immigrants than they can currently afford to detain with little support for a robust border wall on either side of the aisle within congress  republicans and democrats have moved on to detention  which is also expensive  and has implications for recent border crossers as well as immigrants with firmly established roots in the united states mr  trumps strict enforcement agenda has pushed the population of detained immigrants to the highest levels in history  with the authorities sweeping into immigrant heavy locales to arrest vast numbers of the undocumented  as well as immigrants who have violated the terms of their visas  usually through criminal convictions   making them deportable under sweeping policy changes introduced by mr  trump  ice has gone after immigrants who were once not targeted  repopularizing workplace raids  arresting community leaders  and using previously frowned upon tactics to ferret out anyone who can be expelled from the country  as a result  the average daily population in immigration detention for the 2019 fiscal year has reached 45 890  ice currently has funding to house only 40 520 people republicans are saying that they secured money for 5 000 additional immigration detention beds  while democrats are saying that they managed to bring down detention numbers by 17 4 percent  technically  both are true  heres why both parties agreed in the proposal to fund an average daily population for 2019 of 45 724 ice detainees  or about 5 000 more than the 2018 budget provided  allowing republicans to claim their success but in order to reach that average by sept  30  the last day of the fiscal year  ice will gradually have to decrease its detained population to 40 520  which represents about a 17 percent decrease from the 49 057 who are currently detained republican aides suggested in internal communications that the number of detained immigrants could reach 58 500 under the proposal through a process called reprogramming  which allows agencies to adjust their budgets to address unforeseen emergencies under reprogramming  federal agencies can take money that has been appropriated by congress for specific matters  and use it to fund other things  and though it is meant to be used sparingly  the department of homeland security has often used reprogramming to fund extra detention beds though it is a common tactic  democrats argue that the amount of money that would need to be reprogrammed in order to reach 58 500 detention beds   750 million  would be unprecedented and they argue that the congressional committees that are now controlled by democrats would never approve such a large amount the department of homeland security has historically deferred to such committees for approval before reprogramming funds  though it is not technically required the deal provides funds for  1 375 billion in physical barriers along the border  far less than the  5 7 billion that mr  trump requested for his border wall  the money could be put toward 55 miles of new fencing  using only currently deployed designs the proposal also provides funding to revamp holding facilities that are used by customs and border protection  which came under renewed scrutiny after the deaths of two young migrant children around christmas and it would refund obama era programs that were eliminated under mr  trump  which had provided alternatives to detention for certain immigrants  those who had been enrolled in the programs were allowed to roam freely  using gps ankle bracelets and other incentives devised to make sure they showed up for court .
washington  president trump has decided to roll out the big cannon in the rose garden on friday  he said he was declaring a national emergency to build a wall on the border with mexico  using money from other federal accounts  after congress declined to authorize sufficient funds to satisfy him in legislation that averts another government shutdown mr  trump is wielding extraordinary power to get his way  democrats strenuously dispute that there is a national security crisis on the border that warrants using the kind of presidential authority that in the past has been used for grave matters like the sept  11 terrorist attacks here are six takeaways from mr  trumps action republicans in congress  including senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  were fine with the spending deal that they reached with democrats to keep the government open but more hard line elements within the party scalded mr  trump with criticism  including the fox host laura ingraham and the conservative commentator ann coulter  but as the new york times reported early friday  the president felt cornered into accepting the deal and agreed to it only with mr  mcconnells promise to support an emergency declaration still  the white house assuaged some other skeptics of the funding deal  namely sean hannity on fox and the radio host rush limbaugh  both of whom in effect announced the presidents decision in advance and encouraged their followers to fall in line mr  trump is willing to risk the blowback  even from members of his party  and a possible court defeat  if it means he can tell his core supporters that he did all he could to build the wall democrats cannot stop the president from issuing the declaration  but they can make it very uncomfortable for republicans they can vote to terminate the presidents declaration on the grounds that there is no emergency  there is strong sentiment among democrats to do that  which would force republicans in the senate to make a tough vote over mr  trumps extraordinary exercise of power already  senator susan collins  republican of maine  has been sharply critical of the president using his authority this way  and fellow republican senators marco rubio of florida and rand paul of kentucky also have been highly skeptical  mr  paul called it extraconstitutional so the presidents action will force republicans to decide whether to back him  and then set a precedent for a future democratic president to use power this way  or embarrass mr  trump with a vote that could undo his declaration  the president could veto the resolution  and the declaration would likely remain in place because there would not be sufficient votes to override it  but his standing would be undermined mr  trump has to find money from other federal programs to make up a  4 billion shortfall from his initial demand for border wall funding  he can do this by taking money from funding for projects the declaration enables mr  trump to divert  3 6 billion budgeted for military construction projects  and he will also tap into  2 5 billion from counternarcotics programs and  600 million from a treasury department asset forfeiture fund  all told  that leaves him with about  8 billion for the wall  including the  1 375 billion authorized by congress in the spending package that averts a government shutdown each of those pots of money comes with a specific constituency that authorized it in the first place  and those constituencies may not be pleased to see it used for another purpose with this declaration  a court challenge is a near certainty  a party opposing the president will probably seek an injunction  a halt in the action  while the matter is litigated  yet every day that the wall is not built could undermine mr  trumps fundamental premise that there is an emergency at the border the challenges are likely to be many  in jurisdictions from coast to coast  increasing the chances that new construction would not start any time soon speaker nancy pelosi of california has been among the few democrats who seem to be able to stare down the president in this case  she has offered a not so subtle warning about what she sees as an abuse of the emergency authority  she pointed to the mass shootings in the united states  and noted that perhaps the president should issue a national emergency about guns that could be a mere preview of how she and the democrats will frame the case against the president  starting with the idea that he has abused his constitutional authority after his speech on friday  ms  pelosi and senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  vowed to try to overturn the decision this is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president  who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process  they said in a joint statement expect to hear a lot from ms  pelosi about a basic tenet of american government  that congress is a coequal branch of government that is not cowed by presidential whim the presidents penchant for improvisation may not have served him well  in making his case for a national emergency  mr  trump said that he could have waited  but he did not want to  so he declared an emergency i could do the wall over a longer period of time  the president said  i didnt need to do this but id rather do it much faster then he noted that he had so much money from the legislation that averted a shutdown that money was not really an issue we have so much money  we dont know what to do with it  mr  trump said  i dont know what to do with all the money theyre giving us  its crazy  those two admissions could be the foundation of a legal challenge to his national emergency declaration .
las cruces  n m   in a vast congressional district of fluted mountain ranges  chile crops and oil and gas wells on the countrys southern border  new mexico democrats in november broke the republican hold on a house seat that had endured for 37 years  except for a two year break xochitl torres small  a 34 year old water rights lawyer  won by carefully calibrating her message as a problem solver  like several other moderate democrats who flipped house seats nationwide last year  though the region is 55 percent hispanic  she did not harp on president trumps border wall or his incitement of fears of immigrants bringing crime and drugs she did not need to in new mexico  we experience the positions of this president a little more intimately than a lot of people  said jeff steinborn  a democratic state lawmaker from las cruces  the race baiting  divisive border politics has a very human face in our community as mr  trump agreed on friday to end the longest government shutdown on record  in the face of  some of his lowest approval ratings ever  he backed down at least temporarily from his campaign promise of a border wall  doing so could come at a political price with his supporters but at the same time  there already has been a toll to his party for his insistence on hundreds of miles of new border barriers nowhere is that clearer than in the southwest  where growing diversity and mr  trumps demeaning rhetoric about latino migrants are pulling parts of the region from the once firm grip of republicans in addition to ms  torres smalls district  democrats flipped a house seat in the midterms on the southern border in arizona and four seats in rapidly diversifying orange county in southern california in arizona  kyrsten sinema  a democrat  captured a republican held senate seat  while in texas the democratic senate nominee  beto orourke  came closer to winning a major statewide race than any other democrat in 20 years  ms  sinema won 69 percent of latino voters and mr  orourke 64 percent  according to exit polls each of the nine house members whose districts touch the border from california to texas opposes a wall as the wrong solution for border security the irony of the wall is it works best the further you are from the border  said senator martin heinrich  democrat of new mexico  the state with the highest share of hispanics while mr  heinrich glided to re election in november  some democrats from nearly all white states farther north went down to defeat  it was a huge issue in north dakota and montana in the senate races  mr  heinrich said this constant picture painted by the president of this dangerous borderlands region is so incongruous with daily life  he added republican analysts play down the role of immigration and the border in the recent democratic advances in the southwest  stan barnes  a former arizona state lawmaker and current republican lobbyist in phoenix  said the positions of ms  sinema on the border were nearly identical to those of her trump hugging opponent  martha mcsally kyrsten sinema  you couldnt tell the difference between her and martha mcsally on matters of the border  he said  she did not run as a democrat  she ran as an independent or an arizonan  and did not concede one bit of being tough on illegal immigration to martha mcsally demographers have long predicted the growing share of latinos in texas and arizona would turn those republican leaning states a shade of purple or blue  democrats expectations of awakening the sleeping giant of latino voters have been repeatedly thwarted but 2018 may have moved them a step closer to the future  more than one in four latino voters said they cast a ballot in a midterm election for the first time  versus 12 percent for whites  according to the pew research center  in congressional races across the country  about 69 percent voted for the democrat immigration is the big deal breaker in not voting republican  said joseph garcia  director of the latino public policy center at arizona state university because latinos are much younger on average than whites  and many are just forming a partisan preference  mr  garcia predicted that mr  trumps policies and language about immigrants would sour them on republicans in federal elections for years to come it wasnt just the wall  it was the rhetoric over three years demonizing latinos in general  he said  that has a longer lasting effect than just this administration the die has been cast in that arizonas future is largely latino  he added  and theyre all u s  citizens because they were born here  the median age of latinos in arizona is 26  and for non hispanic whites  43 to james kolbe  a republican who in the 1990s and 2000s represented the arizona congressional seat that flipped in the midterms  south and east of tucson  the presidents rhetoric about illegal immigrants was reminiscent of the white hot anger he heard at town hall events in the mid 2000s  but that talk is out of date  he said  because the reality on the southern border is far different with illegal immigration near a 50 year low  more mexicans are leaving the united states than entering  meanwhile  there is a spike in families and children from central america turning themselves in to border agents critics of the trump administration say the actual border crisis is one of its own making because it has failed to allocate resources to process asylum seekers and humanely house children and families in the race for mr  kolbes old district  which has swung between the parties  the losing republican supported mr  trumps wall  while the democratic victor  ann kirkpatrick  opposed new border barriers and called for a path to citizenship for dreamers  the immigrants brought to the united states illegally as children while the districts overall population since 2000 has grown by 14 5 percent  its latino population soared 53 percent  according to a new york times analysis of census data back in new mexico  ms  torres small won a narrow victory in the second district thanks to a voter surge in democratic leaning las cruces  the states second largest city turnout in the city and surrounding doa ana county was up 4 percent over 2010  while in lea county  a republican stronghold  turnout fell more than 7 percent  starkly showing the contrast between democratic and republican enthusiasm  which many observers trace to mr  trump on saturday  chants of no wall  no wall  broke out as ms  torres small spoke at the local womens march about the need to compromise with the president on the shutdown we have to make sure that people who live on the border have a voice for what we want our border to look like  ms  torres small said  according to the las cruces sun news meanwhile  at a street market downtown where farmers sold honey and chile wreaths  shoppers said they had no sense of a crisis on the border  which is 40 miles south and buffered by scrubland of juniper and yucca last year the border patrol replaced 20 miles of low fencing meant to stop vehicles with a column style barrier  18 to 30 feet tall  which one shopper called a jurassic park wall i really dont think about it very much at all  said patricia mihok  who was selling childrens books she had written about wildlife of the chihuahuan desert  which straddles the international border  she worried that a border wall would threaten migrating species rory richardson  70  a retired airline pilot  called a wall a waste of money  he blamed the president for falsely accusing immigrants of crimes unsupported by statistics he brings out the very worst in this society  mr  richardson said  hes talking to the people who supported him from day 1  that dont care about the truth  theyve made up their minds and dont confuse me with the facts but henry diaz  85  a retired sheriff of doa ana county  who was strolling with his wife after a breakfast of huevos rancheros at rosies cafe  said a border wall was needed everybody has a fence around their house  he said  why do you have that  you need the privacy new mexico  which last voted for a republican for president in 2004  was once more of a political battleground than it is today  democrats made sweeping gains in the midterms  winning not just the second district but also the governors race and enlarging their majorities in the legislature last week  democratic lawmakers in santa fe introduced bills to make new mexico a sanctuary state  which would bar state agencies from helping federal immigration authorities who seek to deport undocumented immigrants i think its important that new mexico not help donald trump enact basically racist immigration policies  mr  steinborn  the las cruces lawmaker  said .
calexico  calif   president donald trump on friday promised approximately 450 miles  725 km  of new  wall  along the southern u s  border  after threatening to slap mexico with an unspecified economic penalty to crack down on what he describes as a crisis of undocumented immigration and drug trafficking referring to a  colossal surge  of immigrants  trump convened a discussion with immigration officials and local leaders in calexico on the u s  mexico border just north of the much larger city of mexicali before touring a just completed 30 foot  9 meter  tall  2 2 mile  3 5 km  barrier at calexico  trump said more u s  military resources will be dispatched to the border  our country is full   trump said in a warning to migrants   can t take you anymore the republican president s latest pronouncements  including a threat to impose auto tariffs on mexico  are in response to a rising number of migrants  many of them families with children  traveling northward from central america through mexico and to the u s  border during friday s discussion in calexico  trump was handed a diamond shaped piece of steel slate   the material used to construct barriers along the border lt  gen  todd semonite of the u s  army corps of engineers said that by the end of next year   just after the november 2020 presidential election   about 450 miles  725 km  of new barrier will be completed  border officials have said they need 722 miles  1 162 km  of new or replacement barriers trump is counting on seizing funds from other federal accounts and shifting them for the construction  a move being challenged in federal court because congress has not given approval  democrats generally oppose trump s wall proposal  suggesting instead other types of enhanced border security that they argue would be more effective and less costly hammering on a favorite theme  trump earlier on friday said he was considering imposing an unspecified economic penalty on mexico unless it helps alleviate the united states  drug and immigrant flows although trump has several times linked the issues of illegal immigration and drug smuggling as he tries to tighten border security  much of the drug trade is not carried out by migrants but by professional crime gangs that send narcotics to the united states in vehicles through official ports of entry praising mexico for moving recently against drug traffickers  trump said   if they continue that  everything will be fine  if they don t we re going to tariff their cars at 25 percent   also  i m looking at an economic penalty for all of the drugs that are coming in through the southern border and killing our people   trump told reporters in washington before departing for southern california trump threatstrump said the drug related tariff would supplant provisions of a trade deal  the u s  mexico canada agreement  known as usmca  which has not been approved by congress in a twitter post on friday morning  trump repeated a threat to close the border if mexico  stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from     i am looking at an economic penalty for the 500 billion dollars in illegal drugs that are shipped and smuggled through mexico and across our southern border  over 100 00 americans die each year  sooo many families destroyed   the president tweeted it was not immediately clear what other penalties he was considering  the white house did not respond to a request for elaboration it also was unclear where trump got the  500 billion figure mike vigil  a former chief of international operations for the u s  drug enforcement administration  said the amount of drugs smuggled into the united states annually was probably in the range of  50  60 billion  he emphasized that it was fueled by u s  demand  he s blaming mexico for our drug problem   vigil said  adding that his words could hurt bilateral cooperation in battling drug trafficking   the president should focus on reducing the demand and facilitating drug treatment centers here in the united states   he added  in recent days  mexico has taken a more rigorous approach to interviewing and registering immigrants from central america  haiti and cuba  according to officials previously  the mexican government freely handed out humanitarian visas with the goal of allowing people to stay and work legally in mexico  but it backed away from that policy after a surge in those requesting the documents and amid criticism from washington on thursday  a mexican federal police plane flew dozens of haitians home on friday  the migration institute said on twitter that 57 cubans were sent back to cuba by plane in the morning  more than 60 cubans were flown home last week meanwhile  20 states have filed a motion to block trump s attempts to divert federal funds through an emergency declaration  new york attorney general letitia james  a democrat  said on friday  the u s  house of representatives on friday also filed a lawsuit challenging trump s ability to seize the funds  house speaker nancy pelosi  also a democrat  said   reporting by roberta rampton  additional reporting by doina chiacu  steve holland

amazing to be at its premiere  which was given this week in 1904  right undoubtedly  because it was one of the great fiascos in opera history the premiere  at the storied teatro alla scala in milan  was often drowned out by what one critic described as groans  roars  moos  laughs  bellows  sneers  the times reported that the opera had been received rather coldly puccini compared the experience to a lynching  some believed rivals had organized claques to embarrass him  others cited the operas subject matter  an unsympathetic american naval lieutenant impregnates and abandons a japanese teenager

nearly 75 years ago  an american president was eyeing a grand project along our southern border  not to divide the united states and mexico but to bring the two nations together  on june 12  1944  a week after d day  president franklin roosevelt signed legislation establishing big bend national park  almost a million acres along the rio grande in west texas  he followed up with a grand challenge to president manuel vila camacho of mexico  i do not believe that this undertaking in the big bend will be complete until the entire park area in this region on both sides of the rio grande forms one great international park  mr  camacho agreed still  the building of a great international park along our southern border  rather than a grim medieval wall  remains an elusive goal  but if there ever was a moment for it  this is it  and particularly in a place where time and the flowing river have already carved truly great walls along thousand foot deep canyons  there was a compelling precedent for president roosevelts idea  in 1932  the united states and canada joined glacier national park and waterton lakes national park to form the worlds first international peace park  an important example globally of cross border collaboration  following this lead  in 1936 the united states and mexico established a commission to begin work on big bend international park  with the ending of the war  president harry truman took up his predecessors cause  writing president camacho to reiterate american interest in the binational park  but mr  camachos tenure ended in 1946  president truman had bigger challenges  and the idea sputtered for decades in 1977  i was a member of the first reported expedition to navigate the entire 1 800 mile plus rio grande  the highlight of the journey  sponsored by the national geographic society and dartmouths ledyard canoe club  was big bend  where an international border neatly drawn on a map dissolves into the muddy waters of the rio grande  etched in my memory are sweeping cactus filled deserts  soaring pine dotted peaks and a lone mexican cowboy riding across the river to round up a stray big bend continued to draw presidential attention  including from president ronald reagan and president miguel de la madrid hurtado  they signed an agreement in 1983 for protection  improvement and conservation of the border area  in 1994 mexico established the maderas del carmen protected area  and in 2000 a mexican corporation  cemex  conserved additional borderlands that helped re establish bighorn sheep and black bears  sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  about a decade later  president barack obama and president felipe caldern signaled their interest in joint protection of big bend  and american and mexican officials developed a plan for protection and preservation of the transboundary region  nothing came of it in congress  nevertheless  after decades of work  more than three million contiguous acres  substantially larger than yellowstone national park  are now protected on both sides of the rio grande  along with more than 250 miles of river frontage with the 2016 election  the chant to build that wall seemed to drown everything else  but interest in the roosevelt idea is still alive on both sides of the river  even as president trump seeks billions more for his wall  so whats the case for an international park the pitched battle over mr  trumps wall has focused on border security and immigration policy  these are critical issues  with lives at stake  but in the midst of this heated dispute  what if we could actually strengthen day to day relationships among people living on both sides of the border  without seizing any private land  and also enhance security in the process  an international park would send a strong message of cooperation and hope at a moment when the loudest words are about division and despair a jointly managed park would recognize the region as a single ecosystem and encourage collaboration by focusing the two nations on shared environmental and climate challenges along the border  like droughts  floods and wildfires  and invasive plants and endangered species  joint efforts at habitat restoration and water conservation would increase river flows  discourage illegal crossings and support agriculture  and the park would increase tourism  helping struggling people on both sides of the river the park would be managed like its united states canadian counterpart  with the united states and mexico retaining separate authority over their respective lands and park visitors carrying required documents as they cross from one side to the other  at the same time  park managers  with high level support from both washington and mexico city  could collaborate on everything from search and rescue and wildlife protection to scientific research and native plant restoration republicans have a strong tradition  extending back to teddy roosevelt  of supporting parks and international conservation  republicans and democrats recently came together in overwhelming numbers in congress to approve a sweeping land conservation bill  protecting natural areas is not an alien concept for republicans  even these days on the democratic side  senator tom udall of new mexico is a strong supporter of the idea  his father  stewart  was instrumental in enacting the wild and scenic rivers act as head of the interior department in the kennedy and johnson administrations  that law protects 196 miles of the rio grande in texas and 68 miles in new mexico across the river  president andrs manuel lpez obrador sees mr  trumps wall as an attempt to strong arm and humiliate mexico  but he also understands that mexico and the u s  are bound not only because of the common border  but by a shared culture and history a great international park that connects rather than divides our two nations would honor that relationship and stimulate important collaboration at a perilous time  franklin roosevelt would be pleased .
washington  president trump has repeatedly warned that terrorists are pouring into the united states from mexico  in one of his central justifications for building a border wall but his own governments assessments conclude that mr  trump has seriously overstated the threat  and counterterrorism officials and experts said there had never been a case of a known terrorist sneaking into the country through open areas of the southwest border despite the administrations focus on security threats at the border  a white house strategy document sent to congress last month outlining steps needed to monitor and intercept terrorists included no reference to the need for construction of barriers  fences or walls  separately  an intelligence analysis concluded that cyberattacks are the top threat to the united states  not terrorists at the border there is no wave of terrorist operatives waiting to cross overland into the united states  nicholas j  rasmussen  the former director of the national counterterrorism center  said on tuesday  it simply isnt true in a rare prime time address to the nation  broadcast at 9 p m  on tuesday  mr  trump was expected to describe a national security crisis brewing at the mexican border  it was his opportunity to directly defend his demands for  5 7 billion for a border wall  funding that congressional democrats have refused to provide  fueling the 18 day government shutdown many latin american countries have border law enforcement gaps  limited law enforcement capabilities and established smuggling routes  that extremists could exploit to harm the united states  according to the state departments latest country reports on terrorism but  the report concluded  that has not happened these vulnerabilities offer opportunities to foreign terrorist groups  but there have been no cases of terrorist groups exploiting these gaps to move operations through the region  the report said the latest ranking of urgent national security vulnerabilities  compiled annually by american intelligence agencies  puts the terrorist threat from the southwest border low on the list and then mentions it in a discussion of how worldwide production of cocaine  heroin and methamphetamine is at record levels over the last several days  white house and department of homeland security officials have relentlessly pushed the case that the situation at the border is both a national security crisis and a humanitarian one sarah huckabee sanders  the white house press secretary  said on sunday that nearly 4 000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally  and added that the most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border a day later  kellyanne conway  the white house counselor  called those comments an unfortunate misstatement at the same time  in a memo sent to journalists late monday  kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  cited more than 3 000 special interest aliens  individuals with suspicious travel patterns who posed a potential national security risk the threat is real  she wrote in a series of tweets on monday afternoon  the number of terror watchlisted encountered at our southern border has increased over the last two years  the exact number is sensitive and details about these cases are extremely sensitive former national security officials and analysts have pushed back  especially on the notion that terrorism suspects or their sympathizers use the southwest border as a door to the united states that 4 000 number was bull  said w  ralph basham  who served as commissioner of united states customs and border protection from 2006 to 2009  during the bush administration the idea that you have that many terrorists flooding across the border when you have all of these dedicated agents focused on stopping that kind of activity is ridiculous  mr  basham said a senior american counterterrorism official said on tuesday night that an annual average of three known or suspected terrorists  all of whom were on watch lists  had tried to enter the united states at a legal border crossing or entry point over the last several years  and had been denied a 22 page national strategy to combat terrorism travel  overseen by the staff of the national security council and under mr  trumps signature  cited a broad commitment to making it more difficult for terrorists to cross u s  borders sent to congress on dec  21  the day before the government shutdown began  the document urged data sharing and improved coordination with foreign partners to identify terrorists before they travel  it did not urge the construction of a border wall the only explicit reference to border security in the document  which was obtained on tuesday by the new york times  is a listing of executive orders that mr  trump has already signed  it also included strategies to interdict potential terrorists with plans to maintain the equipment and technology necessary to stop bad actors and share real time information between law enforcement agencies the 2018 assessment by the office of the director of national intelligence ranked cyberattacks against utilities  communications systems and markets as the top threat to the united states  published annually by american intelligence agencies  the ranking has not changed much over the past five years but the government shutdown has furloughed nearly half of the work force of the department of homeland securitys new cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency  which is advertised as the first line of defense against network attacks  mr  trump has also dismantled the office of the white house cybersecurity coordinator  the job that was supposed to sew together offense and defense against the daily barrage of cyberattacks after cyberattacks  the top threats to the united states include the rise of smaller  more deadly nuclear and biological weapons  terrorist attacks by the islamic state and al qaeda  and russian style influence campaigns and threats to the united states space assets counterterrorism officials have long discounted the threat of islamic state or qaeda terrorists entering through the southwest border  in some cases  the opposite has happened  said seamus hughes  the deputy director of george washington universitys program on extremism  citing homegrown american extremists who crossed into mexico to avoid being detected on no fly lists officials included the case of jason ludke of milwaukee  who pleaded guilty in october to conspiring to provide material support to the islamic state  he and a co conspirator were headed to the border in texas  with plans to join the islamic state in syria or iraq  when they were arrested according to the plea agreement  mr  ludke had planned to work under the islamic states direction and control and recorded a video of himself pledging his allegiance to the terrorist groups leader  abu bakr al baghdadi  mr  ludke told an undercover f b i  agent that he had training in jujitsu and computers  which he believed would benefit the islamic state even as mr  trump has lobbied for the wall  he has also pressed the pentagon and the department of homeland security to immediately tighten security on the border on dec  27  homeland security officials asked for assistance that the pentagon later estimated would require 3 000 additional military personnel to be sent to the border  according to memos exchanged by the two departments over the last two weeks  the force could include a combination of national guard troops  active duty military personnel and volunteers  but that was not made clear in the documents  officials said  it remains an issue of hot debate inside the pentagon the homeland security department also requested 146 mobile surveillance vehicles to be sent to four border states  along with enough personnel and material to install 150 additional miles of barbed concertina wire  the homeland security memo also again asked defense department officials to provide additional aviation support to monitor and control the flow of immigrants the pentagon has not yet approved the request  it included guidelines for ms  nielsen and other homeland security officials to take the lead on strategic communications intended to highlight the pentagons role  it also made clear the troops would carry no weapons .
washington  president trump delivered a message of bipartisan unity on tuesday night in his first address to congress in the new era of divided government  but signaled that he would continue to wage war for the hard line immigration policies that have polarized the capital and the nation in a nationally televised speech that toggled between conciliation and confrontation  mr  trump presented himself as a leader who could work across party lines even as he pressed lawmakers to build a wall along the nations southwestern border that leaders of the newly empowered congressional democrats have adamantly rejected we must reject the politics of revenge  resistance and retribution  and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation  compromise and the common good  the president said  together  we can break decades of political stalemate  we can bridge old divisions  heal old wounds  build new coalitions  forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of americas future any hopes for a newfound spirit of cooperation  however  seemed elusive as the president and democrats spent the hours before  during and after the address exchanging partisan political fire  making clear that ritualistic calls for across the aisle collaboration were unlikely to transform an environment that has turned increasingly toxic republicans jumped to their feet at the presidents calls to curb immigration  limit late term abortions and ensure that the united states does not turn to socialism  even chanting u s a  u s a a couple of times as if at a trump campaign rally  that sounds so good  he exulted speaker nancy pelosi  sitting behind mr  trump for the first time  and other democrats largely remained in their seats without applauding and expressed only tepid enthusiasm even for his mention of goals intended to appeal to them  like infrastructure and paid parental leave  ms  pelosi maintained a polite  even amused smile on her face for much of the speech but the evening was filled with political theater as the president introduced world war ii veterans  holocaust survivors  the apollo 11 astronaut buzz aldrin  a 10 year old cancer survivor  a police officer shot seven times at last falls synagogue massacre in pittsburgh and the teary eyed relatives of a couple killed by an illegal immigrant  all sitting with the first lady  melania trump the change in the power structure in a capitol long dominated by men was on display as ms  pelosi and scores of house democratic women wore white  the color of the suffrage movement  reflecting the fact that 131 women were sworn into the new congress  the most in american history when mr  trump noted this breakthrough  the women leapt to their feet  cheering  dancing and high fiving each other  thats really great  he said  congratulations he made no direct mention of the issues that may yet come to dominate the year  such as the russia investigation by the special counsel  robert s  mueller iii  or the parallel inquiries that house democrats intend to conduct into his campaigns ties with russia and efforts to impede investigations instead  he alluded to them only in passing  but pointedly  an economic miracle is taking place in the united states  he said  and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars  politics or ridiculous partisan investigations but mr  trump indicated no retreat from his almost singular pursuit of a border wall  directly taking on ms  pelosi  who has called it immoral  he devoted 15 minutes of the hour and 22 minute speech to immigration with no concession to democratic priorities like a path to citizenship for immigrants brought into the country illegally as children this is a moral issue  mr  trump said as ms  pelosi sat unmoved behind him  no issue better illustrates the divide between americas working class and americas political class than illegal immigration  he added  wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards in the official democratic response  stacey abrams  who lost a close race for governor of georgia in november  scorned the idea of unity from a president who has practiced the politics of division  we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan  she said  but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart ms  abrams  who is african american  challenged mr  trumps history of racial provocation  saying  we must hold everyone from the highest offices to our families accountable for racist words and deeds and call racism what it is  wrong the presidents speech  built on a theme of choosing greatness  came at a pivotal moment halfway through the presidents term as he seeks to regain momentum after the midterm election defeat that handed control of the house to democrats and after his failed effort to use a partial government shutdown to extract money for the wall stung by his retreat on the government shutdown  mr  trump has hardly been in the mood for collaboration with the other party  as he and his team drafted his address in recent days  he has groused about the text  complaining that it was too gentle on democrats  according to people briefed on the matter the president insisted on sharpening some of the lines in the speech and rebuffed aides  who urged him to congratulate ms  pelosi on her ascension to the speakership during an off the record lunch for television anchors on tuesday before the speech  mr  trump offered scathing assessments of a number of leading democrats  including some lining up to run against him next year he dismissed former vice president joseph r  biden jr  as dumb  called senator chuck schumer of new york a nasty son of a bitch and mocked gov  ralph northam of virginia  who he said choked like a dog at a news conference where mr  northam tried to explain a racist yearbook photograph  according to multiple people in the room democrats did not wait for the address to pan it  it seems every year the president wakes up and discovers the desire for unity on the morning of the state of the union  then the president spends the other 364 days of the year dividing us  and sowing a state of disunion  mr  schumer said on the senate floor  he added  the blatant hypocrisy of this president calling for unity is that he is one of the chief reasons americans feel so divided now mr  trump fired back at mr  schumer via twitter  i see schumer is already criticizing my state of the union speech  even though he hasnt seen it yet  the president wrote  hes just upset that he didnt win the senate  after spending a fortune  like he thought he would  too bad we werent given more credit for the senate win by the media mr  trump arrived at this point in his presidency with the approval of just 37 percent of the public  according to gallup  in the past four decades  the only times a president headed into a state of the union address with as little or less support were in 1983 when ronald reagan was struggling with a painful recession and in 2007 and 2008 when george w  bush was trying to turn around the iraq war mr  trump is the only president in the history of gallup polling to have never drawn the support of a majority of the public at any point in his first two years in office  but while he is the fourth president in a row to lose at least one house of congress during a midterm election  bill clinton and barack obama both bounced back to win re election  and mr  trump has privately expressed confidence that he will  too after presidents suffer setbacks in midterms  they often reach out to the victorious opposition with words of conciliation  however artificial or short lived they may be  in mr  trumps case  he opened this period of partisan power sharing with a relentless confrontation over his proposed border wall  resulting in a record breaking 35 day partial government shutdown that impasse nearly cost mr  trump his opportunity to deliver his state of the union address  as ms  pelosi refused to let him come to the house chamber as long as federal agencies were closed and workers unpaid  mr  trump backed down and accepted a measure reopening the government for three weeks  but negotiations in the interim have made no more progress toward winning money for his wall  and the government could close again on feb  15 given that  mr  trumps calls for unity were almost surely destined to fall on deaf ears  even republicans have publicly rebuked him lately for his plans to withdraw troops from syria and afghanistan  and party leaders have pressed him not to declare a national emergency bypassing congress to build the wall among those invited by the president to join the first lady during the speech was joshua trump  a sixth grade student from wilmington  del   who has been bullied in school due to his last name  according to the white house democrats were making points with their guests  as well  among those they invited were air traffic controllers who went unpaid during the government shutdown  illegal immigrants who worked at mr  trumps properties and transgender soldiers who will be banned under the presidents new policy in addition to ms  abrams  other democrats sought to get in on the action  senator kamala harris of california  who is running for president  delivered her own response shortly before the speech  while senator bernie sanders of vermont  who may also run  delivered his afterward in his address  mr  trump assailed democrats like mr  northam for comments in support of easing restrictions on late term abortions and called for federal legislation cracking down on such procedures  a nod to mr  trumps conservative base  he made no mention of the racist medical school yearbook picture that has threatened mr  northams political career  after aides cautioned him about raising that issue mr  trump also sought to frame the opposition democrats as too extreme  suggesting that the country was in danger of a socialist takeover  here in the united states  we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country  he said  as republican lawmakers booed  we are born free and we will stay free  tonight we renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country the president highlighted what he sees as the accomplishments of his first two years in office  including a growing economy  rising energy production  increased military spending  deregulation and tax cuts  he pressed congress to approve his new trade pact with canada and mexico updating the north american free trade agreement mr  trump did not outline the traditional laundry list of new initiatives  the way other presidents have  but he did plan to make a national commitment to end transmission of the virus that causes aids  with a goal of stopping its spread in the united states by 2030  he repeated past calls for bipartisan measures to rebuild americas crumbling infrastructure  curb the cost of prescription drugs and approve paid parental leave the president also talked about his goal of bringing an end to the endless wars in places like syria and afghanistan  the threat he sees from iran and his bid to force president nicols maduro of venezuela to step down  he announced that he would meet for the second time with north koreas leader  kim jong un  in vietnam on feb  27 28 to seek his nuclear disarmament mr  trump ended his address with an uncharacteristic effort at poetry  an ode to america and its common purpose  i am asking you to choose greatness  he said  no matter the trials we face  no matter the challenges to come  we must go forward together .
updated february 14  2019  senator mitch mcconnell  the majority leader  announced that president trump planned to declare a national emergency so he can bypass congress and build his long promised wall along the southwestern border  read the latest here washington  as the budget standoff between president trump and congressional democrats grinds into the third week of a partial government shutdown  the white house has floated the idea that mr  trump might invoke emergency powers to build his proposed wall on the mexican border without lawmakers approval that route could resolve the immediate crisis by giving mr  trump a face saving way to sign spending bills that do not include funding for his wall  but it would be an extraordinarily aggressive move  at a minimum  a violation of constitutional norms  that would most likely thrust the walls fate into the courts  here is a primer on whether mr  trump can use emergency powers to proceed with the project without explicit congressional permission the president has the authority to declare a national emergency  which activates enhancements to his executive powers by essentially creating exceptions to rules that normally constrain him  the idea is to enable the government to respond quickly to a crisis although presidents have sometimes claimed that the constitution gives them inherent powers to act beyond ordinary legal limits in an exigency  those claims tend to fare poorly when challenged in court but presidents are on firmer legal ground when they invoke statutes in which congress delegated authorities to the executive branch that can be generated in emergencies  in a recent study  the brennan center for justice at new york university school of law identified 123 provisions of law granting presidents a range of such powers the national emergencies act  enacted during the post watergate reform era  regulates how presidents may invoke such powers  it requires them to formally declare a national emergency and tell congress which statutes are being activated  sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  maybe  the trump administration could point to two laws and say they allow officials to proceed with building a border wall without first obtaining explicit authorization and appropriations from congress  according to elizabeth goitein  who oversaw the brennan centers study and is a co director of its liberty and national security program one of the laws permits the secretary of the army to halt army civil works projects during a presidentially declared emergency and instead direct troops and other resources to help construct authorized civil works  military construction and civil defense projects that are essential to the national defense another law permits the secretary of defense  in an emergency  to begin military construction projects not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces  using funds that congress had appropriated for military construction purposes that have not yet been earmarked for specific projects in light of those statutes and similar ones that give presidents flexibility to redirect funds in a crisis  the trump administration could point to serious arguments to back up mr  trump if he invokes emergency powers to build a wall  said william c  banks  a syracuse university law professor who helped write a 1994 book about tensions between the executive and legislative branches over security and spending  national security law and the power of the purse the fundamental principle is that no president or official may spend funds that were not appropriated for that purpose  he said  but i think that its possible that the president could declare a national emergency and then rely on authority congress has historically granted for exigencies to free up some funds to support constructing a barrier along the border no  if he invokes emergency powers to build a border wall  mr  trump is almost certain to invite a court battle  while ms  goitein agreed that there is a nonfrivolous legal case to be made that emergency powers laws might empower mr  trump to spend military funds on a wall  she also pointed to counterarguments any lawsuit would have to contend with for example  she noted  under one of the laws mr  trump might try to invoke  the military may redirect funds to build only projects that congress has separately authorized  lawmakers have not approved a military wall spanning the border still  the administration might argue that congress has effectively preapproved a wall like barrier under other laws  including one that authorizes the military to construct border fences blocking drug smuggling corridors  and another  the secure fence act of 2006  that empowers the department of homeland security to build physical infrastructure enhancements along the border the government could skip the requirement to identify pre existing authorization for a wall if it invoked a different emergency powers law for the funds  but that route would raise other problems  ms  goitein said  among them  the government would need to show that a wall meets the legal definition of military construction even though it is not clearly tied to a military facility or installation and that the southern border situation represents the kind of emergency that requires the use of the armed forces probably not if mr  trump declares that the situation along the southern border suddenly constitutes an emergency that justifies building a wall without explicit congressional sanction  he will run up against a reality  that the facts on the ground have not drastically shifted  the number of people crossing the border unlawfully is far down from its peak of nearly two decades ago  the recent caravans from central america primarily consist of migrants who are not trying to sneak across the border but instead are presenting themselves to border officials and requesting asylum and while mr  trump and his aides keep claiming that terrorists are sneaking in across the border  including assertions that they are doing so by the thousands  as a matter of empirical reality  there has been no such instance in the modern era still  as a matter of legal procedure  facts may be irrelevant  before a court could decide that mr  trump had cynically declared an emergency under false pretenses  the court would first have to decide that the law permits judges to substitute their own thinking for the presidents in such a matter  the justice department would surely argue that courts should instead defer to the presidents determination if any court would actually let itself review whether this is a national emergency  he would be in big trouble  ms  goitein said  i think it would be an abuse of power to declare an emergency where none exists  the problem is that congress has enabled that abuse of power by putting virtually no limits on the presidents ability to declare an emergency in part by accident  when passing many emergency powers laws  congress attached a procedure that would let lawmakers override any particular invocation of that authority  the national emergencies act  for example  permitted congress to rescind an emergency if both the house and the senate voted for a resolution rejecting the presidents determination that one existed but in 1983  the supreme court struck down such legislative vetoes  the justices ruled that for a congressional act to have legal effect  it must be presented to the president for signature or veto  because it takes two thirds of both chambers to override a veto  the ruling significantly eroded the check and balance against abuse that lawmakers had intended to be part of their delegation of standby emergency powers to presidents .
washington  for the last month  president trumps public schedule has mostly been a sparse document  the one issued for tuesday  for instance  listed only his daily intelligence briefing and lunch with the vice president  no new policy announcements  no new cabinet appointments as the partial government shutdown enters its 33rd day  democrats accuse mr  trump of hostage taking tactics  but among the hostages has been his own presidency  other than his single minded pursuit of a border wall  mr  trump has all but put on hold advancing the rest of his agenda  it has become  as one administration official put it  a one issue white house there are important things that arent being addressed  said william a  galston  who served as a domestic policy aide to president bill clinton  but the wall has become the singular issue for mr  trump because he has become convinced that his presidency is on the line  its easy to come up with a list of things on the domestic front that he should be worrying about  mr  galston said  but its just as easy to understand why hes not senate leaders briefly raised hopes of a possible cease fire in the shutdown on tuesday by agreeing to hold votes on a pair of measures this week  but it appeared unlikely that either would draw the 60 votes necessary  mr  trump is eager to deliver his state of the union address in the house chamber next week as originally scheduled  the most prominent platform a president has to set the terms for the coming year  but speaker nancy pelosi has suggested it might be postponed or canceled if government agencies remain closed white house officials said they were operating on the assumption that the president would still give the speech at the capitol next tuesday unless expressly disinvited  but if that were to happen  they had alternative options  like a televised speech delivered in the east room of the white house  the address is being written to unveil a variety of policies  not just discuss the border dispute  which is one reason it is so important to mr  trump the standoff has already forced mr  trump to cancel a trip to europe to meet with global business leaders in davos  switzerland  at a time when the world economy faces a possible slowdown  the president has made no evident progress in filling a series of senior vacancies nor has he produced the tax cutting plan he promised last year  he has done nothing in weeks to publicly promote priorities like fighting opioid abuse or bolstering the economy there is this frustration that the shutdown is interfering with the ability of republicans  i assume democrats feel the same way  to advance the agenda  said lanhee j  chen  who was chief policy adviser to mitt romneys republican presidential campaign in 2012 and is now at stanford university and yet  given the new era of divided government  he added  im not sure how quickly any agenda would be moving even if the government were open  thats a sad testament about where we are as a country many of mr  trumps agency leaders and senior advisers  of course  are still at work  his trade negotiators are focused on brokering an agreement to ease the tariff war with china  and mr  trump himself met with a visiting official from north korea to pave the way for a second summit meeting with its leader  kim jong un  as early as next month but at a time when a president is typically finishing a collection of policies in connection with the state of the union and previewing them to build public support  some of mr  trumps aides acknowledge that the president and his senior team have been almost entirely focused on the border dispute indeed  administration officials said the situation had the unintended benefit of making it easier for mick mulvaney  the newly installed acting white house chief of staff  to settle into his job because he did not have as many issues to juggle the president  who made no public appearances on tuesday  has kept his primary attention on the fight for the border wall for weeks  making only two unrelated out of town trips since the shutdown began  an unannounced stop in iraq to visit troops at christmas time and a quick flight to dover air force base in delaware last weekend to pay respects to the returning remains of four americans killed in syria  even a day trip to new orleans to address farmers turned into another public pitch for the wall still in his inbox are a slew of important vacancies to fill  including defense secretary  interior secretary and chief of staff  his attorney general  united nations ambassador and environmental protection agency chief are all serving in an acting capacity while waiting for senate confirmation votes of his nominees  the white house on tuesday sent 51 judicial nominations to the senate  returning names that had gone unacted on last year mr  trump expressed no urgency when asked by reporters recently about all the acting officials in the upper echelon of his administration  i like acting  he said  it gives me more flexibility left uncertain is how mr  trump may pursue other goals  he vowed before the midterm election to pass a middle class tax cut in the new congress but has said little about it since then  he also vowed to pull out of the north american free trade agreement to pressure congress to pass his newly negotiated replacement but has yet to do so he has similarly talked about collaborating with ms  pelosis democrats  who just took over the house  on possible bipartisan initiatives like rebuilding the nations roads  bridges and other infrastructure or bringing down the cost of prescription drugs  neither of those ideas has come up lately and it is hard to see the current impasse establishing the sort of trust that might lead to across the aisle cooperation moreover  any bitterness or ill will that lingers once the current shutdown is resolved  assuming it is  may complicate future financial negotiations when the debt ceiling needs to be raised to keep the country from defaulting on its obligations and when the current fiscal year is over at the end of september that may depend on how the border fight turns out  some optimists see the potential for an eventual deal between mr  trump and democrats that includes money for his wall in exchange for permanent revisions to immigration laws protecting many of those who have lived in the country illegally for many years hopefully  in the end  we can turn an awful situation into a legislative accomplishment for both sides  said representative josh gottheimer  democrat of new jersey and a leader of the bipartisan problem solvers caucus  who met recently with the president others are not so sure  mr  trump has been willing to subordinate the rest of his agenda to the border wall  analysts said  because it is so central to his political identity and his campaign for re election next year the president believes that the wall represents his contract with america  certainly his contract with his supporters  said mr  galston  who is now at the brookings institution  he regards it  and i think probably accurately  as the issue that did more than any other to propel him to the white house that being the case  he added  this government shutdown is not over a peripheral issue that overshadows other issues  it is the most important issue  at least from the perspective of the president .
washington  as he makes his case for building a border wall  president trump says that his predecessors have secretly confided in him that they should have done it themselves  the only problem  all of the living presidents say thats not true former president jimmy carter said on monday that he never had such a conversation with mr  trump  making him the last of the veterans of the oval office to dispute the assertion  i have not discussed the border wall with president trump and do not support him on the issue  mr  carter said in a statement aides to the other living presidents  bill clinton  george w  bush and barack obama  have all likewise denied mr  trumps claim  former president george bush  who died in november  was in failing health throughout mr  trumps administration and did not have any discussion with the current president about substantive issues  according to people close to him this would not be the first time mr  trump has bragged about conversations that never happened  in 2017  he publicly claimed that the head of the boy scouts called him to praise a speech as the best ever given to the organization  he also asserted that the president of mexico had called him to say that mr  trumps enforcement efforts at the border were deterring central americans from crossing into mexico because they knew they could no longer get into the united states after both the boy scouts leader and president enrique pea nieto of mexico denied making such calls  the white house acknowledged that they never happened  but the presidents press secretary  sarah huckabee sanders  insisted that boy scouts leaders and mr  pea nieto had said things like that in person  just not on the telephone the white house did not respond to requests on friday or monday to explain the presidents latest statement  a senior administration official  who insisted on anonymity to address the matter  said mr  trump might have been referring to public comments made by previous presidents on behalf of border security  though not the wall specifically or directly to mr  trump in an interview with today on nbc aired tuesday morning  vice president mike pence defended the presidents comments while suggesting that they were not based on actual conversations with his predecessors i know the president has said that that was his impression from previous administrations  previous presidents  mr  pence said  i know ive seen clips of previous presidents talking about the importance of border security  the importance of addressing the issue of illegal immigration the issue came up on friday when mr  trump held an expansive news conference in the rose garden about his standoff with congress over funding for a wall  this should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me  he said  and they all know it  some of them have told me that we should have done it while in office  the younger mr  bush signed legislation authorizing 700 miles of fencing  but he has said that stronger border enforcement should be paired with an overhaul of rules making it possible for some of the millions of immigrants in the country illegally to stay  a spokesman said mr  bush had not discussed the issue with mr  trump  mr  clinton  mr  obama and mr  carter are on record opposing mr  trumps wall mr  trump has not interacted with any of his predecessors in any meaningful way since his inauguration  none of the five former presidents alive when mr  trump was elected in 2016 voted for him  even the republicans  the elder mr  bush voted for hillary clinton  and the younger mr  bush told the author mark k  updegrove that he voted for none of the above mr  trump has not met with any of his predecessors in two years in office  he called the younger mr  bush to offer condolences when his father died  and the first time he saw any of the former presidents since taking office was at the funeral a few days later  he shook mr  obamas hand and mr  bush came over to shake his  but none of the former presidents had any extended words with the incumbent .

number needed to send the legislation to the presidents desk  above  wall construction at the border in el paso last week while it is unlikely that there would be enough votes to overturn a promised

washington  a coalition of 16 states  including california and new york  on monday challenged president trump in court over his plan to use emergency powers to spend billions of dollars on his border wall the lawsuit is part of a constitutional confrontation that mr  trump set off on friday when he declared that he would spend billions of dollars more on border barriers than congress had granted him  the clash raises questions over congressional control of spending  the scope of emergency powers granted to the president  and how far the courts are willing to go to settle such a dispute the suit  filed in federal district court in san francisco  argues that the president does not have the power to divert funds for constructing a wall along the mexican border because it is congress that controls spending  read the full lawsuit here  xavier becerra  the attorney general of california  said in an interview that the president himself had undercut his argument that there was an emergency on the border probably the best evidence is the presidents own words  he said  referring to mr  trumps speech on feb  15 announcing his plan  i didnt need to do this  but id rather do it much faster the lawsuit  california et al  v  trump et al   says that the plaintiff states are going to court to protect their residents  natural resources and economic interests  contrary to the will of congress  the president has used the pretext of a manufactured crisis of unlawful immigration to declare a national emergency and redirect federal dollars appropriated for drug interdiction  military construction and law enforcement initiatives toward building a wall on the united states mexico border  the lawsuit says congress is on its own separate track to challenge the presidents declaration  the house of representatives  now controlled by democrats  may take a two prong approach when it returns from a recess  one would be to bring a lawsuit of its own lawmakers could also vote to override the declaration that an emergency exists  but it is doubtful that congress has the votes to override mr  trumps certain veto  leaving the courts a more likely venue joining california and new york are colorado  connecticut  delaware  hawaii  illinois  maine  maryland  michigan  minnesota  nevada  new jersey  new mexico  oregon and virginia  all have democratic governors but one  maryland  whose attorney general is a democrat  and most have legislatures controlled by democrats  read the first edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  the dispute stems from steps mr  trump said he would take after lawmakers granted him only  1 375 billion for new border barriers  legislation he signed last week to avoid another government shutdown mr  trump asserted the power to tap three additional pots of money on his own   600 million from a treasury department asset forfeiture fund for law enforcement priorities  about  2 5 billion from a military antidrug account  most of which would first be siphoned from other military programs the pentagon has yet to identify  and  3 6 billion in military construction funds he said he could redirect by invoking an emergency powers statute presidents have invoked emergency powers statutes nearly five dozen times since congress enacted the national emergencies act of 1976  but never before has one been used to make an end run around congress after it rejected funding for a particular policy but as the debate over mr  trumps action shifts to courtrooms  legal experts warned that its fate may turn less on such high constitutional principle and more on complex legal issues  from whether plaintiffs can establish that the case is properly before the courts  to how to interpret several statutes even though trumps political maneuver to get around an uncooperative congress looks like it stretches the constitution  the questions presented in court will raise ordinary and complicated issues of administrative law  said peter m  shane  an ohio state university law professor and co author of a separation of powers casebook two cases had already been filed after mr  trumps announcement on feb  15  one by the nonprofit watchdog group public citizen  representing several texas landowners and a texas environmental group  and the other a case jointly brought by the center for biological diversity  defenders of wildlife and the animal legal defense fund at least two other lawsuits are expected to be filed later this week  the american civil liberties union has announced its intention to file a case  but has not yet publicly identified its client  the other case will be brought by protect democracy  another watchdog group  and the niskanen center  a center right policy institute  on behalf of el paso county and the border network for human rights many critics have challenged whether an emergency truly exists on the southern border that a wall would solve  pointing to government data showing that the number of people crossing illegally has dropped significantly over the past generation and that most drugs are smuggled through ports of entry the president has argued  without proof  that the emergency declaration is warranted because the migrants invading the united states across the mexico border have caused epidemics of crime and drug use legal specialists expected the justice department to urge a court not to consider facts about the border or mr  trumps words  but rather to defer to the presidents decision  the courts have a long history of being reluctant to substitute their own judgment for the presidents about a security threat the trump administration will have a powerful argument to invoke  in the national emergencies act  congress defined no standard for what conditions have to be met before a president may determine that a qualifying crisis exists but before a judge could weigh whether mr  trump invoked the statute legitimately  he or she would have to decide whether the dispute is properly before the court in the first place plaintiffs will need to establish standing by showing that they are suffering some particular injury from what mr  trump is doing  several of the lawsuits involve people who own land or represent communities along the mexican border in texas  where mr  trump has put the focus of his emphasis on the need for more barriers but it is not clear whether any of the fencing will be built in california or new mexico  two of the states in the lawsuit  and it certainly will not be built in other states involved in the litigation  like new york  new jersey or hawaii mr  becerra  californias attorney general  suggested that plaintiffs in the states lawsuits have standing for reasons that are unrelated to whether any portions of mr  trumps wall will be built in their territory  arguing that the presidents unconstitutional action could cause harms in many parts of the country people in california and other plaintiff states could lose funding that they paid for with their tax dollars  money that was destined for drug interdiction or for the department of defense for military men and women and military installations  he said in the interview further complicating matters  the administration has said it intends to spend the funds in sequence  starting with the  1 375 billion congress appropriated  and reaching the emergency power military construction fund last  the justice department is likely to argue that if no disputed spending is imminent  the case is not ripe for litigation and should be dismissed ian bassin  the executive director of protect democracy  said that el paso county would probably argue that its economy was being harmed by mr  trumps emergency declaration because it wrongfully signaled to businesses and potential tourists that they should stay away the justice department declined to comment on the wave of lawsuits  mr  trump has said he expected to be sued and to lose in lower courts  but he predicted he would eventually prevail before the supreme court but plaintiffs can also challenge whether the administration is interpreting several statutes correctly the provision that gives the secretary of defense authority to transfer some pentagon money into the antidrug account mr  trump is then planning to tap  for example  says its authority may be used in no case where the item for which funds are requested has been denied by the congress  raising the question of whether extra funding for border barriers counts as such a forbidden item and the emergency powers statute mr  trump plans to use permits military construction spending in an emergency that requires the use of the armed forces for projects to support such use  that has been used before to build up foreign military bases in a war effort  but litigants challenge whether a permanent wall to help civilian agencies police the border qualifies under that wording judges will certainly be aware of the larger institutional context when they address those technical issues  but that awareness will not  by itself  determine how the legal questions get resolved  mr  shane said .
washington  hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to work on monday with a presidential promise of a paycheck very quickly but no guarantee that they will be working in three weeks  when a temporary stopgap of funding expires president trump and congressional democrats arrived at a short term agreement late on friday  reopening the government after 35 days and the longest government shutdown in history  lawmakers have until feb  15 to reach a compromise on the republican request for billions of dollars to be allocated for a border wall  a wall democrats have refused to fund referring to the odds that a deal could be struck over that time  mr  trump told the wall street journal on sunday  i personally think its less than 50 50  mr  trump said he would use emergency powers to fund the wall if an agreement could not be reached in a stark reminder that federal employees were returning to work with the knowledge that they might be forced to go without a paycheck once again

managers stood in the lobby  handing out informational papers on things to know  how to apply for back pay  what to do if you forgot your passwords  some supervisors brought in sweet treats  there were nudges about projects that had been put on hold  and  in some cases  forgotten  and hurried meetings to figure out what could be accomplished before the next potential shutdown at a federal emergency management agency office in fort worth  some employees felt like they were racing against the clock theyre trying to get as much work as they can get done before flood season  tornado season

ryan baugh  a department of homeland security statistician and a steward for the american federation of government employees  said the possibility that there could be another shutdown had a damaging effect  raising questions about what could realistically be scheduled  meetings  trainings  projects  given the uncertainty well work hard for three weeks  and then well see what happens  he said  you could still use the word hostage  were still the bargaining chip here the morning commute on monday in the washington area was once again bustling after an eerily quiet month of little road traffic

sure the agencys workers knew their work was valued i dont often get a chance to thank people who do that work the way i thank our pediatrician and the people who give my kids shots  she said e p a  employees for their part said they were relieved to be back to work yet anxious that the reprieve from the partial government shutdown could be short lived most of us cannot afford to be without pay for a month  said denise walker  an agency lawyer  its very stressful for people the national park service reopened on sunday  but prospective visitors were encouraged to check with individual parks to make sure they were indeed receiving visitors  smithsonian museums and the national zoo were set to reopen on tuesday federal workers who had turned to food banks to feed their families continued to struggle to make ends meet as they returned to work on monday  some federal employees have been working without pay for weeks  and many federal contractors are not expected to be paid at all for the days the government was closed jamie rodny  an investigator at the housing and urban development office in los angeles  said she was both excited to return to work and scared she would be facing the same situation in three weeks  she was told she would not see a paycheck on monday  and said her branch chief told her that he had heard they might get paid on thursday ms  rodny  who works for the fair housing and equal opportunity division  which oversees the enforcement of federal housing laws  said she arrived at her office to find frantic emails and voice mail messages from people whose cases she was forced to drop when the government closed  now  as she returns these messages  she expects to hear that some of those complainants were evicted over the past 35 days or are facing debts because of the forced lull in their cases where do i start  she asked ms  rodny spoke at the womens march in washington earlier this month  after she was approached by her labor union  the national federation of federal employees  about the financial and emotional pain of workers affected by the shutdown  her family lives paycheck to paycheck  she said  and during the break in pay  they used their credit cards for as many purchases as possible  which resulted in her credit score dropping  she said they were able to make their mortgage payment because of donations they received through a gofundme campaign  she recently started an activist group called stop government shutdowns forever the president promised the 800 000 employees who had been furloughed or forced to work that they would be paid very quickly or as soon as possible  without providing a specific date  the white house office of management and budget directed agencies to prioritize pay and benefits after reopening some federal agencies worked through the weekend in an effort to get paychecks to their workers as soon as possible  the department of agriculture instructed its employees to file their time sheets by

twitter to say that the agency had already approved a majority of the timecards and pledged to work to make sure everyone is paid soon aware of the looming feb  15 deadline  some lawmakers are trying to pass a law that would outlaw future government shutdowns shutting down the government should be as off limits in budget negotiations as chemical warfare is in real warfare  senator lamar alexander  republican of tennessee  said on friday .
west palm beach  fla   president trump  undaunted by perhaps the most bruising legislative defeat of his tenure  plans to kick off a fresh effort on monday to pressure congress to pay for a wall along the southwestern border  most likely setting up another showdown with democrats who have vowed to block his signature project mr  trump  who failed to extract even a single extra dollar for his wall during a winter battle that shut down parts of the federal government for a record 35 days  will request  8 6 billion in the annual budget proposal  aides said  he will also ask congress for another  3 6 billion to replenish military construction funds he has diverted to begin work on the wall by declaring a national emergency  for a total of  12 2 billion i would just say that the whole issue of the wall and border security is of paramount importance  said larry kudlow  the presidents top economic adviser  we have a crisis down there  speaking on fox news sunday  mr  kudlow acknowledged that there will be a fight over the issue in congress that may be an understatement  just as mr  trump has relentlessly made the wall his highest domestic priority as he gears up for a re election bid next year  democrats who took control in the house in january have made it a litmus test of their determination to stand up to his immigration policies speaker nancy pelosi of california and senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic minority leader  did not even wait for the new wall request to reach capitol hill before declaring it dead on arrival on sunday congress refused to fund his wall  and he was forced to admit defeat and reopen the government  they said in a joint statement  the same thing will repeat itself if he tries this again  we hope he learned his lesson the budget mr  trump will send congress on monday will serve more as a statement of values and a vehicle for political positioning than a plausible outline for how the government will actually raise and spend money in the 2020 fiscal year that begins oct  1  aside from the proposed wall funding  administration officials said  the president will call for a sizable increase in military spending and significant cuts in domestic programs  neither of which democrats are likely to accept mr  trumps fiscal plan will also indicate that he will not balance the budget during his presidency even if he wins a second term  despite his campaign promise not only to eliminate the annual deficit but to pay off the entire national debt accumulated over generations as well  his budget blueprint promises a balanced budget only in 15 years  long after he will have left office  aides said  and even that is predicated on growth estimates that seem unrealistically inflated to independent economists at a time when most economic forecasters see growth slowing in the united states and around the world  the budget projects american growth will actually rise this year  to 3 2 percent  up from 2 9 percent for 2018  that is nearly a full percentage point higher than the 2 3 percent forecast by the federal reserve kevin hassett  the chairman of the white house council of economic advisers  said on sunday that administration economists expected continued boosts to growth this year from the  1 5 trillion in tax cuts that mr  trump signed in 2017  including further increases in labor force participation by older workers other economists have criticized the sustained forecast of 3 percent growth over a decade as overly optimistic  mr  hassett defended it by pointing to the administrations forecast for last year  which was only slightly above the actual growth rate  we have the same forecast we had last year  mr  hassett said  because we got last year precisely correct the budget is the first of mr  trumps tenure to theoretically adhere to spending caps that congress adopted under president barack obama  only to bust in the years since  but mr  trump accomplishes this only through budgetary legerdemain by pushing much of his 4 7 percent military spending increase out of the regular budget and into an account called overseas contingency operations that has been used mainly to finance wars in iraq  afghanistan and syria and has therefore been exempt from congressional caps at the same time  domestic discretionary programs would be cut 5 percent  an idea certain to go nowhere with democrats  mr  trump is hoping to avoid a repeat of last years budget deal  in which he was forced to agree to major domestic spending increases to secure his military boost  but he has even less sway now than he did last year  when republicans controlled both houses of congress the overseas operations fund would receive  165 billion  compared with  69 billion this year  even as mr  trump is scaling back military operations in afghanistan and syria  the last time the fund had so much money was in the 2010 fiscal year  when the united states had nearly seven times as many troops in afghanistan and iraq among those who have criticized the overseas operations budget category as a slush fund is mick mulvaney  a republican former congressman who served as mr  trumps first budget director and is now the acting white house chief of staff on the wall  the president seems more intent on proving to conservatives his commitment to building it than to finding a compromise with democrats  administration officials said the new  8 6 billion mr  trump is seeking would enable him to complete the project  with a total of 700 miles of barriers  most of it new  though with some sections refurbished mr  trump  who spent the weekend at his mar a lago estate in florida  golfing and raising a reported  7 million for the coming elections  lashed out at ann coulter  the conservative commentator who has accused him of giving up too much on the wall wacky nut job  anncoulter  who still hasnt figured out that  despite all odds and an entire democrat party of far left radicals against me  not to mention certain republicans who are sadly unwilling to fight   i am winning on the border  he wrote on twitter on saturday major sections of wall are being built and renovated  he added  with much more to follow shortly  tens of thousands of illegals are being apprehended  captured  at the border and not allowed into our country  with another president  millions would be pouring in  i am stopping an invasion as the wall gets built in december  mr  trump refused to accept  1 375 billion for barriers along the border  though not steel or concrete walls  and demanded that congress instead give him  5 7 billion  resulting in the partial government shutdown that left agencies closed and 800 000 workers without pay after five weeks  he gave in and agreed to reopen the government without concessions by the democrats  the spending deal that ultimately passed both the democratic controlled house and the republican controlled senate included just the  1 375 billion he had originally turned down he signed grudgingly but then declared a national emergency to justify raiding  3 6 billion from a military construction fund for wall money  relying on a presidents more traditional authority to move money around in limited ways  he also diverted another  3 1 billion from counternarcotics programs and an asset forfeiture fund  combined with the  1 375 billion  that gave him about  8 billion for border barriers democrats and some republicans objected to the national emergency declaration on the grounds that mr  trump was abusing the constitution by appropriating money that congress had explicitly refused to spend for that purpose  the house has voted to overturn his declaration  and enough republicans have signaled that they will join democrats to do the same in the senate  presumably prompting what would be the first veto of mr  trumps presidency  critics do not have enough votes to override his veto  but lawsuits have been filed seeking to block his move the budget to be unveiled on monday would backfill the  3 6 billion from military construction projects  but officials did not say whether the other diverted money would be restored given the anger on the left over the national emergency declaration  it seemed hard to imagine that democrats would agree to sanction it by reimbursing the money he took  this ridiculous request  like the rest of the trump budget  is not even worth the paper its written on  said representative nita m  lowey  democrat of new york and the chairwoman of the house appropriations committee .
mcallen  tex   president trump traveled to the border on thursday to warn of crime and chaos on the frontier  as white house officials considered diverting emergency aid from storm  and fire ravaged puerto rico  florida  texas and california to build a border barrier  perhaps under an emergency declaration in a sign of growing unease about the partial government shutdown  some senate republicans came off the sidelines to hash out a deal that would reopen the government as congress worked toward a broader agreement tying wall funds to protection for some undocumented immigrants and other migrants but before those negotiations could gain momentum  they collapsed  vice president mike pence and other members of mr  trumps team let it be known privately that the president would not back such a deal it kind of fell apart  said senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina  who was among those republicans seeking a deal it is time for president trump to use emergency powers to fund the construction of a border wall barrier  he said later in a brief statement  he added  i hope it works the administration appeared to be looking into just such a solution  using extraordinary emergency powers to get around congress in funding the wall  among the options  the white house has directed the army corps of engineers to determine whether it can divert for wall construction  13 9 billion allocated last year after devastating hurricanes and wildfires  according to congressional and defense department officials with knowledge of the matter  who insisted on anonymity to discuss the possibility administration officials are debating whether they could make such a move without the president declaring a national emergency  an action the white house counsels office has explored but mr  trumps advisers  including his son in law and senior adviser  jared kushner  have urged him to try to find other approaches than declaring a national emergency  mr  kushners role was first reported by the wall street journal the advisers have warned him of a range of possible negative outcomes  particularly the risk of losing in court  people familiar with the discussions said aides have suggested that mr  trump would be giving a dysfunctional congress a pass from fulfilling its duties if he makes an aggressive move  and some of his more conservative advisers have suggested a national emergency declaration is a form of government overreach that is antithetical to conservative principles as the shutdown neared day 21  the second longest in history  mr  trump used a visit to a border facility in mcallen  tex   to blame the protracted shutdown on democrats  charging that their opposition to a wall was responsible for brutal crime and violence youll have crime in iowa  youll have crime in new hampshire  youll have crime in new york without a wall  he warned we could stop that cold  he added mr  trump also repeated his demand for the money from congress while saying that mexico would somehow provide funds indirectly for the wall  a contradiction of what he said in december when he wrote in a twitter post  i often stated  one way or the other  mexico is going to pay for the wall  i didnt say theyre going to write me a check for  10 billion or  20 billion  mr  trump said on thursday  if congress approves this trade bill  theyll pay for the wall many times over  when i say mexicos going to pay for the wall  thats what i mean it was among the bewildering statements that underscored his often contradictory attempts to force democrats to capitulate  mr  trump renewed his threat to declare a national emergency and build his wall without congressional approval we can declare a national emergency  mr  trump said  we shouldnt have to later  standing just by the rio grande with military vehicles and border agents as his backdrop  he said he would consider a compromise that would allow undocumented immigrants brought to the united states as children  often known as dreamers  to maintain legal status they lost when he ended the obama era program that protected them i would like to do a much broader form of immigration  mr  trump said  we could help the dreamers only hours earlier  mr  pence had rejected such a deal  saying the president wanted to wait until the supreme court ruled this spring on whether the program  deferred action for childhood arrivals  or daca  was constitutional  no wall  no deal  mr  pence declared in a briefing with reporters on capitol hill  were going to keep standing strong  keep standing firm the vice president faulted the democrats  but he has essentially blocked potential solutions for the impasse  he has made it clear that mr  trump would not drop his insistence on funding for a wall on the southwestern border  which democrats have branded a nonstarter mr  pence also indicated that the president was disinclined to accept the idea behind a bipartisan plan that had been under discussion in the senate that would trade wall funding for legal status for undocumented immigrants facing the threat of deportation  including the dreamers and people who previously held temporary protected status privately  he told mr  grahams group that the president also would not support a proposal that would reopen the government for three weeks while republicans and democrats work to hash out a broader legislative deal on the wall and temporary grants of legal status for the two groups were kind of stuck  mr  graham conceded speaker nancy pelosi  democrat of california  also showed no signs of budging  urging the republican controlled senate to take up a measure that the house passed on wednesday to reopen part of the government  the house passed two more measures on thursday  this time funding the departments of housing and urban development  transportation and agriculture  as well as the food and drug administration a dozen republicans crossed party lines to support one of the measures  slightly more than in previous votes  but no indicator that the patience of mr  trumps own party was wearing thin we say to them  take yes for an answer  this is what you had proposed  ms  pelosi said at a news conference  why are you rejecting it at the expense of the health  safety and well being of the american people  do you take an oath to the american people  or to donald trump the showdown has forced 800 000 federal workers to go without pay and placed federal benefits for millions more in jeopardy  with the fallout being felt across the united states  without debate on thursday  the senate unanimously passed legislation to ensure that workers who go without salaries receive back pay when the government reopens  senator mitch mcconnell republican of kentucky and the majority leader  said mr  trump had assured him he would sign the bill the partial shutdown will almost certainly become the longest in american history on saturday  eclipsing a 21 day lapse that began in december 1995  mr  trump tweeted thursday that he would skip a planned trip to the world economic forum  in davos  switzerland  slated to begin jan  22  because of the impasse the implosion of the congressional deal left lawmakers bracing for mr  trump to declare a national emergency  senior democrats were exploring both legislative and legal options to challenge the move the president is allowed to divert unspent money from projects under a national emergency  but a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe confidential discussions  questioned the legality of using army corps funding  saying it would be subject to restrictions under the stafford act  which governs disaster relief  the official said the process was as much a political exercise intended to threaten projects democrats valued as a pragmatic one that would be a travesty  representative peter a  defazio  democrat of oregon and the chairman of the house transportation and infrastructure committee  said in an interview its all speculative at this point  he said  alluding wryly to mr  trumps penchant for abrupt announcements at all hours of the day and night  until we get a tweet at 2 30 tomorrow morning  we wont know still  republican senators who had called for reopening the government while the debate over border security continues said they were disappointed its very difficult when were dealing with people who do not want to budge at all with their positions  and thats the president and speaker pelosi  senator susan collins of maine said  theyre each very dug in on their position  and thats made this very difficult to resolve .
washington  president trump will declare a national emergency as early as friday to bypass congress and build his long promised wall along the nations southwestern border even as he agreed to sign a spending package that does not finance it  white house officials said thursday the announcement came just minutes before voting began on the spending measure  which then cleared both houses  ending a two month war of attrition that closed much of the federal government for 35 days and threatened a second shutdown on friday  the senate passed it 83 to 16  and the house followed later in the evening  300 to 128 but if he declares a national emergency to access billions of dollars for his wall  mr  trump could instigate a constitutional clash over who controls the federal purse and test the bounds of presidential authority in a time of divided government  democrats and some republicans instantly condemned the move  with some vowing to challenge it through legislation and lawsuits  trump will declare a national emergency  what happens next  the presidents plan would combine money included in the spending package for fencing along the border with funds that he can divert from other programs using traditional presidential discretion on top of still other money he would tap by declaring an emergency altogether  an administration official said  mr  trump would be able to dedicate about  8 billion for barriers  more than the  5 7 billion that congress refused to give him president trump will sign the government funding bill  and as he has stated before  he will also take other executive action  including a national emergency  to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border  said sarah huckabee sanders  the white house press secretary  the president is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall  protect the border and secure our great country mr  trumps announcement capped hours of last minute drama as he came under pressure on thursday morning to not sign the spending legislation from conservative figures like laura ingraham  who denounced it on twitter as a monstrosity and a total scam a balky president was concerned that signing the measure could impose restraints on his ability to tap other funds and was urged by his chief of staff  mick mulvaney  to tell republican leaders to instead pass a short term bill to keep the government open while reopening negotiations  according to a republican briefed on the situation such a move would have unraveled the delicate bipartisan balance favored by senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  who wanted to move beyond the wall fight  in a telephone conversation on thursday  mr  trump asked mr  mcconnell whether the spending measure included any hidden provisions or land mines  and the senator reassured him it did not  according to a person familiar with the call similarly  kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  and white house lawyers told him that he could still move money around  and ms  nielsen said that the spending package was actually better than a short term measure  mr  mcconnell argued that it was a win over speaker nancy pelosi ultimately  mr  trump was persuaded to sign the bipartisan spending measure after all  and at least some close to the president doubted that he was ever really wavering and instead was just enjoying the suspense but mr  mcconnell chose not to take a chance  rushing to the floor and interrupting a colleagues speech to announce mr  trumps decision  in effect locking it in before he could change his mind in agreeing to end the spending fight for now  however  mr  trump essentially started a new one with his vow to declare a national emergency  one that crosses party and ideological lines as liberals and conservatives alike objected to what they called presidential overreach seven senate democrats  including four announced or possible presidential candidates  immediately introduced legislation intended to block mr  trump from diverting money from disaster relief for the wall  some house democrats  including representative jerrold nadler of new york  the chairman of the judiciary committee  began endorsing a joint resolution to essentially nullify a national emergency declaration a parade of liberal advocacy organizations sent out pre written statements promising to challenge any such declaration in court as an outrageous abuse of power by an unstable and increasingly autocratic president  as one of the groups  public citizen  put it the president is doing an end run around congress  ms  pelosi told reporters  she suggested that mr  trump was setting a precedent for future democratic presidents to act on issues like gun control  precisely the scenario that scares republicans you want to talk about a national emergency  lets talk about today  ms  pelosi said  reminding mr  trump that it was the anniversary of the shooting massacre last february at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland  fla  seventeen students and staff members were killed  thats a national emergency  why dont you declare that emergency  mr  president  i wish you would senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  echoed her criticism and said congress would defend its prerogatives  the public was more opposed to the emergency declaration than they were to the wall  he said in a brief interview  and they were opposed to the wall about a half dozen senate republicans quickly spoke out against the move  as well  i dont think this is a matter that should be declared a national emergency  said senator lisa murkowski of alaska  we as legislators are trying to address the presidents priority  what were voting on now is perhaps an imperfect solution  but its one we could get consensus on senator susan collins of maine said such a declaration was of dubious constitutionality  while senator marco rubio of florida called it a bad idea  senator rand paul of kentucky said  we have a government that has a constitution that has a division of power  and revenue raising and spending power was given to congress still  other republicans backed mr  trump  including an ally  senator lindsey graham of south carolina  as well as senator shelley moore capito of west virginia  who faces re election next year  he feels that declaring a national emergency gives him that flexibility that he wants and needs  so im supportive of that  ms  capito said of the president for goodness sake  we tried for 35 days in december and january  right  to get the democrats to do what everyone knows needs to happen except democrats  said representative jim jordan  republican of ohio  i support the national emergency declaration 100 percent among the republicans who privately warned mr  trump against an emergency declaration was mr  mcconnell  who expects that house democrats will pass a resolution terminating it in a form that the republican leader cannot block from a floor vote  at least five or six republican senators are likely to vote against the president  making a majority along with the democrats  and potentially forcing mr  trump to veto it  read the first edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up for it here  a person familiar with the discussions said that mr  mcconnell said that he has warned mr  trump that he has less than two weeks to try to persuade wavering republicans to support his national emergency effort  otherwise he will face the prospect of a bipartisan rebuke by congress the spending legislation that passed on thursday drew strong bipartisan votes in a congress that has been deeply divided along party lines  in the house  213 democrats and 87 republicans voted yes  meaning that democrats were unable to pass it by themselves because they lost 19 of their own  most republicans  109 in all  voted no ms  pelosi  using nearly a dozen pens to sign the final bill  applauded the bipartisan majority  calling it quite a remarkable show in the senate  most of the 16 no votes were by republicans  along with four democratic presidential candidates  cory booker of new jersey  kirsten gillibrand of new york  kamala harris of california and elizabeth warren of massachusetts the package includes the seven remaining bills to keep the remainder of the government open through the rest of the fiscal year at the end of september  house and senate negotiators unveiled the 1 159 page bill on wednesday just before midnight  leaving little time for lawmakers to actually digest its contents the border security compromise tucked into the bill is perhaps the most stinging legislative defeat of mr  trumps presidency  it provides money for 55 miles of steel post fencing  essentially the same deal that mr  trump rejected in december the measure prohibits construction in certain areas along the rio grande valley and includes a provision  pushed by representative henry cuellar  democrat of texas  granting communities on the border time to weigh in on the location and design of the fencing the bill also prohibits funds from being used to keep lawmakers from visiting and inspecting department of homeland security detention centers  following a number of highly publicized instances where democratic lawmakers tried to visit detention centers and were turned away lawmakers were drawn by the other six parts of the spending package that finance a number of agencies  including the internal revenue service  which is in the middle of tax filing season  and the commerce department  allocations include  77 million to address the opioid epidemic  as well as money for natural disasters  including nearly  4 billion to wild land fire programs and  12 6 billion for the federal emergency management agencys disaster relief fund the package also negates an executive order that mr  trump signed to freeze pay for federal civilian workers  and instead extends a 1 9 percent pay increase  vice president mike pence  cabinet officials and other high level political appointees will receive raises of about  10 000 a year that had been frozen during the shutdown negotiators failed to resolve other matters  including back pay for federal contractors caught in the middle of the shutdown and an extension of the violence against women act  which expires friday  although grants under the act are funded in the spending bill mr  trumps aides have told him he can add to the  1 375 billion by reallocating money from other related programs using his traditional discretion but a national emergency would allow him to access even more money  exactly how that would work was still being debated  there were multiple drafts of the emergency order circulating within the government this week a defense department official said one likely scenario would be to divert up to  2 5 billion in counternarcotics funds to the army corps of engineers  the administration would then transfer existing federal land along the border to the defense department and acquire or condemn private land the army corps could then go ahead and build a wall or other barrier to secure the defense departments property using the newly diverted funds  dozens of miles of barrier could be built this way  according to the official  who asked not to be identified discussing alternatives before the white house was ready to disclose a specific plan legal experts have said mr  trump can muster serious arguments that he can declare a national emergency under current law  but it would almost surely prompt a court challenge from critics arguing that he is usurping two centuries of congressional control over spending under article i of the constitution  congress has the power to appropriate funds  no money shall be drawn from the treasury  but in consequence of appropriations made by law  it says but congress has passed laws in the past providing presidents with authority in national emergencies  laws that remain on the books  indeed  31 national emergencies declared by mr  trump and his predecessors remain active legal challenges could ultimately lead to a confrontation at the supreme court  the court is led by a five member conservative majority  but it has shown skepticism of presidential excesses in recent years  reining in both president george w  bush and president barack obama when the justices concluded they had overstepped their authority .
washington  president trump on friday issued his first veto  rejecting legislation to overturn his declaration of a national emergency to fund a wall along the southwestern border  the bill had attracted significant republican support in congress  a rare and notable departure from partisan solidarity today  i am vetoing this resolution  mr  trump told reporters in the oval office  congress has the freedom to pass this resolution  and i have the duty to veto it  the president called the resolution dangerous  reckless and a vote against reality mr  trump was flanked by vice president mike pence  attorney general william p  barr and kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  mr  barr said the presidents emergency order was clearly authorized under the law and solidly grounded in law the veto  which was expected  will send the legislation back to congress  which almost certainly does not have enough votes for an override  that means mr  trumps declaration will remain in effect democrats were quick to condemn the presidents action it is no surprise that the president holds the rule of law and our constitution in minimal regard  senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  said in a statement  there is no emergency  congress has refused to fund his wall multiple times  mexico wont pay for it  and a bipartisan majority in both chambers just voted to terminate his fake emergency to that  speaker nancy pelosi added  the house and senate resoundingly rejected the presidents lawless power grab  yet the president has chosen to continue to defy the constitution  the congress and the will of the american people mr  trump has long insisted that there was a security and humanitarian crisis at the border with mexico  an assertion that was undercut by mr  trump himself when he acknowledged that he could have waited to issue a declaration  but on friday  he offered a flurry of statistics to support his contention  though many were vague  he blurred numbers that reflected a humanitarian problem with those he said represented a security issue democrats had seized on his earlier words and cited other government data that shows there has been no flood of criminal migrants coming into the united states  some republicans shared that view but others said they opposed the president on the grounds that it was the duty of congress to appropriate taxpayer dollars and that mr  trump had exceeded his authority  on thursday  a dozen republicans joined senate democrats in voting to overturn mr  trumps emergency declaration  59 to 41 never before has a president asked for funding  congress has not provided it and the president then has used the national emergencies act of 1976 to spend the money anyway  senator lamar alexander  republican of tennessee  said after the vote  senator jerry moran  republican of kansas  said he thought mr  trumps declaration was unconstitutional the president said on friday that he understood why some republicans believed he had overreached  theyre doing what they have to do  and i put no pressure on anybody  mr  trump said  i actually said  i could have gotten some of them to come along  i said  i want you to vote your heart  do what you want to do  im not putting any pressure ill let them know when theres pressure  o k   he added  and i told them that  i said  when i need your vote  im going to let you know  i didnt need the vote because we all knew it was going to be a veto  and theyre not going to be able to override  its going to go very quickly mr  trump has held broad sway over congressional republicans in his first two years in office  the decision by the dozen senate republicans to side with democrats on an issue central to the presidents agenda was seen as a reclaiming of the role of congress as a coequal branch of government mr  trump was undeterred by the republican opposition and quickly signaled his next step when he tweeted veto  not long after the vote  the president said on friday that there was nothing less than an invasion of the united states by migrants  and he added that so many of them had been apprehended that there was nowhere left to hold all of the people that were capturing even if congress fails to override the veto  the emergency declaration is already drawing court challenges a coalition of 20 states  including california and new york  sued last month over mr  trumps use of emergency powers  arguing that the president does not have the authority to divert funds for building a wall along the mexican border because it is congress that controls spending xavier becerra  the attorney general of california  said that congress had sent a clear message that your supposed emergency isnt one he added  we are determined to stop his fabricated emergency in its tracks anthony d  romero  the executive director of the american civil liberties union  said in a statement that even members of president trumps own party are beginning to realize that he is a one man constitutional crisis the presidents veto is as meaningless as his signature on the national emergency declaration  he added  congress has rejected the presidents declaration  and now the courts will be the ultimate arbiter of its legality  we look forward to seeing him in court and to the shellacking that he will receive at the hands of an independent judiciary .
the end of the myth from the frontier to the border wall in the mind of americaby greg grandinin a speech in 1932  franklin delano roosevelt reminded a san francisco audience of what had always distinguished the united states from other nations since its earliest days  at the very worst  roosevelt declared  there was always the possibility of climbing into a covered wagon and moving west where the untilled prairies afforded a haven for men to whom the east did not provide a place well  yes and no  it is the mission of this fine  elegantly written history to explore the ever shifting role of the frontier in the american story  just who was welcome in that west facing haven  greg grandin explains  was never as simple as americans liked to proclaim  but the end of the myth has a shadow theme  how is it  grandin wants to know  that the symbol of america was once a boundless  beckoning frontier and today is a dark and forbidding wall the first person to articulate the frontier thesis was a university of wisconsin historian who was little regarded at the time  frederick jackson turner  in 1893  he read a paper on the significance of the frontier in american history to a sleepy audience  no one asked a question the world quickly woke up  turners idea was that the united states had been blessed by geographic good fortune  the seemingly infinite west would solve the problems that arose whenever too many people were jammed into too small a space  the frontier  in grandins summary  would reduce racism to a remnant and leave it behind as residue  it would dilute other social problems as well  including poverty  inequality and extremism  teaching diverse people how to live together in peace it was a pretty picture and a profoundly optimistic one  the frontier  turner declared  was a magic fountain of youth in which america continually bathed and was rejuvenated  grandin deepens and enriches that picture  though turner depicted the frontier as a place where individualism sprouted from the land like prairie weeds  in grandins summary  that got the story backward  the reality  grandin argues  was that the state preceded the frontier  before the settlers arrived  the government had bought the land and surveyed it and built roads across it  above all  the united states army removed native americans and mexicans from the settlers way  in brutal and deadly fashion but this is a measured  careful work  not a peoples history polemic  grandin is a fine explainer with a knack for pithy summary  turners frontier was a restrained place  more james stewart than john wayne  america was a nation founded on unparalleled freedom and unmatched unfreedom  the appeal of the frontier myth was that it took problems in the here and now and shifted them to the there and then grandin keeps his cool  he prefers the stiletto to the club  but he grows angrier as his history reaches the present day  the frontier was  ultimately  a mirage  he writes  because it promised a limitless world where all could benefit  all could rise and share in the earths riches  the wall  on the other hand  is a monument to disenchantment  a deafening shout that theres not enough to go around the wall stands as our new emblem  grandin writes  and it is a symbol of a nation that used to believe that it had escaped history  or at least strode atop history  but now finds itself trapped by history  disenchanted and bewildered  we have become  so grandin contends  a country that increasingly defines itself by what it hates .

 read the latest edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  brownsville  tex   homar veloz lives in south texas  but on the wrong side of the border wall  separated from the rest of the united states by a long line of vertical steel bars standing up to 18 feet high his house on the 1600 block of milpa verde is located in an odd swath of brownsville  tex   that runs between the border wall and the rio grande  a netherworld that is officially still america but which somehow got left on the mexican side of the wall visitors often get confused  including mr  velozs daughter  who was nervous the first time she visited the house  and reminded him that she hadnt brought her passport she said  dad  dont tell me were in mexico  he recalled  because shed gone past the fence one of his neighbors made a homemade billboard that she posted at the end of her driveway to make things clear  were part of america on long stretches of the southwest border  a clearly visible boundary separates the united states and mexico  in parts of southern california and in the arizona desert  it takes the shape of a wall running right along the line  with one country on each side but in south texas  things get fuzzy  the border there  by tradition and international treaty  is the rio grande  and no one has yet figured out how to build a border wall in the middle of a river  as a result  the fence that elsewhere would trace the southern edge of the united states can run  as it does in mr  velozs neighborhood  more than a mile north of the river that has created an oddly isolated zone of homes  ranchland  industrial sites and nature preserves that locals call a no mans land  between the barrier and the border  a place that dozens of texans call home president trumps border security plans call for miles of new border fencing in south texas  much of it in the rio grande valley  which has emerged as a key corridor for unauthorized migration into the united states  the border wall proposal has raised questions about cost and effectiveness across the country  but one of the biggest issues here in texas is the way the plan would significantly add to the buffer zone  a bizarre region that has amused  angered and isolated the people who live and work there it was a bunch of yo yos up in d c   said cuban a  monsees jr   71  who lives north of the fence  not far from mr  veloz  but owns more than four acres on the south side  it should be closer to the river  no  1  mr  monsees said of the fence  where it should have been was within 150 feet of the river bank  rather than  in some cases  a mile and a half away this netherworld between the end of mexico and the visible beginning of the united states is a subtly off kilter place unlike any other in america residents  property owners and ranch hands in south texas gain access through dozens of openings and gates  in many cases by punching in secret access codes on a keypad  one household south of the fence in brownsville put its mailbox on the north side  presumably to make life easier for the letter carrier the pace is slow  the property cheap  mr  veloz rents his house for  350 a month  another resident doesnt have a mailbox because the mail never comes  and burns his trash because the refuse collector never shows up the fencing that created the netherworld went up during the george w  bush administration  but limitations on where the fence could be constructed are much older a treaty signed by the united states and mexico in 1970  and later ratified under president richard nixon  to resolve some boundary disputes also prohibits construction of anything that would obstruct the normal flow of the rio grande  it applies not only to the rivers main channel  but also adjacent lands  hence the decision to keep the fencing well clear of the river the fencing was intended to help keep out drug smugglers and unauthorized migrants  but in some ways it has complicated the trump administrations attempts to halt the waves of migrant families from central america who have been crossing the border recently  those who cross in the rio grande valley do not have to breach a border wall to claim asylum  because they reach united states soil and gain that right as soon as they have crossed the river  so for them  the situation is no different than it would be if there were no wall or fence at all a number of legal battles have broken out between the trump administration and property owners along the river  over the governments plans for additional barriers north of the river that would cut off and fragment ranches  nature centers and historical landmarks life on the south side of the bush era fence has been difficult for the nonprofit nature conservancy  it owns the southmost preserve near brownsville  a nesting habitat for rare birds and the site of one of the last two large stands of native sabal palm trees in the country  most of the preserve  831 of its 1 014 acres  is south of the fence at one time  a preserve manager lived in a house on the site  and many donors and researchers visited or even stayed overnight  but after the wall was built in 2009  slicing through the preserve  the live in manager was moved out for safety reasons  and visits by donors and researchers dwindled  there have also been negative ecological impacts  including disruptions to the free movement of ocelots  an endangered species the federal government initially offered the nature conservancy roughly  100 000 for a right of way through the preserve  but the group sued and was awarded nearly  1 million  less than one third of the  3 1 million it spent to purchase the preserve visitation in general is not what it was  said laura huffman  the nature conservancys state director  its changed the story about the preserve  one hundred percent of the time now the conversation about southmost preserve is not about sabal palms and habitat protection for the ocelot  its about a border wall  and thats not our conservation work in some ways  this region is not unlike other rural parts of texas  there are vast  carefully maintained fields of corn and sugar cane  horse stalls  dirt roads  power lines and tail swishing cattle  there are radio towers and quaint ponds and houses with swimming pools and unleashed dogs chasing passing vehicles brownsville officials say mr  veloz and his neighbors on milpa verde are provided the same municipal services as any other residents our response times are not affected  said jarrett sheldon  chief of the brownsville fire department  people on the other side of the wall  theyre going to get the same response residents south of the fence dont need to rely solely on brownsville emergency responders for their security  in any case  they live in one of the most heavily patrolled communities in the country  border patrol agents come through regularly in vehicles and helicopters  along with sheriffs deputies  constables and state troopers  cameras are mounted high atop the fence  many of them aimed at the openings and gates  and residents have long grown accustomed to being photographed and filmed as they travel to and from their homes mr  veloz said it all makes him feel safer  migrants and smugglers are a common sight  years ago  he said  people used to knock on his door at night  i wouldnt answer  he said  because i dont know what their intentions are being texans  though  many of the people who live between the fence and the river say they dont count exclusively on the government to keep them safe  one recent afternoon  a retired refrigerator repairman wearing camouflage clothing strolled south of the wall with a handgun in a holster on his hip  mr  monsees was even more heavily armed as he spoke outside his home while sitting in his pickup truck this is a single shot  410  and thats a single shot  22  and i keep the pistol between the seats  he said in another buffer zone community along the river about 50 miles northwest of brownsville  on a muddy dirt road outside the town of donna  arturo munoz  72  sat in the carport of his house just south of the border fence  sipping a bud light  his dog max lay at his feet its just about the same as on the north side  said mr  munoz  a retired welder and vietnam veteran  though he conceded that he has no mail service  no landline telephone and no cable television he said he bought the property nearly 15 years ago because he grew up nearby and feels a connection to the area  when it came time to build the border fence  he said  the government made him an offer he could refuse  and he did  he stayed put  and the wall went up just north of his white brick home  right behind a line of trees in his back yard its a lot safer than in town  he said  i lived in town  i was renting  and got broke into three times he described riding his bicycle near his house one day and seeing a few migrants walking along  he said he waved to them and pedaled on  they had crossed the river on their journey to america  and had found it  sort of .
washington  president trump criticized mexico  el salvador  guatemala and honduras on thursday for accepting monetary aid from the united states but doing nothing in return  a day after his homeland security secretary struck what she described as a historic agreement with three of those same countries to help strengthen security on the united states southwestern border mr  trump also threatened to close the border  a move he has previously considered  which would have a significant economic impact by disrupting the flow of trade and labor homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen met on tuesday with mexican officials in miami and on wednesday  with central american officials in tegucigalpa  honduras  to discuss the humanitarian crisis and what the trump administration considers a security emergency at the united states mexico border im pleased to announce the u s    our northern triangle allies have reached a historic agreement to confront the root causes of the crisis on our border  ms  nielsen said on twitter on wednesday  working with central american govts to increase security   prosperity in the region has been one of my greatest priorities the countries agreed to continue having conversations about ways to counter human trafficking  smuggling  organized crime and gangs  and to improve border security throughout the region mexicos president  andrs manuel lpez obrador  said on thursday that his country was in constant communication with the united states and would maintain a very respectful relationship with its neighbor it was not immediately clear what caused mr  trumps outrage early thursday  and later he wrote that mexico  with the strongest immigration laws in the world  refuses to help with illegal immigration   drugs  the remarks came on the heels of house democrats refusal to sign off on a defense department request to redirect funds to be used to help build the presidents border wall instead of focusing on readiness  hurricane recovery and other genuine issues  the administration continues to spend billions of dollars on an imaginary crisis  representative adam smith of washington  the chairman of the house armed services committee  said in a statement on tuesday the trump administration has long described the situation at the border as a national security emergency  but democrats have disputed that characterization the acting defense secretary  patrick m  shanahan  said on wednesday that despite the objection from lawmakers  the pentagon would move forward with the plan to reprogram funds to be used for the border wall in february  mr  trump declared a national emergency on the southern border  providing for military funds to be shifted to help build the wall  the decision provoked outrage from democratic and republican lawmakers over the constitutional separation of powers  the president vetoed a resolution to block his declaration  and on tuesday the house failed to overturn that veto defense department officials have said they do not need congressional approval to divert funds and use them for the wall .
washington  the house on tuesday failed to overturn president trumps first veto  leaving the declaration of a national emergency at the southwestern border intact despite the bipartisan passage of a resolution attempting to nullify the presidents circumvention of congress to fund his border wall despite concerns about the constitutional separation of powers and the effect of mr  trumps move on local military projects  the 248 to 181 vote fell short of the two thirds majority needed to kill the national emergency declaration republicans in both chambers had joined democrats in passing the resolution disapproving his national emergency just weeks ago  voicing discomfort over the presidents intent to divert funding to the construction of a border wall without congressional approval  mr  trump  issuing the first veto of his administration  had called the resolution dangerous  reckless  and a vote against reality but only 14 republicans ultimately joined house democrats in voting to override the veto  one more than the 13 who voted for the resolution of disapproval a month ago   representative john katko  republican of new york  had said he would support the measure  but missed the earlier vote  mr  trump then thanked house republicans for sticking together  todays vote simply reaffirms congressional democrats are the party of open borders  drugs and crime  he wrote on twitter democrats had hoped that the publication of all the military construction projects that could see funding delays as mr  trump pursued wall money would sway their republican colleagues  they framed the vote around both lofty constitutional principles and parochial home district matters even when the legislative branch disagrees with the executive  we respect the office the president holds and its his right to veto legislation  said speaker nancy pelosi of california  speaking on the floor ahead of the vote but when those decisions violate the constitution  she added  then that must be stopped house republican leaders  however  derided the vote as political gamesmanship and a waste of time democratic lawmakers and aides say they have not ruled out the possibility of reintroducing the resolution in six months  and they could use other legislative options to block the presidents effort to take as much as  3 6 billion in military construction funds for the wall for now  the political fight over mr  trumps national emergency declaration shifts to the courts  where a number of states and organizations have joined lawsuits challenging the legal merits of the order  xavier becerra  californias attorney general  warned in a statement that the 20 states involved in legal action are ready to fight long and hard to stop his fabricated emergency in its tracks the judicial machinations will most likely prevent the president and pentagon officials from immediately tapping military funds for border wall construction  and the defense department has yet to prepare a final list of what projects could have funding delays  it is unclear when the list will be available in the interim  the pentagon has taken the first steps to begin diverting money from other defense department funds toward constructing fencing at the border  on monday  patrick m  shanahan  the acting defense secretary  authorized the transfer of up to  1 billion from military personnel funding toward the construction of 57 miles of border fencing  improving roads and adding lighting in yuma  ariz   and el paso  according to a letter sent to the department of homeland security military officials have said that they do not need congressional approval for such an action  but across capitol hill on tuesday  lawmakers pressed pentagon officials about the potential effect on military construction and the merits of a wall at the southwestern border to look at the pentagon as a piggy bank  slush fund  where you can grab money for something when you need it really undermines the credibility of the entire d o d  budget  said representative adam smith of washington  the chairman of the house armed services committee at a hearing on tuesday  mr  smith warned mr  shanahan and general joseph f  dunford jr   the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff  that congress would respond to the reallocation of funds without congressional approval by curtailing the privilege of such reallocations in the spending bills for the next fiscal year mr  shanahan  testifying before the committee for the first time as acting head of the defense department  acknowledged the complexities of the southwest border situation and said officials understood significant downsides of losing what amounts to a privilege those risks were weighed  and given the legal order from the commander in chief  mr  shanahan said  we are executing on that order in a senate armed services committee hearing  senator gary peters  democrat of michigan  also pressed army officials on whether readiness and modernization should be prioritized over security at the southwestern border it is not for me to say one is more important than the other relative to the whole national security of the united states  said gen  mark a  milley  the army chief of staff .

washington  as new polls released on wednesday showed that a majority of americans had cooled to the idea of a protracted government shutdown over his long promised border wall  president trump woke up with the same two options facing him as the past 33 days  he could fight back or concede or maybe he could try rhyming build a wall   crime will fall  mr  trump wrote in his daily morning twitter address  this is the new theme  for two years until the wall is finished  under construction now   of the republican party  use it and pray two minutes later  mr  trump tweeted the rhyme again for emphasis mr  trump  a born marketing machine  brought to the white house a history of selling americans everything from steaks to questionable real estate credentials to the catchphrase youre fired  and his red and white make america great again hat is instantly associated with mr  trump  an accessory that  as americans were reminded last weekend  draws controversy like a laser beam when mr  trump fires off a tweet  the president gets visibly excited when he comes up with a message he believes will go over well with his base  he peers over his phone with a watch this expression  according to two people who have observed such a process the wall rhyme appears to fit into that same bulls eye category  the white house press office did not respond to a request for comment about the origin of mr  trumps latest catch phrase on wednesday  but a senior aide to the president said that mr  trump came up with it himself  and credited the new slogan to his marketing genius there are a few hitches  mr  trumps rhyming sales pitch that a border wall will reduce crime is not credible  and the facts he uses to bolster his claims are often correctable first  despite the presidents repeated claims  construction has not yet started on the border wall  the under construction now in his morning tweet needs more context  customs and border protection has begun or completed several projects to replace old fencing with new barriers  but no additional miles of wall have been added yet  construction to build a new levee wall system in texas is scheduled to begin in february  the first extension of existing barriers second  mr  trumps rhyme that a wall will lead to falling crime rates may be catchy  but its at odds with what data shows about the influence immigration has on crime law enforcement agencies rarely release crime data that includes immigration status  but several studies have found that immigration does not lead to an increase in crime  others have shown that immigrants  including those who are undocumented  are less likely to commit crimes than native born americans also  a border wall would not suddenly alter the population of undocumented immigrants already in the country  as the president suggests  most of them are here because they overstayed temporary visas  not because they crossed the border illegally the statistics mr  trump often uses to portray a criminal threat are also misleading  he has pointed to 17 000 criminals caught trying to cross the border  omitting the fact that a majority were stopped at legal ports of entry  not wall less areas of the border  he has recounted that officials have made 260 000 some arrests of immigrants with criminal records in the last two years  though the charges included a range of crimes  many nonviolent like traffic violations or illegal entry he has also issued baseless warnings of terrorists infiltrating the border  despite state department and counterterrorism officials saying there is no credible threat mr  trump  known to be more concerned with the broad contours of his messaging than the particulars  continued to push his new slogan on wednesday  targeting a segment on msnbc that showed immigrants slipping across the border into the united states from mexico even trump haters like  ms nbc acknowledge you build a wall   crime will fall  mr  trump wrote  his delight undimmed by his new rhyme .

president trumps greatest hurdle in persuading americans that there is a national security crisis on the southwest border may well be his own credibility mr  trump is using a rare currency  a prime time address to the nation  to make the case for a border wall with mexico  an issue that has forced a partial shutdown of the federal government his penchant for superlatives  the best  the worst  never  always  and now  crisis  and his record of falsehoods  misstatements and exaggerations on the topic will likely be challenged as never before here is what to watch for and some of the larger issues the president faces mr  trump will deliver his speech at 9 p m  eastern time  it will be aired by major broadcast and cable news networks and streamed live at www nytimes com mr  trump could try to circumvent congress by declaring a national emergency to order that the wall be built  but administration officials who had seen a draft copy of his speech said the president was not preparing to do so this would be an extraordinary use of presidential authority  for example  president george w  bush invoked emergency powers following the sept  11 attacks the rationale for the emergency power is to give the president the capacity to act quickly to deal with matters like an urgent security threat there are currently 31 national emergencies that are ongoing  the oldest dates back to 1979  when president jimmy carter invoked one to freeze iranian government assets  the trump administration has issued three emergency declarations so far  most recently in late november freezing the property of certain nicaraguan officials saying a situation is a crisis does not make it so  but mr  trump and other senior administration officials have been using the word repeatedly in recent days  they point to a direct connection between the flow of drugs from mexico and the opioid epidemic in the united states  they say that migrants  particularly women and children  are victims of crime as they journey to the united states  and mr  trump has also strongly suggested that terrorists may be slipping across the border these threats are greatly exaggerated  if not fabricated  migrant border crossings have been declining for nearly two decades  the majority of heroin enters the united states through legal ports of entry  not through open areas of the border  immigrants are less likely to commit crimes in the united states than native born americans  the state department said in a recent report that there is no credible evidence that terrorist groups had sent operatives to enter the united states through mexico despite all of this  mr  trump could repeat some of these statistics  which other administration officials have cited misleadingly of the nearly 17 000 criminals attempting to cross the border  a number used by officials recently  about 63 percent were stopped while attempting to enter legal ports of entry of the 10 individuals on the terrorist watch list stopped daily by the department of homeland security  most were attempting to enter by air travel  and the watch list itself includes people who are suspected of having ties to terrorism  not necessarily those convicted of terrorism crimes and the more than 3 000 special interest aliens who have been stopped at the southwest border refers to people who come from countries that have exported terrorism or who exhibit travel patterns that indicate a possible nexus to nefarious activity  according to the department of homeland security  a recent analysis from the libertarian cato institute found that of 45 000 special interest aliens caught at the border since 2007  none has committed terrorist attacks so far  democrats have been highly unified in their opposition to mr  trumps wall proposal  speaker nancy pelosi of california has called it immoral  instead  democrats have demanded that the president immediately end the shutdown and allow congress to pass funding legislation to keep the government functioning  only then will they allow a debate on border security after television networks agreed to air the presidents speech  ms  pelosi and senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  demanded that their side be given time to further dramatize his case for a border wall  mr  trump is set to head to texas border with mexico on thursday according to the monitor of mcallen  tex   the presidents trip would come about a month before border wall construction in the area would begin  relying on previously appropriated funding  the construction could affect several environmentally sensitive areas  representative vicente gonzalez  democrat of texas  told the newspaper that a border wall was not the answer i would remind the president that there are 7 500 open positions with customs and border protection that have not been filled  and that this should be their top priority  mr  gonzalez said in a statement monday  with updated resources  technology and more border patrol agents  customs officers and agriculture inspectors  we can keep this nation prosperous and protect our citizens from those who wish to harm us  he said the crime rate in the city of mcallen has been generally in decline for nearly 30 years .
calexico  calif   president trump traveled to this small border town two hours east of san diego on friday to highlight what he and his aides say is an out of control crisis caused by a surge of central american families who have overwhelmed law enforcement facilities at the border just a day after retreating from his threat to shut down the entire border with mexico  mr  trump accepted a plaque from border agents and sheriffs in front of a 30 foot tall section of border wall  the physical embodiment of his immigration agenda  and met with border officials  lawmakers and administration officials at the border patrol station here were really making progress at letting people know this is an emergency  the president said  its a colossal surge and its overwhelming our immigration system and we cant let that happen critics argue that the wall is not a solution to the surge of families that have arrived in recent months since most of the families are not trying to sneak into the country undetected  on the contrary  most are seeking border patrol agents to turn themselves in  either at the ports of entry or between them but mr  trump insisted on friday that his efforts to seal off the border from undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers was necessary because we dont have room  that means you cant take em i dont think anyone has ever expressed it like that but i am expressing it like that  mr  trump added  when its full  its full asked on thursday night why the president was not using the national emergency he recently declared to seek funds to provide humanitarian relief to the families who have been apprehended recently  kirstjen nielsen  the secretary of homeland security  conceded that the focus on the wall is  partly  a stunt well  i think part of that is just a  its an optic  she told chris cuomo  the host of cuomo prime time on cnn  to have the president stand in front of the wall indicates immediately to any viewer that hes at the border  but i think his message will be about the dual crisis and how we need congress to act  to give us the authorities to address mr  trump  however  hailed what he called the tremendous impact of the wall in calexico and said that his administration expected to build 400 miles worth of wall in the next two years in fact  the small section of wall that mr  trump stood in front of  next to a field of solar panels  is not evidence that the president is building the wall he repeatedly called for during his 2016 presidential campaign but merely an upgrade to an existing section of fencing  the two mile section was completed in october  sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  weeks after declaring a national emergency at the border because congress refused to fund construction of his border wall  mr  trump recently threatened to close the legal ports of entry between mexico and the united states  potentially disrupting billions of dollars worth of trade and halting the travel of a half million people each day but on the eve of his trip here  mr  trump backed down in the face of hard criticism from the business community and top officials in his own party  senator mitch mcconnell  the republican leader  predicted that a complete border shutdown would have a potentially catastrophic economic impact on the country mr  trump responded on thursday by initially saying he would give mexico a year to stop central american migrants from traversing mexico on their way to the united states  he added that if mexico did not do its part  he would first impose tariffs on mexican cars before shutting down the border later in the day  mr  trump denied that he had put off a border shutdown for a year  saying that it could still happen if he decided that mexico was not doing enough to keep migrants from traveling to the united states well start with the tariffs and see what happens  he said in his visit here  mr  trump thanked mexico for deporting migrants at its southern border  which he said they have never done before in three decades  and suggested he had delayed closing the border because of their heightened efforts but it is false that mexico only recently began enforcing its southern border at mr  trumps urging  according to data  experts and the mexican government  marcelo ebrard  mexicos foreign minister  told reporters on tuesday that mexico had been consistent in its immigration policies it deported 40 000 to 190 000 migrants every year from 2011 to 2016  data from segob  mexicos internal affairs agency  shows  in 2016  mexico deported nearly 150 000 migrants from honduras  el salvador and guatemala compared with 107 000 deportations of migrants from those three countries in 2018  in the first two months of 2019  mexico deported more than 13 000 migrants from the countries contrary to mr  trumps repeated claims this week  mexicos immigration laws are not harsher or stronger than the united states  illegal crossing are decriminalized in mexico and considered a minor offense  experts said they were not aware of any changes in the laws or enforcement practices on the contrary  the discourse of president lpez obrador has been more humanitarian than that of the former president  granting work permits and making efforts to find last minute shelters  said karla a  valenzuela  a professor at ibero american university in mexico city who specializes in migration dr  valenzuela said an uptick in detentions and removals in recent weeks was not necessarily indicative of intensified enforcement  but rather more linked to increased flows from central america meanwhile  the presidents re election campaign released a video on friday blasting democrats for their position on the border  a clear indication that mr  trump intends to use the issue of border security for his political benefit  no matter the facts on the ground the video shows leading democratic presidential candidates  including beto orourke  senator kamala harris and senator elizabeth warren  mocking the idea of a wall at the border we do not need any walls  mr  orourke is shown saying  the headline in the video says  bluntly  democrats do not want to keep americans safe and adds  its time for democrats to stop playing political games with national security a response from the democratic national committee assailed the presidents visit as nothing more than a photo opportunity to try and build nonexistent support for his unnecessary and ineffective border wall instead of doing anything to address the issues that matter most to the people of calexico  trump is actually making things worse  the committee said .

president trump reeled off a list of his favorite media personalities on friday when asked who might have influenced his decision to declare a national emergency after congress refused to give him money for a border wall sean hannity  rush limbaugh  tucker carlson and laura ingraham  a powerful bloc of conservative voices who have railed against any budget compromise on wall funding  all received shout outs in a rose garden news conference sean hannity has been a terrific  terrific supporter of what i do  mr  trump said of the fox news commentator he praised mr  limbaugh for his ability to command an audience  he can speak for three hours without a phone call  mr  trump said  try doing that sometime  for three hours he speaks  hes got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world  i mean  this guy is unbelievable the president added that none of the favorites he mentioned  most of whom work for fox news  drove his decisions  they dont decide policy  he said the question that got mr  trump to discuss his cable and radio cheering squad came from the nbc news reporter kelly odonnell  it seemed apt after what had occurred in december  when the presidency seemed perhaps more entwined than usual with prominent figures in conservative media at the time  mr  trump appeared willing to sign a continuing resolution to prevent a government shutdown  even without money for the wall  then a few of his most influential supporters  including mr  hannity and mr  limbaugh  lasered in on the lack of wall funding and pleaded with mr  trump to refuse to sign the bill  he did exactly that  leading to a 35 day shutdown  the longest in the governments history this week  as the deadline on the temporary spending measure that ended the shutdown loomed  the president was willing to go ahead with a newly proposed budget  even though it had less money for a border wall than was on the table at one point last year in contrast to december  mr  trump reached out to a synod of conservative commentators in an effort to assuage their concerns his administration talked with mr  hannity and lou dobbs  the fox business network host  the purpose was to politick the right wing media with the message that mr  trump deserved support for the new bill because he had forced concessions he also would declare a national emergency as a way to get around congress and provide dollars for the wall  a move conservatives championed were going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border  and were going to do it one way or the other  mr  trump said in the rose garden  its an invasion  we have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country but not everyone in the right wing punditocracy endorsed mr  trump  ann coulter  who was an early supporter of the president  has now become a thorn in his side in december  she published a blistering column on her website calling mr  trump a gigantic douchebag for not having made headway on a border wall  this week  as many anticipated mr  trumps willingness to approve the spending bill  she didnt let up  saying on twitter that the goal of the national emergency is for trump to scam the stupidest people in his base for 2 more years the president spoke of ms  coulter on friday  but not in the most glowing terms i dont know her  the president said friday   i havent spoken to her in way over a year  but the press loves saying ann coulter he continued  i have nothing against her  in fact  i like her for one reason  when they asked her  right at the beginning  who is going to win the election  she said  donald trump  and the two people that asked her that question smiled  they said  youre kidding  arent you  nope  donald trump  so i like her a few seconds later  he added  but shes off the reservation  but anybody who knows her understands that after the news conference  ms  coulter tweeted  he seems to think the reservation is him  not his campaign promises three minutes later  she posted another  this time about the constitutional provision allowing for the removal of a president from office  no  1 trending topic on twitter  25th amendment mr  trump also cued up one of his old anti press hits during the news conference  when jim acosta  the cnn reporter whose white house credentials he suspended late last year  asked about critics who say youre creating a national emergency in order to get your wall  the president was ready your question is a very political question  because you have an agenda  he said  youre cnn  youre fake news .
washington  president trump famously declared that in his administration the nation would become tired of all the winning  so on friday he tried a little losing after the longest government shutdown in history  mr  trump surrendered with nothing concrete  or steel  to show for the battle  taking essentially the same deal that was on the table in december that he originally rejected  touching off a 35 day impasse with senator mitch mcconnell on the telephone  rank and file republicans in revolt and televisions in the white house showing air traffic slowing in the northeast because of the shutdown  mr  trump bowed to the inevitable and agreed to reopen the government until feb  15 without the money for his border wall that he had demanded for a president who believes in zero sum politics and considers compromise a sign of weakness  it was a bruising setback  a retreat that underscored the limits of his ability to bull his way through the opposition in this new era of divided government  as it turned out  the art of the deal at this stage of mr  trumps presidency requires a different approach and the question is whether he can adjust by any measure  it was an unequivocal loss  said patrick j  griffin  who was the white house legislative director for president bill clinton during the government shutdowns of the 1990s  no interpretation is needed  no wall and probably lost votes rather than gain or strengthen his base  some conservatives accused president trump of folding on a central promise  the next three weeks will test whether mr  trump can rebound as he faces a new deadline to come up with an agreement  if he can find common ground with democrats led by speaker nancy pelosi and senator chuck schumer while making progress on his wall  he may yet emerge from this searing ordeal claiming a political victory if not  however  he may discover his disgruntled fellow republicans on capitol hill less willing to go along with a renewed government shutdown  forcing him to decide whether to provoke a constitutional clash by declaring a national emergency to bypass congress altogether and build the wall without legislative approval white house officials argue that there are more moderate house democrats who are willing to support a wall even though ms  pelosi has called the project immoral and opposed spending even a single dollar on it  in the days to come  they hope to either peel off those democrats and force ms  pelosi to meet somewhere in the middle or to drive a wedge among democrats highlighting their own divisions moving forward for the next three weeks  have the democrats boxed themselves into a corner with zero for wall funding that makes them look weak on border security  asked marc short  who was mr  trumps white house legislative director earlier in his presidency  will the white house be able to work around pelosi to gain enough democrat support for some wall funding after watching ms  pelosi this week disinvite mr  trump from delivering the state of the union address while the government remained closed  mr  mcconnell concluded that she would never cave and decided to come off the sidelines to try to end the standoff  he scheduled votes for thursday on two plans to end the stalemate  one on mr  trumps terms and another democratic version  mainly to demonstrate to the president that he did not have enough support to prevail after both bills failed to muster the 60 votes required for passage on thursday  mr  trump was fed up and ready to get it over with  according to advisers  he was eager to get the dispute resolved at least temporarily so he could deliver his state of the union address  he told vice president mike pence and jared kushner  his son in law and senior adviser  to give him options they came back with four ways to reopen the government  a three week spending bill that included a prorated portion of money as a down payment on the border wall pending further negotiations  a clean short term spending bill that included no such money  a clean short term bill with a bipartisan house senate conference committee to negotiate border security  or a declaration of national emergency that mr  trump would use to move money on his own while resuming government operations for the rest of the fiscal year mr  mcconnell met with mr  schumer and raised the idea of a down payment  but the democrat rejected it  mr  schumer then suggested a short term spending bill with a conference committee to negotiate  mr  mcconnell let the white house know that mr  schumer would sign onto that as late as friday morning  though  mr  trump appeared set to make an emergency declaration  but when he spoke with mr  mcconnell again  the senator and mr  kushner argued against it  mr  trump backed off and agreed to the short term reopening without wall money  telling aides that he knew it would result in a bad news cycle for several days  but that it was the right thing to do and would eventually yield a long term victory his resolve to change the subject was fortified as he watched television on friday morning to see his associate roger j  stone jr  marched off to court by heavily armed f b i  agents arresting him in connection with the special counsels russia investigation  the icing on the cake  as one official put it  were reports about air traffic out of la guardia airport in the presidents hometown and elsewhere in the region slowing because of the government shutdown the president scheduled an announcement  and the scene in the rose garden was surreal  cabinet officers and white house aides lined up and applauded when the president emerged from the oval office as if he were declaring victory in his confrontation with democrats in congress  and the president sounded as if he was doing just that  opening his remarks by saying that he was very proud to announce today that we have reached a deal to end the shutdown only there was no deal  just a retreat  the president who said he would never reopen the government unless he secured money for his border wall agreed to reopen the government without money for his border wall supporters of a wall were hardly fooled  excoriating mr  trump for giving in  good news for george herbert walker bush  as of today  he is no longer the biggest wimp ever to serve as president of the united states  ann coulter  the conservative commentator who prodded mr  trump to take a firmer stand in december  wrote on twitter breitbart news  the conservative news site once run by stephen k  bannon  the presidents former senior adviser  made clear the disappointment among mr  trumps base with its banner headline  government open     and border  no wall  so did the daily caller  another leading voice on the right  trump caves  and the washington examiner agreed  trump blinks democrats were not exactly gracious in victory  barely containing their delight  hopefully  it means a lesson has been learned  shutting down government over a policy difference is self defeating  tut tutted mr  schumer  it accomplishes nothing but pain and suffering for the country and the american people by late in the day  a defensive mr  trump was insisting it was not a defeat  i wish people would read or listen to my words on the border wall  he tweeted  this was in no way a concession  it was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days  if no deal is done  its off to the races until now  of course  he had expressed little if any concern for those hurt by the shutdown  insisting instead that many of the 800 000 who went without pay for five weeks were on his side and wanted him to stand strong  whether this episode prompts mr  trump to change his approach to governing  it has altered the politics of shutdowns leaving federal workers caught in the middle the great irony is that the shutdown only proved the indispensable value of the very government trump so often expresses such disdain for  said paul bledsoe  a former clinton white house aide who is now the strategic adviser at the progressive policy institute  a center left

some of the most prominent voices in the conservative base were furious at president trump on friday after he agreed to reopen the government without getting money for a border wall  the sort of terms he had spent more than a month rejecting  they derided the deal as a capitulation by a leader who they had trusted to stand firm among those leading the charge was the conservative author ann coulter  one of mr  trumps earliest and firmest supporters  she told the times columnist frank bruni last year that implementing the principles of the communist manifesto would be less of a betrayal by mr  trump than retreating on the wall  one of his central campaign promises  some on the right picked up on that theme of betrayal on friday much of the criticism centered on toughness and steadiness  two qualities that mr  trump has long bragged about having  weak  wimp  beta  these insults were hurled at the president from the right on friday peter wehner  a senior fellow at the conservative ethics and public policy center who worked for presidents ronald reagan  george bush and george w  bush  wrote that house speaker nancy pelosi had exposed mr  trump as pitifully weak  all bluster  a pathetic negotiator  and that his backing down would undoubtedly hurt the president with his base   mr  wehner himself  who is also a contributing opinion writer for the times  has long been critical of mr  trump  the breitbart news home page friday afternoon blared  with no wall in bright red letters the daily caller  another right wing news outlet  declared in its own headline  trump caves fox news presented the news very differently  deal reached  its home page said  reporting that mr  trump and democrats had come to an agreement this reflects a broader divide between two segments of mr  trumps base  those  like ms  coulter  for whom a border wall is a major priority  and those who see trumpism as something much larger  for the latter group  fridays announcement seemed a forgivable offense then there was a third group  those who are staunchly committed to the wall and argued that mr  trumps move on friday was actually strategic i am more proud of president trump today than i have ever been  wrote bill mitchell  an outspoken trump supporter  arguing that the president had essentially guaranteed victory by vowing to declare a national emergency if democrats do not fund the wall within three weeks the fox news host sean hannity made a similar argument on his radio show  no  he said  mr  trump didnt get any money for the wall in this deal  but hes going to .
london  two very different presidents  donald j  trump and emmanuel macron of france  are each pursuing a time tested strategy for leaders trying to push through a major policy change  marshaling a sense of crisis for mr  trump  claims of mayhem at the border  which far exceed the reality there  are meant to draw support for a border wall  for mr  macron  the very real threat of climate change is meant to compel economic policy shifts  including new taxes each is arguing that existential stakes demand drastic action  with mr  trump threatening to declare a national emergency  which would grant him extraordinary powers  and each is attempting to rally his countrys voters and policymakers around a common mission but each faces disappointment  mr  trump  three weeks into a government shutdown  so far has neither sufficient public nor congressional support for a border wall  mr  macrons agenda has been derailed by mass protests their setbacks illuminate when a sense of crisis does or doesnt take hold  and when leaders can and cant exploit that to get their way time and again  in democracies and nondemocracies around the world  voters and government officials have shown that they will support drastic actions  and defer more readily to their leaders  during crises power hungry leaders have long exploited crises  real or engineered  to justify seizing control  president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey used a failed coup against him  in 2016  to justify sweeping political purges it is not always about grabbing power  leaders often use crises to promote policies that they see as necessary but that voters might otherwise not support you never want a serious crisis to go to waste  rahm emanuel  president barack obamas chief of staff  said in 2008  referring to mr  obamas proposals for stricter regulations in response to the financial crisis  this crisis provides the opportunity for us  he said  to do things that you could not before there is  of course  no central authority or accepted checklist for determining when a crisis is real  and severe enough to merit drastic action  its a matter of subjective public perception  but there is growing research into what leads people to support drastic steps from their leaders take mr  trumps push for a border wall  whatever his intentions  to win the wall  to rally the base  to distract from setbacks or merely out of impulse  during his election campaign  and again during the midterm elections  he has hit squarely on two psychological triggers that can make people want a strong leader to take control the first is a sense of demographic and cultural change  particularly when that change feels uncontrolled  among some white americans  the growing prominence of minority groups in politics and popular culture has created a sense of demographic threat  according to researchers  leading those voters to desire a strong leader who would impose control mr  trump used warnings about unauthorized immigration to cultivate a sense of crisis  though unauthorized immigration has been declining for a decade  and the migrants traveling to make asylum applications are exercising a basic legal right   that hit on those fears  and he used promises of a border wall to reassure frightened voters that he would protect them the second trigger is fear of a specific kind of violence  people feel a sense of acute crisis if they believe that they may be attacked for their membership in a demographic group  such as race or religion  according to research by daphna canetti nisim  a university of maryland political psychologist  they become more supportive of harsh policies to control outsiders  such as torture or extrajudicial detention  and more supportive of a strong leader who will go outside the law mr  trump tapped into this as well  warning that hispanic and muslim migrants posed a grave danger  though the threat was almost entirely invented  in britain  proponents of withdrawal from the european union  or brexit  followed a similar playbook meanwhile  mr  macron has struggled to find an audience for his warnings about climate change  that threat is perilously real  but it is also abstract and impersonal  it does not target individuals based on their identities or hit other triggers that make something feel like a crisis  so french voters  far from mobilizing behind mr  macrons priorities  have protested against economic challenges that feel more immediate mr  trumps case for a border wall may have cultivated a sense of urgent crisis among his supporters  helping his unlikely presidential bid succeed  but there was another audience he never quite captured  the policymaking and government elites who control the levers of power in a strong democracy  leaders need both voters and elites to radically change the national agenda  the sept  11 attacks  for instance  created a sense of crisis among regular americans as well as policymakers in both parties  allowing president george w  bush to make sweeping changes in domestic and foreign policy but elites and voters perceive crises very differently  mr  trump has yet to win enough support from congressional republicans  much less from within the policymaking bureaucracy  to build his wall  elites who otherwise supported the president were not as moved by his tales of dangerous foreigners typically  when voters see something as a crisis but elites do not  the result is gridlock  as mr  trump found with plans for his wall  in weaker democracies  this sometimes tempts leaders to push elites and institutions like the courts aside  denouncing them as hurdles to popular will  it s why dictators love crises  the democracy scholars steven levitsky and daniel ziblatt have written  as an excuse to grab power  often to cheers from their supporters sometimes leaders face the inverse problem  particularly with slow moving crises like climate change that might worry elites more than voters mr  obama was able to rally international leaders behind a global climate agreement in 2015  no small task  but struggled to pass legislation on the issue at home  mr  macron  likewise  has had more success with fellow european leaders than with his own voters convincing voters to trust elites on what constitutes a crisis has not always been a such a challenge  voters once tended to defer on complicated policy issues to trusted leaders or their preferred political party  according to research by elizabeth n  saunders of georgetown university during the cold war  for instance  governing elites in western europe considered the threat from the soviet union a major crisis  pushing through sweeping changes to military and foreign policy  european voters were more concerned with day to day economic issues  generally leaving their leaders to conduct foreign policy as they wished but  in recent years  public trust in establishment elites has broken down across the west  voters are more skeptical of the elites priorities some in france  not totally without reason  see mr  macrons climate change agenda as a smoke screen for plans to shred the social safety net  in britain  many voters shrugged off elites who told them that brexit would bring disaster  and in the united states  some republican voters came to believe that their partys establishment was selling them out that widening mismatch in priorities between elites and voters has provided an opening for populist leaders  by telling voters that elites are ignoring the real crisis  populists can portray the establishment as part of the threat  justifying drastic action like mr  trumps threatened declaration of emergency these breakdowns can bring their own sorts of crises  real ones in france  weeks of violent protests by the yellow vest movement have brought political uncertainty and in the united states  many migrants and refugees are trapped in detention facilities or at the border  hundreds of thousands of federal employees are going without paychecks for the families broken apart or going without pay  there is little doubt that this is a crisis  but as long as many americans and their leaders do not consider it an emergency  little appears likely to change .
washington  outraged house republicans sued president barack obama in 2014 for spending billions of federal dollars without congressional approval  and won  now many house and senate republicans could side with president trump for doing what they saw as a grave abuse of power by mr  obama  circumventing an unwilling congress in a spending dispute the power of the purse is paramount for congress  the constitutional edict that no money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law gives congress the upper hand over the executive branch when it comes to how federal funds are allocated and disbursed  the president can veto spending bills if he is dissatisfied  but is not supposed to rewrite them or defy congress and spend money in ways it did not approve many in both parties now say that the presidential decision to act unilaterally and fund construction for a border wall via an emergency declaration would establish a dangerous new model  encouraging presidents thwarted by congress to simply cite such a crisis to spend dollars however and wherever they pleased we have a crisis at our southern border  but no crisis justifies violating the constitution  said senator marco rubio  republican of florida accepting the declaration would represent another weakening of the authority of congress in a steady ceding of power to the executive branch  a trend that republicans have said they want to reverse and that they railed against when mr  obama used executive orders to act on issues such as immigration and health care as ive said many times  i have concerns about the precedent that could be set with the use of emergency action to re appropriate funds  said senator charles e  grassley of iowa  the senior republican in the senate many other republicans expressed similar reservations  but senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  who had suggested misgivings of his own  said he would back mr  trumps emergency declaration  as did others who said the president had no other option given the bipartisan spending compromise that denied him money for his coveted wall from day 1  president trump has made it clear hes ready to address the crisis at the southern border  whether or not congress works with him  said senator kevin cramer  a newly elected republican from north dakota  while democratic leadership has refused to tackle this issue  i stand with president trump in favor of funding border security as we head into budget talks for the upcoming fiscal year that willingness to stand with the president at the expense of their own institution underscores that the border wall remains a powerful symbol with republican voters and suggests republicans would rather risk a troubling precedent than run afoul of mr  trump  who made the wall his signature campaign promise in 2016  and his constituency  it also shows how deeply lawmakers wanted to avoid another calamitous shutdown but republicans also fear that once mr  trump takes the emergency route  future democratic presidents will follow suit and declare an emergency to deal with issues dear to their hearts  be it climate change  gun safety  immigration or health care  republicans wont be left with much room to complain should that happen speaker nancy pelosi said as much as she warned republicans of the dangers of the presidents plan im not advocating for any president doing an end run around congress  she said  im just saying that the republicans should have some dismay about the door that they are opening  the threshold they are crossing ms  pelosi has a point  in the ever escalating partisan fights in congress  the party that considers itself wronged by raw exercise of power typically seeks quick revenge when it has the opportunity to do so  cases in point  the decision by democrats in 2013 to eliminate the 60 vote threshold for filibusters on most nominations  the republican blockade in 2016 against judge merrick b  garlands nomination to the supreme court and the elimination in 2017 by republicans of the 60 vote threshold on supreme court nominations in the republican case against the obama administrations spending  a lawsuit initiated by john a  boehner  the speaker at the time  claimed that the executive branch was spending more than  130 billion in subsidies under the affordable care act that congress had never agreed to spend  in a surprising decision in 2015  judge rosemary m  collyer of federal district court in washington sided with republicans and said that if the house could not sue to protect its appropriations power  it was in big trouble the house of representatives as an institution would suffer a concrete  particularized injury if the executive were able to draw funds from the treasury without a valid appropriation  she wrote in her ruling  the case was later essentially made moot when mr  trump took over from mr  obama  but the ruling against the white house stood the border wall case is somewhat different because the white house is using its declaration of an emergency as a justification for steering federal dollars to the wall against the wishes of congress  but democrats and some republicans insist there is no emergency in the sense that the law was intended to cover  they say such action by the president would be an unmistakable defiance of congress  which made its views evident in the spending legislation that did not provide the authority for the president to build the wall he wants congressional intent on this issue is very clear  said senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  the presidents wall has been before congress several times and has never garnered enough votes to even merit consideration  for the president to declare an emergency now would be an unprecedented subversion of congresss constitutional prerogative like the health care dispute  the emergency declaration is virtually certain to end up in court and also be challenged in congress the presidents actions left many apprehensive about its future implications  particularly members of the appropriations committee i clearly have concerns about the idea that he can use an emergency declaration for this set of circumstances  said senator roy blunt  republican of missouri  but lets see what happens and how they do it for the president to repurpose unilaterally billions of dollars that have been appropriated by congress for specific needs undermines the role of congress and is of dubious constitutionality  said senator susan collins  republican of maine the president sees the emergency declaration as a way to get his way over a resistant congress  but to many on capitol hill  it is the declaration itself that could become the emergency .
washington  president trump said on monday that he has rejected a proposal by senator lindsey graham of south carolina to temporarily reopen the government in an effort to jump start talks with democratic lawmakers on funding a border wall i did reject it  mr  trump said of the proposal  speaking to reporters as he boarded marine one outside of the white house  en route to delivering a speech to a farm convention in new orleans in an appearance on fox news sunday  mr  graham  a close ally of the president  pitched mr  trump on a plan for the president to agree to a vote by congress to reopen the government for about three weeks before he pulls the plug on the legislative option  if there was no progress made during that time  mr  graham said  the president could then declare a national emergency as a way to obtain funding for a border wall without congressional action but mr  trump said that he did not want to extend the impasse over funding for the wall  it was not clear  however  what mr  trump saw as an alternative  im not looking to call a national emergency  he said on monday  this is so simple you shouldnt have to mr  trump  advisers said  has refused to allow his acting chief of staff  mick mulvaney  or anyone else negotiating on his behalf to compromise on his demand for  5 7 billion in border wall funding  that has led to awkward moments in front of congressional leaders in a meeting at the white house with lawmakers from both parties on jan  4  mr  trump castigated mr  mulvaney for proposing a compromise figure between mr  trumps desired  5 7 billion for a wall and the democrats offer of  1 3 billion for border security  as a way to end the shutdown using an expletive  the president blamed his acting chief of staff for messing up the negotiations  the salty exchange was first reported by axios mr  trump emerged on the south lawn on monday after spending a snowy weekend without leaving the white house grounds  it was a rare occurrence for a president who typically spends weekend afternoons during winter on his golf course in palm beach but mr  trumps physical presence in the capital has become one of the ways he has tried to demonstrate his willingness to negotiate with democrats on funding the wall  even as he has staked out an intractable position on the issue  it is a point of pride he has highlighted on twitter and in interviews  as he has become concerned about the perception that he is being outmaneuvered by speaker nancy pelosi  a veteran negotiator who even mr  trump has praised in the past i havent left the white house in months  mr  trump told jeanine pirro  the fox news host who is also a personal friend of the presidents  in a phone in interview on her show saturday night  in fact  mr  trump traveled to the texas border earlier in the week on monday  mr  trump again highlighted his physical presence in washington as a selling point  ive been here all weekend  mr  trump said  a lot of the democrats were in puerto rico celebrating something  i dont know  maybe theyre celebrating the shutdown while about 30 democratic lawmakers  most of whom are members of the congressional hispanic caucus  spent the weekend at an annual winter retreat in puerto rico  ms  pelosi spent the entire weekend in washington  a spokesman said mr  trump  advisers said  still believes he has the upper hand with democrats  but people in the white house have become increasingly concerned as the shutdown drags on and public opinion polls have shown that the majority of the country pins the blame on mr  trump about 53 percent of americans see mr  trump and the republicans as mainly at fault for the shutdown  according to a washington post abc news poll conducted between jan  8 and 11  only 29 percent blamed democrats in congress for the partial government shutdown that has left 800 000 federal employees working without pay  or furloughed adding to mr  trumps rigidity in the shutdown negotiations is the anticipation among white house officials that a report from the special counsel  robert s  mueller iii  could be delivered to the justice department in the coming weeks  mr  trump is agitated by the prospect of mr  muellers report  according to people who have spoken with him  even as advisers have tried to downplay what might be in it .
washington  as a partial government shutdown entered its third week  negotiations between vice president mike pence and congressional aides from both parties yielded little progress on saturday while the impact on government services and on federal workers was worsening by the day not much headway made today  president trump conceded on twitter  not long after the vice presidents office characterized the roughly two hour talks  held next to the white house at the eisenhower executive office building  as productive the two sides are scheduled to meet again sunday afternoon  but there was little hope that the broad divide between mr  trump and democrats over his demand for more than  5 billion for a border wall would be bridged anytime soon  saturdays talks came a day after mr  trump said the government shutdown could continue for months or even years if democrats did not relent on their steadfast refusal to grant him the wall money the negotiations on saturday focused on priorities for security rather than a dollar figure for the border wall  the vice presidents office said  while mr  trump has stood by his  5 7 billion demand  senate democrats have offered  1 3 billion for border security  including fencing  while speaker nancy pelosi and the top senate democrat  chuck schumer of new york  have repeatedly said that they will not agree to any wall funding  ms  pelosi has called a border wall an immorality the vice presidents office said that mr  pence had reiterated the presidents position that any deal needed to include funding for the wall  the office also said that democrats had requested additional information from the department of homeland security about its needs to deal with border issues democratic staff members asked for a formal budget justification for the administrations insistence on its  5 7 billion proposal  a democratic official familiar with the discussion said  adding that mr  pence made clear that the white house would not budge from that figure  the democrats told the vice president that there would be no movement on the dollar figure until after the government is reopened it is unclear just what kind of authority mr  trump has granted mr  pence to speak for him in negotiations  last month  when mr  pence made a  2 6 billion counteroffer to democrats in an effort to avert the shutdown  mr  trump quickly shot down the proposal during the talks on saturday  kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  offered a briefing on what the administration has deemed a crisis at the border  ms  nielsen had tried to give a similar briefing earlier in the week to congressional leaders and white house officials gathered in the situation room  but she was cut off by ms  pelosi  who questioned ms  nielsens facts in addition to ms  nielsen  the vice president was joined on saturday by mick mulvaney  the acting chief of staff  and jared kushner  a senior adviser to mr  trump  mr  kushner is said to have raised the prospect with democratic lawmakers that if they give the president the full  5 7 billion in wall funding or something close to it  they might in exchange get an agreement for new protections for the young immigrants known as dreamers  the prospect of such a deal has alarmed some conservatives for his part  the president seemed to be goading democrats with a morning tweet that implied that he was ready to talk with them at the white house  even though it was mr  trump who had announced on friday that the meeting would be at the staff level the president also repeated his claim that the bulk of federal workers who are going without pay are democrats  a claim rebuffed by federal union leaders  but said their political affiliation was not relevant to him  on friday  he had said that most federal workers supported his demand for a border wall and were willing to sacrifice their paychecks to achieve it as the shutdown reached its 14th day  the finances of government agencies continued to show signs of strain  on saturday  scott gottlieb  the commissioner of the food and drug administration  said the agency had about one months funding left for some of its activities there have also been a few new signs of fraying political fealty to the president among republicans  on friday  senator thom tillis  republican of north carolina  became the third member of his party in the senate to call for an end to the shutdown  joining senator cory gardner of colorado and senator susan collins of maine  all three are expected to face difficult re election battles in 2020 in an op ed article for the newspaper the hill published friday evening  mr  tillis encouraged congress to strike a deal that would provide long term certainty to the daca population  the dreamers brought to the united states as children  and force out the extreme elements on either side of the aisle when it comes to securing our borders  its important to note that the real solution is not going to be a big  literal physical wall  but rather an all the above  all hands on deck approach  he wrote  adding his support for solutions including physical barriers and steel fences the op ed came just a day after the campaign arm of the senate democrats released statements to local news media targeting republican senators up for re election in a move to keep pressure on the president and senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the republican leader  ms  pelosi announced saturday afternoon that house democrats would begin passing individual appropriations bills next week to reopen all government agencies  beginning with legislation that would reopen the internal revenue service this action is necessary so that the american people can receive their tax refunds on schedule  ms  pelosi said in a statement  the certainty of the tax returns of hard working families should no longer be held hostage to the president mr  mcconnell has largely stayed on the sidelines in the shutdown fight  saying that any solution must be reached between mr  trump and democrats  in an opinion column on friday  the courier journal of louisville  the largest newspaper in mr  mcconnells home state  called on him to get into the game and end a crisis that really doesnt need to be happening .
washington  it was a festive but awkward opening of the new congress newly sworn in members celebrated their electoral success surrounded by family  democrats cheered their returned speaker and republicans applauded their expanded majority in the senate but a substantial portion of the government that they oversee was closed  and the 800 000 federal workers who are not being paid lingered over the festivities on thursday  an unfortunate circumstance that dampened the usual pomp  adding to the tension was deep uncertainty about how to resolve the partial government shutdown that bridged the departing 115th congress and the incoming 116th the two parties seemed dug in  suggesting the shutdown would continue  a possibility that was underscored on friday by president trumps warning to congressional leaders that it could last months  even years  if democrats did not capitulate and provide money for a border wall each side is testing the others resolve at this point  said tom davis  the former house republican leader from virginia who came to the capitol to observe the start of the new congress  there are no guardrails previously  such guardrails included a desire by both parties to not be seen as irresponsibly shuttering government agencies that provide needed services to their constituents  or to not be viewed as so incapable of governing that they allow partisan  philosophical and funding differences to leave hundreds of thousands of government employees without paychecks i think we should be blunt about this  there is never an excuse for a shutdown of the government  said senator lamar alexander  republican of tennessee  there is never an excuse even for a partial shutdown of the government but part of the government was definitely shut down  and the impasse seemed different from the partisan funding fights of the clinton and obama eras  both sides claimed to want to end the stalemate  but there were no signs of frantic talks about trying to find a resolution and reopen agencies as quickly as possible  democrats and republicans traded not proposals and counterproposals  but instead lodged accusations about who was responsible and recriminations over competing legislative approaches after seizing power and restoring nancy pelosi to the speakership after eight years in the minority  house democrats approved measures to reopen the government without the  5 billion in border wall funding demanded by mr  trump  the sticking point in the entire exercise but senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  had already declared that he would not put any measure before the senate unless mr  trump had agreed to sign it  the president was definitely not signing the house measure  at least at this point  and actually threatened to veto it mr  mcconnell was moving very cautiously  before the holiday break  he had pushed through the senate with no objection a resolution to extend funding for all federal agencies into february  only to see it quickly torpedoed by mr  trump and house conservatives  it was an embarrassing outcome for the senate leader  and mr  mcconnell was in no rush to make that mistake again  preferring instead to wait for a white house plan to end the shutdown on the other side of the aisle  democrats would typically be furiously trying to find a way to get the government back online  early last year  senate democrats relented just a few days into a shutdown and capitulated on an immigration issue to reopen the government  this time  democrats believe mr  trump has boxed himself in with his demand for money for a wall that they consider ill advised and publicly unpopular  they are not about to help him out of his predicament president trump is holding the government hostage over his wall  using the well being of millions of americans as hostage in a futile attempt to get what he wants  a concrete border wall  said senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader democrats  looking at a much more favorable senate map in 2020 compared with a difficult 2018  do not see much political risk in standing firm against mr  trump  in fact  at this point  they see picking a fight with the president as politically advantageous they view the shutdown as damaging to republican senators who could face difficult re election challenges in 2020  including cory gardner of colorado  who has broken with his colleagues and called for reopening the government without border wall funding mr  trump and his allies  on the other hand  see the fight as critical to his political standing  facing an emboldened and empowered democratic house  the president intends to keep his conservative base firmly in his corner  and standing up for his long promised wall is one way to do so  early signs last month that he would relent on the wall money drew a quick rebuke from the right it is a recipe for a prolonged impasse other factors are also at work in keeping the government shut down  the first two and a half weeks of the interruption have occurred during the holidays  when many workers are off and the demand for government help is not as great some of the most vital government services  the military  veterans affairs and health and education programs  were funded in separate spending measures that already passed and were signed into law  limiting the scope of the shutdown and most government workers have not yet begun missing paychecks as the shutdown persists  though  pressure will mount on congress and the white house to find a resolution  already  there are calls from democrats and a few republicans to pass a package of bills that would fund the rest of the government with the exception of the department of homeland security  which is the agency caught up in the wall funding dispute there are also a few ideas circulating to draft a compromise that would exchange wall funding for democratic priorities such as making permanent a program for undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country as children while it remains unclear just how the standoff will be resolved  lawmakers in both parties say they will ultimately have to put aside their differences and find a solution people have to be able to pull back from this  said representative mike simpson  republican of idaho and a veteran member of the appropriations committee  sure  we are republicans and democrats  but at some point we are the congress at this point  however  it is a new congress caught up in old divisions between lawmakers and the president  conflicts that suggest a difficult and contentious two years ahead .

washington  time and again  when president trump stood by saudi arabia after the killing of a virginia based journalist  when it looked as if he might intervene in the special counsels russia investigation and when he threatened to declare a national emergency to pay for his border wall  lawmakers on capitol hill warned him not to push them too far this week  in a remarkable series of bipartisan rebukes to the president  congress pushed back on wednesday  with seven republicans breaking ranks  the senate joined the democrat led house in voting to end american military aid to saudi arabias war in yemen in protest over the killing of jamal khashoggi  a columnist for the washington post  on thursday morning  the house voted unanimously on a nonbinding resolution to make public the findings of the special counsel  robert s  mueller iii and on thursday afternoon  12 republican senators abandoned the president to pass legislation  already adopted by the house  that would block mr  trump from declaring a national emergency to build his border wall  an act of defiance that he has vowed to overturn with the first veto of his presidency were saying today  no  we do not acquiesce to this  senator lisa murkowski  republican of alaska  said after voting to block the emergency declaration  we do not agree that the president should be able to come in and go against the express intention of the congress when it comes to these appropriated funds for his wall the series of votes vividly demonstrated a newfound willingness to stand up to the president among some of his republican allies on capitol hill  and they underscored a deep frustration in congress about the presidents supposed scorn for a coequal branch of government we have an issue that has been litigated and adjudicated through congress  i mean  what was more litigated than this very question  we had a government shutdown for crying out loud  said senator patrick j  toomey  republican of pennsylvania  referring to funding for the border wall  which mr  trump is trying to secure with an emergency declaration that would circumvent congress its about separation of powers  mr  toomey said  its about respecting the principles of the constitution for some republicans  particularly those who have typically voted in lock step with the president  the votes were a moment of soul searching during a harried week before recess  when most lawmakers were looking forward to getting out of town  the yemen vote was an exceedingly rare invocation of the 1973 war powers act  passed after the vietnam war to restrain the presidents authority to use military force we dont often have great votes about great questions around here about separation of powers  said senator rand paul  republican of kentucky  adding  i dont think you can overstate how important it is that for the first time in the history of the country  the full congress voted to tell the president that we cant be in a war mr  trump made it clear he would fight the bipartisan challenges to his authority he feels good  said senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina  a close ally of mr  trump who talked to the president shortly after the vote  he said  my veto will be sustained  i said  yeah  overwhelmingly  he feels like his commitment to build the wall is moving forward but the rare coalition of democrats and republicans could bolster legal challenges to the emergency declaration that could tie up wall funding indefinitely  and the mere act of defying mr  trump foreshadows potential new difficulty for the president as he seeks to push his agenda through a democrat controlled house and a less pliant republican controlled senate there are moments where you see a partisan rebuke of the president by congress  said william g  howell  a political scientist at the university of chicago and the author of power without persuasion  the politics of direct presidential action  they are really pretty infrequent  and when you do observe them it speaks to real tumult in the party senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  said he hoped the votes this week are green shoots  republicans  out of courage  out of principle and maybe out of principle or maybe exasperation  are beginning to constrain the president when he goes too far most republicans cast their votes as a matter of conscience  and some republicans who fashion themselves constitutional conservatives  such as senator ben sasse of nebraska  tied themselves in knots explaining how vexed they were to side with the president  senator thom tillis of north carolina  one of the first republicans to declare his support for overturning the emergency declaration  faced a huge backlash from conservatives and flipped his vote at the last second house republicans  who joined democrats in voting to call for mr  muellers report to be made public  insist there was no tumult but democrats saw it as an important declaration of principle  congress is finally asserting its authority under the constitution  with enthusiasm  said representative donna e  shalala  democrat of florida  who spent eight years in the executive branch as health secretary to president bill clinton the rejection of mr  trumps national emergency declaration could also give ammunition to a half dozen legal cases challenging the presidents exercise of that power under the 1976 national emergencies act  said jack l  goldsmith  a harvard law professor who led the justice departments office of legal counsel under president george w  bush some judges may count that as evidence of congressional intent  mr  goldsmith said  though he added that he disagreed with that view dror ladin  a staff lawyer for the american civil liberties union  said congresss action would help convince federal judges that the president was acting illegally to fund his wall this vote reinforces that the president has no right to that money  mr  ladin said but as a political matter  mr  trump could use the congressional votes to his advantage on the 2020 campaign trail  portraying himself once again as the outsider candidate battling an unpopular congress and the establishment in washington congress has for decades been what ross k  baker  a political scientist at rutgers university  calls a constitutional weakling  excessively deferential to the president  but there have been moments in history where the legislative branch seeks to assert its power and relevance  particularly with respect to the military and foreign engagement that happened in the 1970s with the passage of the war powers act  which gave congress the ability to compel the removal of military forces absent a formal declaration of war  congress exerted its authority in 1991 and again in 2002  when it authorized the president to use military force in the run up to both wars in iraq in 2005  amid a public uproar over the torture of detainees  congress tightened antitorture laws to ban the infliction of cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment on prisoners  including those held overseas by the c i a   over the objections of president bush now the fight over wall funding may incite yet another round of congressional muscle flexing  a number of republicans are pushing legislation to claw back the powers that congress gave the president in the national emergencies act  which mr  trump invoked to declare an emergency along the southwestern border the senates waking up a little bit to our responsibilities  said senator lamar alexander  republican of tennessee .
donald j  trumps highly personal management style as a businessman  impetuous  impolitic  sometimes immature  worked  at the very least  it wasnt publicly discredited very often mr  trump ran his own private company  it was small and largely hidden from the prying eyes of shareholders and government regulators  he was surrounded by longtime loyalists and family members  his main public exposure unfolded in staged settings  on softball talk shows or his own reality tv show now president trump is running a much larger enterprise  two years into the trump administration  its increasingly apparent that while the management traits he developed in the private sector may have propelled him into the white house  theyre not serving him well now that hes there as doris kearns goodwin  the presidential historian and author of the recent book leadership  in turbulent times  told me this week  mr  trump manifestly lacks a long list of traits associated with effective leadership  humility  acknowledging errors  shouldering blame and learning from mistakes  empathy  resilience  collaboration  connecting with people and controlling unproductive emotions the last of these was on display this week  when mr  trump stormed out of a negotiating session with democratic leaders and denounced the meeting in a tweet as a total waste of time the consequences are also becoming apparent  with the government shut down over mr  trumps demand for funding a border wall  the loss of a republican majority in the house of representatives and scant legislative achievements beyond the 2017 tax cut  his presidency is emerging as a case study in how not to govern with a modicum of management skill he could have gotten his wall  and he would probably be on the path to re election  said jeffrey pfeffer  professor of organizational behavior at the stanford graduate school of business  but he has very few accomplishments to his credit thats not to say mr  trump hasnt displayed some effective management techniques  albeit ones that are rarely discussed in americas business schools as mr  pfeffer told me this week  mr  trump exhibits several qualities that are prevalent among many leaders  including narcissism and dishonesty we claim we want nice people  but we dont  mr  pfeffer said  studies show that people want to associate with people who win ive always won  and im going to continue to win  mr  trump reportedly said in 2016 and mr  pfeffer noted that the reality distortion field that mr  trump deploys  ignoring the truth and creating an alternate set of facts  was once associated with the apple founder steve jobs and remains prevalent in silicon valley and among entrepreneurial start ups paul glatzhofer  director of talent solutions at the consulting firm psi international  agreed that mr  trump displayed some positive qualities of effective leadership  such as decisiveness  setting ambitious goals and self confidence  you may not like the idea of a wall  but its an ambitious goal  mr  glatzhofer said nonetheless  he cautioned that the presidents other  negative traits could far outweigh any positives  when we assess senior leadership  it doesnt matter how many strengths they have if they also have these flaws that can derail their careers  he said mr  trump also gets credit for being himself  especially from passionate members of his base  a quality he seems to have is that he doesnt care what other people think  mr  pfeffer said  not many of us are like that  but theres a certain power in violating conventional norms these qualities helped mr  trump win in 2016  but they havent translated into effective governance  at least not yet  people often equate the success of an individual with the success of an organization  but theyre not highly correlated  mr  pfeffer said mr  trump was able to assemble a relatively stable and loyal team of people who worked for him for years when he ran his private business  his failure to do so at the white house  save for a couple of survivors including kellyanne conway and family members like jared kushner  may be his most perplexing and conspicuous management failure in the first year of mr  trumps presidency  one third of his top white house appointees left  unprecedented for the countrys chief executive  for the top dozen appointees  the rate was 50 percent  this past year with still more churn  the total turnover rate hit 83 percent  according to the brookings institution  which is tracking personnel moves at the white house  no other president has come close in his first two years the only survivors among the top 12 white house appointees are bill mcginley  a low profile adviser and the cabinet secretary  and kevin hassett  chairman of the council of economic advisers hes an extreme case  mr  pfeffer said  hes never really had to moderate his behavior or compromise or answer to a real boss  in the real world  you cant just fire everybody kathryn dunn tenpas  senior research fellow at brookings and author of the staff turnover study  said  the turmoil inhibits his ability to complete his campaign promises she added  it creates an environment of anxiety and chaos  the stress and long hours are bad enough under normal circumstances and the unceremonious way in which mr  trump has pushed people out is likely to deter job candidates  ms  tenpas cited the failure to find a permanent successor to mr  kelly as chief of staff  a position that in any other administration people would be jumping up and down for .
washington  jared kushner  the presidents son in law  was confident in his ability as a good faith negotiator who could find a compromise to end the government shutdown his pitch to democratic lawmakers was simple  he told them he was the person who could land this plane buoyed by his success in helping pass a criminal justice bill  mr  kushner  a senior white house adviser  agreed to take the lead when the president asked him to find a way to end the monthlong stalemate  he hoped his experience winning over democrats skeptical of the trump administration during negotiations for that measure would produce a similarly successful conclusion but negotiating a broad immigration deal that would satisfy a president committed to a border wall as well as democrats who have cast it as immoral proved to be more like mr  kushners elusive goal of solving middle east peace than passing a criminal justice overhaul that already had bipartisan support for one  mr  kushner inaccurately believed that moderate rank and file democrats were open to a compromise and had no issue funding a wall as part of a broader deal if jared kushner thinks there is any daylight between house democratic leadership and rank and file members on this issue  then the extent that he lands this plane it will land in the alamo  said representative hakeem jeffries  democrat of new york and democratic leaders like senator chuck schumer  party officials said  did not believe that mr  kushner had the power to circumvent stephen miller  a senior policy adviser to the president  in meetings  they also noticed  mr  kushner appeared to prop up mr  miller as an expert on immigration  noting that mr  millers reputation as a hard liner was out of sync with his reasonable nature on friday  president trump did what mr  kushner had privately insisted was not an option on the table  he folded standing in the rose garden  mr  trump announced he was ending the standoff  during which he had failed to convince democrats to fund a  5 7 billion border wall  and was reopening the federal government for three weeks it was a stunning setback for the president and for mr  kushner  who had told colleagues that public opinion would move to their side and that speaker nancy pelosi would emerge as the one who looked unreasonable and intransigent mr  kushner had advised the president against declaring a national emergency  which would enable him to get funding for his wall without approval from congress  instead  he ultimately pushed mr  trump toward the announcement he made on friday  supporting it as a way to buy more time to reach a deal mr  trump  white house aides said  has been frustrated at everyone around him for not delivering a deal he can accept  and he has become wary of his son in laws advice on this issue  the aides said this account is based on interviews with more than a dozen congressional officials  white house aides and people involved in the immigration debate on capitol hill  aides said  mr  kushner had positioned himself as the person who could sell the president on a compromise  casting himself as a facilitator who did not lobby for details of any proposal but simply wanted to find a solution that both sides could claim as a victory mr  kushner has told mr  trump that he should spend the next three weeks trying to achieve a broader immigration package  that challenge has eluded both parties for years  but mr  kushner has suggested to colleagues that it is worth trying for  according to west wing aides the president appears to have internalized the advice  21 days goes very quickly  mr  trump wrote on twitter on saturday morning  negotiations with democrats will start immediately  will not be easy to make a deal  both parties very dug in  the case for national security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the border   through dialogue  we will build the wall but democrats said they do not believe that mr  kushner will have better luck drafting a larger deal in the next few weeks  unless hes able to convince his father in law to abandon his obsession with building a medieval border wall  then hes not going to be successful in finding a bipartisan agreement  mr  jeffries said sarah huckabee sanders  the white house press secretary  however  noted that mr  kushner was still seen internally as one of the administrations most successful negotiators  pointing to his involvement with the criminal justice bill as well as the new north american trade deal  jared is a key player in the administration and will continue helping the president accomplish his top priorities  she said in an email but for now  mr  kushner appears to have few allies  occupying what people close to him describe as a no win position mr  kushner finds himself with little sway over democrats  who consider the substantial changes that the white house keeps proposing for asylum seekers to be poison pills  and conservatives are not convinced mr  kushner is the right person to negotiate a deal  they recognize he has mr  trumps ear  but worry he does not understand the fault lines of the debate or what proposals will anger mr  trumps base  one proposal that was reviewed  which would give green cards to 700 000 undocumented young immigrants  enraged conservatives within the white house  several aides said  mr  kushner is not interested in opinions that vary from his  and tends to view people who disagree with him as problems  closing them out of discussions  people close to mr  kushner  however  speaking on the condition of anonymity  have described him as working well with west wing colleagues  particularly the legislative affairs director  shahira knight  a veteran of capitol hill but even mr  kushners allies concede that when it comes to immigration  he has not grasped the emotional nature of the fight the way he did when he tackled the criminal justice overhaul  an issue that was personal because of his fathers own incarceration mr  kushner  allies said  sees the  5 7 billion request for border wall money as reasonable  and has compared it to one month of troop deployments in afghanistan  he views ms  pelosi as trophy hunting  or trying to take down the president politically with the shutdown allies of mr  kushner say that not all of his discussions with democrats have been publicized  and that he has gained trust partly because he keeps his conversations confidential  but on capitol hill  many democrats said discussions on immigration have been scarce senator dick durbin  democrat of illinois  was given no notice about mr  trumps announcement last weekend in which he offered temporary protections for young undocumented immigrants in exchange for wall money  according to a congressional aide  senator joe manchin iii  democrat of west virginia  heard from mr  kushner only once  when he phoned before the presidents prime time address from the oval office to warn him that the moment would move public opinion to the presidents side  mr  jeffries  who worked closely with mr  kushner on criminal justice reform  had no conversations about forging a bipartisan immigration bill some democrats  however  gave mr  kushner credit for at least trying to keep a dialogue going  even if it did not result in a compromise we disagreed on the issue  but talking is essential in a divided government  especially if we want to solve any problems  said representative josh gottheimer  democrat of new jersey .
if you had the word crisis in your presidential address drinking game  my sympathies in president trumps first televised address from the oval office  and the rebuttal from representative nancy pelosi and senator charles schumer  there was a lot of crisis talk  crisis of the heart  manufacturing a crisis  the president cast the crisis as a dire  dangerous wave of immigration coming across the mexican border  for the democrats  the crisis was the extended government shutdown  precipitated by mr  trumps insistence on funding for his promised border wall what there was not  after two days of media drama  was a convincing argument for why this needed to be a prime time event at all  there was no news  there was no new argument  there was just a wall of sound  and the american viewing audience paid for it nor was there much compelling television  unless youre an avid maker of internet memes  this was not a friendly setting for either party the oval office  which can confer gravitas on a typical president  simply saps this atypical one  mr  trump comes alive playing off a crowd  like the ones he drove wild with promises that mexico would pay for the wall  plopped behind a desk  sniffling  reading sleepily from a teleprompter  he was a comedian playing an empty room ms  pelosi and mr  schumer  meanwhile  shared a lectern in a hallway  side by side  one glaring as the other spoke  looking unfortunately like a cross between grant woods american gothic and the twins from the shining there was a bit of new rhetoric from mr  trump  his prepared speech referenced morality  something he rarely does off the cuff   and a few sound bites from the opposition  we dont govern by temper tantrum  mr  schumer said   but you heard nothing you couldnt absorb from a few minutes surfing cable news  or political twitter  any time of the day so what did all this accomplish  well  it got mr  trump on tv  his true home  after a run of headlines for the new democratic house  it gained him two days of newscasts about him  him  him  cable reporters gave hourly updates on whether the president might declare a national emergency  he became the protagonist again  the home audience hanging on for the dramatic reveal the real crisis revelation  honestly  was a crisis of tv standards  which came long before the cameras started rolling  on monday  the networks hemmed  wobbled  then decided to give mr  trump unfiltered access to their audience  on a topic on which he has a clear record of  well  lies  falsehoods  misstatements  ill leave it to you and your thesaurus whatever the semantics  the networks know they cant trust mr  trump to tell the truth  they know this because he went on live tv twice last week  in a cabinet meeting and in a long rose garden ramble  and said numerous things about this very topic that were demonstrably  empirically false assessing whether a source is credible isnt bias  its not political  its journalism  in this case  the networks had more evidence than charlie brown did about lucy and her football   this comparison may be unfair to charlie brown  who did not act out of fear that the football would tweet mean things about him  instead  the broadcast networks carried mr  trumps address live  and without the real live  onscreen fact checking that news outlets have experimented with in other speeches abc scrambled to cram in speed talking fact checks between speeches  its correspondents correcting information about the number of illegal border crossings  fact checking mr  trumps claim that mexico would pay for the wall and noting that most heroin comes into the u s  through legal border crossings  nbc and cbs focused more on the politics of the shutdown  going forward   the cable networks  of course  had all night to debate and speculate  cbss screen graphics were especially friendly to the president  the chyrons under its analysis read president trump  the border wall will pay for itself  with no assessment of the claim  president trump  border wall is just common sense and pres  trump  securing border a choice between right and wrong  there were no captions quoting the democratic rebuttal live airtime for oval office addresses isnt an entitlement  the broadcast networks declined to air a 2014 speech by barack obama  on immigration   on the grounds that it would be essentially political  they could have done the same for mr  trump  then covered the news he made  if there was any  with context and fact checks instead  they made a gutless decision to put appearances or tradition or the fear of a presidential ragetweet over their responsibility to keep their audience from being misinformed  and for a partisan fizzle of a news event we will see how mr  trump fares with the democrats  but the tv networks put up as much of a barrier as a wall made of toothpicks .
washington  one day last week  amid spiraling fallout over special counsel robert mueller s russia probe   house speaker nancy pelosi dialed up the president and requested a meeting she talked to president donald trump about working together on an infrastructure package it was the first phone call between the two since the testy days of the government shutdown earlier this year  and it seemed productive  they are planning to meet  she told the associated press in a wednesday interview so goes the relationship between washington s two power centers  one in the white house  where trump is slapping almost hourly at the investigations into his administration and running headlong into a climactic moment of his presidency  the other on capitol hill  where pelosi is deliberately steering her gavel toward her party s goals as the two cross the 100 day mark of the era of divided government  theirs is a relationship like almost none other in washington even as trump derides democrats as  unhinged  and claims they are a party taken over by  socialists   he pulls his punches with pelosi  and while pelosi criticizes trump as  unfit  for office  and hasn t fully closed the door on impeachment  she wants to work with him on shared priorities on thursday  pelosi told reporters she s looking for at least  1 trillion for the infrastructure package  far more than the  200 billion trump has proposed  and she d like to get it closer to  2 trillion  she said she expects to  meet soon  with the president to discuss it  i have pooh poohed his  200 billion mini nothing of an infrastructure bill   she said during the house democrats  issues conference retreat in virginia   and i think he probably knows that was not a successful path to building the infrastructure from sea to shining sea  lawmakers said they expect to have legislation ready for consideration in the house by june or july the white house confirmed the president and the speaker  did speak last week and have agreed to meet soon to discuss working together on infrastructure   said administration spokesman judd deere  the president wants a bipartisan infrastructure package that rebuilds crumbling infrastructure  invests in the projects and industries of tomorrow  and promotes permitting efficiency   deere said thursday launching an infrastructure investment program is the kind of big bipartisan undertaking that seems all but impossible in times like these the trump administration s  infrastructure week  became a punchline around washington when it fizzled amid the white house s often shifting priorities  trump promised on election night a  1 trillion investment in new roads and other projects but has never come close to achieving it  democrats scoff at the  200 billion requests he s made in his budget proposals as meager  pelosi called it a  nonstarter  but infrastructure  like the effort on lowering prescription drug costs  is the kind of initiative that could benefit both of them as they head toward the 2020 campaign season  they could change the subject from the ongoing investigations that pose risks for both parties  and they could show voters they can deliver with building projects that improve communities and create jobs even at a time of divided government  with democrats controlling the house and republicans controlling the senate  we want dirt to fly   pelosi said after her talks with trump  pelosi thinks the president may be willing to do more than he s put on the table  trump s latest budget proposed  200 billion in federal dollars that could be leveraged with private capital to cover the difference  i don t think the president is wedded to that proposal   she said   it s too small  she says 80 percent of their conversations  including the talk last thursday  are about infrastructure  they re trying  she said  to find areas of  common ground   the purpose of the upcoming meeting she requested is to  get a dollar figure  as a starting point for the discussions asked about infrastructure  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell also left open the possibility of a fresh bipartisan effort  we ve all been talking about infrastructure  including the president  for a couple of years now   mcconnell  r ky   told fox news on wednesday   we need some straight talk from both sides on how we re going to pay for it  the day after trump and pelosi spoke  trump went to california to visit the southern border  where he is trying to build a long promised border wall with mexico after democrats thwarted his demand for more wall funds during the shutdown that afternoon  house democrats filed a lawsuit challenging trump s national emergency declaration  which he invoked to circumvent congress and to use military construction money to pay for the border wall  it s so very self evident that the president is very different from every other person that anybody ever served with   pelosi said in the ap interview wednesday  he is not only unique  he s     what would be the word   she said  trailing off   to be president of the united states is to have a very special personality  but there are shared values about commitment to our constitution  to the vision of our founders to the constitution of the united states  i don t see those features yet in this president  associated press writer kevin freking in

to the editor re trump declares national emergency to build border wall  nytimes com  feb  15  if some migrant workers and asylum seekers illegally crossing the southern border constitute a national emergency  then what to think of the tens of thousands of americans lost to gun violence each year  the growing number of americans without access to affordable health insurance and the existential threat of our increasingly extreme climate if republicans in congress do not immediately rebuke this reckless and unconstitutional subversion of congresss own power of the purse  and if the increasingly partisan federal judiciary signs off on this obvious abuse of authority  then a dangerous precedent has indeed been set and in that case  i very much look forward to a democratic president declaring a state of emergency to ban assault weapons after the next school shooting  to create a universal medicare opt in for the uninsured  and to impose a large scale reordering of our fossil fuel based economy after the next devastating wildfires or hurricanes republicans will rue this latest capitulation to this lawless president  yet perhaps the country will come to be better off for it nikhil singhshelton  conn to the editor how much waste of time  money and energy is it going to take for this country to come to its senses and demand that president trump and congress get serious about the business of government mr  trump has conjured up a national emergency where none exists and has tied the entire country in knots for months over a useless wall he wants to build on our southern border to protect us from imaginary threats  meanwhile  nothing is being done about the issues that will eventually have real consequences for the country if this isnt dereliction of duty  i dont know what is stuart mathnew yorkto the editor to paraphrase that famous quote  first the president came for the justice department  but the republicans in congress did not speak out because they were not part of the justice department  then the president came for the free press  but the republicans in congress did not speak out because they were not journalists and now the president has come for you  congress  he means to usurp your power over appropriations  the most fundamental constitutional power granted to you by the framers  will you leave it to the courts to defend your prerogatives  hoping that there are still some judges and supreme court justices left who are free of trumpian influence  or will you finally  finally speak out for yourselves  forcefully and with one unified voice  nancy starknew yorkto the editor there is no better demonstration of president trumps failure at leadership and governance than his reliance on his emergency declaration powers in order to assemble the funds necessary to build his wall i am reminded of the spoiled kid who resolves to take his ball home because he cant win the game by playing by the rules  in this case  our constitutional separation of powers  of course  it is his teammates  the republicans in congress  who stand to lose the most because they are no longer in the ballgame  they have kowtowed to their neighborhood bully once too often and may as well go home themselves if mr  trumps border wall truly had merit  the case to be made would be straightforward  instead we have a president who must desperately make stuff up to stay in a game that he doesnt know how to play don kruppsan diegoto the editor senator marco rubio says  if today the national emergency is border security  tomorrow the national emergency might be climate change  conflating a fabricated emergency with a true emergency not only fails to make his point but also shows that mr  rubio does not consider climate change urgent michael ettingerrhinebeck  n y  to the editor the real national emergency is that donald trump believes he is an autocrat and subject to neither constitutional restraints nor existing law  arthur bradley eisenbrey iiigrosse pointe woods  mich .

washington  u s  homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen  who oversaw president donald trump s bitterly contested immigration policies during her tumultuous 16 month tenure  resigned on sunday amid a surge in the number of migrants at the border with mexico a senior administration official said trump asked for nielsen s resignation and she gave it  trump  who has recently expressed growing anger about the situation at the border  said on twitter   secretary of homeland security kirstjen nielsen will be leaving her position  and i would like to thank her for her service  in another tweet  trump said kevin mcaleenan  the current u s  customs and border protection commissioner  would become acting dhs secretary in a tweet late sunday  nielsen said that she would stay on until wednesday  i have agreed to stay on as secretary through wednesday  april 10th to assist with an orderly transition and ensure that key dhs missions are not impacted   she said nielsen s departure was first reported by cbs news  nielsen  46  had been dhs secretary since december 2017  her departure had been repeatedly rumored over the past year  particularly after a wave of anger over the administration s 2018 family separation policy at the border with mexico and most recently as u s  border officials estimated that 100 000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border in march  the highest level in a decade another senior administration official said trump s national security adviser  john bolton  after a blowup with nielsen late last year  also recommended to trump that she should go trump has made a clampdown on illegal immigration a centerpiece of his two year old presidency  leading chants of  build that wall  at his rallies as he has sought to cut back on the number of newcomers entering the united states without proper documentation many of the migrants picked up last month were central americans seeking u s  asylum trump was so frustrated about the increase that he announced he would cut off u s  aid to guatemala  honduras and el salvador  he also threatened to close the border with mexico  although he later backed off that proposal with a threat to impose tariffs on auto imports in her resignation letter  nielsen asked for more from congress and the courts  which have opposed such trump administration initiatives as his effort to limit immigration from muslim nations and the border wall  i hope that the next secretary will have the support of congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure america s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation s discourse   she wrote to trump trump also took aim at congress in another tweet later on sunday  saying   country is full   and saying democrats in congress must  fix loopholes  and repeating his threats to close the border or impose tariffs if mexico does not do more  nielsen s resignation was the latest high profile departure from the trump administration  and leaves just four women in his cabinet  among others  trump currently lacks a permanent secretary of defense or chief of staff lightning rodnielsen s departure was announced two days after the republican president abruptly said on friday he was dumping his nominee to be the top official at u s  immigration and customs enforcement  ice   ronald vitiello  saying he wanted someone  tougher  ice is under the jurisdiction of dhs  which was formed following the sept  11  2001  attacks on new york and washington repeatedly subjected to tough questioning by democrats at congressional hearings  nielsen became a lightning rod for criticism of trump s policies  she was confronted by protesters last year at a mexican restaurant in washington last year  nielsen came under increasing pressure by critics to step aside after the trump administration adopted the policy of separating migrant children from their parents as part of its  zero tolerance  approach intended to deter families from leaving home in the hope of entering the united states after criticism as pictures of children in cages were spread across the world  trump signed an executive order in june ending family separations and requiring that families be held together in federal custody while the adults awaited prosecution for illegally crossing the border but the government reported that at least 245 children were taken from their families between that time and the first months of 2019 trump insists that the arrival of immigrants across the southern u s  border constitutes a national emergency so important that he sidestepped congress  refusal to provide him with billions of dollars he requested to build the border wall representative bennie thompson  the democratic chairman of the house of representatives homeland security committee  said nielsen s tenure at dhs  was a disaster from the start  he said in a statement  however  that she should not serve as a scapegoat  blasting trump for  terrible and cruel policies   noting that the department now has neither a permanent secretary nor deputy secretary  thompson called on the administration to work with congress  in good faith  before she was nominated as secretary  nielsen worked as a deputy to former marine general john kelly  who headed dhs before becoming white house chief of staff  kelly resigned as chief of staff on jan  2

welcome to crossing the border  a limited run weekly newsletter from the new york times  like what you see  send this to a friend  if someone forwarded it to you  sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox by manny fernandez in mcallen  tex here in texas  america has two southern borders  i live 10 miles from one  60 miles from the other the first border is the one you know about  the tall steel barrier you see on the news  the physical and symbolic line that is patrolled  topped with razor wire and debated the second is well north of that  and it has been quietly setting southwestern cities apart from the rest of america for years  this other border is the line of federal traffic checkpoints that operate up to 100 miles north of the existing fence  there are more than 30 permanent border patrol checkpoints across arizona  california  texas and new mexico more than the fence line  the checkpoint line is in many ways the true border wall  more undocumented immigrants die trying to circumvent the checkpoints than they do trying to get around the fence  and many fear the checkpoints more than they fear the fence  every day  hundreds of thousands of people who pull up to these checkpoints have to do something other americans in other cities dont have to do on the highway  answer a uniformed officers question about whether they are a united states citizen these checkpoints were suddenly in the news this week  after the border patrol took the rare step of temporarily closing some of them in the el paso region and in new mexico  border patrol officials said they did it in response to the influx of central american families seeking asylum  agents working those checkpoints are being diverted elsewhere to help process the migrants that officials said are overwhelming their resources along the border two weeks ago  i briefed the media and testified in congress that our immigration system was at the breaking point  the commissioner of customs and border protection  kevin k  mcaleenan  told reporters in el paso on wednesday  that breaking point has arrived this week at our border  there were a total of 13 400 migrants in custody along the border wednesday morning  he said  a high number for us is 4 000  a crisis level is 6 000  thirteen thousand is unprecedented the closures have brought the checkpoints back into the national spotlight and have raised a host of questions  the border patrol has pumped a considerable amount of time  taxpayer money and personnel into these inland checkpoints  designed to intercept any drugs or unauthorized migrants that might have made it through the main ports of entry when i visited one of the busiest checkpoints on the border in 2015  located in the middle of south texas ranchlands near the town of falfurrias on highway 281  a border patrol official told me  without the checkpoints  then you have narcotics and people just coming straight up the highways one must presume those narcotics and people are coming straight up the highways now in the parts of texas and new mexico where the checkpoints are now closed  for all the talk of toughened border security last month  i moved temporarily from houston to the south texas city of mcallen to help expand the new york timess coverage of the border  i cant drive north back to houston without passing a checkpoint  and i cant pass a checkpoint until i roll down my window and answer a border patrol agents question  are you a u s  citizen sometimes the agents ask me where im headed  and on at least one occasion they asked me to pop the trunk  once  an agent joked about the barbie and trolls stickers my 6 year old daughter had stuck on a back window  another time  one of the border patrol dogs that sniff the vehicles responded to something in my trunk  and i had to pull over for a secondary inspection  which proved uneventful  in a nation where police stop and frisk tactics are the subject of much debate  americans who live on the border have normalized government intrusion its destabilizing to the people who live in these regions  in subtle ways  nuanced ways  said francisco cant  a former border patrol agent who is the author of the line becomes a river  a memoir  i think its part of creating the state of exception  creating this idea that the borderland is somehow other  other than the regular full united states the interactions at the checkpoints dont always go as smoothly as mine have  numerous motorists and activists who have refused to answer the citizenship question have posted videos of the encounters on youtube  one video shows a california teacher at a new mexico checkpoint as she questioned an agents authority to stop her  agents in those situations usually make reference to u s  v  martinez fuerte  the 1976 supreme court ruling that established that vehicle stops at the checkpoints were consistent with the fourth amendments restrictions on unreasonable search and seizure one thing i often wonder  i was born in fresno  calif   but would i get questioned as often at the checkpoints if i werent mexican american  several white friends and colleagues have told me that agents have waved them through without questioning their citizenship status  that doesnt happen to me  ive passed through several border patrol checkpoints in texas dozens of times  i get asked whether im an american citizen  every single time manny is one of a team of new york times journalists currently reporting from the border  each week theyre sharing a slice of their reporting about the border and the people

to the longest shutdown in united states history  and when the government finally reopened in january  the fate of the presidents wall seemed as confusing as ever heres a look at what has happened since then and whats likely to happen next  on tuesday  the house of representatives came up short in an attempt to override the presidents veto of an earlier house vote rebuking him for declaring a national emergency at the southern border  that allowed the presidents declaration of a national emergency at the southern border to stand  read the full story here  heres how every member of the house voted  the debate over the emergency declaration now turns to the courts  where a coalition of more than a dozen states filed lawsuits last month challenging its legal merits  this week  the acting defense secretary authorized the transfer of up to  1 billion toward the construction of 57 miles of border wall and other related projects  that money was separate from the emergency declaration  and military leaders around the country are mindful that local construction projects  fire station repairs  new schools and training complexes  may soon see their funding cut or delayed

washington  president trump plans to use his state of the union address on tuesday night to outline a bipartisan and optimistic vision of the country  a senior administration official said on friday it could be a difficult sell in the past few weeks  as he has tried to navigate his way out of a political standoff with democrats  mr  trump has ramped up his anti immigration messaging  stormed out of meetings with democratic leaders and refused to accept any compromise that does not ultimately include funding for a border wall and while the white house said on friday that the goal of the speech was to bring together a divided government and a divided nation  the official said immigration would emerge as the main theme mr  trump is also expected to make an appeal to his evangelical anti abortion base by talking about the fundamental importance and respect for human life  the official said  and he will focus a large portion of his remarks on the importance of ending illegal immigration but the official  who refused to be identified according to the ground rules of the briefing  framed the speech as an opportunity to change the tone of the current political debate together we can break decades of political stalemate  mr  trump is expected to say  according to an excerpt from the speech shared by the official  we can bridge old divisions  heal old wounds  build new coalitions  forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of americas future  the decision is ours to make the overarching theme of the speech  the official said  will be choosing greatness  and it will focus on issues where there is a possibility of bipartisan consensus  infrastructure  lowering health care and prescription drug costs  protecting american workers affected by what he described as decades of flawed trade deals and safeguarding national security the president will also call on congress to replace what he described as the nafta disaster with the united states mexico canada agreement and discuss the trading relationship with china in his first state of the union address last year  mr  trump also sought to strike a unifying tone that was a contrast to the political attacks and divisive messaging that he is better known for  but the promises in last years speech  including bringing democrats and republicans together behind a  1 5 trillion infrastructure plan  have not materialized  while the more contentious policies of his presidency have continued this year  mr  trump will address the nation after a 35 day government shutdown caused by his insistence that congress approve funding for the border wall  and although the president agreed to three weeks of negotiations to end the impasse  he said on thursday that the talks are a waste of time and strongly hinted that he would declare a national emergency to bypass congress and obtain wall funding mr  trump suggested on friday that he would announce his decision on declaring a national emergency during the state of the union speech i dont want to say  he told reporters when asked if he was planning to do so  youll hear the state of the union and lets see what happens  he said white house officials have been warning him against the action  but they also view it as a potential last ditch exit ramp if they cannot find another face saving solution last month  in the midst of the shutdown  speaker nancy pelosi told the president she wanted to postpone the address  initially scheduled for jan  29  until after the government reopened  and suggested he deliver the speech in writing mr  trump retaliated by grounding the military plane that was supposed to take ms  pelosi and other lawmakers on a fact finding trip to afghanistan  then  when mr  trump pressed ahead  insisting he wanted to give the speech  ms  pelosi disinvited him  but this week she and the president agreed he would give the speech on feb  5 .
one clear lesson from the elections of 2016 and 2018 is that president trump and his fellow republican candidates win where white voters are losing ground take a look at the 2018 congressional results in the upper midwest and pennsylvania  states that provided the electoral college votes crucial to trumps capture of the white house john c  austin  the director of the michigan economic center and a senior fellow at brookings  analyzed economic trends in 15 congressional districts that changed hands last year  12 from republican to democrat  three from democrat to republican  in pennsylvania  michigan  minnesota and iowa austin found a striking pattern  in the majority of districts that went from republican to democrat the accompanying graphic reveals the extent to which economic considerations shaped the outcome in these districts the same general pattern emerged in state after state in the recent midterms in september 2018  siobhan hughes and dante chinni of the wall street journal took the 70 congressional races ranked as most competitive by the cook political report  they then ranked the races on the basis of an economic health index created by the institute of international finance of the ten districts ranked highest on economic health  eight were categorized lean republican by the cook political report  and two lean democrat  before the november election  nine of those 10 seats were held by republicans on election day  democrats carried eight out of 10 of these districts mark muro and jacob whiton  both of brookings  worked with john harwood of cnbc to analyze democratic and republican held congressional districts in the aftermath of the 2018 election  their conclusions reinforce the findings of austin  hughes and chinni the key result  the 20 most prosperous districts are now held by democrats  while republicans represent 16 of the 20 least prosperous  measured by share of g d p  the accompanying chart illustrates their analysis the authors calculation of the contribution to the g d p  of every congressional district showed that democratic districts produce  10 2 trillion of the nations goods and services and republican districts  6 2 trillion this trend creates a significant dilemma for trump and the republican party  candidates on the right do best during hard times and in recent elections  they have gained the most politically in regions experiencing the sharpest downturn  electorally speaking  in other words  republicans profit from economic stagnation and decline lets return to john austin of the michigan economic center  in an email he describes this unusual situation succinctly  a rising economic tide tends to sink the trump tugboat  addingcertainly more people and communities that are feeling abandoned  not part of a vibrant economy means more fertile ground for the resentment politics and blaming others for peoples woes  like immigrants and people of color  that fuel trumps supporters in june 2017  austin demonstrated the importance of struggling white communities to the republican party  his study of the 2016 presidential results in the midwest showed how strong turnout among voters in regions facing economic deterioration can help republicans  in that earlier report  austin wrote this pattern is not limited to the united states  there are numerous studies demonstrating that european and british voters who are falling behind in the global economy  and who were hurt by the 2008 recession and the subsequent cuts to the welfare state  drove brexit as well as the rise of right wing populist parties one paper  measuring the effects of economic austerity on pro sociality  evidence from greece  by nicholas sambanis  anna schultz and elena nikolova  political scientists at penn  duke and university college london  found  for example in a july 2018 paper  did austerity cause brexit  thiemo fetzer  an economist at the university of warwick in coventry  england  argues that austerity policies adopted in the wake of the 2008 financial collapse were crucial both to voter support for the right wing populist party ukip in britain and to voter approval of brexit these political movements are strongly and causally associated with an individuals or an areas exposure to austerity since 2010  fetzer writes  examination of economic trends  welfare policy and polling data shows  according to fetzer  thatthere are significant parallels between voting patterns for and against brexit and the patterns in the 2016 and 2018 elections in this country in a separate 2017 paper  who voted for brexit  fetzer and two fellow economists at the university of warwick  sascha o  becker and dennis novy  found that in particular  fiscal cuts in the context of the recent u k  austerity program are strongly associated with a higher vote leave share  this heldthe results here and in england reinforce the conclusion that the worse things get  the better the right does as a rule  as economic conditions improve and voters begin to feel more secure  they become more generous and more liberal  in the united states  this means that voters move to the left  in britain  it means voters are stronger in their support for staying in the european union in his forthcoming book  democratic capitalism at the crossroads  technological change and the future of politics carles boix  a political scientist at princeton  describes how postwar prosperity from 1945 to the mid 1970s led to a liberal international consensus as global competition  outsourcing and later  automation  began to produce significant economic disruption  beginning in the 1970s  this liberal consensus frayed boix writes in the united states  economic adversity helped produce trump  whose inaugural speech  reportedly the handiwork of steve bannon and stephen miller  boix cites as emblematic of the hostility emerging with the fall of liberalism together  the trends described above raise an intriguing question  if the republican party now depends on the votes of those who are falling behind  does the party have a vested interest in economic stagnation and decline i asked scholars and officials at the niskanen center  a washington think tank that recently received favorable coverage for its efforts to resolve contemporary ideological division  whether they thought the republican party has come to recognize that prosperity helps democrats  while economic adversity engenders hostility to immigrants  resentment of liberal elites and animosity among rural voters toward urban america  does this awareness give politicians on the right a motive to support policies and actions that foster government dysfunction and further impair sections of the country that are in decline jerry taylor  president of niskanen  replied to my inquiry by making the case that as conservatives see it  the more visible government dysfunction is  the better  it provides civic education working from this premise  taylor argued that as far as conservatives go taylor disputed the suggestion that republicans consciously or unconsciously labor to frustrate economic growth in rural white america  instead  he said  they are ideologically committed to the belief that economic growth iswill wilkinson  the centers vice president for research  wrote back to me but  in actual practice moving from campaigning to governing  wilkinson continued  trumpswhats more  wilkinson noted this has put the republican party in a painful position  according to wilkinson brink lindsey  vice president for policy  replied to my queries from a somewhat different angle  you dont need conscious intent to produce dysfunction to explain republican governance failures in lindseys view this is not  according to lindsey in addition to the mueller investigation  there are two major factors that will determine the sustainability of the republican partys rotten equilibrium the first  of course  is trump himself  his victory in 2016 was a charlatans ascent  and his presidency has served to sustain distrust in government  fuel  in one sense  for the continued success of charlatans  for the moment  though  his failure to win money for the border wall has punctured his viability as a governing force trumps second  if less heralded  achievement has been to invigorate the democratic opposition  he has inspired an immense  rambunctious  intensely motivated and exceptionally diverse pack of candidates  some prepared  some less so  to dislodge him from the white house .
as the government shutdown over president trumps demand for border wall funding moves through week three  the administration is looking to cut a deal with democrats by emphasizing the deepening humanitarian crisis at the border  a crisis caused in large part by this administrations inhumane policies  political grandstanding and managerial incompetence in a letter sunday to lawmakers  the white house laid out its latest proposal for addressing the border tumult  the administration called for more immigration and border patrol agents  more detention beds and  of course   5 7 billion to build 234 new miles of border wall  the white house also demanded an additional  800 million for urgent humanitarian needs  such as medical support  transportation and temporary facilities for processing and housing detainees translation  mr  trumps mass incarceration of migrant families is overwhelming an already burdened system that  without a giant injection of taxpayer dollars  will continue to collapse  leading to ever more human suffering the situation is an especially rich example of the trump doctrine  break something  then demand credit  and in this case a lot of money  for promising to fix it late last week  frustrated by his standoff with democrats  mr  trump even threatened to declare a national emergency in order to get his wall built without congresss approval  a move guaranteed to prompt a ferocious legal challenge any attempt to sell mr  trumps cruel immigration agenda with a veneer of humanitarian measures should be viewed with skepticism  this administration has long held that the best way to deal with asylum seekers fleeing the horrors of their home countries is to increase their suffering upon reaching the united states to discourage others from even trying  there is no question but that the administration remains ill equipped to cope with the fallout from its narrow fixation on deterrence  migrant children are being piled into holding cells where they fall ill  or worse  the number of detainees at immigration and customs enforcement facilities has swelled to unprecedented levels  requiring periodic mass releases  without preparation or planning  hundreds of migrants are simply dropped off at bus stations in border cities  the times found that  in the final week of december  some 600 migrants were unceremoniously released onto the streets of el paso mr  trumps spiteful choice to shut parts of the government is only making the situation messier  immigration judges are being furloughed  further slowing the processing of asylum requests  border patrol agents are working without pay  eroding morale  in perhaps the choicest twist of fate  some  300 million in new contracts for wall construction cannot be awarded until the shutdown ends  with democrats now controlling the house  the president is right to assume that he will need a new negotiating approach  but the answer isnt for lawmakers to throw good money after bad  or to try to prettify a retrograde agenda with humanitarian trimmings the trump administration is asking congress and the american public to embrace warped logic  that its policies are going to continue and that the only question is whether any money should be spent on measures to ease the suffering caused by those policies  after two years of watching this administration run amok  surely democratic lawmakers can come up with a better approach .

heres what the president said  and how it stacks up against the facts democrats have offered  1 3 billion in funding for border security measures like enhanced surveillance and fortified fencing  they do not support mr  trumps border wall at a meeting with ms  pelosi and mr  schumer in december  mr  trump took responsibility for the partial government shutdown i will take the mantle  i will be the one to shut it down  im not going to blame you for it  he said  linda qiuin november  the agency  which is actually named customs and border protection  and which oversees the border patrol   apprehended 51 856 people trying to cross the border illegally  thats about 1 700 per day the agency also deemed another 10 600 inadmissible  which refers to people who seek lawful entry into the united states but are barred from doing so  together  that would be over 2 000  but inadmissible is not the same thing as illegal entry  linda qiutwenty six senate democrats  including mr  schumer  voted for a 2006 law that authorized about 700 miles of fencing along the southwest border  during the 2016 presidential campaign  mr  trump characterized the 2006 legislation as inadequate  dismissing it as such a little wall  it was such a nothing wall as part of his campaign  mr  trump promised to build a 1 000 mile concrete border wall  he sometimes calls the wall a fence  though he has also rejected suggestions that it is a fence  linda qiusome economists argue that immigrants drive down available jobs and wages for americans only if they are competing for the same jobs as the

entry at the southern border  not through the desert  according to the drug enforcement administrations 2018 annual drug threat assessment a border wall would not address what experts see as the next  more deadly phase of the opioid epidemic  fentanyl fentanyl is a narcotic that is used to treat severe pain and is a key contributor the opioid crisis  it is also sometimes mixed with heroin  most fentanyl enters the united states from packages mailed directly from china through traditional ports of entry  according to the report  and through canada from china  a lower potency  lower cost grade of fentanyl is also smuggled across the southwest border from mexico  the fentanyl directly from china is far more lucrative for sellers because of its higher purity  the fentanyl sent through conventional mail packages has proved difficult for law enforcement to detect  fentanyl coming from mexico is often hidden in automobile compartments  much like conventional drug smuggling the presidents opioids commission reported last november that we are losing this fight predominately through china  michael tackettin the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years  immigration and customs enforcement arrested over 210 876 people with previous criminal convictions  and another 55 233 people with pending criminal charges but it should be noted that these criminal convictions covered a range of offenses  including many that were nonviolent  the most common charges were for traffic violations  possessing or selling drugs and immigration offenses like illegal entry  linda qiufirst  the revised north american free trade agreement  known as the united states mexico canada agreement  has yet to pass in congress  any economic benefits from the agreement  if it passes  will most likely come in the form of lower tariffs for american companies or higher wages for american workers this is different from mr  trumps campaign promise that mexico would finance the wall  alan rappeportthe president has claimed that the annual cost of illegal drugs in the united states is  500 billion  but a 2015 report by the surgeon general estimated that the annual economic impact of illicit drug use is  193 billion stopping the flow of drugs across the southwest border would not entirely stem the flow of drugs across the united states  moreover  it is not clear how reducing the cost of drug addiction would finance the wall  alan rappeportan estimated 800 000 federal workers are furloughed or working without pay because of the shutdown  while millions of americans are not being directly harmed

and travel  alan rappeportsenator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina  told fox newss sean hannity that he had never seen mr  trump behave in such a presidential manner  and he issued a dire warning to mr  trumps base if we undercut the president  thats the end of his presidency and the end of our party  mr  graham said as the president clearly laid out tonight  we have a growing humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border  representative kay granger of texas  the ranking member on the house appropriations committee  said in a statement i stand ready and willing to work with the white house and my friends on both sides of the aisle in the house and senate to find a legislative solution to border security and reopen the government even before the speech began  democrats were preparing their rebuttals president trump is going to use the public airwaves to spread fear and misinformation tonight  tweeted representative david cicilline of rhode island  the head of the democrats messaging arm  im going to correct the record in a more lighthearted jab  senator christopher s  murphy  democrat of connecticut  joked that he unsuccessfully tried to get senator brian schatz  democrat of hawaii  to livestream a trumps not telling the truth drinking game tonight me and him  shot of beer every time trump says something made up  mr  murphy wrote on twitter  he didnt bite   mr  schatz  live tweeting the speech  noted instead  this is dark  and during the speech  democrats flooded the internet with their own commentary  frequently reflecting mr  trumps rhetoric back at his administration donald trumps presidency is a national emergency  wrote representative ilhan omar  democrat of minnesota but it was perhaps representative hakeem jeffries of new york  the no  5 house democrat  who most succinctly summed up his partys response  we are not paying a  5 billion ransom note for your medieval border wall  he tweeted  with a castle emoji  and nothing you just said will change that cold  hard reality  emily cochrane and catie edmondsonspeaker nancy pelosi of california and senator chuck schumer of new york  the minority leader  spoke from the capitol after mr  trump finished his remarks from the oval office  the dueling speeches from opposite sides of pennsylvania avenue unfolded at the close of day 18 of a government shutdown over mr  trumps demand for  5 7 billion for a border wall that democrats have steadfastly opposed the democratic leaders decision to select themselves as the message bearers to counter the president underscores how a partisan power struggle in a new era of divided government is undergirding the discussions over resolving the shutdown  even as the paychecks of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and benefits for millions of americans hang in the balance senator bernie sanders  independent of vermont  who ran unsuccessfully for the democratic presidential nomination in 2016  also made a public response to mr  trump  which was streamed live on social media platforms after ms  pelosi and mr  schumer concluded their remarks  the move was reminiscent of how a fractious republican party responded to state of the union addresses when barack obama was president  republican leaders designated a formal response and tea party aligned conservatives chose their own messengers to deliver a different rebuttal  julie hirschfeld davisa dozen senate democrats took the floor this evening for a talkathon style protest calling on mr  trump and senate republicans to end the government shutdown  led by senators tim kaine of virginia and jeanne shaheen of new hampshire  it was yet another effort to raise the pressure on senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  to allow a vote on legislation that would reopen the government  earlier tuesday  senate democrats voted against advancing a package of bipartisan middle east policy bills slated for consideration this week to further press republicans  mr  mcconnell said on the senate floor on tuesday that he would not waste time on show votes  but he is also being pushed by vulnerable members of his own party up for re election in 2020 to intervene and end the shutdown  catie edmondsonwhat is normally an easy decision for network executives  granting airtime to a sitting president to address the nation  led to hours of hand wringing by journalists and producers wary of giving a platform to a president whose public remarks  particularly on immigration  have been marked by untruths and misleading claims  liberals wondered why news outlets would defer to a president who  hours earlier  had used twitter to label journalists the enemy of the people  the real opposition party and crazed lunatics eventually  abc  cbs  nbc and fox agreed to a request by mr  trump for the airtime  forgoing their 9 p m  entertainment shows  and millions of dollars in associated ad revenue  for his oval office appearance  in which he plans to address the government shutdown  the networks said on tuesday that they would also broadcast the democratic response  michael m  grynbaum.
calexico  calif   the barbed wire overhead evokes danger and violence  but maritza hurtado cannot take it seriously  when the sharp coils were placed on top of the old border fence several months ago  running right along the main boulevard  she chalked it up to political propaganda from a white house that does not understand life along the southwest frontier this is not a war zone  ms  hurtado said from her tax and immigration consulting office in downtown calexico  from which she can peer into mexico  ive had a business here for 30 years and weve never needed the barbed wire  why now  to me  it feels as if im enclosed for nearly a year  president trump has pointed with pride to a renovation project replacing two miles of border fencing in calexico  he hailed it as the start of our southern border wall   to the great consternation of many of the towns residents  who are wary of becoming the public face of a hard line immigration policy that most here do not agree with  the attention the presidents tweet brought was surreal  in part because the construction replaced an unsightly stretch of steel fencing that was already there nationally  partisans and journalists began to debate whether the 30 foot tall steel slats that make up the replacement barrier should be called a wall like the one mr  trump promised during his campaign  others said it was just a fence  a distinction that has taken on great importance in washington lost amid the battle over credit and semantics was how calexico residents themselves felt about becoming characters in trump era political theater  for many  a sense of apprehension turned to anger when the military installed barbed wire on top of older border fencing  which runs through downtown this community is basically being used for political purposes  said ms  hurtado  who served as the towns mayor until december  and its happening throughout these border cities that are just like ours  she tried to remain diplomatic when television news crews asked her for comment about the barrier last spring  she said  to avoid making more drama for this community that has nothing to do with the national problem but she said she felt incredulous over the administrations insistence that the replacement fence is part of the wall  before we started this project here to do the replacement  border patrol came to visit us about three times to ask us to please participate in avoiding the drama  they came to say  three times  you guys  just so you know  were starting this project  and its not the wall  recounted ms  hurtado  a democrat who did not vote for the president  and then here comes trump and says  its the wall  read more about how the people who live on the border feel about the wall   we have other problems here that need fixing   the town has received a steady dose of attention from trump administration officials since last spring  vice president mike pence visited the barrier in april and said the administration was committed to seeing the construction of a border wall  in october  the homeland security secretary  kirstjen nielsen  visited to unveil a plaque crediting the president with the barrier this month  the president tweeted again  the fake news media keeps saying we havent built any new wall  he wrote  apparently in reference to the barrier in calexico  below is a section just completed on the border  anti climbing feature included  very high  strong and beautiful  also  many miles already renovated and in service amid a continuing national debate about the border  which has resulted in the longest government shutdown in history  many in this town of 40 000 have struggled to reconcile ominous warnings they see projected from the white house about life on the border with their own experiences living in the quiet agricultural community 120 miles east of san diego calexico has long celebrated its interdependent relationship with mexicali  its sister city directly across the line  the two cities downtowns are bisected by pillars where the border lies  shoppers from urban mexicali  which has a population of about 1 million  are vital to calexicos small town economy and cross to shop at large outlet stores on the american side  americans head to the mexican side on weekends for cheap health care  entertainment and concerts were right up against each other  each city depends on the other  said hildy carrillo  the executive director of the calexico chamber of commerce  who like ms  hurtado did not vote for mr  trump  the families are on both sides of the border  the businesses are on both sides of the border  and the education  the entertainment and the culture are on both sides of the border  punto  read about how charities are stepping in to help released migrants  rather than a border wall  residents here express enthusiasm for modernizing the calexico west port of entry  which they hope will expedite traffic and allow for a fluid flow of business between the two sides  the number of legal northbound crossers each day  leading to hourslong lines  is astounding  about 20 000 pedestrians and up to 20 000 vehicles  according to the general services administration ground was broken in 2015 on the first stage of the renovation  a  121 9 million project completed in september 2018  town officials are hopeful the second phase will be funded by congress we have been waiting for that funding  for years  for our port of entry  ms  hurtado said  thats been our struggle  we dont need a wall  weve been struggling to get the money for the door  the presidents previous threats to shut down the border had also concerned her  were depressed and youre going to kill us if you shut things down  its like  help us by knowing us  you know after mr  trumps tweet about the border wall  ms  hurtado had t shirts made and distributed  they read  its not a wall the high volume of legal traffic does not mean that illegal border crossings do not happen here  the risk those migrants pose  however  and the characterization of the numbers who jump the fence is enormously overstated  ms  carrillo said the real danger  many here said  lies in drug trafficking conducted through sophisticated tunnel systems built by cartels during a drive through downtown calexico  victor carrillo  ms  carrillos cousin and a former city council member  mayor and county supervisor  pointed to a house where federal authorities found an expansive underground tunnel in 2016 that ran from the united states to mexico  as he drove  mr  carrillo and a friend pointed to other areas where tunnels were found  where sink holes formed because of attempted burrowing and where the authorities suspect there could be new tunnels theyre everywhere  every new apartment complex you see go up  you figure there might be a tunnel there  mr  carrillo said a wall  he pointed out  does not even begin to address that problem the politics of the imperial valley are generally not with the president  the county gave hillary clinton 68 percent of the vote in 2016 compared with 27 percent for mr  trump  the 51st congressional district  which runs along the southern border from the arizona border to san diego  supported the incumbent democrat  representative juan vargas  with 71 percent of the vote versus 29 percent for his republican challenger  eighty four percent of imperial county residents are latino  according to 2018 data by the united states census bureau that is not to say that there are not people here and in the broader imperial valley  which is a large agricultural region  who support the presidents policies  but in calexico  it seems  few like to speak about it publicly  and even some of those who lean conservative have reservations about the presidents talk on immigration john renison  70  an army veteran and longtime calexico resident who is a former city council member and county supervisor  began his political career here in the 1990s as a republican but is reluctant to identify with either party today  but he said the barbed wire running through calexico is a distasteful statement  as is  he said  the presidents general rhetoric about immigration we do not have a crisis on the border  we are not in fear of being invaded like he said  mr  renison said  whats really laughable is you think youre going to stop illegal immigration by constructing walls and fences .

as president trump declared a national emergency on friday to bypass congress and build his long promised wall  he again painted a portrait of a lawless  chaotic border and cited arguments about the effectiveness of the kind of barrier he has in mind that were not rooted in facts illegal border crossings have been declining for decades  while families are overwhelming an immigration system devised to handle single men  a border wall would not prevent them from seeking asylum  which is legal  research does not show that immigrants commit more crimes than native born americans  and a wall would do little to prevent drugs and human trafficking at the border  as official ports of entry are the main route into the united states for both cumulatively  mr  trumps unsupported or misleading statements undercut his rationale for declaring an emergency  a step that is widely viewed as testing both constitutional and political norms and is sure to draw legal challenges  mr  trump is correct that there were 23 murders in el paso last year  compared with more than 1 200 murders in ciudad jurez  mexico  but the disparity predates the existence of border barriers separating the two towns in 2007  the year before border fencing construction began  el paso reported 17 murders while jurez recorded about 320 homicides  before the drug war between cartels escalated in 2010  after the barriers were largely completed  el paso recorded five murders before the number increased to 16 a year later  that same year  murders in jurez topped 3 600 before declining to over 2 000 in 2011  mr  trump was referring to the flow of drugs across the border and disputing arguments that most smuggling takes place not in remote areas where a wall might be built but through authorized border crossing points  or ports of entry  the relevant statistics come from mr  trumps own agencies  not democrats  data from customs and border protection shows that 80 percent to 90 percent of heroin  cocaine  methamphetamine and fentanyl is seized at ports of entry  marijuana is the exception   the drug enforcement administration noted that a small percentage of all heroin is seized at areas between ports of entry you can  for example  the justice department recently detailed how an international sex trafficking ring committed visa fraud to transport women from thailand into the united states and coerce them into the sex trade  about 80 percent of human trafficking victims passed through official ports of entry  according to a decades worth of data collected by the counter trafficking data collaborative  the polaris project  a group that works to prevent human trafficking in the united states  said in a statement that out of nearly 50 000 cases it has handled  the vast majority of victims arrive through ports of entry  israel built a wall along its border with egypt in 2013  and it has proved to be effective  israeli officials have said that illegal crossings decreased to 12 in 2014 from more than 16 000 in 2011  a 99 percent reduction whether that example could be applied to the united states is another matter  as politifact has reported  the border between israel and egypt is much shorter than the united states mexico border  along flat land as opposed to mountainous terrain  israel also invested in technology and manpower to guard its border mr  trump is right that previous presidents have issued 58 national emergency declarations since 1978  30 of which are still in effect  but those declarations have largely dealt with crises and conflicts abroad examples include blocking transactions with the taliban  prohibiting the importation of diamonds from sierra leone  placing restrictions on north korea and allowing faster treatment during the swine flu outbreak in 2009 mr  trumps declaration  however  is extraordinary in that it addresses a domestic policy issue and involves redirecting money without the approval of congress the funding deal passed by congress on thursday authorized  1 375 billion for border fencing  which is less than the  1 6 billion that senators proposed last june and that mr  trump rejected  asked about his reaction to the reduced funding  mr  trump misleadingly cited comments made by speaker nancy pelosi at a news conference in january  while the government was still partially shut down  ms  pelosi jokingly said that she would agree to give mr  trump  1 for his border wall  but ms  pelosi and democrats have consistently drawn a distinction between the wall and border security  referring to employing technology enhancements and additional personnel as well as barriers  at that same january news conference  ms  pelosi and other democrats promoted a bill that included  1 3 billion for border fencing and would have temporarily reopened the government  mr  trump also repeated four other claims about immigration and his border wall that the new york times has previously fact checked  curious about the accuracy of a claim  email factcheck nytimes com  .
el paso  texas  the battle of the border was an epic desert showdown between two gifted politicians  each marshaling around 10 000 people  one blessed with the truth  the other peddling lies  and yet  to donald trumps mystifying credit  the lie survived to fight another day  we tell some tall tales here in texas  but no texan is a match for this president as day broke here in my hometown yesterday  it looked like after years  mr  trumps lies about the border had finally run out  amid his showdown with democrats over his proposed border wall  which had already led to an unpopular 35 day long government shutdown  mr  trump was coming to el paso to make his case once again  build the wall  the people of el paso  with the local hero and presidential hamlet beto orourke as their public face  had a response  were safe not because of walls but in spite of walls  were safe not in spite of immigrants but because of immigrants ahead of the presidents visit  normally taciturn local politicians turned on mr  trump for falsely claiming in recent weeks that el paso  the second largest border city in america  was swamped by an immigrant crime wave until a fence went up  the english language daily  el paso times  proclaimed  local leaders ready to tell el pasos story  the spanish language daily  el diario  more startlingly heralded  el paso  national battleground  the officially nonpartisan mayor  dee margo  laid into mr  trump on twitter  outraged  el paso was never one of the most dangerous cities in the u s as air force one approached  winds whipped up to 50 miles per hour as people streamed toward the county coliseum  formerly a site for livestock shows and rodeos  where mr  trump held what amounted to his kickoff rally for the 2020 election  this is not trump country  after all  hed branded the entire border  where millions of americans live  a violent wasteland  business leaders groused that the president had been bad for business  endangering  70 billion in local trade with mexico while scaring away businesses with tales of immigrant mayhem  the county commissioners court is on the record opposing a wall cutting through downtown  el paso voted nearly 3 to 1 against him in 2016 for a moment  it seemed the president would finally get his comeuppance here  a definitive and undeniable repudiation of his monstrous and unpopular pet project on the merits  mr  trump should lose the battle hands down  the crime rate in el paso peaked in 1993  then it fell steadily for years finally settling at about 370 violent crimes per 100 000 people  lower than a city el pasos size  like  say  boston or the national average organized by some 50 local groups  the march for truth gathered at least as many or even more people than mr  trumps rally  winding its way to a field directly across from the county coliseum  some skewered mr  trump  sure  not today  satan  read one sign  but most people  like cathy benavidez  a retired social worker  came to defend their hometowns reputation  im just embarrassed by what trump has said because its not true  ms  benavidez said  her hand lettered sign said  in glitter  stop the wall  stop the lies  el paso has always been safe mr  orourke appeared in shirt sleeves  despite plummeting temperatures  but with his usual upbeat attitude  in a brief interview over the rising voice of a mariachi singer  he said  this is el paso so i want to take every opportunity to support the cause  the culture and the community he helped bring out 10 000 supporters  according to local organizers  maybe as many as 15 000  mr  trump brought 6 700 to the old rodeo arena  according to the fire department  with a few thousand more stamping their feet in front of the parking lot jumbotron  the truth  or at least the facts  made steady progress in el paso but that didnt stop the lies  like mr  trump claiming 35 000 people came to see him while just 200 went to see mr  orourke  there is nothing the president wont lie about  he even encouraged followers to chant finish that wall  though theres been no construction since he became president on any kind of wall he promised  just fences ordered up since 2006  i tried to count the lies during his speech but had to stop after 10  my stetson is off  the guy is a gifted and gratuitously generous liar thanks to a powerful border wall in el paso  texas  it is one of the safest cities  he insisted even after the uproar  and the crowd roared  of course  i had parked my car by the 18 foot bollard border fence a block away  there was no wall  just like there were no 10 000 maga fans milling around outside but the truth is plodding  getting its pants on  one leg at a time  while a lie races halfway around the world  as the old saw attributed to mark twain goes  mr  trumps tales of kidnappings and mayhem  too  are far more racy than the truth  el paso has problems  the international bridges carry tens of millions of people  cars  trucks and rail cars each year  theyre not getting inspected  but that is tedious  i grew up here and el paso does have a crisis  too much poverty and too little education  but that is boring mr  trumps lies are dime novel  pulp fiction  heart pounding  mesmerizing and thats where they derive their power  regardless  word came that evening that congressional negotiators would give mr  trump about  1 billion for more steel barriers  which he will call a wall and then declare victory  it will be anything but that the presidents biggest cheerleader  lindsey graham  is absolutely right when he says the wall has become a metaphor  and henri rafael  a trump fan i met at the rally  is absolutely right  too  a border wall is very much needed  but its not about the wall anymore  his friend in a pink maga hat  monica demoss  chimed in  these people need to go out and work the wall is about whatever you want it to be about  welfare  immigrants  race  class  socialism  you name it  it will never be an actual  30 foot wall from sea to shining sea  as mr  trump once promised  he is  in fact  losing on the merits  bit by bit  but he will still get his monument  a metaphor that just as effectively divides the nation  even if a real wall never divides the border here  in el paso ill hand it to the guy  no texan could tell a taller tale .
to the editor re 12 g o p  senators defect to block emergency move  front page  march 15  perhaps  given the times  it is remarkable that 12 republican senators defied president trumps trampling on the separation of powers by voting to block his national emergency declaration over border wall funding  but more remarkable is that 41 republicans did not join them it is spineless to fail to challenge this president on a blatant  authoritarian type power grab that defies the constitution that the senators have sworn to uphold  it is craven to cast a vote out of fear that mr  trump will seek revenge by suggesting that someone else ought to hold your senate seat if you do not bend to his will  and yet  this is what they did so while we give a shout out to those 12 republican senators who made the principled call  let us ponder what it says about the ones who did not felicia massarskyatlantic cityto the editor re cracks in the senates red wall  editorial  march 15  let us not overreact to this action by a handful of republican senators  it is not nearly time to suggest mr  trumps unfettered desecration of our democracy is nearing a conclusion  what mr  trump did was blatantly defy the will of congress in his declaration of a national emergency  it was not the policy but merely the procedure  the stripping of the power of congress to control the purse strings  that was the precipitating cause for this mini revolt but fundamentally this was little but a symbolic slap on the wrist  quickly undone by presidential veto  and life will quickly return to the normal that we have unfortunately come to know there will be no talk  at least no serious talk  of republicans joining in a call for impeachment  there has been no growing of a backbone  no declaration that this is an irreparable bridge too far  it is a welcome moment when there is even a hint of something other than pure capitulation to mr  trumps whims and tantrums  but unless and until he puts a crown on and announces he is now king  there will be no republican mutiny  just the occasional reminder that some in his party will not permit the president to cast all their votes for them robert s  nussbaumfort lee  n j  .
washington  so it has come to this  the president of the united states was asked over the weekend whether he is a russian agent  and he refused to directly answer the question  which came from a friendly interviewer  not one of the fake media journalists he disparages  was the most insulting thing ive ever been asked  he declared  but it is a question that has hung over his presidency now for two years if the now 23 day government shutdown standoff between mr  trump and congress has seemed ugly  it may eventually seem tame in light of what is to come  the border wall fight is just the preliminary skirmish in this new era of divided government  the real battle has yet to begin with democrats now in charge of the house  the special counsel believed to be wrapping up his investigation  news media outlets competing for scoops and the first articles of impeachment already filed  mr  trump faces the prospect of an all out political war for survival that may make the still unresolved partial government shutdown pale by comparison the last few days have offered plenty of foreshadowing  the newly empowered democrats summoned the presidents longtime personal lawyer to testify after he implicated mr  trump in an illegal scheme to arrange hush payments before the 2016 election for women who claimed to have had affairs with him  legal papers disclosed that mr  trumps onetime campaign chairman shared polling data with an associate tied by prosecutors to russian intelligence new reports over the weekend added to the sense of siege at the white house  the new york times reported that after mr  trump fired the f b i  director  james b  comey  in 2017  the bureau opened an investigation into whether the president was working for the russians  and the washington post reported that mr  trump has gone out of his way as president to hide the details of his discussions with president vladimir v  putin of russia even from members of his own administration what all this adds up to remains unclear  whether it will lead to a full blown impeachment inquiry in the house has yet to be decided  but it underscores the chance that with candidates already lining up to take him on in 2020  washington will spend the months to come debating the future of mr  trumps presidency and the direction of the country the reality  said andy surabian  a republican strategist and former special assistant to mr  trump  is that the next two years are going to be nonstop political war the white house has begun recruiting soldiers  the new white house counsel  pat cipollone  has hired 17 new lawyers  according to the post  as he prepares for a barrage of subpoenas from house democratic committee chairmen but mr  trumps inner circle has shrunk  and he has fewer advisers around him whom he trusts  his white house chief of staff is still serving in an acting capacity  and the west wing is depleted by the shutdown  as he himself wrote on twitter this weekend  theres almost nobody in the w h  but me mr  surabian said the rest of the party must recognize the threat and rally behind the president  republicans need to understand that democrats in congress  beholden to the resistance  arent interested in bipartisanship  theyre out for blood  he said  its a war we can win  he added  but only with fortitude  unity  coherent messaging and a willingness to fight back democrats  for their part  say they are out for accountability  not blood  intent on forcing a president who went largely unchecked by a republican congress during his first two years in office to come clean on the many scandals that have erupted involving his business  taxes  campaign and administration they plan to get started in the coming days  on tuesday  they will grill former attorney general william p  barr  who has been nominated by mr  trump to assume his old office again  about his approach to the special counsel  robert s  mueller iii  mr  barr wrote a private memo last year criticizing mr  muellers investigation  and democrats will use his confirmation hearings to press him on whether the special counsel will be allowed to finish his work and report it to congress senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic minority leader  also plans to force a vote in the senate this week on the trump administrations plans to lifts sanctions on the companies of oleg v  deripaska  a russian oligarch close to mr  putins government  if he reduces his ownership stakes  democrats plan to use the issue to argue that mr  trump has been soft on russia even committees that are not usually in the investigation business are jumping into the fray  representative eliot l  engel  democrat of new york and the new chairman of the house foreign affairs committee  told the new yorker last week that he was eliminating the subcommittee on terrorism in favor of a subcommittee aimed at investigating mr  trumps foreign policy lost in all this may be any chance of bipartisan policymaking  at stake in the current fight is just  5 7 billion for mr  trumps promised border wall  roughly one eighth of one percent of the total federal budget  if one eighth of one percent of the total budget can prompt the longest government shutdown in american history  then the potential for further clashes over the remaining 99 87 percent seems considerable  on issues like health care  taxes  climate change  guns and national security  the two sides start this era of divided government far apart thats the flashing yellow light here  said mayor rahm emanuel of chicago  a former top white house aide to presidents bill clinton and barack obama  if you cant do government 101  what makes you think youre going to do advanced placement government like finding the money for an infrastructure bill julian epstein  who was the counsel for democrats on the house judiciary committee during mr  clintons impeachment fight 20 years ago  said big issues like a shrinking middle class largely untrained for the 21st century economy would go unaddressed during the battles to come the political class is now addicted to manichaean conflict as a way of life  mr  epstein said  its become the mothers milk  for base voters in both parties who together make up a minority share of voters  for cable television and for social media given the investigations  mr  trump may prefer a battle over the wall as more favorable ground to fight even with 800 000 federal workers furloughed or forced to work without pay  polls suggest he is not winning with the broader public but has rallied his base in the fight more americans blame mr  trump for the government shutdown than blame democrats  and most oppose a border wall  according to a new survey by the post and abc news  but support for a wall has grown over the last year from 34 percent to 42 percent  fueled largely by republicans  while opposition has slipped from 63 percent to 54 percent negotiations have broken down  while mr  trump had gambled that speaker nancy pelosi  democrat of california  would back down  she has made clear that she has no interest in compromise  she and mr  schumer have insisted that mr  trump reopen the government while negotiations over a border wall proceed  which the president has refused to do  mr  trump walked out of their talks last week after he asked ms  pelosi if she would support his wall if he reopened the government and she said no its all about their own sense of strength  said john feehery  a former senior house republican aide  pelosi wants to be validated  she wants to be seen as a strong leader  trump feels like he has to govern through strength  this is strength versus strength  unfortunately  the people in the middle are the government workers who cant afford to lose a paycheck instead of talks to end the shutdown  the president spent at least part of his weekend defending himself against the suspicions about his affinity for mr  putin  he insisted that he has actually been tougher on russia than his predecessors and that the f b i  was led by losers that tried to do a number on your president he picked up the telephone on saturday night to call into the fox news show hosted by jeanine pirro  who participated in a campaign rally with him last fall  she asked him about the f b i  investigation reported by the times with a tone of scorn im going to ask you  are you now or have you ever worked for russia  mr  president  ms  pirro asked i think its the most insulting thing ive ever been asked  he answered  i think its the most insulting article ive ever had written  and if you read the article  youd see that they found absolutely nothing she then cited the post article about his efforts to conceal details of his private meetings with mr  putin  we had a great conversation  he said  we were talking about israel and securing israel and lots of other things  and it was a great conversation  im not keeping anything under wraps  i couldnt care less ms  pirro expressed sympathy for the battles he was waging youve got such fight in you  its unbelievable  she said well  he answered  i guess i have good genes .
washington  the tentative deal reached late monday by congressional negotiators to avert another government shutdown brought to the fore something president trump has rarely seen in his time in office  reality based programming with mr  trump holding firm to his demand for a border wall with mexico  republicans and democrats on capitol hill adopted another approach  namely flexibility the agreement in principle is a new challenge for mr  trump as he navigates a divided government here are some key takeaways from the possible accord mr  trump has rarely wavered in his arguments for a border wall  many of them false  including several of those made monday night at a campaign rally in el paso the president insisted that the barriers built there on the border with mexico had helped drastically reduce crime  but republican and democratic local officials  and federal crime statistics  showed otherwise  trump repeats false claim about el paso crime  this time in el paso republicans in congress were mindful of this and the possible fallout from another shutdown  so they did what the president has chosen not to do  negotiate with democrats to try to fashion a solution the tentative deal does not come close to mr  trumps demands  but does represent what republicans were able to achieve given the strong resistance and the relative solidarity among democrats it delivers even less than a deal that vice president mike pence proposed to democrats in december  republicans yielded on money and wall construction  while democrats dropped demands for some aspects of migrant detention when asked if the president would sign the deal if congress approves  it  senator richard shelby  republican of alabama and chairman of the appropriations committee  told reporters  we think so  we hope so by almost any objective measure  the president cannot claim victory based on this deal  that does not mean he will not try  in recent days  he has shifted his rhetoric from building a wall to finishing a wall he was defiant at the rally in el paso  we need the wall and it has to be built  he said news of the possible deal broke just before mr  trump was to speak he had the option of receiving a briefing on the compromise or making a scheduled appearance with laura ingraham of fox news  he chose the latter  he has some work to do persuading his supporters on the right who see the wall as a core promise of his presidency  the early reviews were harsh  on fox  sean hannity called the deal a garbage compromise the president has retained the option of declaring a national emergency to build the border barrier  now he will have to decide whether to accept the deal that top members of his own party in congress negotiated  or to in effect go it alone if mr  trump were to declare a national emergency  the move would assuredly draw a court challenge  and would not help him in further negotiations with congress on other issues or he can continue to try to make the wall a potent issue of his 2020 re election campaign  arguing that if he had a republican controlled congress  he could deliver on his promise  that strategy failed in the 2018 midterm elections mr  trump is not the only one with political imperatives in the border security debate members of congress also possess a sense of self interest that exceeds their allegiance to the president  republicans in particular know that the wall is not broadly popular in the country  and that another government shutdown would probably hurt their party far more than democrats  that much of the impetus for compromise seemed to come from senate republicans  who hold a majority in their chamber  is a clear signal they want to move past this debate democrats were vulnerable  too  though  as they would shoulder a sizable share of the blame for another government shutdown  and they cannot advance their agenda to show a contrast with mr  trump and republicans if the government is closed congressional deals reached among small groups of even influential members have also been known to fall apart  for now  this deal looks promising  but nothing is final until it is final the compromise needs to be written into legislation  both chambers of congress need to pass it  and the president needs to sign it  all before friday to avert another government shutdown .
president trump has been eager to show progress on construction of his long promised wall on the border with mexico  so eager that on wednesday he sent a tweet showing the building of steel fencing in southern new mexico with the video sped up to add a sense of both efficiency and urgency he retweeted himself on thursday with the all caps proclamation the wall is under construction right now  this is misleading the government has built about 700 miles of wall and fencing along the border since 2006  the barriers  damaged by migrants trying to get through them or by the elements  need periodic repairs the section of the barrier that mr  trump showcased this week was not new construction  but rather replacement for existing fencing  the money for the steel slatted barrier came from a congressional appropriation in 2017  not from newly authorized spending in the recent deal that averted a government shutdown  or from money the president is seeking to take from other federal projects under his national emergency declaration from last week a construction contract for the replacement bollard fencing was awarded on jan  22  2018  to a company in montana  according to a news release from united states customs and border protection  the area of the border wall replacement will be a 20 mile section of existing vehicle barrier located just west of the santa teresa port of entry and extending westward in new mexico  the release said  the existing barrier will be replaced with an 18  to 30 foot high bollard style wall the contract called for the project to be completed in about 390 days  the agency also highlighted the benefits of the see through characteristics of the bollard wall mr  trump noted that the project finished ahead of schedule whether there will be new wall or fence construction in that area is an open question  new mexico is among the states suing the trump administration to challenge his emergency declaration curious about the accuracy of a claim  email factcheck nytimes com .

by insisting on a border wall  president trump is emphasizing an issue that may be popular with his base but seems unlikely to attract new supporters  there has been little polling since the government shutdown began last month  but what there is indicates that voters oppose a border wall  blame the president for the shutdown  believe the shutdown will have adverse consequences and dont believe the government should be shut down over the wall  the wall has consistently been unpopular  with voters opposed by around a 20 point margin over months of national surveys  that makes it even less popular than the president himself  support for the wall is closely tied to support for the president  though  over all  polls show it consistently tracks just a few points beneath the presidents approval rating  and support for the wall is almost exclusively confined to voters who already support the president  in new york times upshot siena college polls of eight battleground congressional districts this past fall  89 percent of voters views on the president and the wall were aligned  more than any other issues except the tax bill and the kavanaugh supreme court nomination  the relationship between support for the president and the wall is so tight that its hard not to wonder whether  at least for now  support for the wall is simply a function of support for the president  in other words  attitudes about president trump might drive attitudes about the wall  rather than the other way around  it wouldnt be much of a surprise  given how strongly voters feel about the president and the extent that hes emphasized the issue its hard to see how the issue can be used to help him win re election  midterm exit poll data  election results  voter file data and pre election polls indicate that the presidents approval rating is below 50 percent in states worth at least 317 electoral votes  270 are needed to win  thats actually a relatively healthy number for the president compared with his national approval rating  around 41 percent   but it could be a conservative estimate  and voters views might be unusually entrenched  given the stability of his ratings many presidents have won re election after a midterm drubbing  and mr  trumps approval rating isnt particularly far from what he may wind up needing  given the g o p s current advantage in the electoral college  but the wall has not helped so far  data from the fox news voter analysis of the midterms  a new competitor to the traditional exit polls  indicated that a majority of voters opposed the wall in states worth nearly 400 electoral votes  including in several states where the presidents approval rating was above water in the poll  like ohio and florida there is tentative evidence in the fox data that the wall is particularly unpopular in the relatively white and rural west  but somewhat more popular  at least with respect to the presidents approval rating  in the northeast and inland south  this would follow a familiar pattern in american politics  it mirrors the presidents support in the presidential primary and tracks with longstanding measures of racial resentment  even so  the wall still isnt popular in michigan or pennsylvania  important battleground states  and voters in ohio  a politically similar state  opposed the wall none of these polls account for the government shutdown  but attitudes about it are unlikely to be fluid given the lack of movement on the wall during the trump presidency  tying the issue to an unpopular shutdown seems particularly unlikely to help and  historically  voters tend to drift against the policy preferences of the presidents party  thats already evident on immigration more generally  polls show voters more supportive of immigration than ever before  for all of the focus on the presidents base over the last two years  there is not much reason to think that the base  alone  is enough for the president to win re election in a one on one race against a viable democratic candidate  this could change  it has before  but with the midterms over  this is now the central political challenge facing the president  by that measure  its hard to see where a shutdown over the wall fits in .
an undocumented immigrant who worked at one of president trumps golf clubs in new jersey for years and recently spoke out about her experience will attend his state of the union address after being invited by her democratic congresswoman  the womans lawyer and the congresswomans office said wednesday the undocumented immigrant  victorina morales  had worked as a housekeeper at the trump national golf club in bedminster  n j   since 2013  and spoke to the new york times as part of an article published last month  the report revealed that the presidents company  the trump organization  was  for years  employing people at the golf club who are in the country illegally in a brief interview on wednesday  ms  morales said that on the advice of her lawyer  she stopped going to work on dec  4  two days before the times article was published  still  the lawyer  anibal romero  said that neither he nor his client had received notice that she had been fired  he said ms  moraless employment status with the golf club was not entirely clear since leaving her job  ms  morales  who is from guatemala  has campaigned for rights and fair treatment for undocumented immigrants  on wednesday  she said she was pleased to have been invited to the state of the union  that she has accepted the invitation and that she was very proud because i am going to raise my voice for all of us immigrants im not scared to show my face  she said  speaking in spanish  i am not speaking for me  im speaking on behalf of millions of undocumented immigrants who live in the united states the congresswoman  bonnie watson coleman  represents the new jersey district in which ms  morales lives  the news that ms  morales had been invited to attend tuesdays state of the union address as ms  watson colemans guest was reported by the washington post on wednesday immigrants by and large are hardworking  trustworthy and skilled people who simply want to work and build better lives here  ms  watson coleman said in a statement  for years these kinds of people were loyal and dedicated enough to be trump organization employees  i hope that in his state of the union address  donald trump will finally acknowledge the real face of immigrants in this country  women and children fleeing violence  law abiding  taxpaying people who would do almost anything to be americans  and if he cant  ive invited victorina so that he may look her in her eyes to tell his lies to a familiar face the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment on wednesday evening mr  trump has made border security and protecting jobs for americans cornerstones of his presidency  and his insistence on building a border wall led to the recent partial government shutdown  he has labeled illegal immigration a major  major problem  and pledged to build a border wall while his administration has carried out workplace raids and payroll audits the times article  published dec  6  said undocumented immigrants had been employed for years at the trump national golf club as housekeepers  landscapers and kitchen staff  it also said they were kept on the payroll even though management was aware they had used phony documents to secure employment  as is common among undocumented immigrants ms  morales previously told the times that a manager at bedminster had helped her secure a new fake social security number and legal permanent residency card after telling her that those on file had expired since the article was published  about a dozen workers deemed ineligible to work in the united states because they lacked legal immigration status have been terminated at the bedminster club  according to people familiar with the matter another dozen were fired at the trump national golf club in westchester county  n y   this month  a development first reported by the washington post the trump organization also said late tuesday that it was putting in place a system to weed out undocumented immigrants who try to get jobs at its properties i must say  for me personally  this whole thing is truly heartbreaking  eric trump  an executive vice president with the trump organization  said in the statement on tuesday  our employees are like family  but when presented with fake documents  an employer has little choice he said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the trump organization  and that it demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately .
washington  president donald trump may have threatened to transport illegal immigrants to so called sanctuary cities to  make everybody crazy  and generate media attention  republican u s  senator rick scott said on sunday trump said on friday he was considering sending illegal immigrants to sanctuary cities  prompting u s  mayors to accept such an offer as the battle over border security rages  sanctuary cities are local jurisdictions that generally give undocumented immigrants safe harbor by refusing to use their resources to help enforce federal immigration laws that could lead to deportations  since many such jurisdictions are democratic strongholds  the proposal was seen by critics of trump as an attempt by the president to punish democrats for refusing to support funding for the construction of a wall on the southern u s  border it would  however  likely encounter a slew of logistical and legal obstacles  with some legal experts and advocacy groups saying the proposal could violate federal laws  including those barring the use of government funds for political purposes speaking to cnn s  state of the union   scott said he did not know if transporting immigrants to these jurisdictions was legal or illegal  and he suggested the president could be bluffing   i mean maybe he s just saying this to make everybody crazy  make everybody talk about it on their shows  scott  a former florida governor who was elected to the u s  senate in november  has generally kept his distance from trump and criticized him in the past over immigration policies and other issues frustrated by rising numbers of undocumented immigrants arriving at the southern border and a failure to get congress to fully fund a u s  mexico border wall  trump has sought to taunt democrats by dangling the possibility of an influx of illegal immigrants into their communities  scott acknowledged the president s frustration over a lack of progress on addressing the influx of migrants  but said the administration had to comply with the law   i m sure the president is very frustrated because we re not securing our border  the democrats are stopping this  but we have to comply with every law  late on saturday  trump wrote on twitter that the united states  has the absolute legal right  to transfer apprehended illegal immigrants to sanctuary cities  without citing evidence    t his includes gang members  drug dealers  human traffickers  and criminals of all shapes  sizes and kinds   he wrote on sunday  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders told abc news   this week  that administration staff had initially concluded that transporting immigrants to sanctuary cities may prove too logistically challenging  but that the white house was exploring its options because  the president likes the idea    we re looking to see if there are options that make it possible and doing a full and thorough and extensive review   sanders said  since democrats have said they would welcome these individuals   everybody gets a win out of it   she added    reporting by michelle price  editing by nick zieminski and daniel wallis .
santa rosa de copan  honduras  hundreds of hondurans traveling in vehicles and on foot converged on the guatemalan border on tuesday  part of a new migrant caravan bound for the united states which president trump has already used as fresh ammunition in his fight for border wall funding the caravan began departing from the northern honduran city of san pedro sula on monday night  others set off throughout the day on tuesday  honduran authorities estimated that between 800 and 1 000 people were in the caravan  while officials from honduras national human rights commission put the range between 1 500 and 2 000 mr  trump  whose dispute with congress over his demand for  5 7 billion for a border wall between mexico and the united states has led to a partial shutdown of the federal government since dec  22  warned on twitter on tuesday about the new mass migration a big new caravan is heading up to our southern border from honduras  he wrote  only a wall  or steel barrier  will keep our country safe  stop playing political games and end the shutdown the new caravan is following in the footsteps of several other large migrant groups that left central america last fall and crossed guatemala and mexico  with thousands of participants ending up in or near the city of tijuana in northern mexico the trump administration has excoriated central american and mexican governments for failing to stop the caravans  which met little resistance at the various international borders they crossed on the way north in a show of muscle on tuesday  however  the honduran government vowed vigilance at its border with guatemala and said it had detained 60 minors without proper travel documents to leave honduras the border and the illegal crossings are reinforced  julin pacheco  the honduran security minister  told reporters on tuesday  if people are going to leave  they have to leave through legal  authorized points the mexican government has also vowed to harden its southern border to block the passage of any undocumented migrants in the latest caravan  olga snchez  the countrys interior minister  said that officials had identified about 370 illegal points of entry along its border with guatemala and planned to monitor them to prevent illegal crossings tens of thousands of hondurans and other central americans have migrated north in recent years  fleeing rampant violence and poverty  some have chosen to move in large  semi coordinated groups or caravans  offering participants a degree of security against the many perils that lurk on the migrant trail  including muggings  extortion and rape until last year  most caravans went largely unnoticed  but a migration that began in southern mexico last spring drew the attention of mr  trump  who warned that the group posed a threat to the united states sovereignty an even larger group set off from honduras in october  drawing the ire of mr  trump as well as international media attention  it was followed by other groups and by mid november  more than 6 000 migrants  nearly all from central america  had made it as far as tijuana hundreds of them have applied for asylum in the united states while others have tried to cross the border illegally  still others have decided to remain in mexico  availing themselves of the mexican governments offer of humanitarian visas and work permits  hundreds more  frustrated with their inability to cross legally into the united states  have been voluntarily repatriated to their homes in central america but neither the dashed hopes of so many from last years caravans nor mr  trumps threats seemed to discourage many of the participants in the latest caravan even though a wall is being built  thats not going to stop us  said junior aleman  17  who was walking with a group of about a dozen migrants through the mountains of western honduras on tuesday  the group had left san pedro sula on monday night and  through a combination of walking and hitching rides  were making their way toward the honduras guatemala border crossing at agua caliente he intended to try to cross illegally into the united states and head for virginia  where two of his aunts lived  there  he said  he planned to find a job  something that had been hard to come by in honduras theres no work and i want to help my family  he said .
west palm beach  fla   president trump would not commit in an interview aired sunday to making public the results of the special counsels investigation into russias ties to his campaign  adding that it was time to get rid of the inquiry in the interview on cbss face the nation  mr  trump reiterated his belief that the attorney general would determine whether the public would see the results of the inquiry by the special counsel  robert s  mueller iii  but he would not say whether he would be comfortable with the results being made public i dont know  the president said  it depends  i have no idea what its going to say the law does not require the justice department to release a report  and mr  mueller has been silent on the issue  last month  trump advisers were pleased that william p  barr  mr  trumps nominee for attorney general  opened the door to the possibility that the special counsels report could be shielded from the public during a senate confirmation hearing mr  trumps wide ranging interview with margaret brennan  the shows host  was conducted days after the acting attorney general  matthew g  whitaker  said the investigation was nearing its end  and amid stagnant negotiations with democrats over mr  trumps demand for a border wall  mr  trump indicated at various points in the interview that he would use the power of his office to solve that matter and others facing his presidency among those matters  the president appeared to suggest  are national security and the military  he called the use of military force against venezuela an option  and he indicated that he would like to keep troops in iraq  a striking departure from his push to withdraw from afghanistan and syria  to keep an eye on iran its perfectly situated for looking at all over different parts of the troubled middle east rather than pulling up  mr  trump said  were going to keep watching and were going to keep seeing and if theres trouble  if somebody is looking to do nuclear weapons or other things  were going to know it before they do on the border wall fight  the president reiterated his belief that we have now set the table to take action after a short term deal to fund part of the government  a deal struck to end the longest government shutdown in history  expires on feb  15  in an interview with the new york times on thursday  mr  trump suggested that he had successfully made the case to americans that the problem at the border was enough to constitute declaring a national emergency  and that nancy pelosi  the house speaker  was doing a disservice to the country  both points he again made on sunday people that didnt have any idea  mr  trump said  they didnt have a clue as to what was happening  they now know exactly whats happening mr  trump is expected to make immigration a cornerstone of his state of the union speech  which is scheduled for tuesday  in the interview with cbs  mr  trump once again accused democrats  in particular ms  pelosi  of ignoring urgent problems at the border  which included human trafficking and what mr  trump called an invasion of human traffickers into the country though mr  trump seems intent on ignoring congressional negotiations  lawmakers insisted on sunday that they were still trying  senator richard c  shelby  the chairman of the senate appropriations committee and a member of the committee working to reach a deal  admitted that it was too early to say whether the negotiations could be successful i think that the president is dead set on keeping his campaign promise  mr  shelby  republican of alabama  said on cnns state of the union  he acknowledged that mr  trump probably had some legal merits for declaring a national emergency over the border wall  but he pleaded for the committee to be allowed to do its work if people leave us alone  mr  shelby added  well get this done by wednesday night he said that the committee had invited experts with knowledge of the southwestern border to testify this week on exactly what is needed for border security  mr  shelby expressed optimism that hearing from those experts could move us off of the semantic debate over a wall or fencing its a question of how do we get off the politics and on to the substance  he said other members of the bipartisan committee  representative henry cuellar  democrat of texas  and senator john hoeven  republican of north dakota  doubled down on their respective partys positions on fox news sunday  mr  cuellar  who represents parts of the border  dismissed the presidents reasoning for the wall as built on a false premise in the cbs interview  mr  trump fought back against criticism of his wall and other policies  he responded to warnings that his administration was risking a resurgence of terrorist groups by promising the rapid withdrawal of troops from syria and afghanistan by saying that he ran against 17 republicans and won ill leave intelligence there  mr  trump said  and if i see nests forming  ill do something about it last week  mr  trump showed similar defiance in suggesting that his intelligence chiefs go back to school for issuing a threat assessment saying that north korea was unlikely to give up its nuclear program and that iran is not  for now  taking steps necessary to make a bomb mr  trump said that he would ultimately rely on his own counsel if he disagreed with intelligence assessments the president also indicated that the power of his affectionate letter writing with kim jong un  the north korean leader  might persuade mr  kim to drop his nuclear plans  mr  trump has at least six letters from mr  kim that he enjoys sharing with people who visit him in the oval office we have had tremendous correspondence that some people have seen and cant even believe it  mr  trump said  now that doesnt mean were going to make a deal  but certainly i think we have a very good chance of making a deal other leaders did not receive such praise  mr  trump said that he had declined a meeting with nicols maduro  the embattled president of venezuela  days after the trump administration said it recognized juan guaid  the 35 year old opposition figure  as the countrys rightful leader i decided at the time  no  because so many really horrible things have been happening in venezuela when you look at that country  mr  trump said with his cabinet in flux  mr  trump dismissed as fake news the reports that senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  had asked mike pompeo  the secretary of state and his most visible emissary in negotiations with north korea  to consider leaving to run for a senate seat in kansas mr  pompeo confirmed that discussion over a week ago  the secretary of state said that he had appreciated the call  but that he had a very full plate the cbs interview was broadcast during the presidents first visit in months to mar a lago  his florida estate  where he spent saturday golfing with tiger woods and jack nicklaus  on sunday  the president hit the golf course again amid planning for his annual super bowl party the president told cbs that he loved to watch football  but that he would not encourage his youngest son  barron  12  to participate in such a dangerous sport .
donald trump has a congress problem  he cant get republicans to promote his policies  and when he forces the issue  as with his border wall  he cant win their support but most americans dont know that  after all  republican legislators voted with the president well over 90 percent of the time during the 115th congress  record numbers of appellate judges were confirmed  and the president signed major tax legislation  many observers have concluded that mr  trump dominates the republican party  and his loyal base holds congressional republicans tautly in line but discerning legislative influence is more difficult than it appears  throughout the first two years of the trump presidency  republican leaders in congress skillfully used a variety of tactics to minimize the presidents influence and maximize their own control over public policy critically  congressional republicans have adopted strategies that make the public  and more important  his conservative base  think mr  trump is in command  to casual followers of political news  the visible evidence from congressional votes and news releases suggests a powerful president leading a loyal congressional party  in reality  republican legislators have hidden their influence  purposefully disguising a weak president with little clout on capitol hill while also preserving party unity in his 1960 book  presidential power and the modern presidents  the political scientist richard neustadt argued that presidential power is the power to persuade  strong presidents have significant influence over public policy because they wield informal power  developing a reputation for getting their way and punishing those who impede their progress  weak presidents  like mr  trump  fail to persuade  allowing competing political actors in washington to block their goals and assert their own influence mr  neustadt identified a second resource that aids in presidential persuasion  public prestige  political actors in washington may not fear the president  but they may think twice about standing in his way if they perceive the public response to doing so may hurt them on this dimension  mr  trump appears to be stronger  his overall approval rating is very poor  but he is extremely popular among republican voters  and his sizable conservative base is ready and willing to turn on elected republicans in primary elections should they displease the president  the infrastructure of conservative media  fox news  talk radio  strongly supports  and influences  mr  trump  augmenting this public power  mr  trump may not have much ability to sway democrats  but republican officials credibly fear crossing him nevertheless  congressional republicans have found a solution to this challenge  agenda setting  political power is not simply the ability to influence the positions citizens or lawmakers take on issues  but also the ability to control what issues are discussed and voted on throughout the last congress  republican leaders simply declined to take up legislation that reflected the priority of the president but not their own  there were no votes on immigration restrictions or funding for a border wall  protectionist trade legislation or infrastructure the trump budget proposals for the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years requested deep cuts in nondefense discretionary spending  congressional republicans quietly buried them and delivered bills both years that increased nondefense spending such negative agenda setting leaves little trace  without a vote  it becomes difficult for opponents or voters to identify or understand what happened  president trumps priorities werent voted down in the house or the senate  they were just never considered agenda setting also provides congressional leaders positive power to set legislative priorities  mr  trump has famously shown little interest in the details of policy  and republican leaders in washington easily convinced him to accept as his priorities the partys orthodox issues of affordable care act repeal and tax cuts during his first year in office by setting the agenda and having the president sign on  republican legislators controlled policy while sharing the position of the president  when republicans held a white house celebration after passing tax legislation  mr  trump claimed credit  and legislators publicly praised the trump tax bill  and the president himself this trade off  in which orthodox republicans get policy control and mr  trump gets the glory  is also apparent in the nominations of judges and executive branch officials  the president was quite successful in having judicial nominees confirmed  but virtually all of his confirmed judges have been standard conservatives  likewise  his successful executive branch appointments much more reflect republican priorities than his own by privately influencing mr  trump to nominate people who reflect republican priorities  congressional leaders not only win substantively  but the president gets to show off a perfect record of confirmations on the senate floor  and a high rate of republican support for his nominees despite this  mr  trump has had an unusually large number of nominees rejected by the senate  many of whom were put forth without previous input from congressional leaders  but this  too  has been done less visibly  with candidates withdrawing or being defeated in committee rather than being rejected in actual votes on the senate floor the logic of agenda setting also explains the reticence of congressional republicans to conduct meaningful oversight of mr  trump or his administration  full scale legitimate investigations require visible agenda setting  they cannot be accomplished by omission or in private negative and positive agenda setting served the republican policy agenda well during the first two years of the trump administration  in december  however  in backing out of a republican constructed senate deal that would have kept the government open  the president forcefully asserted his own legislative agenda setting given the power of the veto as a presidential tool of negative agenda setting  exasperated republican senators had little choice but to allow mr  trump to take control of the border wall negotiations congressional leaders  however  continued to use subtle agenda setting tactics  the majority leader  mitch mcconnell  became largely absent from the public debate  declining to take part in post negotiation news conferences at the white house and flatly declaring he would not bring legislation to the senate floor until the president and democratic leaders had reached a deal that could pass  and republicans would not have to visibly cross the president in difficult public votes these tactics yielded impressive results  while a majority of americans blamed mr  trump for the partial government shutdown  very few blamed congressional republicans  the g o p  leaders have managed to not get the blame for the shutdown or get blamed by the base for abandoning the president now that democrats control the house  republican leaders may find it more difficult to limit the presidents legislative role  mr  trump will be less likely to accept a mostly theatric role in interparty negotiations and  as shown in the shutdown  may be more interested than congressional republicans in public confrontation this bodes poorly for legislative prospects in the new congress  in our current partisan environment  the visible engagement of the president in the legislative process tends to polarize debate on even seemingly nonpartisan issues  republican leaders know theyve lost much of their policymaking capacity  they may soon realize they also can no longer mask the weakness of mr  trump .

i didnt need to do this  president trump insisted at a rose garden appearance on friday  as he declared a national emergency aimed at shaking loose a few billion dollars in financing for his beloved border wall the presidents assertion was both ludicrous and self defeating  if a declaration was unnecessary and the wall on track  the wall is very very on its way  the president said earlier in the week   how could he claim to be addressing an emergency  as mr  trump explained it  but id rather do it much faster  a presidential desire for speed does not constitute a crisis  no matter how eager a president is to camouflage his failures in reality  the wall is not a done deal  and mr  trump has spent the past few months  the past two years  really  failing to convince either congress or mexico to pay for it  this weeks bipartisan spending bill  which contained no more wall money than the one over which mr  trump shut down the government in december  was a particularly humiliating defeat desperate to save face  the president and his team cooked up a nonemergency emergency with the aim of seizing funds already appropriated for other purposes  currently  the plan is to pull  2 5 billion from the militarys drug interdiction program   3 6 billion from its construction budget and  600 million from the treasury departments drug forfeiture fund  the white house plans to backfill the money it is taking from the pentagon in future budgets and so  in a breathtaking display of executive disregard for the separation of powers  the white house is thumbing its nose at congress  the constitution and the will of the american people  the majority of whom oppose a border wall even as he spun this as an act of strong leadership  mr  trump acknowledged that his declaration resolves nothing and creates a host of legal  legislative and political troubles  he predicted that the move would prompt swift legal pushback  which it did  less than four hours after the announcement  a government watchdog group filed suit  demanding that the department of justice hand over documents concerning the legal authority of the president to invoke emergency powers  soon after  the state of california announced its intention to sue  on thursday  even before the announcement  protect democracy and the niskanen center announced plans to file on behalf of el paso county and the border network for human rights  so the floodgates are open mr  trump predicted that he would lose the first couple of court rounds  particularly in california federal courts  but would ultimately be vindicated by the supreme court  critics of the move expect things to turn out differently  whatever the outcome  the legal issues are complex  and the case could wind up bogged down indefinitely  meaning not much wall for now moving from the legal to the political realm  republican lawmakers will very likely find themselves in a pickle  congress has the power to override a national emergency declaration by passing a joint resolution  to prevent opponents from stalling the bill indefinitely  once one chamber passes the resolution  the other must hold a vote on it within 18 calendar days  house democrats have already announced their intention to hold such a vote  and are expected to prevail  this will then put senate republicans in the position of having to vote on whether to support a presidential grab of congresss power  to survive a presidential veto  such a measure would need to pass with two thirds of the votes in both chambers  which seems unlikely  but the vote itself will prove awkward for republicans  forcing them to go on record as to whether they have officially abandoned their constitutional duties then theres the violence this will do the budget process  not exactly a smooth running machine as is  but if members of congress start worrying that money appropriated for one purpose will be clawed back by the white house and handed over for a different one  look for spending battles to get bloodier still  some of the money to be raided for the wall will come from military construction projects in republican states like kentucky and north carolina  which brings us to the question of precedent  in defending his declaration  mr  trump and his team keep asserting that emergency declarations are not unusual  the president called them a great thing that other presidents have done many  many times since 1976  such declarations have been used 59 times  but most have been uncontroversial and involved matters of foreign policy  declaring an emergency simply because congress refused to fund the presidents pet project is seen even by members of his own party as setting a dangerous precedent  as senator susan collins  the maine republican  warned  for the president to use it to repurpose billions of dollars that congress has appropriated for other purposes and that he has previously signed into law  strikes me as undermining the appropriations process  the vote of congress and being of dubious constitutionality speaker nancy pelosi raised broader issues on friday  this issue transcends partisan politics and goes to the core of the founders conception for america  which commands congress to limit an overreaching executive  she said in a statement with chuck schumer  the senate democratic leader  the presidents emergency declaration  if unchecked  would fundamentally alter the balance of powers  inconsistent with our founders vision we call upon our republican colleagues to join us to defend the constitution  they added  the congress cannot let the president shred the constitution mr  trump betrays no interest in the collateral damage wreaked by his actions  this move will come back to bite him and his party  the question is when  and how hard .
el centro  calif   donald trump was on the television  but no matter  ferdinando galeanas customers were watching their plates  not the president as mr  trump delivered an ominous state of the union address from washington  which warned repeatedly about the dangers along the southwest border  mr  galeana dutifully tended to orders of tacos  horchata and micheladas at dpoly  the mexican eatery his family runs here about 10 miles from the mexican border  what the president was saying on the screen behind him  said mr  galeana  would not help his small business  his family or his five dozen employees what we need here is someone to help people looking for jobs  said mr  galeana  whose wife and american born children work with him at the restaurant  the things he says  they make me laugh residents of el centro and several other towns along the california mexico border have watched with curiosity and apprehension in recent years as the president has escalated his calls for a wall along the southwest frontier  mr  trump repeated his warnings about such perils again tuesday republicans and democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis  mr  trump said during his speech  delivered not long after a bitter impasse over funding for a border wall that shut down the government for 35 days  congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government  protect our homeland  and secure our very dangerous southern border  sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  on a busy tuesday night at dpoly  patrons occasionally glanced at the screen that played the presidents address to the nation  most paid it no mind at all  mr  galeana and others said they had largely tuned out what the president has to say because  too often  his rhetoric is disconnected from what their communities really want  they have struggled to reconcile the presidents warnings about threatening conditions on the border with their own experiences living in this quiet  largely agricultural hamlet what hes saying on the news is different from what were seeing here  said cecy magallanes  45  who is originally from mexicali  not far across the border in mexico  and works as a school bus driver she said mr  trumps previous calls for a border wall seemed like a strategy to get votes his wall  always his wall  added cesar salas  ms  magallaness husband  shaking his head located on el centros main street  dpoly and its clientele embody the biculturalism of border towns across the southwest  farm workers  white collar professionals  big families and off duty border patrol agents congregate here for tacos  sopes and flavored juices  modern and minimalist  the restaurants gray walls and dark wood floors could be the backdrop of an elegant crate and barrel photo shoot  save for an arresting pink mural of frida kahlo that instantly sets the room apart  flashes of pastel pop from behind a tiled bar  which includes a display of dia de los muertos statuettes  read  state of the union fact check  what trump got right and wrong english and spanish are heard virtually interchangeably at table after table  latin pop plays in the background  songs like dnde estars by the mexican electrocumbia musician raymix mr  galeana  who owns the restaurant along with his wife  teresa  said he and his family decorated with the idea of showcasing mexican culture in a modern setting  a concept that so often is lost in mexican restaurants in favor of stereotypical dcor like sombreros our idea was to show that mexico is not just what the stereotypes say  its so much more  he said  we are proud of our culture  and we want to show that that is what many of those here say they wish the president understood  immigration and cross national exchanges are celebrated in these towns along the border hildy carrillo  the executive director of the calexico chamber of commerce  has been sharply critical of president trumps immigration policies  she watched with exasperation last year when mr  trump called the replacement of the towns border barrier the start of our southern border wall  she said she feared the presidents remark would turn calexico into an anti immigration symbol and make it seem unsafe for that reason  ms  carrillo  a democrat  chose not to watch the speech tuesday  one of the few ive ever missed  she said  she went shopping instead  she said  because i refuse to get stressed out having to listen to him such frustrations are frequently expressed in towns along the southwest border  which spans nearly 2 000 miles from california to texas  public officials from el paso took to social media after tuesday nights speech to accuse the president of intentionally misleading the public after he said a border barrier had turned around high crime rates in the city  simply put  walls work and walls save lives  mr  trump said he lies   potus is once again lying and using the  sotu address to spread falsehoods about our beloved city of el paso  representative veronica escobar  a democrat who represents el paso  said on twitter a fact check by the el paso times on the matter  prepared in january but circulated heavily again on tuesday night  found the citys crime rate peaked in 1993  but by 2006 had sharply declined to its lowest level in decades  construction on the border fence that mr  trump appeared to reference began in 2008 the paper also pointed out that  before the bush era fence was approved  el paso and ciudad jurez had been separated by a border barrier for decades before the speech on tuesday  gov  michelle lujan grisham of new mexico  a democrat  denounced the presidents charade of border fear mongering and ordered the withdrawal of most national guard troops stationed at the border in her state many people living along the border  including mexican immigrants  say they understand the desire for strong border security  but in conversations here in el centro on tuesday  even those who agreed with some of the presidents positions were quick to point out that his statements about immigrants  and mexicans in particular  made them disinclined to support him aleyda montejano  21  who is mexican american  lives in the town of imperial but goes to hairstyling school in mexicali because it is less expensive  she said that she agreed with the president that there needed to be a deterrent to illegal immigration  but she said that message was difficult to separate from his tone the way he talks about mexicans  i just dont agree with it  she said  the reason people come here is to have a better life  but  about the border  there are some people that cross illegally and thats not right brian arturo posada  19  an american citizen who grew up in mexicali  said that he was sympathetic to some of the things republicans in washington talk about  like preventing abuse of social benefits such as unemployment insurance  but he said the presidents tone in past speeches too frequently crossed the line when he talked about immigrants and mexican laborers the only thing that really i didnt like was when he said all mexicans are gangsters  he said  thats not true  its not true  and when he was keeping those kids in jails  that made me really mad meanwhile  several mexican laborers in the region said they fear that the presidents warnings about immigrants and crime exacerbates discrimination against them cristina bejarano  34  a mexican laborer who picks cilantro and lives in calexico  about 12 miles south of el centro  said that life for her and other immigrants in the region can be difficult because of the nature of farm work  but she said she moved to the united states two years ago because  even if farm labor is backbreaking  her life and prospects are better here than in mexico she said she wished president trump and others could understand that a lot of people havent had a chance to meet any mexicans  ms  bejarano said  they say were all criminals when were not  just because were brown doesnt mean were dirty .

washington  president trump proclaimed on thursday that without funding for his wall at the southwestern border  the panel of lawmakers negotiating a broad compromise on border security would be wasting their time  issuing what appeared to be an ultimatum even as lawmakers pleaded for a chance to reach a deal that would head off another shutdown without a wall  it doesnt work  mr  trump told reporters in the oval office  im not saying this as a republican  im not saying it as anything other than a fact stater if you dont have a wall  he added  theyre all just wasting their time and in an interview with the new york times on thursday  the president indicated that he was prepared to move forward without lawmakers  saying that he had set the stage for doing what im going to do  he declined to directly say whether he planned to declare a national emergency to build a wall  read the new york times interview with president trump  the comments came as 17 house and senate lawmakers from both parties struggled to reach a bipartisan border deal before feb  15  when much of the government again runs out of money  republican leaders  especially in the senate  have made it clear that they do not want to suffer through another debilitating shutdown  and senators asked the president to give them room to work i think it would be more worthwhile and effective if the president would allow some space for these negotiations to occur and not be doing commentary at this point  said senator susan collins  republican of maine democrats offered their own opinions on thursday  in her weekly news conference  speaker nancy pelosi told reporters that theres not going to be any wall money in a final bill  four house democrats  all freshmen  circulated a letter lobbying for cuts to the department of homeland securitys budget  urging colleagues to not compromise our values at the negotiating table but it was the presidents commentary throughout the day on thursday  on twitter and in the oval office  that prompted several lawmakers to plead for him to tone down his messaging senator richard c  shelby of alabama  the chairman of the senate appropriations committee and a member of the negotiating group  known as a conference committee  asserted that without outside reaction  not just from the president  but other outside forces  a solution could be reached within days if the speaker  the president and everybody  the leaders of our parties in the senate  would let us  the appropriators  do our job  we could do this  mr  shelby said democrats released formal details on thursday of their opening bid in negotiations  outlining nearly  56 billion in spending for the department of homeland security without any mention of walls or fencing  the proposal also blocks the construction of physical barriers on wildlife refuges on the border  the only mention of such barriers ms  pelosi signaled that she would be open to allocating money for roads  ports of entry and infrastructure and technology at the southwestern border  all things that she said were part of the negotiation they have to choose the best way to use the money  she said of the committee  adding that a bipartisan consensus could hopefully be reached without outside interference but the president  who has vacillated between hard edge demands for border wall funding and a softer tone on alternatives to a wall  returned to his hard line posture that a wall had to be included in a final bill  he repeated his false claim that construction of new expanses of border wall had already begun the tone of mr  trumps remarks  coupled with a string of morning tweets  prompted a mixture of bewilderment and concern among lawmakers trying to reach a deal but unsure of what the president will sign i do think the presidents tweet underscores the single most important question as to whether this negotiation can be successful  how free the republicans are to negotiating in good faith and to what extent they can proceed to do that  said representative david e  price  democrat of north carolina and a member of the negotiating committee a path to a final compromise on border security and funding the department of homeland security still appears uncertain because of what he said and because of how he operates  mr  price said in an interview for some lawmakers  the presidents assessment about the success of the negotiations was simply realistic i think the president is saying something that a lot of people are already thinking  said senator john kennedy  republican of louisiana  this may well be a waste of time  and i think the president may turn out to be right we also could surprise ourselves around here and do something intelligent  he added  you just never know but some lawmakers remained optimistic that a deal could be reached before feb  15  with the presidents approval  the scope of the bill is likely to be narrow to maintain consensus  without the addition of immigration law changes or the inclusion of a measure to raise the governments statutory borrowing limit we dont want to go there  we want to keep it simple  said senator jon tester  democrat of montana and a member of the committee  i think we have to keep it simple and clean other members of the committee  including mr  shelby  have also raised the possibility of bringing in experts to outline what exactly is needed at the border i think we can still get there  said senator shelley moore capito  republican of west virginia who sits on the conference committee  maybe it wont be the terminologies  it might be barriers or fencing or levies or things of this nature  but i think we need to listen to the professionals  and the professionals are telling us we need more barrier .
washington  president trumps plan to spend billions of dollars more on his border wall than congress approved involves more than his invocation of emergency powers to redirect military construction funds  before spending any of that money  mr  trump first intends to tap  2 5 billion in other defense department funds under a different claim of executive authority the pentagon has not yet determined which programs will be cut to meet mr  trumps demands  the acting defense secretary  patrick m  shanahan  told reporters over the weekend that he had set in motion a process to identify candidates  but had made no decisions i just want to make a point of this  mr  shanahan added  we are following the law  using the rules  and were not bending the rules  o k  no  mr  trump is planning to tap different pots of money in sequence  and only the fourth and last pot involves the emergency powers statute  before reaching that last pot  mr  trump plans to spend the roughly  1 4 billion that congress approved for new border barriers in the recent spending deal and then about  600 million from a treasury department asset forfeiture fund the third pot of potential wall money would be  2 5 billion drawn from a military counterdrug account under a different statute  one that does not involve any emergency declaration  in it  congress has authorized the pentagon to support other agencies counternarcotics efforts by constructing roads or fences and installation of lighting to block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the united states on its face  the statute appears to authorize spending only for construction  if it cannot be stretched to encompass land acquisition  the  2 5 billion would most likely be useful only for building barriers on property the government already owns  either way  time is short  mr  shanahan said that the money that could be reprogrammed for counterdrug is money that would have to be spent in this year  the fiscal year ends on sept  30 no  when congress passed the most recent pentagon spending law last september  it appropriated about  517 million for counternarcotics support activities  of that amount  about  100 million remains readily available for border barrier spending  an administration official said the trump administration plans to use the counterdrug account as a temporary way station for more than  2 billion in funds taken from unrelated military programs  the administration will first transfer the funds into the counterdrug account  and then treat them as money that can be used for border barriers but the defense department has not yet decided which other programs to drain of their funding one military official  speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations  said the pentagon had been scouring its  700 billion budget in search of accounts with unspent funds to target  for example  the official said  an army personnel account designated for paying bonuses to new recruits appears to have excess money because the service has been falling short of its recruiting goals lately but reaching the total will require some painful decisions all of this money has been assigned for other purposes  mr  shanahan said  adding  it really is a trade off a federal law  the anti deficiency act  generally makes it a crime for an official to spend money on something in excess of what congress has appropriated for that purpose but the trump administration says it can lawfully move other military funding into the pentagons counterdrug account under general transfer authority  a power congress has given to the defense secretary  this power gives mr  shanahan  under certain conditions  the flexibility to move up to  4 billion around from one purpose to another but there are certain limits  among them  it can be used only on an item that is higher priority than its original purpose and meets a standard of unforeseen military requirements and in no case where the item for which funds are requested has been denied by the congress  this raises the question of whether mr  trumps desire to spend more on his wall than congress appropriated qualifies under that standard martin lederman  a georgetown university law professor who helped run the justice departments office of legal counsel during the obama administration  said that he had found no example of litigation in which a court had tested such arcane language and conditions in the transfer law  leaving few guideposts for how far the administration can stretch it maybe  a deluge of lawsuits are asking judges to block mr  trumps executive actions on wall spending  a lawsuit filed by a coalition of 16 states  for example  includes the accusation that mr  trump exceeded his legal authority in seeking to divert the funding for the military counterdrug account to use on border barriers the general transfer authority provision says mr  shanahan must notify congress promptly of all such transfers  another military official  speaking on the condition of anonymity  said the defense department had scheduled a meeting of senior officials on thursday to iron out where redirected funds will be taken from  and planned to take those recommendations to the appropriations committees in congress on friday as a matter of constitutional law  if congress has given the executive branch the authority to redirect funds  the appropriations committees cannot veto any particular exercise of that power  but as a matter of political reality  executive branch officials generally heed committee objections  the idea is to preserve a harmonious relationship with appropriators who could slash their next budget especially because the house is controlled by democrats  this norm appears likely to put the pentagon in a bind  the house appropriations committee chairwoman  representative nita m  lowey of new york  has expressed deep skepticism about mr  trumps plan  blasting him for ignoring congresss refusal to fund his wasteful border wall  which she called a political vanity project the defense department declined to address what it will do if congressional appropriators tell it not to move the money .
during the june 1788 convention at which virginia ratified the constitution  patrick henry  a critic of the proposed government  accused james madison  its foremost defender  of failing to protect against corrupt or lawless politicians  is there no virtue among us  madison replied  if there be not  we are in a wretched situation  no theoretical checks  no form of government can render us secure that exchange is worth recalling as the house of representatives prepares for a vote scheduled for tuesday on whether to override president trumps veto of a congressional resolution to nullify the national emergency he declared to build a border wall  the house is almost certain to fail to muster the two thirds majority required of both legislative chambers to override a presidential veto  it seems likely that the senate  for its part  will not even do its constitutional duty and try  republicans  especially republican senators  are being justifiably excoriated for failing to defend congressional authority but blaming them alone misdiagnoses the constitutional problem  congresss impotence indicates an appalling failure of constitutional awareness and education in the united states  the republican base  like the democratic base during president barack obamas tenure  is demanding  and getting  a constitution of expediency rather than of law as many observers have noted  the republican senators who criticized the emergency declaration and then voted to uphold it  thom tillis of north carolina  ben sasse of nebraska and lindsey graham of south carolina foremost among them  all face re election in 2020  mr  trump is popular in their states  and their constituents are evidently more concerned with building a border wall than with the constitutional niceties according to which it is funded  these senators failure to refine and enlarge the public views  in madisons phrase  is a dereliction of their duty under article i of the constitution  but the root problem is the constitutional views that elected officials are supposed to refine one republican senator who voted against the emergency declaration  roy blunt of missouri  was disinvited from a political event in his state by a local party official who demanded of him  why could you not support my president in the emergency declaration  so long as the public does not care whether congress protects its institutional turf  or  worse  is hostile to it doing so  the constitutional architecture cannot stand madison understood this  one of the most consistent themes of his writings is that the public always governs eventually in the united states  in republican government the majority however composed  ultimately give the law  he wrote before the constitutional convention  alexander hamilton  too  explained that liberty in the united states must altogether depend on public opinion  and on the general spirit of the people and of the government the constitutional imperative is to slow down policymaking so that passion can dissipate and reason can take hold  that requires civic virtues that constitutional education must teach  they involve not merely knowledge but ultimately temperament  the foremost is patience  constitutional mechanisms work slowly by design  another essential virtue is public spiritedness  in a sprawling republic  those with strong views must recognize that they share the political community with fellow citizens whose competing views are equally intense  both patience and public spirit entail caring not just what happens  but also how it happens if  by contrast  civic education focuses solely on outcomes at the expense of process  it will produce a politically entitled people immune to these virtues or to any civic quality other than demanding what you want when you want it  yet this is substantially how civic education  which occurs in schools but also in the public square  when the news media reports on issues and when public figures discuss them  treats the constitutional order in schools  civic education tends to accord outsize importance to the bill of rights at the expense of the more complex topics of separation of powers  federalism and other pillars of the constitutional edifice  hamilton had opposed a bill of rights in part because he thought these mechanisms safeguarded rights better than protections inscribed on paper could  journalists and politicians equally obsess over winners and losers  the public hears whose ox is being gored  but too rarely the importance of the constitutional process by which the goring occurs a madisonian people  by contrast  will care about constitutional integrity in addition to political outcomes  this is for constitutional reasons but also for selfish ones  the power whose use one celebrates today will be wielded by a leader with whom one disagrees tomorrow  a lesson democrats who endorsed mr  obamas unilateral executive orders are now learning  such citizens will also understand that they occupy the country along with more than 325 million fellow citizens whose views must be accommodated crucially  they will not tolerate members of congress who surrender legislative authority  even for results to some voters momentary liking  because they will prioritize enduring constitutionalism over transient policies  they will realize  too  that maintaining legislative authority  which is more immediately responsive to local concerns  serves their own interests as well finally  some group among a madisonian people will have the foresight to step off the cynical and anti constitutional carousel according to which president george w  bush did it so mr  obama could do it so mr  trump might as well  too none of this excuses members of congress from their duties  which sometimes include withstanding public opinion  even the democratic justification for an override vote sure to fail is  as the house speaker  nancy pelosi  put it  to create a record so the issue can be resolved by the courts to her credit  ms  pelosi did say that we are article i  the first branch of government  but she was less reticent about executive power when mr  obama acted unilaterally on immigration  in both cases  the house should have defended its constitutional turf  it is no solution  on the contrary  it presents its own constitutional problems  for one party to ask the courts to provide the institutional protection the whole house declined to provide itself as for the senate  one purpose of its members six year terms is to enable what madison called great firmness in resisting public whims and defending constitutional principles  so much for that  every legislator is accountable for how he or she votes on the emergency declaration  but madison expected those immediately facing re election to capitulate more easily to public opinion  there are worse political sins  harsher criticism should be reserved for senators who caved without facing immediate electoral consequences but their constituents who demanded this constitutional surrender  especially those who profess fidelity to the constitution as the bedrock of their politics  deserve the sternest rebuke  it is an axiom of republican politics that everyone incurs criticism sooner or later  except the people  yet if the people care solely about expediency at the expense of law  we are in a wretched situation from which the constitution will not rescue us .
washington  president trumps evolving definition of a border wall animated negotiations to end a partial government shutdown on sunday  while house democrats moved to increase pressure on the president by vowing to pass individual bills to reopen targeted departments that handle critical functions like tax refunds and food stamps i informed my folks to say that well build a steel barrier  mr  trump told reporters after returning to the white house from a senior staff meeting at camp david  he added of the democrats  they dont like concrete  so well give them steel the president characterized the second day of talks between vice president mike pence and democratic congressional aides as productive after saying earlier in the day that he did not anticipate much progress  but mr  trump also said that  if no deal could be reached over his demand for  5 7 billion for the border wall  he was still considering using emergency authority to build the barrier with other government funds for their part  democrats said there was no progress as the shutdown entered its 16th day  and asked again that the government be reopened before negotiations on border security money begin a day before  they had asked the administration for a detailed plan of how such money would be used  and the office of management and budget responded with a letter on sunday evening reiterating the presidents request for  5 7 billion for the construction of a steel barrier along the southern border  democrats have rebuffed that figure but the letter also provided a fuller picture of mr  trumps border demands  in a small gesture to democrats  it said the president wanted  800 million to address urgent humanitarian needs  including enhanced medical treatment  it also asked for funds to support 52 000 detention beds and 2 000 more law enforcement agents the shutdown  which is threatening to become the longest in american history  is affecting about 800 000 federal workers  many of whom will soon miss their first paycheck  and has curtailed the functions of numerous government agencies  the impasse has also added another crisis to mr  trumps turbulent presidency as he adjusts to working in an era in which he must now share power with democrats the partys leaders gave little indication that they would come to terms with the president if he simply changed the materials used to construct the wall  mr  trump has been talking at least since mid december about building a wall made up of artistically designed steel slats instead of concrete  but he seized on the idea on sunday to a new degree theres no requirement that this government be shut down while we deliberate the future of any barrier  whether its a fence or a wall  senator richard j  durbin  democrat of illinois  said on cbss face the nation but mick mulvaney  the acting white house chief of staff  said that while he thought the shutdown was going to drag on a lot longer  mr  trumps shift in wall materials could provide a semantic opening to advance the talks if he has to give up a concrete wall  replace it with a steel fence in order to do that so that democrats can say  see  hes not building a wall anymore  that should help us move in the right direction  mr  mulvaney said on nbcs meet the press  if thats not evidence of the presidents desire to try and resolve this  i dont know what is while mr  trump had expressed little hope for the talks on sunday  he indicated that the coming days would offer a chance to show that resolve  i think were going to have some very serious talks come monday  tuesday  wednesday  he said democrats believe they have a plan to bring new leverage to the negotiations  speaker nancy pelosi said the house would begin considering individual appropriations bills this week that would reopen the government  starting with legislation that would return workers to the treasury department  including the internal revenue service  followed by measures to open the departments of agriculture  housing and urban development  and the interior representative steny h  hoyer  democrat of maryland and the majority leader  said on meet the press  well do it bill by bill so we can help taxpayers  we can help people who need food assistance  we can help people who need housing vouchers  people who need flood insurance  those bills have little chance in the senate  where senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  has held fast to his pledge that he would not put any legislation on the floor that the president would not approve congressional republicans employed a bill by bill strategy of their own in 2015 on the brink of a government shutdown over funding for planned parenthood  only to have democrats block all 12 spending bills approved by the appropriations committee the president said last week that he opposed that approach  and senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  said last month that the president would need to publicly support any funding measures before they were considered  adding that we cant have another situation when the president signals support at first but then reverses himself  mr  trump did just that in december after the senate passed bills to avert the shutdown senator chris van hollen of maryland  whose state has one of the highest concentrations of federal workers  has suggested that democrats block the consideration of all bills unrelated to opening the government until senate republicans allow a vote on the house bills there may be added pressure on mr  mcconnell from his own ranks  three senate republicans  susan collins of maine  cory gardner of colorado and thom tillis of north carolina  have called for reopening the government  two other republican senators who have been critical of the shutdown  lamar alexander of tennessee and pat roberts of kansas  have announced that they will not seek re election in 2020  so they would not face the electoral consequences of incurring mr  trumps wrath however  some other lawmakers  like senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina  who is continuing to advocate a deal in which mr  trump would get his wall funding and democrats would get new protections for the young immigrants known as dreamers  view the shutdown with less urgency i do want to open the government  but the goal is not to open the government  the goal is to fix a broken immigration system  mr  graham said  he added later  it was pretty clear to me that were never going to have a deal unless we get a wall as part of it ms  pelosi  in her first sit down interview on network television since reclaiming the speakers gavel last week  blasted mr  trump for suggesting that he may unilaterally move to build the border wall the impression you get from the president is that he would like to not only close government  build a wall  but also abolish congress so the only voice that mattered was his own  ms  pelosi told jane pauley in the interview  which aired on cbs newss sunday morning representative adam smith  democrat of washington and the new chairman of the armed services committee  said mr  trump did have the power to declare a national emergency to build the wall  unfortunately  the short answer is yes  he said on abcs this week  but he said the president would face a court challenge asking where is the emergency .

from the government shutdown to the start of a new congress  its been a busy week in american politics  here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed  and some links if youd like to read further                     early in the week  house democrats agreed on a proposal to end the partial government shutdown that would extend current levels of funding for the department of homeland security  but that didnt include money for president trumps border wall  mr  trump rejected the idea in a white house meeting on wednesday  saying he would look foolish if he compromised after the democrats took control of the house on thursday  they passed two bills to reopen the government  knowing they would likely go nowhere in the senate  the majority leader  senator mitch mcconnell  said he would not bring up any legislation mr  trump did not support  few republicans called for an end to the shutdown on friday  the president threatened to keep agencies closed for months or even years  mr  trump also said he was considering declaring a national emergency to build a border wall without congressional approval as the president holds firm on the shutdown  he hasnt publicly addressed the

el paso  ahead of president trumps scheduled rally in this west texas city aimed at building support for his proposed wall on the border with mexico  people from across the ideological spectrum in el paso had a message for him on sunday  dont speak for us the president is just wrong about the wall and wrong about el paso  said jon barela  a lifelong republican and chief executive of the borderplex alliance  an organization promoting economic development in a cross border industrial hub with a combined population of more than 2 7 million  taking in the cities of el paso  ciudad jurez and las cruces mr  barela disputed mr  trumps widely discredited assertion that border fencing had cut violent crime in el paso  pointing to f b i  data showing that the city has ranked for decades among the safest urban areas its size in the united states  long before american authorities started building some fencing along the border about a decade ago as a fiscally conservative republican  i just dont understand how spending  25 billion on a wall with limited effectiveness is a good idea  mr  barela said in an interview  mexico is an economic and strategic ally of the united states  and an antiquated effort to place a barrier between us just wont work  this month  were launching a limited run weekly newsletter about life on the border  far from the tug of war of washington politics  sign up here to receive the first issue of crossing the border when it launches  dee margo  the republican mayor of el paso  voiced similar criticism of mr  trumps description of el paso  in his state of the union address  as one of the nations most dangerous cities before the barrier went up on the border  representative veronica escobar  a democrat recently elected to congress to represent el paso  is asking mr  trump to apologize and meet with migrant families seeking asylum in the united states the tension surrounding mr  trumps planned visit to el paso on monday is revealing political fissures  a democratic bastion in a state where republicans have long wielded dominance in statewide politics  el paso is also home to beto orourke  the former local congressman who is a star of the democratic party and a potential challenger to mr  trump in the 2020 presidential election at the same time mr  trump is scheduled to speak before about 6 000 people at the el paso county coliseum  mr  orourke will speak at another rally a mile away  mr  orourke said in an essay on medium that mr  trump will promise a wall and will repeat his lies about the dangers that immigrants pose el paso  where hispanics account for about 80 percent of the population  was already hostile ground for mr  trump  in the 2016 election  he took only about 26 percent of the vote in el paso county  read our latest story on trump and betos rallies in el paso  still  the president shouldnt have a problem filling the venue  some of his supporters in the city remain eager to hear what mr  trump has to say id like to see a wall go up along the entire border  said joshua ascencio  21  a cavalry scout in the united states army who has plans to become an agent with the border patrol when he leaves the military  mr  ascencio said he was looking forward to mr  trumps rally im a supporter of the president and i think its important to be there for him  said mr  ascencio  i want to hear him on border security still  for many others in this city of immigrants the mere idea of mr  trump coming to el paso to promote his administrations crackdown on immigration raises hackles the president of the united states is  disgracefully  nothing more than a racist  said mayra cabral  37  an immigrant who grew up across the border in ciudad jurez and now cleans tables at a restaurant in el paso  where she has lived for the last 19 years after marrying an american citizen ms  cabral laughed out loud when asked about mr  trumps claims that hispanic immigrants bring crime to the united states  she said that el paso is normally so calm that its boring here sometimes  ms  cabral added that she and her family were not getting waylaid by talk of the presidents visit  on saturday night  they hosted a quinceaera for her 15 year old daughter attended by about 300 people i was able to do this for my daughter because i work at a job that people born in the united states wont do  ms  cabral said  trump likes to call us criminals  but what about all the americans in the country who commit violent crimes  why doesnt he talk about them for once mr  trump appears to have homed in on el paso after meeting with republican officials from texas in january in mcallen  a city affected by a large influx of migrant families traveling through the rio grande valley  at that meeting  attorney general ken paxton of texas told mr  trump that the construction of border fencing in el paso caused crime to fall in the city but while el paso has long been relatively safer than other american cities its size  the violent crime rate in the city actually climbed briefly just before and in the two years after authorities installed fencing on the border as part of an effort to improve border security during the administration of george w  bush mr  paxton tried to back up his assertion that a border wall in el paso had cut crime rates by referring to a 131 mile fence that was completed in 2010  politifact  the nonpartisan fact checking website owned by the poynter institute  questioned mr  paxtons claim  pointing out that while texas does have 131 miles of fencing not all of it is even in el paso the contested assertions of a senior state official comes at a time of ratcheting tension in texas over the treatment of latino voters by republican state officials  who in january called into question the citizenship status of nearly 100 000 voters  county officials found that the list of voters  which was referred to by mr  paxton in a campaign fund raising email with the headline voter fraud alert  actually included scores of naturalized citizens the mexican american legal defense fund filed a lawsuit this month against mr  paxton  gov  greg abbott and secretary of state david whitley of texas  arguing that they conspired to purge latinos from voter rolls following a surge in turnout by latino voters in the midterm elections governor abbott and united states senator ted cruz  the republican who narrowly defeated mr  orourke to hold on to his seat in november  are among the republican officials from around the state who are expected to attend the rally on monday in support of mr  trump but elsewhere along the border  there has been rising opposition among state and local officials to the presidents security strategies  read  butterflies  bulldozers and barbed wire rally border wall opponents new mexicos governor  michelle lujan grisham  announced last week that she had ordered a partial withdrawal of national guard troops from her state  new mexico will not take part in the presidents charade of border fear mongering by misusing our diligent national guard troops  ms  grisham  a democrat  said in a statement early monday  gov  gavin newsom of california announced that his state  too  would withdraw national guard troops sent earlier to help the federal government boost security at the border in nogales  ariz   the city council on wednesday passed a resolution condemning the recent installation of new barbed wire along the existing border wall in that city  calling it an indiscriminate use of lethal force that is typically only found in a war  battlefield or prison setting gaining public support for the idea of a wall at an event such as the rally in el paso will be important for mr  trump  as talks for a bipartisan agreement on border security appeared to have stalled on sunday amid lingering disagreement over how much should be spent on a border barrier  president trump  who initially proposed spending  25 billion on a wall  now is looking for  5 7 billion  democratic lawmakers have talked about a figure closer to  1 3 billion to  2 billion a second government shutdown could be in the works if no agreement is reached bob giles  a car dealer from lafayette  la   who is building a new volvo dealership in el paso  said that he understood how mr  trumps proposed wall could seem like a good idea from an outside perspective but when you spend time in el paso and talk to people  its clear they take offense that a wall made a difference in the city  said mr  giles  while mr  trump often speaks of a crisis on the border  mr  giles said he hasnt seen one thats not the word i would choose  he said  his own hope is to sell cars not just to americans  but also to business executives from jurez who have homes in el paso  this is an incredibly vibrant market with lots of construction going on  he said  it makes a difference when you see it with your own eyes .

washington  president trump has invited representatives from cable and broadcast news channels to an off the record lunch at the white house ahead of his prime time speech tuesday night  an address in which he is expected to frame his demand for border wall funding as a response to a national security and humanitarian crisis the white house has requested about eight minutes of broadcast time from the networks for mr  trumps oval office remarks  the president appears to be preparing for the event as if he is delivering a miniature state of the union message  typically  television anchors meet with the president over lunch ahead of his annual address to congress as the partial government shutdown enters its third week  mr  trumps aides have been making the case that there is a crisis at the border in briefings with staff members on the hill and in meetings with journalists the white house has floated the idea of invoking emergency powers to build a wall along the countrys southwestern border without approval from congress  but while democrats have been bracing themselves for him to make that declaration on tuesday night  administration officials who had seen a draft copy of his speech said the president was not preparing to do so uncertainty around a possible emergency declaration is not out of character for a president who often likes to upend expectations  when he met with television reporters ahead of his state of the union message last year  for instance  mr  trump suggested that he would announce a comprehensive immigration deal  an announcement that did not materialize later that night white house officials are keeping the content of mr  trumps speech close to the vest  saying only that the president wants to deliver a message that there is a crisis at the border  and asserting that he is writing the speech himself  they have admitted privately  because they were not authorized to speak publicly  that they worry they are on the verge of losing a messaging battle over the shutdown tuesdays lunch is expected to take place in the roosevelt room at the white house .
this article is part of david leonhardts newsletter  you can sign up here to receive it each weekday president trumps emergency declaration for a border wall is based on an obvious falsehood  there is no emergency at the u s  mexico border  and because he was goaded into the declaration by sean hannity  the episode makes a mockery of the federal government but in the relative scheme of trumps misbehavior  the emergency declaration doesnt rank very high  its not corruption or obstruction of justice  its not an attempt to undermine americas alliance with western europe  and it doesnt even matter much for immigration policy  if youre trying to calibrate your trump related outrage  you can take a deep breath this morning a presidential declaration of emergency in order to construct a wall would be stupid  lawfares quinta jurecic wrote  it would be wasteful  it would test the limits of the presidents authority under the law in question  but it would not  in itself  be a step toward authoritarianism   heres the longer version of her case   listen to the argument podcast every thursday morning  with ross douthat  michelle goldberg and david leonhardt  this will be challenged in courts immediately  and it will be pretty easy to throw this thing out  neal katyal  a former acting solicitor general  predicted on lawrence odonnells msnbc show last night trumps fake emergency is a sign of weakness not strength  tweeted the new yorkers john cassidy  he ran on the wall  he had two years of republican control of congress  and he still couldnt get it financed  weak president and philip klein of the washington examiner made the conservative case against the declaration  the only hope for limited government conservatives is that any emergency declaration gets quickly enjoined  and eventually nixed  in federal court  at least then  the silver lining would be that a legal precedent would be set that the president cannot attempt such an end around congress the china rivalryive always thought americans would come together when we realized that we faced a dangerous foreign foe  my colleague david brooks writes  and lo and behold  now we have one  china  its become increasingly clear that china is a grave economic  technological and intellectual threat to the united states and the world order i agree that the united states has been too complacent about the geopolitical challenge that china poses .

washington  senate republicans introduced a measure tuesday night that would curtail future presidential emergency declarations in a last ditch effort to save president trumps current border wall emergency from an embarrassing rejection by senators charging constitutional overreach four republican senators have publicly said they will support a house passed resolution of disapproval when it comes up for final passage in the senate on thursday  that would be just enough to ensure passage of a measure overturning the national emergency that the president declared to secure border wall funding over congresss objection but that near certainty appeared to shift on tuesday as vice president mike pence pressed senate republicans at a closed door meeting before their weekly policy lunch  a measure sponsored by senator mike lee  republican of utah  and supported by more than a dozen republican senators  would curtail the presidents powers under the national emergencies act of 1976  requiring a congressional vote of approval for any new emergency declaration after 30 days and one of the republicans who said he favored the resolution of disapproval  senator thom tillis of north carolina  appeared to be wavering  according to multiple people at the policy lunch  without him  and barring any other defections  the resolution would fail to reach the presidents desk if you would have asked me before this lunch then i would have said  in the senate  the president is going to lose  said senator john kennedy  republican of louisiana  who opposes the resolution  but im not so sure now  a lot of people are trying to think of a way to express their support for the president  but at the same time express their concern about ceding too much power to the white house while mr  lees bill would not retroactively apply to mr  trumps border emergency declaration  it would give senate republicans cover  and offer their only chance of defeating the house resolution by easing concerns that a future democratic president could take advantage of the precedent set by mr  trump speaker nancy pelosi sought wednesday to deny senators that cover  saying flatly she would never put mr  lees legislation on the house floor for a vote republican senators are proposing new legislation to allow the president to violate the constitution just this once in order to give themselves cover  she said in a statement  the house will not take up this legislation to give president trump a pass republicans were ready to persist  mr  lee  who declined to say how he would vote on the resolution  recast the issue as the senate reasserting its constitutional prerogatives  in the future over the last 80 years  congress has voluntarily relinquished a whole lot of legislative power  handed over to the executive branch  said mr  lee  speaking to reporters about his bill  weve deviated so far from the structure put in place by the constitution passing the resolution to overturn the border emergency would represent a rare assertion of legislative prerogative by senate republicans  who have been loath to buck mr  trump over the last two years  the measure would almost certainly be vetoed  the first of mr  trumps presidency  but it could also bolster several lawsuits contesting the presidents emergency declaration as a flagrant violation of the constitution  which grants congress the power to decide how to spend federal tax dollars senate democrats responded incredulously to the republican maneuver i think leader mcconnell all too often has abandoned what is good for the comity in the senate and the institution of the senate to go along with president trump  senator chuck schumer  the democratic leader  said in an interview on tuesday he said democrats would oppose any attempt to curtail future abuses of executive power without addressing mr  trumps actions the resolution of disapproval has squeezed mr  tillis between conservatives in his home state angered by his stand and the swing voters he needs for his re election in 2020 mr  trump has added his own pressure  in conversations with staff members and lawmakers  the president has made an emotional case for opposing the resolution  telling them that a vote in favor would be seen by their constituents as a vote against border security and warning that such a move would be regarded as disloyalty  according to three republicans with direct knowledge of his actions  who spoke on the condition of anonymity this is not a free vote  the president is paying attention  senator mitch mcconnell  the republican leader  told the conference during their weekly lunch at the capitol  according to a person in attendance mr  lee then delivered an upbeat assessment of a meeting with mr  pence  telling his colleagues that the vice president agreed  in principle  to the idea of limiting the scope of an emergency declaration to 30 days without congressional approval  but insisted that it be measured in legislative days rather than calendar days  which could extend a presidents latitude for action  the person added mr  tillis  to the surprise of some in the room  embraced the idea  although he did not go so far as to say he would reverse his public support for the resolution  he is a co sponsor of mr  lees bill it is unclear if mr  pences concession will be enough  a handful of other republicans have privately signaled they may also buck the west wing to ensure a clear statement from congress that a president cannot use an emergency declaration to secure funds for a project that was explicitly rejected by the branch of government constitutionally granted control of federal spending weve got a short window for something to come together  senator john thune  republican of south dakota  the no  3 republican in the senate  told reporters on tuesday other senators  he said  would likely feel comfortable in the end voting against the resolution as long as they had something they could point to that actually is modernizing the underlying statute both senators susan collins  republican of maine  and lisa murkowski  republican of alaska  have publicly declared their intent to disapprove of mr  trumps declaration and gave no indication on tuesday that they had changed their minds senator rand paul  republican of kentucky  is also a yes vote  and told reporters on tuesday that while it was unlikely that he would change his mind on supporting the resolution  he would support reforming the national emergencies act the compromise proposed by mr  lee also seemed to soothe other republican senators who have criticized the presidents actions but have been unwilling to publicly support the motion of disapproval senator roy blunt  republican of missouri  has not publicly said how he will vote on the resolution  but he thought the lee bill would help keep defections to a minimum  mr  trump had been a sharp critic of presidents exceeding their authority when the president was barack obama the president had problems  as a candidate  with the obama overreach  mr  blunt said  hes been on the record for some time on this topic  and i think this would give him a chance to get back to where he was three years ago .
washington  u s  president donald trump on thursday threatened to impose tariffs on car imports from mexico unless it does more to stop illegal migrants and drug trafficking  his latest warning to america s southern neighbor to tighten border security after backing away from a threat this week to immediately shut the border to stop a surge of migrants from central america  trump raised the specter of a 25 percent tariff on cars as a possible tool he could use to force mexico to halt illegal immigration and drugs  before we close the border we ll put the tariffs on the cars  i don t think we ll ever have to close the border because the penalty of tariffs on cars coming into the united states from mexico at 25 percent will be massive   trump told reporters at the white house earlier  trump said he would give mexico  a one year warning  to stop drug trafficking  or face tariffs  but he held out the possibility that the measure could be used sooner to address migration issues trump made stopping illegal immigration a centerpiece of his 2016 run for the white house  pledging to build a wall on the border to stop migrants  when congress refused to give him the money to pay for the wall  he declared a national emergency to divert funds from other projects the democratic controlled house of representatives will sue to block trump from  stealing from appropriated funds   speaker nancy pelosi said on thursday trump  who plans to visit the border at calexico  california to view a border wall project  said that media coverage this week had prompted mexico to act to curb the flow of immigrants to the united states and take other action to ease the pressure on u s  ports of entry  a lot of good things are happening with mexico  mexico understands that we re going to close the border  or i m going to tariff the cars   he said trade disruptionstrump prompted panic among business leaders last friday with his border closing threat  u s  border officials have estimated that some 100 000 migrants were apprehended or encountered at the border in march  the highest level in a decade  most are central american families seeking asylum the department of homeland security has transferred 750 border agents from commercial to immigration duties  triggering long delays for cross border trade the u s  chamber of commerce said it welcomed trump s decision not to close the border  but said congress needed to do more  congress should also ensure customs and border protection officials receive the resources they need to reduce the excessive wait times affecting legitimate trade and travel across the border   said neil bradley  a top official with the chamber in a statement mexican exporters are looking into sending their goods to the united states by air freight to avoid a five mile  8 km  long line of trucks at the border caused by the trump administration moving federal agents away from customs checks to immigration duties auto parts and medical equipment makers were among the mexican companies considering the more expensive air cargo to avoid incurring penalties for late delivery to u s  clients or factory closures  luis aguirre  the president of mexico s manufacturing industry chamber index  said late on wednesday    reporting by roberta rampton and jeff mason  additional reporting by doina chiacu  yeganeh torbati and david alexander in washington and lewis krauskopf in new york  editing by howard goller and alistair bell .

good morning  heres the sign up  if you dont already get california today by email   if you werent already confused about the status of californias controversial bullet train after gov  gavin newsoms state of the state address  you might be soon during his speech last week  the governor said the high speed rail network as it was initially envisioned  as a link between los angeles and the bay area  was taking too long and costing too much  so  he announced  the project would be scaled back for the time being  instead stretching from bakersfield to merced eventually  mr  newsom backtracked and blamed the news media for overstating the change of plan but not before president trump seized the opportunity to hammer a favorite target  tweeting that california has been forced to cancel the massive bullet train project  and saying that the federal government wanted back  3 5 billion  read more about the long running debate over californias bullet train here  that was a week ago  before a new battle between the president and the golden state took shape  this time  it was over mr  trumps declaration of a national emergency on the border in order to access more money for a border wall  california and 15 other states sued  arguing that the move was an illegal way of diverting funds that congress designated for other things our message to the white house is clear  california will not be part of this political theater  mr  newsom said in a statement in support of the legal action yesterday  though  the tension escalated when the transportation department said it was exploring legal options to force california to pay back  2 5 billion in federal money that has already been spent on the project  the trump administration said in a separate letter that it planned to end a  929 million grant to the california high speed rail authority both mr  newsom and president trump linked the fight over the border wall with the renewed efforts to claw back rail funding this is clear political retribution by president trump  and we wont sit idly by  mr  newsom said in a statement  this is californias money  and we are going to fight for it president trump tweeted that what he described as californias failed fast train system is hundreds of times more expensive than the desperately needed wall still  its not clear whether the federal government has the authority to keep the  929 million grant from california which means that the fight over the bullet train  like so many of the clashes between the trump administration and california  is likely to end up in court  we often

this article is part of david leonhardts newsletter  you can sign up here to receive it each weekday congressional republicans offered up two conflicting storylines yesterday  and its worth keeping both in mind 1  multiple senators hypocritically supported president trumps emergency declaration for a border wall thom tillis of north carolina was the most blatant  two weeks ago  he opposed the trump move as an unacceptable power grab  writing in a washington post op ed  there is no intellectual honesty in now turning around and arguing that theres an imaginary asterisk attached to executive overreach  that its acceptable for my party but not thy party  listen to the argument podcast every thursday morning  with ross douthat  michelle goldberg and david leonhardt  as recently as wednesday  his staff sent nasty emails of denial to aaron blake of the post when blake described tillis as turning wobbly yesterday  however  tillis caved  he did so after conservatives began talking about supporting a primary challenge to him in 2020 if he voted against trump  this is trumps party  rachel bitecofer of christopher newport university notes of the seven republican senators facing competitive races next year  six voted with trump yesterday  they are evidently more scared of losing a primary than of losing a general election  as jonathan bernstein of bloomberg opinion points out cory gardner of colorado was another republican who supported the emergency declaration yesterday  the denver posts editorial board  which had backed gardner in his 2014 campaign  responded with  our endorsement of cory gardner was a mistake 2  and yet trump is a weak president as nervous as congressional republicans may be about primary challenges  they also keep showing that their support of trump is almost purely self interested  and not very deep  even with the hypocritical support  12 republicans voted against trumps declaration  allowing the measure to pass 59 41 and presumably forcing him to issue a humiliating veto  the vote  the times editorial board writes  is a big deal  in practical terms  it could fortify the multiple lawsuits pending against mr  trumps absurd declaration  a faux emergency so nakedly political that even he admitted it was unnecessary not long before the senate vote  the house yesterday passed a resolution  in a 420 to 0 shutout  demanding that the justice department release the mueller report  the combination of the two votes was a remarkable rebuke  yes  congressional republicans are doing far less than they should to stand up to trump  many of them  like tillis  have made themselves look foolish in the process  but its also the case that trump receives less support from his own party than any other president in recent history his presidency  as bloombergs bernstein has written  is entering a dangerous phase for him .
it didnt take long for a group of texas landowners to challenge president trumps declaration of a national emergency in court more suits have followed 16 states  including new york and california  have sued to stop mr  trumps use of emergency powers to build a border wall  and the president himself predicted that the matter would end up in the supreme court  whether the president wins or loses  though  there is a serious risk that the final result will be a dangerous judicial precedent the texans and others who face the loss of land because of eminent domain actions funded via mr  trumps emergency declaration have standing to sue and good cause to do so  not because the government may offer them too little money to constitute just compensation  though past practice suggests this will be an issue  too  rather  they object to the process that the president has used to gain the funding after congress largely denied it to him as an initial matter  they argue that there is no real emergency here as required by the national emergencies act  second  and more significant  they contend that even if there is an emergency  it is not one that requires the use of the armed forces  which is the critical condition in the budget statute that the president unlocked by issuing his emergency declaration  in other words  if theres no military necessity  then theres no emergency authority to redirect military construction dollars toward a border wall even if there is military necessity  moreover  those dollars cant be spent on just anything  the statute defines military construction precisely and narrowly  you can pay to build things on military property  yes  but not on other government  let alone private  property  and you can pay to buy land  but only in order to make that land military property  not other government property  as texans and other landowners argue that these conditions are not met  they have plenty of ammunition from the presidents own lips  including from his news conference last week  during which he emphasized that he did not need to take this step but simply wanted to for the sake of speed as a result of all this  we are on the verge of intense litigation over a subtle but critical point  can judges second guess a presidents determination that there is an emergency under the national emergencies act  even if not  can they at least second guess the determination that the situation requires the use of the armed forces as required by the budget statute this is where the risk of a problematic precedent arises  it could take either of two opposite forms  on one hand  the courts may give too much deference to the executive branch  taking a valuable tradition and distending it to cover disingenuous claims by the president  encouraging more of the same  and worse  in the future  on the other hand  the courts also might err in the opposite direction  throwing the baby out with the bath water in the course of second guessing the president in this extreme instance  resulting in a temptation of courts to second guess in less justified circumstances the deference tradition has deep roots  courts have long given special weight to presidential judgments about matters that blend factual and policy judgment concerning national security and military needs  we saw the influence of that principle in the trump administrations eventual victory in the travel ban litigation  but the tradition runs far deeper than that one danger in the current litigation is that this tradition will be applied in a reckless way  in the worst case  the litigation might produce a supreme court holding articulating and entrenching a deference on steroids version of this concept  this would have extraordinary spillover effects  gutting the chances of effective litigation checks not just here but in many other settings down the line  the decision would lie about like the proverbial loaded weapon  tempting future presidents to similar  or worse  pretextual claims  supporters of president trump would be most unhappy to find a president beto orourke or kamala harris reaping the benefits of it in the coming years and then there is the opposite risk  with the pendulum swinging so far away from deference as to gut the doctrine going forward  a ruling against the president need not produce such a result  to be sure  mr  trumps declaration normally would prompt deference  yes  but in his signature way he has offered ample grounds for a court to find unique reasons to rule against him  during his emergency announcement  after all  he could not resist admitting  i could do the wall over a longer period of time  i didnt need to do this  but id rather do it much faster  theres more where that came from  and a judge ruling against the president will not need to erode the deference tradition more broadly if handled carefully enough  it should be possible for a court to describe this as an exceptionally rare instance in which deference fails  the proverbial exception proving the rule but the more alarming aspects of this scenario  and the larger climate of distrust mr  trump has brought on himself  could lead to a holding that guts the idea of deference more broadly  this  too  would be dangerous the deference tradition exists for good reason  the executive branch as a whole possesses access to information  expertise and experience that are critical for sound policymaking  and to at least some extent our legal system allocates responsibility for military and national security judgments to it  it may be that this is an outlier situation in which the boundaries of wise deference have been met and exceeded  with the presidents candor undoing his own legal case  but a reckless anti deference decision  sweeping broadly beyond the narrow facts of this unusual case  would lie about like a loaded weapon just as much as an unduly deferential ruling  its just that  in this case  its effect would encourage future judges to too readily abandon normally desirable constraints on their role they say bad facts make bad law  and whichever court gets the last word in this instance had best bear that in mind  if in the end there is an anti deference ruling  lets hope that it is specific to the unusual facts of this case  with pains taken to protect the general rule  and if in the end the courts instead defer  lets hope they have some way to reassure us all that this does not open the door to further abuses we knew the president was launching down a risky and unpredictable path  it turns out he is taking the courts with him .
washington  kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  on wednesday tersely defended a now defunct trump administration practice of separating migrant children from their families at the border  sidestepping whether she supported it as a way to deter illegal immigration in tense exchanges with house democrats  ms  nielsen instead implored congress to confront what she called a humanitarian catastrophe on the southern border by changing laws to crack down on illegal border crossings she also said the trump administrations family separation practice was similar to those of previous presidents  even if only sporadically enforced in earlier cases it was a policy by this administration that only ended when there were pictures of little kids in cages that had been ripped away from their parents  representative kathleen rice  democrat of new york  told ms  nielsen during a hearing of the house homeland security committee  update  kirstjen nielsen out as trumps homeland security secretary  ms  nielsen replied that ms  rice mischaracterized the administrations enforcement thats a policy  ms  rice said  you should admit it ms  nielsen noted that parents are generally separated from their children when they go to jail for illegal activities  but that wasnt the point of the immigration policy  she said the point was to increase prosecutions for those breaking the law  she added  sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  the hearing was ms  nielsens first since democrats took control of the house this year  she backed president trumps request to declare a national emergency at the border  which would give him access to funding to build a border wall  and cited new data from her department showing that the number of immigrants entering the united states illegally had doubled from a year ago immigration officials are on track to apprehend one million people crossing the southern border this year  ms  nielsen said this is not a manufactured crisis  ms  nielsen said  this is truly an emergency sarah huckabee sanders  the white house press secretary  later accused democrats of refusing to acknowledge a crisis at the border  she also chastised senate republicans who did not support the presidents emergency declaration if you had done what you were elected to do on the front end  then the president would not have to fix the problem on his own through a national emergency  ms  sanders said some republicans at the house hearing said they supported building a wall along the border representative daniel crenshaw  republican of texas  acknowledged the concerns about family separations but said physical barriers were crucial to securing the long stretches of land between ports of entry mr  crenshaw said he now doubted that we all value the rule of law and value the ability to manage our border effectively  a view he admitted was cynical the department of homeland security has opened three investigations into the trump administrations immigration policies  the agencys acting inspector general  john v  kelly  said in a separate hearing on wednesday mr  kelly said one investigation is looking into the departments systems for tracking migrant children separated from their families  another is examining whether asylum seeking families are being separated at the border department investigators were also reviewing whether parents facing deportation were given the option of bringing their children back home with them  in the hearing with ms  nielsen  ms  rice asked whether every relative facing deportation was  in fact  allowed to do so to the best of my knowledge  every parent was afforded that option  ms  nielsen said in the past  most undocumented immigrants entering the united states from mexico were single men looking for work  but over the past year  the number of migrants traveling together as a family has soared  a point that ms  nielsen sought to underscore officials have said migrants  and the smugglers who exploit them  know they are unlikely to be detained if they travel with a child under a court order  the government is prohibited from keeping children in holding facilities at the border for more than 72 hours  children must either be transferred to immigration detention facilities suitable for minors  or be released the government has allowed thousands of detained migrants to go free each week because it lacks enough beds to hold them in family detention facilities  immigration and customs enforcement  a branch of ms  nielsens department  can accommodate only 3 326 parents and children in its three residential family centers democrats also criticized ms  nielsen for not adequately keeping track of migrant children who were separated from their parents last year you let kids be separated without tracking them  do you know how outrageous that is  madam secretary  said representative nanette barragn  democrat of california  you have no feeling  no compassion  no empathy here ms  nielsen did not respond the practice  part of a zero tolerance immigration policy that drew swift condemnation after it was publicly announced last spring  quickly became a symbol of the presidents crackdown on illegal immigration  at the time  ms  nielsen repeatedly denied that her department had a policy of routinely separating migrant children from their parents at the border  despite mounting evidence that thousands of families had been broken apart during a news conference in june at the white house  she said she was offended by accusations that she would authorize separating children from their parents to send a message of deterrence  but the department continued to separate families until mr  trump  facing enormous public pressure  signed an executive order meant to end the policy representative bennie thompson  democrat of mississippi and the committees chairman  said he had requested documents on the treatment of asylum seekers at the border and family separations  after wednesdays hearing  mr  thompson told reporters that he expected that information within a week and was prepared to use subpoena powers as a last resort the secretary can choose whether to be complicit in this administrations misinformation campaign  mr  thompson said  or she can correct the record for much of her tenure  ms  nielsen has been the subject of mr  trumps ire over illegal immigration and border security mr  trump berated her privately for not doing enough to stop illegal immigration and accelerate construction of a wall along the border with mexico  the president grew repeatedly angry with ms  nielsen for telling him that his ideas to stop immigration would be illegal or improper by years end  reports were rampant that mr  trump wanted to fire ms  nielsen  but her credibility with the president has since improved  during the governments 35 day shutdown over funding for the presidents border wall  ms  nielsen was a fierce advocate for the wall and on wednesday morning  ms  nielsen made clear she would not stray far from the presidents anti immigrant language we face a crisis  a real  serious and sustained crisis at our borders  ms  nielsen said .
parkersburg  w va   on day 20 of the partial government shutdown last week  a small band of federal workers  shivering in 25 degree weather  staged a rally to send what their organizer  eric engle  said was a message to senator shelley moore capito  we need to end this shutdown  if it takes overriding the president  thats what it takes but here in the heart of trump country  that message is decidedly muffled  even in parkersburg  where the federal government is one of the two largest employers  so strong is support for president trump  who remains dug in on his demand for  5 7 billion to build a border wall  that even some furloughed workers insist ms  capito must stick with him we need the wall  jessica lemasters  29  an accountant on furlough from the treasury department  said over lunch at the corner cafe  a few blocks from the rally  i dont like being furloughed  but it happens those conflicting sentiments help explain why senate republicans like ms  capito remain in lock step with mr  trump  even as the longest government shutdown ever enters its fourth week and 800 000 federal workers miss their paychecks  the 24th day of the shutdown slipped by with no progress toward a resolution  and while polls show that a majority of americans blame mr  trump and republicans and do not support a border wall  republicans are reading a different line in the polling  support for the wall is growing and hardening among republican voters i am concerned for my people  said gregory d  blaney  an aerospace engineer who runs a nasa facility in fairmont  w va   and is working without pay  but  he added  im willing to endure some impact if it means border security mr  trumps verbal gyrations on the wall and the shutdown have left senate republicans bewildered  and twisting wildly themselves  senator lindsey graham of south carolina  a close ally of the president who is also running for re election in 2020  has gone from trying to negotiate a bipartisan compromise to advocating a presidential emergency declaration to calling on mr  trump to temporarily reopen the government while continuing negotiations on the wall on monday  mr  trump bluntly responded to that last one  i did reject it early last week  ms  capito  a freshman up for re election next year  seemed to be wavering when she suggested she might be able to live with negotiating border security after reopening the government  the democrats position but after mr  trump addressed the nation from the oval office and traveled to the border  she walked back those remarks  telling a local television station  i think president trump is going to stand strong  and im going to stand strong with him so far  only three senate republicans  cory gardner of colorado  susan collins of maine and lisa murkowski of alaska  have decisively broken with mr  trump and called for the government to reopen without a border wall deal  mr  gardner and ms  collins are up for re election in democratic leaning states  ms  murkowski was re elected in 2016 others are expressing their unease with caution  senator joni ernst of iowa has put distance  if only a tiny bit  between herself and mr  trump by saying that while she strongly supports a wall  it does not need to cover the entire southern border  senator martha mcsally of arizona has asked that her pay be withheld until the shutdown is over  senator thom tillis of north carolina has called for republicans to strike a deal that included long term security for the young immigrants known as dreamers who were brought to the country illegally as children  all will face voters in 2020 the question for republicans up in 2020 is how long can they let this go on  said jennifer duffy  who analyzes senate races for the nonpartisan cook political report  the more uncomfortable they get  the closer they get to breaking with trump  but they have to watch the base here in west virginia  where mr  trump clobbered hillary clinton by more than 40 points in 2016  the shutdowns effects are severe  the federal government employs nearly 3 5 percent of west virginia workers  a bigger share than in all but six other states and the district of columbia  according to data from the bureau of labor statistics the state has six federal prisons whose correctional officers are working without pay  other federal agencies have built big installations here to escape the high cost of office space in the washington region  the f b i  has a major fingerprint center on 986 acres of land in clarksburg  the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and nasa share a sprawling technology park in fairmont  all have employees working without pay just last month  after congress approved legislation championed by ms  capito  mr  trump renamed the nasa facility in honor of one of the women who inspired the academy award nominated film hidden figures  now it is mostly shuttered but border security is an issue that resonates in west virginia  in large part because of the states opioid epidemic  while mr  trump overstated the amount of opioids flowing into the nation through the southern border in his oval office speech  many here see the wall as one way to stop the tide we see every day the effects of the opioid epidemic  said ms  lemasters  the furloughed worker  explaining why she is so strongly in favor of the wall mr  trumps language about unauthorized immigrants also resonates strongly here  where whites make up 94 percent of the population  they come to this country  they are coming from third world countries  said steve plum  a retired police officer who owns the corner cafe with his wife  they have absolutely nothing to offer as to ms  capito  she needs to stand her ground  he said ms  capito  65  declined requests for an interview  she votes with mr  trump 96 percent of the time  according to the website fivethirtyeight  but her style is anything but trump like  she keeps a low profile in washington and sees government not as an enemy but as an opportunity for west virginia  whose residents rely heavily on federal support shes not a bomb thrower  shes never going to get too far out there on the edge  shes very careful  said hoppy kercheval  a prominent radio host in west virginia  who had ms  capito on his show last week  i would not call her a trump cheerleader  i would call her a supporter of trump policies ms  capito is also chairwoman of the senate appropriations subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the department of homeland security  and in that role she put together a bill that allocated  1 6 billion for border security and fencing it gained bipartisan approval in committee and has passed the democratic controlled house  but senator mitch mcconnell  the majority leader  refuses to take it up  so like other spending bills that could reopen the government  ms  capitos measure is now stalled in the senate i got  1 6 billion for the wall with 10 democrats voting for this  ms  capito told mr  kercheval  though the money was not supposed to be spent on a wall  but i also realize that holding parts of the government that are unrelated to this hostage  with people missing paychecks and things of that nature after a while begins to wear on not just the folks who are most directly affected but everybody tolerance may be eroding here in parkersburg  a city of about 30 000 that sits across the border from ohio the treasury departments bureau of the fiscal service  which most people call by its old name  the bureau of the public debt  employs about 2 000 people  though not all are affected by the shutdown  disgust with washington runs high i think they are acting like a bunch of freaking kids up there  said randy beymer  a retired salesman  over a late breakfast with his sister  donna hewitt  who nodded in agreement many are directing their ire at senator chuck schumer  the democratic leader  and speaker nancy pelosi  pelosi and schumer say a wall is immoral  theyve got a wall around their house  said rod sellers  70  a truck driver  echoing conservative talking points that are not true but ms  capito is already beginning to share in the blame  at the oil and gas museum downtown  which chronicles the citys history as a site for oil and gas exploration  darla uppole  who was visiting with her 11 year old daughter from nearby williamstown  said ms  capito needed to get off the sidelines and push mr  trump toward compromise hes got to be pushed  but shes got to support him too  she said  i do think we need the wall  but this is no way to run government .
how fitting is it that president trumps first oval office address  which he requested be televised live in prime time by every major network  was aimed at stirring up the american public about a crisis largely of his own making not that the border crisis is one of mr  trumps self serving political fictions  like the deep state or widespread voter fraud  it may have started out that way  but the situation has  with the presidents nurturing  become something far more tragic pursuing poorly thought out and even more poorly executed policies on the pretext of battling a nonexistent national security crisis  mr  trump has helped create a pressing humanitarian one  desperate migrant families being detained en masse at the border are overwhelming a system pushed beyond its limits by an administration that chose to ignore the implications of its actions  overcrowding  children falling gravely ill and  paradoxically  the haphazard release of throngs of detainees into border communities stretching from california to texas mr  trump is now invoking the urgency of the situation as a justification for pursuing more wasteful  hard line measures that most americans do not support  chiefly the ludicrous border wall over which he has shut down critical pieces of the government  the president and his enablers have been busily knitting together inaccurate data  misleading anecdotes  exaggerations and other alternative facts about the flow of criminals  drugs and terrorists across the southern border  he seems to hope he can paint a dystopian landscape of security threats and human suffering so dire that the american people will rally to his side and pressure congressional democrats to succumb to his demands for a towering wall  preferably concrete  but at this point  it seems  steel will suffice failing that  mr  trump has also been floating the possibility of stiff arming congress altogether  with his advisers increasingly anxious that republican lawmakers are poised to abandon them on the shutdown  the president has raised the threat of declaring a national emergency  which he thinks would allow him to command the pentagon to build his wall  such a move would prompt a swift and furious legal challenge  if not a full blown constitutional crisis  that could drag on indefinitely  it would  however  also give mr  trump a way to reach a wall free funding deal with congress without losing face  thus weaseling out of the shutdown box into which he has nailed himself the border wall began life as an applause line at mr  trumps rallies  and it has endured as the rare  perhaps even sole  policy objective that actually matters to him  the substance of true border security may not interest him much  but this symbol sure does  while mr  trump proved a wily campaigner and political street fighter  as president he has been painfully out of his element  two years in  he remains ill suited to the complicated  thankless  often grinding work of leading the nation  governance clearly bores him  as do policy details both foreign and domestic  he has proved a poor judge of talent  he prefers grandstanding to negotiating  and he continues to have trouble with the whole concept of checks and balances  while the republican base remains enamored of him  most of the electorate has grown weary of his outrages and antics which is why  with his wall on the line  mr  trump so desperately needs to convince the american people that they are facing an acute crisis  maybe even a bona fide emergency in times of trouble  an anxious public looks to its leaders  and the ability to telegraph strength  decisiveness and certitude assumes greater value than in periods of calm and prosperity  circle the wagons patriotism  maybe even a little jingoism  becomes more appealing  people long to feel protected with his demagogy  mr  trump managed to fuel a sense of insecurity and unease throughout his campaign  along with the idea that he alone could make america great again  in office  he has attempted to perpetuate that angst by proclaiming existential threats to the republic  be they migrant caravans storming the border  muslim terrorists flooding the airports or violent immigrants roaming the countryside  shutting down the government is only the most recent effort at getting what he wants by traumatizing the nation he has sworn to serve were mr  trump truly interested in securing the border  and easing the suffering his policies are making worse  there are immediate steps he could take  for starters  he could end this wretched shutdown so that the people responsible for protecting the border can get paid  immigration judges can return to processing asylum claims and  yes  the physical and virtual barriers already in place can be maintained and perhaps even improved beyond that  he would need to ease up on the my way or the highway swagger and sit down for a real discussion with lawmakers about how to address the deep dysfunction of this nations immigration system  none of which would be as sensational as grabbing some prime time airtime it would  however  be a sign that the president is at last getting serious

washington  president donald trump said on friday he was considering sending illegal immigrants in the country to so called sanctuary cities  prompting u s  mayors to accept such an offer as the battle over border security raged frustrated by rising numbers of undocumented immigrants arriving at the southern border and a failure to get congress to fully fund a u s  mexico border wall  trump taunted democrats by dangling the possibility of an influx of illegal immigrants into their communities  due to the fact that democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws  we are indeed  as reported  giving strong considerations to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only   trump wrote on twitter philadelphia mayor jim kenney responded in a statement   while the trump administration s proposal shows their disdain to basic human dignity  the city  philadelphia  would be prepared to welcome these immigrants just as we have embraced our immigrant communities for decades  in february  a federal appeals court said the trump administration could not terminate federal grants to philadelphia for its refusal to cooperate with immigration agents seeking to deport immigrants  in chicago  mayor rahm emanuel said in a statement  we would welcome these migrants with open arms  just as we welcomed syrian refugees  just as we welcomed puerto ricans displaced by hurricane maria and just as we welcome rohingya refugees fleeing genocide in myanmar   sanctuary cities are local jurisdictions that generally give undocumented immigrants safe harbour by refusing to use their resources to help enforce federal immigration laws that could lead to deportations those localities argue that it is not their responsibility to get involved in federal enforcement and that doing so could hinder policing efforts within communities  the washington post first reported on thursday that the white house has been considering a plan for transporting immigrants in detention and releasing them into sanctuary cities that are democratic strongholds the newspaper reported there was resistance from some high level department of homeland security officials concerned about several aspects of such a plan  including the potential costs nevertheless  trump  speaking to reporters at the white house on friday  said of sanctuary cities   we can give them an unlimited supply  of immigrants white house spokesman hogan gidley said these would be  illegal aliens that are already set for release   which likely would include families with children  house of representatives speaker nancy pelosi s hometown of san francisco is another sanctuary city in remarks to reporters on friday  pelosi  a democrat  said she was not aware of the newspaper report  but she added   it s just another notion that is unworthy of the presidency of the united states and disrespectful of the challenges that we face  as a country  as a people  to address who we are  a nation of immigrants  pelosi was in leesburg  virginia  where house democrats were wrapping up a three day retreat one immigration expert  who asked not to be identified  noted that undocumented immigrants in federal custody could be at one of several stages of the adjudication process and that trump likely has the power to have them sent to different jurisdictions from where they are being held but the source added   this is a stunt  it doesn t enhance the efficiency of the process  trump s challenge to democrats came one day after senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  a republican like trump  told reporters that he wanted to launch bipartisan negotiations to seek solutions to the nation s immigration woes in march alone  103 492 undocumented immigrants have been taken into custody along the southern border or turned away  many of them are from el salvador  honduras and guatemala and are seeking asylum in the united states away from high levels of violent crime and illegal drugs at home   reporting by mohammad zargham and richard cowan in washington and susan cornwell in leesburg  virginia  editing by richard chang and james dalgleish .
washington  president trump agreed on friday to reopen the federal government for three weeks while negotiations continued over how to secure the nations southwestern border  backing down after a monthlong standoff failed to force democrats to give him billions of dollars for his long promised wall the presidents concession paved the way for the house and the senate to both pass a stopgap spending bill by voice vote  mr  trump signed it on friday night  restoring normal operations at a series of federal agencies until feb  15 and opening the way to paying the 800 000 federal workers who have been furloughed or forced to work without pay for 35 days the plan includes none of the money for the wall that mr  trump had demanded and was essentially the same approach that he rejected at the end of december and that democrats have advocated since  meaning he won nothing concrete during the impasse mr  trump presented the agreement with congressional leaders as a victory anyway  and indicated in a speech in the rose garden that his cease fire may only be temporary  if republicans and democrats cannot reach agreement on wall money by the february deadline  he said that he was ready to renew the confrontation or declare a national emergency to bypass congress altogether we really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or steel barrier  mr  trump said  if we dont get a fair deal from congress  the government will either shut down on feb  15  or i will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and constitution of the united states to address this emergency  president trumps emergency powers  explained  but mr  trump has already adopted some of the language that his democratic adversaries have used during the longest shutdown in history  he conceded that we do not need 2 000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea  we never did and invoked the utility of smart walls that substitute some physical barriers for drones and other sensors  the semantic evolution provides both the president and democrats with a face saving way forward if they want it the surprise announcement was a remarkable surrender for a president who made the wall his nonnegotiable condition for reopening the government and a centerpiece of his political platform  some immigration hard liners that make up a key part of his political base were incensed by the capitulation good news for george herbert walker bush  as of today  he is no longer the biggest wimp ever to serve as president of the united states  the commentator ann coulter  who has aggressively pushed mr  trump to keep his campaign promise on the wall  wrote on twitter on capitol hill  though  jittery lawmakers from both parties greeted the news with relief  mr  trump relented as the effects of the shutdown were rippling with ever greater force across the economy  with fallout far beyond paychecks  on friday  air traffic controllers calling in sick slowed air traffic across the northeast  hundreds of workers at the internal revenue service also did not show up  and the f b i  director said he was as angry as he had ever been over his agents not being paid none of us are willing to go through this again  said senator lisa murkowski of alaska  referring to a half dozen republicans who voted on thursday for a democratic measure to reopen the government for two weeks  and its not just a few of us  there are a great many in our conference that feel pretty strongly  how the shutdown reordered american life  democrats  who declined to revel in their clear victory  said they would work in good faith to strike a deal on border security  they have raised their offer on border security funding considerably and toughened their rhetoric on stopping illegal immigration but speaker nancy pelosi stated plainly that any compromise would not include money for a new border wall  which democrats view as ineffective and overly costly even though many have supported border fencing in the past have i not been clear on a wall  ms  pelosi said at a news conference with senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  the two have repeatedly said they would support allocating additional money for technology and increased patrols along the border  like the ones mr  trump referenced on friday the cease fire should pave the way for mr  trump to deliver his state of the union address to congress after all  but ms  pelosi said it would not be held this tuesday  as originally scheduled  she had rescinded her invitation this week to come to the house chamber until the government was reopened  and on friday  she said she would work with mr  trump to find a new date the state of the union is not planned now  ms  pelosi said  when government is open we will discuss a mutually agreeable date as he announced the deal  mr  trump paid tribute to the federal workers who have endured five weeks without pay  expressing sympathy for them in a way he had not until now  you are fantastic people  he said he promised to ensure that workers would be compensated for the paychecks they have missed since the shutdown began in late december very quickly or as soon as possible  to that effect  the office of management and budget circulated a letter to affected agencies and departments on friday afternoon instructing management to prepare for an orderly reopening and to prioritize pay and benefits for workers but other costs will be more permanent  many federal contractors do not expect to be repaid for their work during the shutdown  its compounding effects will ultimately cost the federal government more money than if it was open  and though the long term economic damage caused by the shutdown remains to be seen  it appears that at the very least the short term pain was more costly than a down payment on the border wall according to an analysis from standard   poors  the ratings agency  the united states economy lost at least  6 billion in the five weeks the government was partly shuttered  more than the  5 7 billion that mr  trump had requested to build a steel or concrete barrier at the border mr  trump offered no explanation for his surrender  nor did he acknowledge that it was one  on twitter on friday night  he said  this was in no way a concession  it was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days  if no deal is done  its off to the races during the presidents speech earlier in the day  cabinet officials and white house aides lined the sides of the rose garden and applauded him  mr  trump began his remarks as if he had actually emerged victorious  saying that he was very proud to announce what he called a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government few lawmakers even in the presidents own party saw it that way i hail from a state that is very supportive of the president and border security with barriers  so that is a consideration for me  but there are a lot of other strategies we could employ that would work better than a shutdown  said senator shelley moore capito  republican of west virginia with polls showing the president enduring most of the blame by the public  republicans led by senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  pressured mr  trump to agree to the temporary truce  over the next three weeks  a house senate conference committee representing both parties will negotiate a border security plan  but if it fails to reach a consensus  government agencies could close again the presidents concession came a day after two competing measures to reopen the government failed on the senate floor  a democratic bill  which would have reopened the government with no strings attached  received more votes than the bill backed by mr  trump  which included temporary protections for some undocumented immigrants in exchange for  5 7 billion for his proposed border wall mr  mcconnell and mr  schumer huddled on thursday night after the failed votes to discuss a path forward  mr  schumer rejected the idea of offering a down payment for the wall to reopen the government and pitched mr  mcconnell on what ultimately became the agreement with mr  trump  according to a senior democratic aide mr  mcconnell  who viewed the shutdown as unnecessary from the start  found mr  trump eager to end the impasse  and in a series of calls  they ironed out the details  to the republican leader  it was a way to ease much of the pressure on federal workers and get the senate back to work as late as early friday morning  mr  trump appeared intent on declaring a national emergency at the border alongside the agreement to reopen the government  but mr  mcconnell and white house officials encouraged him to drop the idea  according to people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to discuss them republican leaders tried to rally their members during a closed policy luncheon before thursdays votes  but even as republicans prepared to support mr  trumps plan  the signs of mounting frustration after weeks of inaction were evident republican senators rose one by one to voice concerns about the effect on federal workers and the lack of forward momentum in an impasse that felt unbearable  they swore they would never stand by another government shutdown weve already lost  lamented senator johnny isakson  republican of georgia  according to people familiar with the remarks  its a matter of the extent we want to keep losing at another point  during an exchange first reported by the washington post  senator ron johnson  republican of wisconsin  vented at mr  mcconnell for putting republicans in the position of having to vote on two competing approaches to reopen the government  one republican and one democratic  without consulting them first you put us in this position  mr  johnson said  according to one of his aides mr  mcconnell  who had largely been absent from negotiations to reopen the government until late last week  responded  are you suggesting im enjoying this .
vice president mike pence insisted on beginning the first meeting with a prayer  so the chief of staff to the senate majority leader  mitch mcconnell  asked god to bring us together when negotiators met saturday in mr  pences ceremonial office in the eisenhower executive office building the next day  democrats began with their own prayer  offered by a member of senator richard j  durbins staff  that noted that jesus and mary were both refugees the two disparate prayers underscored the stalemate that lawmakers find themselves in as the shutdown drags into its third week  the two sides could not even agree on a pro forma invocation sixteen days into the partial government shutdown  congressional democrats and the white house have made little progress  the two weekend meetings  described by white house officials and democratic staffers in attendance who wished to remain anonymous  showed in ways big and small how the distance between the two sides remains a wide gulf with no clear compromise on the horizon the democratic staffers  who on sunday waited for about 45 minutes when republicans were late to the scheduled meeting  said they would not negotiate on the border wall until the government was reopened  according to a white house official in the room  mr  pence made it clear that the white house would not budge from the  5 7 billion in funding it wants for a wall  and that the white house would not reopen the government by supporting the six bill package that the house has passed  according to a democratic official familiar with the meeting and the white house had no response  democratic staffers said  when they pushed to acknowledge that making transportation security administration officials work without pay  and shuttering other agencies  was creating a security crisis in itself  when pressed to put their demands in writing  the gap between the sides seemed to widen even more as republicans added requests for asylum port of entry changes that democrats do not favor  and for additional presence of the immigration and customs enforcement along the border republicans  for their part  were more eager to demonstrate that progress was made over the weekend sarah huckabee sanders  the white house press secretary  on fox news sunday called the meetings the beginning of a conversation and said  the fact that theyre sitting down at the table is some progress but democrats said they were left with the impression that the most senior officials in attendance were arguing that they were not empowered to make any agreements  mr  pence noted that no numbers for wall funding would be discussed because the meeting was not a principals meeting  and when he introduced the presidents son in law  jared kushner  as the person who knew mr  trump better than anyone  mr  kushner demurred  saying that distinction belonged to his wife  ivanka trump  the presidents eldest daughter  who was not in the meeting a white house staffer in attendance described the weekend discussions as productive and cordial  but blamed ms  pelosi for being unwilling to look like she was negotiating with mr  trump to end the shutdown while there was little common ground  some small advances were made  white house officials said  republicans agreed that a concrete wall was a non starter  and that any text of a bill would refer to steel and not concrete and even though mr  pence said numbers would not be part of the weekend discussions  the secretary of the department of homeland security  kirstjen nielsen  on sunday provided democrats with a written statement outlining why the administration needed  5 7 billion for a barrier along the southern border in the meeting  ms  nielsen also gave the full briefing she had prepared to give democratic leaders last week in the situation room  outlining what the white house has described as a crisis at the border  several democrats in the room  according to the white house official  said they agreed with her that a humanitarian border crisis did exist  but the democrats who were interviewed said the two sides remained far apart about what constituted the correct response to a humanitarian crisis stephen miller  the white house policy aide who has been the architect of the presidents immigration policies and its public face  occupied a seat along the edge of the room at saturdays meeting  not at the table  and spoke infrequently  according to attendees  he interjected memorably only once  to argue that the flores agreement  which limits how long the government can detain immigrant children to 20 days  was creating a loophole for smugglers mr  kushner at one point defended mr  miller  calling him an expert on the subject  white house aides chuckled when he noted mr  millers hard line reputation as an immigration zealot was unfair  the democrats  however  did not express any amusement  mr  kushner asked the democrats at the table why they would not concede to changes in the flores agreement  but mr  pence later clarified that changes were not a condition of their negotiations at a news conference last week  mr  trump hinted that he might be willing to come to an agreement with democrats on deferred action for childhood arrivals  and addressing the issue of thousands of young immigrants who live in the country illegally  but the subject of a daca for wall deal was never broached over the weekend  aides said and when democrats asked mr  pence about the possibility of the president declaring a national emergency in order to secure money to build a wall  as he floated to reporters on sunday  mr  pence said the president has not yet made a decision the white house made clear on monday that mr  trump was standing firm on his insistence for a border wall  ms  sanders announced on twitter that mr  trump would visit the southern border  to highlight the continuing national security and humanitarian crisis .

mcallen  tex   president trump traveled to the rio grande valley earlier this month and made his case for building a wall on the southern border  needed  he said  to keep america safe from a variety of dangers that are continuing to make their way across the frontier from mexico to help make his point  the evidence was laid out on tables  a big bag of cash  bundles of drugs  high powered firearms  all confiscated by law enforcement agents working the borderlands in south texas this is just all recent  this is all very recent  mr  trump said  pointing to the illicit exhibit in front of him  mr  trump was not shy about his disgust for the illegal goods  it looks pretty brutal  this is not a manufactured deal  as you say  this is the real stuff but the display at the presidents jan  10 round table  it turns out  had little to do with what happens along unfortified reaches of the border  an examination of the seized items suggests that a border wall would not have stopped most of the items from entering the united states  or  in the case of several weapons displayed in front of the president  from leaving the united states for mexico many of the items on display were seized on international bridges on the texas border  detected by canines and customs and border protection officers  some of them were found during traffic stops or  in one case  inside a south texas home  and its hard to know how they entered the country its not complex  the president said  after various officials described the items on the table  if we dont have a barrier  a very substantial barrier of some kind  youre never going to be able to solve this problem but of course  the story of illegal border trafficking is complex  and one of the biggest takeaways to be gleaned from mr  trumps exhibit table was that nearly all of the items were intercepted by vigilant border agents  federal employees who have not been paid since the fight over a border wall led to a partial shutdown of the federal government on dec  22 the tableau in front of mr  trump included an ak 47 assault rifle and multiple 9 millimeter handguns  though mr  trump seemed to take credit for the all recent seizures of illegal goods  these weapons were actually seized in june 2016  the month before mr  trump officially won the republican nomination for president when a vehicle drove south from the texas border town of mission and onto the anzalduas international bridge bound for mexico  c b p  officers searched the car and found the weapons  according to an agency spokesman  there were also 20 ammunition magazines found in the vehicle  the spokesman said american made guns have illegally flowed south into mexico in large numbers for years  a 2013 study by the university of san diego found that nearly half of american firearms dealers are dependent on mexican sales  with an estimated 253 000 firearms purchased annually between 2010 and 2012 to be taken across the border stacks of  20 bills bundled in a plastic bag totaling  362 062 sat on one table  just days before the president arrived in mcallen  the cash had been inside the south texas home of edsgardo coss vallejo mr  coss vallejo had been living in the united states on a visa  but overstayed his allowed time in the country  when hidalgo county authorities and federal agents showed up at his house to investigate  mr  coss vallejo allowed them inside to conduct a search of his home  border patrol canines alerted on a duffel bag containing the cash  mr  coss vallejo denied ownership of the money mr  coss vallejo was arrested on suspicion of marriage fraud and currency smuggling  and he was deported to mexico after a large x ray scanned a tractor trailer entering texas from mexico at the pharr reynosa international bridge in september  customs inspectors wanted a closer look  canines did the rest and detected the drugs  according to a c b p  spokesman authorities found 117 kilograms of methamphetamines and 12 5 kilograms of heroin concealed in the ceiling of the truck  the spokesman said  a majority of heroin that enters the united states from mexico crosses not through remote stretches of unfenced desert  but through legal ports of entry  such as the border crossing in pharr  tex  but theres no way to know how much gets through  said fulton t  armstrong  who has worked as a national intelligence officer at the central intelligence agency  on the national security council and on the senate foreign relations committee  focusing on latin america the biggest shipments come through legal  established ports of entry  mr  armstrong said in an interview  though he added that there are also examples of drug smuggling that do not occur at official border crossings  mr  armstrong added  carrying this stuff requires sophistication  you dont just put it in your pocket  you dont carry large suitcases or bags when you come through non ports of entry this has raised questions about mr  trumps argument that a wall would help curb drug flows would setting up a fence help  no  theres no evidence at all  mr  armstrong said a  50 caliber sniper rifle took up a big part of one wooden table  with an ar 15 rifle positioned flat on its side alongside it in november 2017  homeland security investigations agents  working on a tip from c b p   found the sniper rifle during a traffic stop in south texas  according to a c b p  spokesman  the ar 15 was found the same way  by h s i  agents in south texas  but in january 2018 it is unclear where the weapons were headed  or whether they even originated in mexico

times insider explains who we are and what we do  and delivers behind the scenes insights into how our journalism comes together washington  i had a flight to palm beach booked for the day after christmas  president trump was scheduled to spend 16 days at his florida club  mar a lago  over the holidays  and our white house team had divided up the hardship assignment  with most of us taking three day shifts in the sun   last year on the gig  michael s  schmidt scored an unplanned interview with the president  destination mar a lago was a big reason many people close to the president predicted  at first  that the shutdown might be short lived  unaccustomed to spending winter weekends in washington  the president would be eager to resume his more familiar  golf all afternoon routine  his friends and allies said  he wouldnt let the fight with congress over a border wall ruin that but my flight came and went  and i was not on it  new years eve came and went  and no one on our team ever had to travel to florida  because the president didnt one of the biggest changes of covering mr  trumps west wing during the shutdown  now on its 34th day  is that he is here  almost all of the time  its become a point of pride for mr  trump  that he is waiting patiently in the white house  i am all alone  poor me  in the white house  he wrote on twitter over the holidays  for democrats to come back to the table and make him a deal  i e   fund his border wall but aside from mr  trumps physical presence in washington  there are fewer changes than one might think on the white house beat mr  trumps days are filled  sort of  with meetings with his vice president or a cabinet secretary  maybe an afternoon briefing on border security  or a meeting with lawmakers from the hill   chuck schumer and nancy pelosi  however  havent come over since jan  9  when they said that mr  trump stormed out after declaring their meeting a total waste of time  but the schedule is always light  mr  trumps day  almost every day  starts with three hours of unstructured and unexplained executive time  which in the mornings often means he hasnt left the residence  if you track his morning tweets with the cable chyrons  the text at the bottom of the screen during broadcasts   what it often means is that he is taking in the morning shows  the first meeting on his private schedule rarely occurs before 11 a m there have been no briefings from the press secretary during the shutdown  but thats not new either  those have been quietly phased out since last september the white house had no clear domestic policy agenda before the shutdown  there is little other work going on inside the building these days  but its not clear what short term projects senior staff members have been diverted from the whole city is quieter  you can always get a seat on the metro  traffic is light  the eisenhower executive office building  where overflow staff and other departments work from  has become a ghost town of empty offices  but the west wing is still buzzing with its typical antagonistic energy all of the senior white house officials who have become household names are still working  many of them want the shutdown to end  some of them are bored  when you visit their offices  theyll tell you theyre not worried about their own missed paychecks  but many of them will admit they are annoyed that there are empty chairs where their assistants usually sit twitter also still works during the shutdown  and mr  trumps thumbs have been as quick as ever when he sees an opportunity to belittle the press or amplify what looks like a brewing culture war  he relished a statement from the special counsels office that disputed a report that he had directed michael d  cohen  his longtime lawyer and fixer  to lie to congress about his role in negotiations to build a trump skyscraper in moscow  and he was quick to take sides in a race driven controversy  declaring that the white  male students from covington catholic high school had become symbols of fake news and how evil it can be after a viral video captured them in a standoff with a native american man at the march for life in washington  d c some parts of my job have become more frustrating  communications with the media will be limited to events and issues involving the safety of human life or the protection of property  or those determined to be essential to national security  was an automatic email response i got recently from a spokeswoman at the state department  i had contacted her to obtain public information that was supposed to have been published online but that has not been  because of the shutdown  the white house has also stopped distributing guidance for the week ahead  now  we find out the night before whats on the presidents agenda for the next day on tuesday  i spoke with someone intimately involved in the shutdown discussions  the person assured me that mr  trump was never  ever going to cave on the wall  and that there has been a silver lining to the shutdown  even as 800 000 federal workers are missing their second paycheck  this person said the shutdown has been an opportunity to make a national case about border security it sounds like pure spin  but theres something to that  in a white house where every major development is supplanted before its significance can be fully digested  the shutdown has overshadowed many things  james mattis  the defense secretary  resigned over what he considered a rash decision to pull troops out of syria  the trump foundation was forced to close amid allegations that the family was using it for personal benefit  the stock market lost more in a month than it had since the great depression  meanwhile  the shutdown has turned the white house into a one issue building  and its reporters into a one story crowd .
washington  the senate will hold competing votes on thursday on president trumps proposal to spend  5 7 billion on a border wall and on a democratic bill that would fund the government through feb  8 without a wall  it will be the first time the senate has stepped off the sidelines to try to end the monthlong government shutdown the procedural move by senators mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  and chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  is the first time the parties have agreed to do virtually anything since the shutdown began dec  22  with most republicans united behind mr  trumps insistence that any legislation to reopen the government include money for a border wall and most democrats opposed to the linkage  neither measure is expected to draw the 60 votes required to advance that means friday is likely to come and go without action to end the shutdown  forcing 800 000 federal workers to go without a paycheck for the second time this month but there was hope that the votes could usher in a more cooperative phase in a crisis that has so far been marked almost entirely by partisan posturing  if both measures fall short  the votes could add new energy to efforts to negotiate a bipartisan compromise  with the shutdown now in its fifth week  the pressure is growing on both parties to reopen the government people are saying  isnt there a way out of this mess  isnt there a way to relieve the burden on the 800 000 federal workers not getting paid  isnt there a way to get government services open first and then debate what we should do for border security  mr  schumer said tuesday on the senate floor after mr  mcconnell announced the votes  well  now theres a way still  mr  trump remained in a bitter spat with speaker nancy pelosi  democrat of california  over his forthcoming state of the union address  underlining the partisan divide that has helped to fuel the stalemate  ms  pelosi has suggested that the president postpone his prime time speech to a joint session of congress scheduled for jan  29 in light of the partial shutdown  but mr  trump does not appear inclined to do so a white house official wrote to security officials on capitol hill late sunday requesting a walk through on monday to prepare for the speech  in what two aides described as a bid to pressure ms  pelosi to issue mr  trump a formal invitation  but monday was a federal holiday  and the meeting never occurred  and there was no word from the speaker on how she planned to proceed white house aides  not knowing how the state of the union dispute will be resolved  have begun to prepare for two different speeches  in case one is not delivered at the capitol  according to people familiar with the discussions one possibility that has been explored is an oval office address  although mr  trump is aware that the brief one he delivered this month fared poorly in polls and in viewership ratings  making it less palatable to him  another option  they said  is a rally speech somewhere outside washington  but aides are concerned that would not be distinct enough from the type of event the president routinely holds on tuesday evening  ms  pelosi took another swipe at the president  using the phrase trump shutdown  which irked mr  trump in their televised oval office meeting last year  as she implored republicans to vote for the democrat backed spending bill on thursday  the senate will have the opportunity to put a bipartisan bill on the presidents desk to reopen government and end this senseless shutdown  ms  pelosi said in the senate  mr  trumps proposal  which he promoted in a televised address on saturday as a bipartisan compromise to pair wall funding with temporary legal protections for some immigrants  is facing all but certain death after white house officials conceded privately on tuesday they had tacked on controversial proposals anathema to democrats that would block many migrants from seeking asylum the republican legislation  unveiled monday night  would provide  5 7 billion in wall funding and large spending increases for the detention and removal of immigrants  as well as three year provisional protections for 700 000 of the young undocumented immigrants known as dreamers and for about 325 000 immigrants mostly from latin american countries and haiti who have been living in the united states under temporary protected status as sweeteners to entice democrats to back the measure  mr  mcconnell added  12 7 billion in disaster aid and an extension of the violence against women act  a measure that expired last year when government funding lapsed the opportunity to end all this is staring us right in the face  mr  mcconnell said tuesday  calling the presidents proposal a comprehensive and bipartisan offer but the measure also included several changes to asylum law  long advocated by stephen miller  mr  trumps senior adviser and an architect of his immigration agenda  that would make it more difficult for people to seek refuge in the united states from persecution and violence at home  among them were provisions to bar central american children from claiming asylum inside the united states  requiring them instead to do so in their own countries  and allow any of them to be quickly sent back to their own countries another revision would create a host of new grounds for deeming an asylum claim frivolous  including if the migrant seeking protection was also trying to obtain work authorization  had used a fraudulent document  knowingly or unknowingly  or did not file in a timely way mr  schumer rejected the plan as meant not to forge a compromise but to shift blame away from the president for the shutdown stalemate  calling the asylum changes a poison pill the presidents proposal is one sided  harshly partisan and was made in bad faith  mr  schumer said  adding that the measure was not a compromise  its more hostage taking a senior trump administration official who insisted on anonymity to describe internal deliberations said on tuesday that the asylum provisions were added at the behest of the department of homeland security once it became clear that democrats were going to oppose mr  trumps original proposal but even the provisions ostensibly meant to attract democratic support for the proposal fell short  while republicans say the protections are drawn from the bridge act  a bipartisan measure  that bill would in fact protect hundreds of thousands more dreamers  who were brought to the united states illegally as children  the republican proposal would shield only those who applied for and received work permits under deferred action for childhood arrivals  or daca  created by president barack obama  which mr  trump rescinded in 2017 the proposal also narrows the group of daca recipients eligible for the temporary protection  adding several requirements that applicants would have to meet  including an annual income threshold federal court decisions have kept daca in place  and on tuesday  the supreme court again declined the trump administrations request to review the legality of the program  almost certainly keeping it in place for the rest of the year  that decision by the court significantly devalued mr  trumps overture to democrats resisting wall funding mr  trump unilaterally did away with both daca and several grants of temporary protected status  leading mr  schumer to denounce the legislative proposal to revive them as the price for reopening the government and funding a border wall as bargaining with stolen goods  mr  schumers proposal would add disaster aid to previously passed house measures to fund the government at current levels through feb  8 the democratic proposal might have some appeal to a handful of moderate republicans who have expressed concern about the continuing shutdown  but to prevail  all democrats would need to vote for it  and they would need the support of 13 republicans  a tall order even as the senate planned for high stakes votes on thursday  the house was preparing to advance its own pair of proposals starting wednesday to reopen the government  democrats scheduled votes on a package of six spending bills negotiated between house and senate republicans and democrats that would include funding for immigration judges and infrastructure improvements at ports of entry  they also planned a vote on a separate stopgap spending bill that would fund the department of homeland security at current levels through feb  28 the measures are similar to legislation that the house has passed repeatedly over the past few weeks  only to meet with a blockade in the republican controlled senate  where mr  mcconnell has refused to take them up a group of centrist house democrats  led by representative elaine luria of virginia  is urging ms  pelosi to go further  in a letter being circulated among democrats  ms  luria  who defeated a republican last year in a military dominated district  called on the speaker to offer mr  trump action on his wall demands in exchange for agreement to reopen the government  under the plan  ms  pelosi would guarantee a vote by the end of february on border security spending  as well as immigration proposals  including protections for daca and t p s  recipients we understand that this shutdown was not created by the 116th congress  but it is our job to fix it  the letter says  we promised our constituents that we would seek bipartisan solutions  and we feel that this proposal would gain bipartisan support and allow a transparent process to evaluate the true needs of border security and provide much needed reform to our immigration process but mr  trump rejected a similar proposal by a group of senate republicans and democrats this month  after white house officials said the president was unwilling to drop his demand for wall funding and reopen the government on the mere promise of a freewheeling legislative process that might fail to produce a measure he could sign .
as a self described political conservative  reagan larson might seem to be a natural fit for the republican party  the 19 year old college student from south dakota grew up in a catholic household that objected to same sex marriage  and she remains firmly opposed to abortion but in many ways  that is where the ideological similarities end  ms  larson  a dual major in biology and spanish at gustavus adolphus college in st  peter  minn   does not oppose the legalization of marriage equality  she views climate change as undeniable  believes immigrants make our country richer  and disagrees with her parents on the need for a border wall ms  larson is part of generation z  one of the most ethnically diverse and progressive age groups in american history  people born after 1996 tend to espouse similar views to the age cohort just ahead of them  the millennials  but they are far more open to social change than older generations have been  according to the findings of a new report by the pew research center  the findings mark a shift that could substantially reshape the nations political and economic landscape according to the study  which was based on online surveys of 920 youths aged 13 to 17 and nearly 11 000 adults 18 or older  only 30 percent of generation z respondents said they approved of president trumps performance  more than half believed humans were fueling climate change  and 70 percent said they wanted the government to do more to solve the nations problems  those views roughly mirror attitudes held by millennials  and together  the two age groups may add up to a powerful voting bloc at odds with republican orthodoxy  political scientists say this should be an alert to the republican party as they think about generational replacement  said elizabeth bennion  a professor of political science at indiana university south bend each succeeding generation of americans tends to be more progressive than those that came before  ms  bennion noted  a trend that potentially poses a long term threat to the republican partys power if there isnt a will to change within the party  she said  it could become permanently in the minority moving forward democrats of all ages tend to align fairly closely on major social and political issues  but the report highlights a sharp generational divide among republicans  for example  more than half of the youngest republicans surveyed said that racial and ethnic diversity was good for american society  a view shared by fewer than 40 percent of their millennial counterparts  34 percent of generation xers and just three in 10 baby boomers young republicans are also more likely to approve of same sex marriage and accept transgender people michael schaefer  18  a politically conservative college freshman from youngstown  ohio  said he was in the sixth grade when some classmates came out as gay  and had a number of transgender students as friends in high school for over half my life  ive been shown the other side of sexuality and gender  he said  i dont care about their sex or gender  i just care about the individual more than one third of generation z respondents said they knew someone who preferred to be addressed using gender neutral pronouns  the pew study found  compared with 12 percent of baby boomers more than 68 million americans belong to generation z  representing about 22 percent of the nations population  according to 2017 survey data from the united states census bureau  a share larger than the millennials and second only to the baby boomers contrary to conventional wisdom  americans political and social views do not tend to drift to the right as they age  according to kim parker  who oversees research into social demographic trends at the pew research center the differences we see across age groups have more to do with the unique historical circumstances in which they come of age  she said  noting that demographers have not seen a generational pattern of growing more conservative or more republican over time paulina aceves  18  a high school senior in scottsdale  ariz  embodies the complexities of her generation  the daughter of mexican immigrants  she proudly identifies as a christian and a republican  but she does not support a border wall  nor does she believe the government should be less involved in american society the right solution is definitely for the government to take a more active role  she said the republican party has lost younger americans like travis gaither  though  as it has moved farther to the right on issues like immigration  gun control and climate change mr  gaither  who grew up in tennessee  described his parents as typical southern white republicans who belong to two country clubs and are active in the chamber of commerce but mr  gaither  20  was chairman of the high school democrats of tennessee during his senior year  a political transformation fueled by his liberal social views and cemented by his outrage over mr  trumps hard line policies the pew study found that two thirds of mr  gaithers generation believe  as he does  that black people are treated less fairly than whites in the united states  he said his feelings on the subject were shaped by an early brush with racism in high school  where a black girl he knew was menaced by a white football player who threatened to lynch her  and then his views were solidified last summer  he said  after a police officer in nashville killed an unarmed black man i feel like ive moved toward the left  as the republican party has shifted toward the right  he said  for more stories about generation z and millennials  please sign up here to have the edit newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox  .

election in 2020  by taking on president trump and the border wall  which are both popular in alabama  and refusing to give ground on the shutdown  the senator may be the last doug jones democrat to win here anytime soon alabama has one of the largest groups of federal workers in the country  and the economic pain of those who are out of work because of the shutdown is rippling through local businesses across the state i voted for jones  i did  said ann lynch  an 86 year old retired schoolteacher  as she did her grocery shopping wrapped in a fur coat on a brisk afternoon in huntsville  where more than half of the local economy is tied to federal spending  but he doesnt support the wall  i dont like that  of course  i think we need it  trump knows we need it mr  joness opposition also underscores the challenge mr  trump faces in fulfilling one of his key campaign promises  and the fierce partisanship that has come to define the stalled shutdown negotiations  if the president cant convince a democrat from alabama  the most vulnerable senator up for re election in 2020  to back his wall  who can he sway im just not going to throw money at anybody who is with a gun to my head  mr  jones said in an interview  referring to mr  trumps  5 7 billion request for the wall  lets get the government open in huntsville  the impact of empty offices at nasas marshall space flight center on the armys redstone arsenal base has rippled through the contractors  restaurants and hotels that power rocket city  with 5 000 workers furloughed across the state  the pain is being felt by people like angie gates  whose small family restaurant lost out on  600 worth of lunch business recently because a prison training program was shut down during the wall standoff for us  because were a small town  the shutdown is kind of difficult  but theres also things in politics that may be worth doing  said ms  gates  if doug jones doesnt support the wall  i dont support him democrats argue that the politics of the shutdown favor their party  pointing to surveys showing that a majority of americans blame the president for the stalemate and oppose the wall but that political calculus may not hold for mr  jones  who won a special election to fill the seat vacated by jeff sessions when he was appointed attorney general  polling also shows that support for the wall among conservatives  who make up much of alabamas electorate  has remained strong during the shutdown  even supporters of mr  jones think hes in trouble hes a dead man walking  said former representative parker griffith  a conservative democrat who helped mr  jones in his election and continues to support him  he leaned into his base  and his base is not big enough to elect him the partisanship that has become a hallmark of the trump era has not been kind to moderate democrats  of the five other democrats from trump supporting red states who were in the senate when mr  jones arrived last year  three lost their 2018 re election bids after opposing mr  trump on various fronts  including the confirmation of justice brett m  kavanaugh to the supreme court one who survived last year  senator joe manchin of west virginia  has stood closer to mr  trump on the border wall than any other democrat in the senate  running an ad during his campaign touting his support for the proposal and saying he would back a presidential declaration of a state of emergency  if it would end the shutdown mr  jones has adopted a different playbook  while he has voted with mr  trump half of the time  according to the website fivethirtyeight  more than nearly any other senate democrat  he has stood with national democrats on high profile issues  including opposing justice kavanaugh  he used his first speech on the senate floor to call for new gun control measures  tackling an issue that has long been anathema to many southern democrats democrats hope voters will value mr  joness decision to stick with his gut when it comes to difficult political issues  even if that means siding with the national party hes a guy whos going to be true to himself  said john anzalone  a birmingham based democratic pollster  authenticity is what sells in a place like alabama but theres also little question that mr  jones hit the political jackpot with his special election in 2017 by facing roy s  moore  an already controversial republican opponent who became all but radioactive after charges of sexual assault against underage girls  even with that baggage  mr  jones beat mr  moore by only about 20 000 votes a number of republican officials in the state  including representative bradley byrne and the alabama state senate president pro tempore  del marsh  are considering challenging mr  jones next year  none have the liabilities of mr  moore  who motivated a surge of black democratic voters while prompting some alabama republicans to cross party lines and others to stay home from the polls on top of those local challenges  mr  jones will also be running against the backdrop of the 2020 presidential election  a contest that will both highlight the national democratic platform and bring out conservative voters eager to support the president even some of his supporters dont expect to be represented by mr  jones for much longer senator jones  bless his heart  hell be a one term senator  said sheila pressnell  61  as she walked through a huntsville shopping center popular with employees of nasa and other government agencies  the only reason he got it was because he was up against a child predator in the interview  mr  jones said he is seeking bipartisan solutions to the shutdown  saying the debate is just nothing but political noise right now and blaming both parties for the stalemate republicans from his state have taken a starkly different approach the president is not going to blink  and he shouldnt  said senator richard c  shelby  mr  joness republican colleague in the senate  adding that he would tell furloughed federal workers to get your democrat friends to the table and negotiate with us while shutdowns rarely determine the outcome of elections that come months or years later  the current political climate delivers a political double whammy to mr  joness standing in the state  as some voters blame congress  bitter that lawmakers are collecting paychecks as government workers struggle  and others want the border wall sandra snell  a transportation security administration agent at the huntsville international airport  said she doesnt believe anyone in washington understands the economic struggles she now faces  before the shutdown  she was preparing to sign a loan on a new house  now  shes worried about paying her bills youre a federal employee  im a federal employee  ms  snell  51  said she would like to tell members of congress  im having to go to work without pay  youre going to work with pay  id like to see my check  too in huntsville  local lenders and utilities are offering ways for furloughed workers to negotiate lower rates  restaurants near the base say they have seen a nearly 50 percent drop in customers since the shutdown began  churches offer counseling for furloughed workers  food banks are stocking up on nonperishable  hearty fare like pasta  beans and tuna  and pawn shops are doing brisk business mr  jones has been working with constituents to help them find services  and he has been an active presence on television and on the senate floor pushing for a resolution  he has pushed to meet with mr  trump  saying the white house should come and brief members of congress beyond just the party leadership but for some in alabama  the crisis offers another reminder to voters that mr  jones doesnt back the president  or his top campaign promise  pam mcgriff  the owner of a custom interior car detailing shop in holly pond  didnt vote in mr  joness first election but said she would consider supporting him in 2020 if he supported mr  trump if he would go up there and balk the democrats  like schumer and pelosi  and say  hey  i think trump is right  and all that kind of stuff  i wouldnt mind splitting my ticket  said ms  mcgriff  56  a republican her husband  wayne  disagreed  saying that sitting out mr  joness election wasnt a choice he would be likely to repeat after watching the senator in office he should support what the people of alabama want  which is the wall  he said  he shouldnt be there  and next time hell be voted out .
london  president trumps push for a border wall hints at a problem that populist leaders are facing across the western world after a year of setbacks  populist leaders and parties are trying to rejuvenate their fortunes by revitalizing the sense of crisis on which they thrive  but as with mr  trumps demand for a border wall  which has brought a two week government shutdown  this may say more about populisms weakness than its strength immigration and terrorism crises  which aided populisms world shaking rise in 2016  have waned  populists have faced disappointing election results in germany  the united states and even poland  shattering the image of the movements inevitability and its claims to represent true popular will the wests populist leaders and parties have grown defensive  retreating into ever starker messages of us versus them  the approach excites their most dedicated followers  but it can be risky  forcing voters to pick sides at a moment when the populist right holds declining appeal cas mudde  a dutch political scientist and leading scholar of populism  has predicted that the movements once meteoric rise will become modest and uneven in 2019  with more setbacks ahead populism is hardly dying  it holds power in the united states  italy and a few eastern european countries  as well as meaningful parliamentary minorities in much of western europe  where populist parties now reliably win about one in six votes still  without a crisis to justify populisms hard line policies  its message has been stripped down to its most core element  opposition to liberal ideals of pluralism  multiculturalism and international cooperation the result is a new phase in the populist era  one that will test populisms appeal  and that of its ideological rival  postwar establishment liberalism  as never before this story  playing out across western democracies  may be encapsulated best by the still unfolding drama of mr  trump  the government shutdown and the border wall two years after he won the presidency  threats supposedly posed by immigration and terrorism in the united states have not materialized illegal immigration continued its 10 year decline  a spate of terrorist attacks inspired by the islamic state occurred before mr  trump took office americans lost enthusiasm for strict policies like mr  trumps promised wall on the mexican border  which polls poorly  republicans suffered a devastating defeat in the midterm elections  mr  trumps divisive message  rather than pulling more voters in  had pushed some away but populists  who thrive on conflict against an existential threat  cannot bend with popular will as easily as mainstream parties  rather than giving up on his wall and compromising his vision  mr  trump has dug in populists in europe had a similarly rocky year in britain  support for brexit has slipped below 50 percent  polls suggest a majority of voters want a second referendum  brexit hard liners in the governing conservative party tried and failed to eject theresa may  the prime minister  over her support for a softer brexit in germany  the rise of alternative for germany  a far right party  has stalled  it performed worse than expected in elections in the border state of bavaria  where immigration is a major issue  and worse than it fared a year earlier when bavarias center right party tried to co opt the populist message and challenge chancellor angela merkel over immigration  it suffered election losses  ms  merkel survived  her approval rating spiked and she lined up a centrist successor many western populists are falling back to their message of besiegement and threat  as much out of the paranoid worldview that is central to populism as out of any conscious strategy brexit hard liners are pointing to the 470 people who illegally crossed the english channel by boat last year  a drop in the bucket compared with the hundreds of thousands of arrivals to europe in 2015 and 2016  mr  trump has claimed  with no hard evidence  mayhem at the mexican border but dividing the world into us versus them works only if voters want to belong to us and oppose them  typically establishment elites and cultural outsiders in europe  many more voters have had contact with migrants since 2016  which research suggests can lessen fear and resentment  in the united states  the buoyed economy has undercut fears of economic competition from immigrants one of the countries most often cited as a populist success last year may also underscore the movements challenges the sweden democrats  a populist party  won 17 5 percent of the vote  its highest share ever  in a national election in september  if populists could surge this high  this fast even in sweden  a bastion of liberalism  surely it represented a global shift but polls tell a different story support for the sweden democrats has not grown since the end of 2015  just as the refugee crisis began tapering off  and the partys share of the vote last year was only slightly more than that of dutch far right populists in 2017  which had been considered a disappointing setback for the movement swedens experience may suggest that western populists rose only with the refugee and terrorism crises and that  as those crises have faded  populism has stalled out well below the numbers needed for it to sustainably hold power a review of populisms global performance  conducted by jordan kyle and limor gultchin of the london based institute for global change  reached a similar finding populists today hold 20 governments worldwide  the same number they held in 2010  have held most years since and have never surpassed  what we perceive as a new wave may in fact be populism shifting out of poorer countries  often in latin america  where they have since suffered setbacks  to the west but there is another way to read cases like sweden  not as the populist wave cresting  but as the liberal consensus breaking  even if populists win power only occasionally  struggle in office and mostly consign themselves to an angry minority  that they play any role at all represents a seismic change their rise  even if it never progresses much further  could still reshape western politics in ways we are only beginning to understand stripped of claims to be responding to an immigration crisis  the populist message is taking on a certain clarity  and proving an enduring  if narrow  appeal though these parties surged in support only recently  their slow but steady rise dates to the 1960s  when postwar liberalism took hold ever since  they have used crises to hit on deeper fears of demographic and cultural change brought about by liberalism  and they have channeled opposition to an establishment consensus that called it taboo to question liberal ideals there has always been some discomfort with the aspect of liberalism that populists are most aggressively challenging  the notion that democracies must extend rights and protections to outsiders western populists have surfaced that discomfort and given it voice  by winning at least enough votes to force the world to listen  they have opened up space for western voters to reject liberal strictures explicitly parties like the sweden democrats and alternative for germany may no longer have much hope of leveraging crises to win power outright  but there appears to be enough latent opposition to liberalism to keep populists well involved in politics border crises  real or imagined  are ideal for this message  they highlight aspects of liberalism that people find most objectionable  promises to protect outsiders  demands that countries compromise sovereignty and the softening of fixed  racially defined national identities so perhaps when brexit hard liners or bavarian populists play up border crises that may seem exaggerated they are speaking to a deeper concern among their small but dedicated base that may be enough to keep them in national legislatures and conversations  even if populists in the west never advance beyond their heights in 2016  they will remain in a strong position to challenge liberalisms postwar hold over western democracies even in countries like germany or france  where centrist leaders hold power  the establishment party system has collapsed  seva gunitsky  a university of toronto political scientist  has argued that the distinction between democracy and authoritarianism is already blurring  with more elected leaders taking on the tools and tactics of strongmen postwar liberal democracy is simply too new of a system  scholars of democracy say  to know whether it can survive these challenges  we may look back at 2016 as a populist blip associated with one off crises  or as the beginning of a process of chipping away at liberal democracy from within for anyone who was hoping for a break in the hectic politics of the past years  mr  mudde wrote in his assessment of populisms prospects  2019 wont be it .

house republican leaders removed representative steve king of iowa from the judiciary and agriculture committees on monday night as party officials scrambled to appear tough on racism and contain damage from comments mr  king made to the new york times questioning why white supremacy is considered offensive the punishment came on a day when mr  king was denounced by an array of republican leaders  though not president trump  the senate majority leader  mitch mcconnell  suggested mr  king find another line of work and senator mitt romney said he should quit  and the house republicans  in an attempt to be proactive  stripped him of the committee seats in the face of multiple democratic resolutions to censure mr  king that are being introduced this week those measures would force republicans to take a stand on the house democratic majoritys attempt to publicly reprimand one of their own mr  king  who has been an ally of president trump on the border wall and other issues  has a long history of making racist remarks and insults about immigrants  but has not drawn rebukes from republican leaders until recently  in november  top iowa republicans like senator charles e  grassley endorsed mr  king for re election even after one house republican official came out and denounced him as a white supremacist  steve king has a history of making racist remarks  read them and more here  but in an interview with the times published last week  mr  king said  white nationalist  white supremacist  western civilization  how did that language become offensive speaking to reporters on monday night after the house republican leadership team acted  representative kevin mccarthy of california  the minority leader  said he was not ruling out supporting a censure or reprimand resolution against mr  king  he said the republicans are not removing mr  king from the g o p  house conference itself  so he can still attend its party meetings  and it was up to iowans whether mr  king should stay in office this is not the first time weve heard these comments  mr  mccarthy said of mr  king  an acknowledgment of the racist language the congressman has used before  that is not the party of lincoln and its definitely not american mr  mccarthy  who conferred privately with mr  king for an hour before the vote  did not say why the most recent comments were a breaking point given mr  kings long public record of similar remarks  maybe i did not see those  but i disagree with these the full republican conference must still technically ratify the leaders decision  but mr  mccarthy presented the matter as closed mr  king remained defiant after losing his committee seats  releasing a long statement insisting that his comments in the times article had been misunderstood  he said he had been referring only to western civilization when he asked how did that language become offensive  not white nationalist or white supremacist leader mccarthys decision to remove me from committees is a political decision that ignores the truth  he said he said he told mr  mccarthy  you have to do what you have to do and i will do what i have to do  he pledged to continue to point out the truth and serve his district for at least the next two years the push to condemn mr  king illustrated how alarmed senior republicans are about the partys image just two months after they lost 40 house seats  most of them in suburban or diverse districts  including seven in mr  mccarthys home state of california  where the g o p  is on the brink of extinction the condemnations of mr  king stood in stark contrast to the lawmakers willingness to tolerate president trumps  frequent offensive and insensitive remarks about migrants  black people  native americans and other minorities just last week  the president used the oval office to unleash a blistering assault on undocumented immigrants  portraying them as criminals in a fashion that harked back to an earlier era of american politics but rarely heard from a president in modern times  and on sunday night  mr  trump invoked the wounded knee massacre of hundreds of native americans as an attempt to joke about senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts im glad that they are finally taking action after all of these years of steve king slandering immigrants and hispanics  but the president of the united states is also doing that and he just said something about elizabeth warren a few evenings ago that was also racially ugly and we havent heard a word of condemnation from anyone in the republican party about that  said representative joaquin castro  democrat of texas  make sense of the people  issues and ideas shaping american politics with our newsletter  congressional republicans have continued to embrace the president and his hard line immigration politics  averting their gaze from his inflammatory rhetoric out of fear their core voters will punish them if they stray from mr  trump the president  when asked by reporters on monday about mr  kings remarks  said  i havent been following it republicans are now trying to get ahead of a fast moving political problem while the country is in the midst of a lengthy government shutdown over a border wall by president trump  who in many ways patterned his immigration policies and rhetoric on those of mr  king mr  mccarthy called a special meeting of the republican steering committee to remove mr  king from judiciary  which has jurisdiction over immigration  voting rights and impeachment  and agriculture  which is a prized committee for iowans  mr  king also lost his seat on the small business committee  the steering committee vote was unanimous while republican officials quickly turned on mr  king  the party also came in for criticism from the senates lone black republican  senator tim scott of south carolina  he noted that the g o p  has long remained silent in the face of racist comments some in our party wonder why republicans are constantly accused of racism  it is because of our silence when things like this are said  mr  scott wrote in a washington post opinion column it is not clear what  if any  additional steps congressional republican leaders will take with mr  king  the national republican congressional committee indicated monday that they were not ready to step away from him the n r c c  does not get involved in primaries and isnt going to comment on a hypothetical general election two years away  said chris pack  a spokesman for the house campaign arm democrats are moving to censure or reprimand the iowa congressman  a stinging penalty  among them were representative james clyburn of south carolina  the highest ranking african american in congress  who introduced a measure monday night in the form of a resolution of disapproval of mr  kings comments and white nationalism democratic leaders in the house have yet to say what they will do with the competing censure resolutions  but are inclined to allow a vote of some sort related to mr  kings remarks  according to one senior democratic aide in the interview with the times  mr  king also reflected on the record number of minorities and women in the new democratic controlled house  you could look over there and think the democratic party is no country for white men  he said mr  kings hard line immigration policies and demeaning comments about hispanics foreshadowed mr  trumps nativist rhetoric in his 2016 campaign  in his two years in the white house and during the government shutdown over a border wall  the president once boasted to mr  king that he raised more money for him than anyone else  mr  king recalled in the times article  which traced how the iowa congressman helped write the playbook for white identity politics that dominate the republican party under mr  trump he has already drawn one serious primary opponent  state senator randy feenstra  for the 2020 campaign and some high profile republicans have indicated they will not embrace his re election it does open the door for other individuals to take a look  gov  kim reynolds of iowa said in a television interview last week of mr  kings closer than expected victory last year ms  reynolds said she was staying out of the primary right now  but multiple iowa republicans said the states senior elected officials were unlikely to endorse mr  king again and would wait until there is more clarity in the primary field before rallying to one of his g o p  challengers  other western iowa republicans are expected to challenge mr  king  who has fended off primaries before but did so with the support of his party and its top leaders in addition to ms  reynoldss criticism  iowa republican chair jeff kaufmann said the state party would remain neutral in mr  kings primary also  iowas two republican senators  mr  grassley and joni ernst  along with senator ted cruz of texas  who had appointed mr  king a co chairman of his 2016 presidential campaign  all rebuked mr  king in recent days all had eagerly embraced him in the past because of his standing with the states most conservative voters  keys to winning statewide elections in iowa  which holds the first in the nation presidential nominating contest mr  grassley had endorsed mr  king in november for re election  even after the chairman of the house republican election committee denounced mr  king as a white supremacist iowa needs steve king in congress  mr  grassley said in that endorsement  i also need steve king in congress ms  ernst  who faces re election in 2020  appeared with mr  king at a rally in his district the monday before election day last year  after he had endorsed a toronto mayoral candidate with neo nazi ties .
on the 12th day of the federal government shutdown  the 45th president of the united states of america posted a meme on his instagram account  an image of his half glowering  half smirking visage  hovering gigantically above the southwestern desert  dwarfing the pictures centerpiece  a rendering of his signature campaign promise  and  in a familiar font  some explanatory text  the wall is coming  its an image that makes you think  thats from hbos hit series game of thrones  sort of  and then makes you think about the unique privileges and burdens of living in this moment in history there are so many unusual aspects of donald trumps presidency that his willingness to communicate with the public through internet memes is often overshadowed  typically  he retweets images made by his most enthusiastic backers  in november he shared one of the clintons  barack obama  huma abedin  robert mueller  his own deputy attorney general rod rosenstein and others  all locked up in a prison cell together  but the wall meme appears to be a white house original  it is also the second game of thrones meme the president has shared in the last two months  he does this sort of thing so often that the senate minority leader  chuck schumer  recently felt compelled to tweet  like an exasperated high school teacher  enough with the memes its impossible to overstate how peculiar it is that the most powerful man in the world  who will turn 73 in june  posts memes  its a behavior more often associated with youth  irreverence and a surfeit of free time  though certainly plenty of old  aggrieved people have picked up the habit in recent years  in 2016  the trump campaign united message board trolls and facebook boomers  and together they disseminated so many memes that some of them began to believe  both jokingly and not  that their meme magic had helped trump win the election in current usage  meme refers most often to an image with text overlay  designed for distribution online  theyre like the bumper stickers of the digital realm  in that any one concept can be endlessly remixed to convey just about any sort of sentiment  calvin can pee on anything   what began more than a decade ago as a fun way to imagine how cats might talk has evolved into a surprisingly fertile mode of political communication  the online database know your meme has confirmed the existence of some 4 066 successful memes in the wild  including newcomers like big chungus  a fake series of video games starring an obese rabbit  and classics like doge  which featured a shiba inu speaking broken english  the actual number is certainly much higher you might find this very silly  and you wouldnt be wrong  but keep in mind  the president posts them all of this represents a long fall from the memes origins  the word was coined by the british ethologist richard dawkins in his 1976 book  the selfish gene  as a way to conceptualize the transmission of culture in biological terms  for dawkins  a meme  shortened from the greek mimeme  an imitated thing  was a unit of culture  a building block of our mental architecture  just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from body to body via sperms or eggs  dawkins wrote  memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain  they could be as small and short lived as a tune or catchphrase  he explained  or as large and consequential as god and eternal damnation genes  dawkins argued  do not aim to propagate a species  they seek only to propagate themselves  memes  he believed  were similarly selfish  dawkins spends most of his chapter on memetics fixating on religion  and because he has since become such an aggressively outspoken atheist  reading the book today it is easy to get the sense that he considers religion almost parasitic  the concept of god  he figured  endures because it offers a psychological salve to people  while eternal damnation survives because it is useful as a means of social control  thus both live on  copied from generation to generation  latching on to humanity and perpetuating themselves too effectively to be got rid of  selection favors memes that exploit their cultural environment to their own advantage  dawkins wrote ideas  in this view  have lives of their own  and the environment in which they struggle for survival is the human mind  our limited processing power means that only the toughest will persevere  if a meme is to dominate the attention of a human brain  dawkins wrote  it must do so at the expense of rival memes  he conceded that a meme would also have to compete for airtime on the radio or tv  billboard space  column inches and book pages  but  writing back in the 1970s  he had no reason to consider what would happen if those scarcity conditions vanished  if they did  you would find yourself in a terrifyingly fecund primordial soup in which all sorts of ideas could develop  mutate  cross pollinate  do battle  die off and be reborn  you would find yourself  well  online and while this primordial soup has brought forth many novel concepts  and resuscitated some old  corrosive beliefs  the things we call memes today are largely just joke formats  mechanisms for the efficient production of humor  they develop less like new ideas and more like algal blooms  spreading until they block out the sun and consume all the oxygen  before dying out naturally  people get sick of them  or getting hit with bleach  explainer journalists write about them   individually  these memes leave little mark on our culture  worse than being forgettable  they become  within a year or two  embarrassing to think back on for even one second but taken as a whole  this swarm of cultural mayflies represents a meaningful shift in our culture  joke making  a sometimes cruel enterprise  has been mechanized and democratized  humor now emerges from the ether  authorless or  more accurate  authored and improved upon by everyone  jokes are communal now  and constant  online  everything that happens all day  in politics  in culture  in the news  is rapidly repurposed for laughs  by everyone  all at once for the most part  this is harmless  after all  what could possibly go wrong in a culture where all anyone wants is to be perpetually amused before trumps border wall was the cause of a government shutdown  it was a mnemonic device  less a policy proposal than a string tied around the finger  according to a recent article in the times  the wall was a memory trick for an undisciplined candidate  trumps advisers sam nunberg and roger stone knew that getting tough on immigration would play well to a right wing audience  but they also knew the man they were dealing with  he has a mind for the tactile  so they gave him something gigantic to hang onto  an 1 800 mile long slab of concrete but trumps talking points were never just talking points  they were more like bits  his campaign rallies were rambling  unscripted affairs  almost like an open mic comedy set  not a fearsome nuremberg rally  but an aging showman road testing material  seeing what caught the audiences attention  early on  his speeches were all over the place  the nbc reporter katy tur told frontline  but as time passed  he started to really hone his message  and he started to remember what lines worked  in the same episode  the writer marc fisher said trump told him that he would simply wait to see the red lights on the tv cameras in the press box turn on  indicating he was live  and then he would say whatever it took to keep the red light on the border wall kept the lights on  at a 2016 rally in burlington  vt   trump mentioned the wall to tremendous  wonderful applause  then paused and asked his audience  and whos gonna pay for the wall  the crowd roared back  mexico  they  he and his crowd  did this two more times together  then trump laughed  ive never done it before  i swear  he said  throwing his arms up as if surprised it had worked  that was pretty cool  were gonna have to use that this incentive structure  in which an easily distracted person says a bunch of stuff he kind of means to an assembled audience  slowly learning what generates a reaction and what doesnt  is familiar  its like posting online  this is the process that nudged the wall ever closer to reality  despite the fact that it was only ever supposed to be a metaphor  a shorthand  a catchphrase  it is an idea with no real owner or creator  passed from person to person  from lectern to grandstand to tv and twitter and back again  copying itself and growing and mutating until it became big  beautiful and tipped with spikes forged from american steel  the border wall is  in the truest sense  a meme  an idea that persists not because it will benefit us but simply because it thrives in our environment  it was so effective at doing whatever it did that it couldnt be contained  spilling out of the presidents brain and spreading throughout our entire body politic  cooling and hardening like bacon grease  until it finally brought everything to a standstill  and i hate to admit it  but that is a little funny .
washington  a day after california filed a lawsuit challenging president trumps emergency declaration on the border  the transportation department said it was exploring legal options to claw back  2 5 billion in federal funds it had already spent on the states high speed rail network the trump administration also said it was terminating a  929 million federal grant to the california high speed rail authority  according to a letter the transportation department sent tuesday the  77 billion los angeles to san francisco bullet train  which has been a goal of california transportation planners for decades  has long faced opposition from mr  trump and other republicans  but on tuesday morning  the president explicitly tied the rail line to efforts to stymie construction of the mexican border wall the failed fast train project in california  where the cost overruns are becoming world record setting  is hundreds of times more expensive than the desperately needed wall  mr  trump wrote on twitter gov  gavin newsom of california  who announced last week that he was scaling back the project  said the transportation departments move was retaliation for the border wall lawsuit  filed on monday with 15 other states its no coincidence that the administrations threat comes 24 hours after california led 16 states in challenging the presidents farcical national emergency  mr  newsom said in a statement  this is clear political retribution by president trump  and we wont sit idly by  this is californias money  and we are going to fight for it the battle over money is just the latest clash between california and the trump administration  which have fought over immigration  environmental and criminal justice issues  xavier becerra  the california attorney general  has been a vociferous critic of the administration and has filed 46 lawsuits against it so far  read more about the long running debate over californias bullet train here  on tuesday  mr  trump disparaged the way california had spent the rail money and the states role in the national emergency lawsuit  california  which has wasted billions of dollars on their out of control fast train  with no hope of completion  seems in charge  the president tweeted a white house spokesman declined to comment  referring questions to the transportation department  a spokesman for the agency said the reason for canceling the grant was clearly laid out in a letter from ronald l  batory  the administrator of the federal railroad administration mr  batory wrote that the federal funds were being pulled because the california high speed rail authority had failed to make reasonable progress on the project the transportation department said in a separate statement on tuesday that it was actively exploring every legal option to seek the return of the  2 5 billion  that threat  however  was not mentioned in mr  batorys letter late tuesday  a trump administration official pointed to mr  newsoms remarks last week as an indication that the project was too costly and would never be constructed as planned given that acknowledgment  the official said  the administration had a responsibility to taxpayers to cancel the financial support for this boondoggle the lawsuit over the emergency declaration  filed in federal district court in san francisco  argues that congress controls spending and that the president does not have the power to divert funds for the construction of a wall speaking to reporters on tuesday in the oval office  mr  trump said that he had been expecting the court challenge  but was not fazed  were going to be very successful with the lawsuit  he said  adding  its an open and closed case the court challenge raises thorny legal issues over the scope of emergency powers granted to a president  mr  trumps declaration is the first time a president has invoked emergency power statutes to circumvent congress after it rejected funding for a specific policy being pushed by the white house it is also unclear whether the federal government has the legal authority to withhold the grant from california  and state officials are likely to challenge the move in court dan richard  who stepped down tuesday as chairman of the board of the high speed rail project  noted that the letter from the trump administration said the federal government intends to terminate the agreement  rather than saying it was canceling it outright  he said he believed this gave california time to press for an agreement to keep the  929 million of course its a serious matter  the federal government has a lot of power in this situation  he said  im hoping that the phrase intends to terminate gives an opportunity for parties to resolve this issue the project has been a major employer in californias central valley  where bridges and overpasses have been built  we have to keep in mind that weve got real human beings working on this right now  thousands of them  whose jobs are at risk  mr  richard said the high speed rail project was a signature issue of former gov  jerry brown  last week  a day after his successor  mr  newsom  announced that he planned to scale back the project  the president posted on twitter that california owed the federal government  3 5 billion  adding  we want that money back now mr  newsom replied that the president was wrong that the project had been canceled  fake news  mr  newsom tweeted  were building high speed rail  connecting the central valley and beyond  this is cas money  allocated by congress for this project  were not giving it back the high speed rail plan has faced stiff opposition from republicans for years  and it has never been clear how  exactly  the project would be financed  last year  state officials said the cost of the project was likely to balloon to  100 billion  and the rail authority had so far come up with about a third of that  but mr  brown championed the initiative  which was the most expansive public transit project currently under construction in the country  mr  newsom never appeared to share that enthusiasm lets level about high speed rail  mr  newsom said last week in the state of the state speech in sacramento  adding  right now  there simply isnt a path to get from sacramento to san diego  let alone from san francisco to l a aides to mr  newsom later appeared to walk back his comments  saying he was not shelving the project and simply wanted to focus on the central valley first representative kevin mccarthy of california  the republican leader  said in a statement on tuesday that it was time to move on from the broken high speed rail project and redirect our efforts to infrastructure projects that work for californians the  929 million in funds that the trump administration says it plans to take back have not yet been transferred to california  that money has been allocated  but not disbursed  meaning that the money is still in the hands of the federal government  to obtain those funds  california was obligated to match a previous grant of  2 6 billion in stimulus money  as of tuesday  the state had matched 38 percent of that .
washington  president trump stormed out of a white house meeting with congressional leaders on wednesday after speaker nancy pelosi said she would not fund a border wall even if he agreed to reopen the government  escalating a confrontation that has shuttered large portions of the government for 19 days and counting stunned democrats emerged from the meeting in the white house situation room declaring that the president had thrown a temper tantrum and slammed his hands on the table before leaving with an abrupt bye bye  republicans disputed the hand slam and blamed democratic intransigence for prolonging the standoff when the meeting was over  talks to reopen the government appeared to be in disarray  the contentious  brief and futile session underscored an impasse that is looking each day like an insurmountable gulf between the two sides  mr  trump will visit the border on thursday in mcallen  tex   leaving little hope of a resolution for a shutdown that will tie the longest in the nations history on friday it wasnt even a high stakes negotiation  it was a petulant president of the united states  ms  pelosi said as she returned to the capitol  a person who would say  ill keep government shut down for weeks  months or years unless i get my way mr  trump called the exercise a total waste of time  view our story on the longest government shutdowns ever  i asked what is going to happen in 30 days if i quickly open things up  are you going to approve border security which includes a wall or steel barrier  nancy said  no  i said bye bye  he posted on twitter day 19 had begun with what looked like signs of splintering support within the presidents own party  senator lisa murkowski  republican of alaska  pledged to confront mr  trump in a closed door lunch at the capitol  while more mainline conservatives like senator pat roberts  republican of kansas  expressed misgivings about the presidents strategy though senate republicans had not yet reached a breaking point  mr  roberts said  were getting pretty close but those differences largely had been papered over by days end  the house voted 240 to 188 to fund the treasury department  the internal revenue service  the securities and exchange commission and other agencies  including white house operations  the eight republican defections exceeded last weeks vote to fund the government by only a single vote mr  trump  for his part  held out the possibility that he might declare a national emergency to build his promised border wall and circumvent congress altogether  a deeply divisive option even within his own party that could allow him to use money allocated for the military and one that would almost certainly be challenged in court there was no discussion about anything other than solidarity  mr  trump said after his lunch with senate republicans and before the white house negotiating session as the sides feuded  800 000 federal workers were going without pay  and government agencies continued to reduce services  part of the cascading effect of a partial shutdown now possibly headed for a fourth week so frayed were feelings after a frantic 24 hour period of accusations and recriminations  including dueling nationally televised addresses  that republicans and democrats emerged from the white house meeting unable to agree on what had happened in the room on this they did  mr  trump insisted again on  5 7 billion in border wall funding  and asked democrats  who he pointed out have supported money for physical barriers in the past  if they would capitulate if he agreed to reopen the government  democrats told him again that they support increased funding for border security  but refused to commit additional money for a physical barrier that they believe is a waste of money  they laid out what they said was unnecessary damage being done to federal workers you are using people as leverage  why wont you open the government and stop hurting people  senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  asked mr  trump at one point during the meeting  according to democratic congressional officials and a white house official familiar with the exchange then you wont give me what i want  mr  trump replied  the congressional officials said  the white house official said that mr  trump added  i am trying to do the right thing for the country  this isnt about politics but there are signs of strain  after his lunch with senate republicans  mr  trump declared that the party was totally unified  even if he faced some questions about strategy leading up to it  though  the number of republicans uneasy about the presidents tactics appeared to be growing  senator shelley moore capito  republican of west virginia and the chairwoman of the appropriations subcommittee on homeland security  had warned on tuesday that she could potentially support reopening the government as talks continued on border security  the democratic position i mean  i think i could live with that  ms  capito said  she said she expected pressure from federal employees and voters in her state would only mount the longer the impasse drags on  ive expressed more than a few times the frustrations with a government shutdown and how useless it is  so that pressures going to build  she said ms  murkowski had vowed to confront the president on the shutdowns effect on her state  she and other moderate republicans entered the lunch confident that senators were coalescing around the idea that the government should be reopened  but they left disappointed  convinced that for now  the party would follow mr  trump perilously further into a shutdown with an uncertain end a handful of them  including ms  murkowski and senators cory gardner of colorado  susan collins of maine and james lankford of oklahoma  pressed mr  trump on the mounting burden on federal workers and related industries in their states  his response was consistent i was able to raise the issues that i have with using a shutdown  ms  murkowski said  he listened and urged that we all stick together several senators  including ms  collins  sought to find a way out of the impasse through a broader deal  in the meeting  she urged the president to reconsider an earlier deal that would have given him  25 billion for a wall in exchange for permanent protections for young undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children  according to republicans familiar with the exchange the president dismissed the idea  a handful of senators huddled wednesday evening with the presidents son in law and senior adviser  jared kushner  to hash over possible ways out of the impasse  but no apparent progress was made for now  at least  the president seems to have maintained support for his uncompromising position hes like the missouri mule who sits down in the mud and says  im not moving  said senator john kennedy  republican of louisiana senator john cornyn  republican of texas  said mr  trump had made the case that republicans had a much better chance of prevailing if they remained united in opposition to spending bills to get the government funded again what did benjamin franklin say at the constitutional convention  mr  cornyn told reporters  we need to hang together or well hang separately  thats what it reminded me of democrats  who are confident mr  trump is taking the brunt of the blame for the impasse  showed little sign of capitulation  the house vote to fund financial agencies and the white house was the first of several this week on individual spending bills that are intended to pick off uneasy republicans  but in the end  it drew only one more republican than a vote last week to reopen the government  a white house official said wednesday that mr  trump would veto any such bill in the senate  democrats had managed to grind to a stop unrelated foreign policy legislation to increase pressure on senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  to relent on his insistence that he will not put any bill to reopen the government up for a vote there without mr  trumps support democrats offered other warnings to the white house  senator richard j  durbin of illinois  the no  2 senate democrat  said he had warned patrick shanahan  the acting defense secretary  in a private meeting that a national emergency declaration by mr  trump would constitute a major breach of relations between the pentagon and congress mr  mcconnell continued publicly to insist that the dispute was for democrats and the president to solve  he has largely absented himself from negotiations  and did not speak during wednesdays white house session  a position that appeared to be validated on tuesday by a politico and morning consult poll that found only 5 percent of respondents blamed congressional republicans for the impasse  compared with 47 percent who blamed mr  trump and 33 percent who blamed congressional democrats i cannot urge my democratic colleagues more strongly to get past this purely partisan spite  rediscover their own past positions on border security and negotiate a fair solution with our president to secure our nation and reopen all of the federal government  mr  mcconnell said in remarks on the senate floor .
mcallen  tex   when a president comes to town there are two realities  the one the white house hopes to create and the one that actually exists president trump arrived in this city on the mexican border on thursday to dramatize his desire for a border wall  a hardened position that has caused the partial shutdown of the federal government he surrounded himself with border agents  victims of horrible crimes  a display of methamphetamine and heroin  an ak 47 and an ar 15 rifle  and a trash bag stuffed with  362 062 in cash that had been confiscated by law enforcement officials in his view  it all added up to a single word  crisis  with a lone solution  building a wall  a point he emphasized in a discussion with the crime victims  law enforcement officers and mcallen residents that says it all  mr  trump said of the contraband  they didnt have to go very far  this is all very recent but there was another reality  the display of drugs  weapons and cash was mainly the product of law enforcement actions stopping criminals at international bridges  where most drugs are smuggled  and conventional ports of entry in a place where a wall is already in place  law enforcement officials boasted of apprehending criminals who had built a tunnel  the money was taken from a suspect who had overstayed a visa in a meeting on tuesday with network anchors before his prime time address to the nation  mr  trump had dismissed the trip to mcallen as a waste of time  a mere photo op  but he gamely went forward after arriving here early thursday afternoon a few miles south of mcallen  he stood near a bluff above the rio grande  with mexico in the near distance  there were more border agents  an array of military vehicles and a helicopter flyover for effect with agents saluting the commander in chief  the fox host sean hannity stood nearby  waiting for an exclusive interview hundreds of people lined a nearby highway  many waving signs backing mr  trump  the border agents who assembled for the meeting also gave him hearty cheers  one supporter was joe cantu  a former police chief from a nearby town wearing a make america great again baseball cap and t shirt theyre coming over in banzai waves  mr  cantu said of immigrants crossing into texas other signs told a different story  they said no wall  no hate  we are all immigrants and our only crisis is trumps failing presidency on the route from the meeting to the photo op along the rio grande  the presidents motorcade also passed numerous product distribution centers  large  low slung buildings that employ hundreds of people  those businesses are a product of nafta  the commercial agreement with mexico and canada that mr  trump has labeled the worst of all time  but that has transformed south texas over the last two decades the mcallen area is heavily democratic and the local congressman opposes the wall  as do many local officials  still  the scene was a draw i just wanted to get a picture  said veronica whitacre  a local city commissioner and mcallen native  its sad for south texas that people believe we live in a dangerous place  when i go places  people ask where i am from and i say mcallen  and people say  are you o k  the city is certainly o k  when it comes to crime  which is near a 30 year low  the president did not talk about that  youll have crime in iowa  youll have crime in new hampshire  youll have crime in new york without a wall  mr  trump said mr  trump did not discuss the significant increase in cases of children being separated from their families as a result of his hard line immigration policies  he spoke only a few blocks from a detention center  but did not go in  when asked by a reporter if he would visit it  the president said that he would like to  but that it would be up to the secret service  he did not go he also criticized democrats who have accused him of trying to manufacture a crisis to justify his  5 7 billion border barrier demand  whats manufactured is the word manufactured  the president said kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary who accompanied mr  trump to texas  reiterated the administrations position that what is happening along the border is a crisis those who claim it was manufactured  she said  insulted americans  to that  senator ted cruz  republican of texas  who joined the president and his entourage  added  when we see politicians go on tv and say the borders secure and there is no crisis  they are ignoring reality not to be outdone  dan patrick  the texas lieutenant governor  added  to those who say this is a manufactured crisis  its a manufactured cover up by your opposition democrats have insisted that the administration faces a large scale humanitarian problem that is a direct result of mr  trumps policy  but argue that a border wall is not the right solution and that mr  trump has failed to make the case that there is a true security crisis a local pastor sympathetic to the president emphasized during a round table discussion that the crisis was humanitarian in nature still  mr  trump said that he had a feel about things and could sense democrats moving toward his position i know you dont see it yet  but i have a feel about things  and i really believe the other side is starting to get it representative vicente gonzalez  a democrat whose district includes mcallen  was in washington while the president visited his hometown  but he closely monitored mr  trumps trip its all theatrics  mr  gonzalez said in an interview  before insisting that mr  trump was somehow trying to escape the government shutdown with a victory mr  gonzalez added  hes trying to land the plane  and i think he knows time is not on his side  so he came down to the border to try to make a final case .
washington  president trump on friday pointed to nearly five dozen previous instances in which presidents of both parties have declared emergencies as justification for his invocation of extraordinary powers to build his border wall  but there is no precedent for what he has just done none of the times emergency powers have been invoked since 1976  the year congress enacted the national emergencies act  involved a president making an end run around lawmakers to spend money on a project they had decided against funding  mr  trump  by contrast  is challenging the bedrock principle that the legislative branch controls the governments purse on the surface  this oh  other presidents do this  too line seems logical  said chris edelson  an american university government professor and author of a 2013 book  emergency presidential power  from the drafting of the constitution to the war on terror  but there is no example where a president asked for funding for something from congress  congress said  no  and the president said  ill use emergency powers to do it anyway mr  trump sought to evade that distinction on friday when he announced his border wall decision at a news conference in the white house rose garden  he portrayed his invocation of emergency powers as a routine use of executive authority that was never controversial when his predecessors did it im going to be signing a national emergency and its been signed many times before  he said  its been signed by other presidents  from 1977 or so  it gave the presidents the power  theres rarely been a problem  they sign it  nobody cares but a list of about 59 previous times when presidents since the carter administration have invoked emergency powers  compiled for a recent study of presidential emergency powers for the brennan center for justice at new york university school of law  shows none that look like mr  trumps declaration in crucial respects the overwhelming majority of those instances were moves by presidents to impose sanctions on various foreign officials and groups  freezing their assets and making it illegal for americans to do business with them  for wrongdoing like human rights violations  terrorism or transnational narcotics trafficking  they attracted no controversy because congress has wanted the executive branch to operate that way congress has also enacted a statute that gave presidents  in a declared emergency that requires use of the armed forces  the power to redirect military construction funds to build projects related to that use  it is that statute that mr  trump is relying upon  and his administration argues that this means he is exercising authority that lawmakers wanted the presidency to be able to wield but elizabeth goitein  who oversaw the brennan center study  pointed to the widespread dispute over whether  as a matter of empirical reality  there exists a true emergency on the border that would be resolved by a wall  as well as to the fact that congress already made clear it did not intend to spend extra billions of dollars on mr  trumps wall there is nothing approaching an emergency in this situation  no matter how loose a definition you use  she said  and congress has made it as clear as it can that it does not want the president to use funds for this purpose  so this is the president using emergency powers to thwart the will of congress  that is very different from how emergency powers have been used in the past in a briefing with reporters on friday  the white house identified only two previous instances in which presidents relied on emergency powers to spend funds on something different than what congress had appropriated them for  both involved military construction associated with wars  one under president george bushs persian gulf war emergency declaration  the other under president george w  bushs emergency declaration after the sept  11 attacks  neither funded projects that congress had previously weighed and rejected the idea behind emergency powers laws is that congress wanted the president to have standby authorities to activate in a crisis  when the government must respond quickly  the brennan center study identified 123 such statutes in the 1976 act  congress turned off numerous old emergencies that had been lingering for many years and created a process presidents must follow when invoking such statutes  but the overhaul did not include defining limits on when a president could decide that a qualifying emergency existed  preserving white house flexibility one check against abuse of that power eroded quickly  congress had intended for lawmakers to have the power to overrule a presidents declaration by passing a resolution with a simple majority vote  after a 1983 supreme court ruling  however  presidents gained the power to veto such resolutions  that weakened congresss hand because it takes two thirds of both chambers to override a veto the other check against abuse has been self restraint  presidents have self regulated and not invoked emergency powers to achieve policy goals congress had rejected  or claimed that a qualifying crisis existed in disputed circumstances much of the criticism of mr  trumps move has centered on fears that he was expanding executive power by establishing a precedent that future presidents  including democrats seeking liberal ends  may someday use to circumvent congress  too  on friday  mr  trump dismissed a question from a reporter about that worry the people that say we create precedent  well  what do you have  56  or a lot of times  well  thats creating precedent  and many of those are far less important than having a border  he said but several legal experts said there was another possible long term consequence that had received less discussion  by violating that norm of self restraint  mr  trump may prompt congress to eventually take back some of that power from the presidency  at least in a post trump era  when a succeeding president might be willing  or believe that it is politically necessary  to sign such a bill notably  representative jerrold nadler  democrat of new york and the chairman of the house judiciary committee  on friday accused mr  trump of a gross abuse of power that subverts the key principles laid out in the constitution over which branch controls the appropriation of funds  and announced an investigation  in 1976  it was the house judiciary committee that drafted the national emergencies act stephen i  vladeck  a law professor at the university of texas  austin  said that legislators may react to mr  trumps move by enacting a new overhaul of those laws that tightened restrictions on when a president could use them lawmakers could  for example  impose a strict definition of what qualifies as an emergency  taking away presidential flexibility to deal with unforeseen circumstances  congress could also attach sunset clauses to emergency statutes  so that the president s special powers would automatically deactivate after a month or two without new action by lawmakers to extend them the risk the president runs is that congress will take away much  if not most  of the discretion its given to the president  mr  vladeck said  and then the concern is that congress could hamstring a future president from having all the tools he or she might need to react to a future emergency  so a short term win for the president could become a long term loss for the presidency .
good friday morning  here are some of the stories making news in washington and politics today                       in a lengthy oval office interview  president trump told the new york times that negotiating with congress over his long sought border wall was a waste of time and that he would probably take action on it himself  he also spoke about the russia investigation and the 2020 election  here are five takeaways from the interview  the senate  in a stinging bipartisan rebuke to mr  trumps foreign policy  advanced legislation to express strong opposition to his decision to pull troops from syria and afghanistan  after two months of being cooped up in the white house  mr  trump will spend the weekend at his oasis  the place where he is most comfortable  mar a lago  mr  trump said trade negotiations with china were going well but that no final agreement would be reached until he met with president xi jinping  he also warned that he was prepared to move ahead with higher tariffs on chinese goods if beijing did not accede to americas demands  mr  trumps re election campaign reported raising  21 million in the final three months of 2018  three out of every four dollars came from small donors  a contrast to many republican midterm congressional campaigns  which relied more on wealthy contributors  the top american diplomat on north korea  stephen biegun  signaled that the united states might soften its demand that north korea list all its nuclear assets as a first step toward denuclearization  mr  trump signed an executive order that will push for federal dollars spent on infrastructure projects to go to american companies  the measure is meant to bolster blue collar trump supporters whose economic prospects have been shaken by the presidents trade policies  senator bernie sanders introduced a plan that would subject more wealthy americans to the estate tax  joining a wave of left wing politicians calling for new ways to tax the rich  the trump administration told congress that it intends to make it much easier for gun manufacturers to sell firearms abroad  the administration also proposed to lower prescription drug costs by requiring insurers and middlemen to share the discounts they get with consumers  sexual assaults rose sharply at three american military academies over the last two years  despite the pentagons efforts to encourage students to report assaults  unreported cases surged by almost 50 percent during the 2017 18 academic year  a defense department study found                      todays on politics briefing was compiled by isabella grulln paz in new york were you forwarded this newsletter  subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox is there anything you think were missing  anything you want to see more of  wed love to hear from you  email us at onpolitics nytimes com .
with president trumps border wall tied up by his fight with congressional democrats  and public opinion about the wall mixed  kris kobach wants to take matters into his own hands fresh from his defeat in the race for kansas governor  mr  kobach  the former kansas secretary of state  is involved in an audacious new project  a privately funded wall along the mexican border mr  kobach  a hard line ally of president trump known for his strident stand on immigration  has long advocated a tough border policy he is currently an advisory board member of we build the wall inc  a nonprofit group that has collected more than  12 million toward the effort  mr  kobach says the group has obtained the presidential seal of approval for the private initiative president trump gave the undertaking his blessing in a telephone conversation wednesday night  according to mr  kobach  the white house press office did not respond to requests for comment  mr  kobach  52  says the group will begin construction soon on its first section of the wall on donated property  likely in texas  and that the work can be completed cheaply and efficiently by the private sector the private wall idea is an outgrowth of a plan started in december as a gofundme campaign by brian kolfage  a disabled air force veteran living in florida who says the impetus for his project was mounting public frustration over the governments failure to reach an agreement on border protection after raising nearly  20 million  the organization was forced to contact donors because it hadnt reached its initial goal of  1 billion  at that point  contributions would be automatically returned to donors unless they opted back in  mr  kobach said that efforts to retain contributors had been very successful  with 94 percent of those contacted transferring the money into the new effort mr  kobach  who is considering a 2020 run for the united states senate seat being vacated by pat roberts  said he is currently an unpaid adviser to the organization but added that he might take a major administrative role as the project grows  asked whether he would be compensated at that point  mr  kobach said he was not sure we caught up with mr  kobach this week by telephone  his remarks were condensed and edited for clarity  q  i understand that youre on the board of an organization thats promoting a private wall  can you tell me what the goal is  a  the goal is to facilitate construction of a border wall on private land with private funds along the southern border in conjunction with federal government efforts to construct the wall  have you done any work to see how much thats going to cost  we believe we can build the wall  or build sections of the wall  for well under half the price that the federal government is projecting and perhaps as low as a quarter of the price  quite often the federal government purchases things at prices higher than individuals in the private marketplace  do you have a location in mind right now  do you have landowners who will donate land for this  we have landowners who are inviting us already  well be hopefully breaking ground within weeks  but i dont want to give the names yet  we havent selected where were going to start  it doesnt require the donation of a large amount of land  the landowner retains the land  its not like we build the wall and take possession of the land do you think theres a groundswell of support for this i do think theres a groundswell of support  its an objective that people conceive of very easily  its not rocket science  its not super high technology to construct border barriers democrats have proposed other kinds of mechanisms for securing the border  technology  drones  radar we already have drones and sensors on the border and they seem to think that having more is adequate  drones dont stop people from coming across the border  they merely tell you that someone is coming across the border  i dont think the people who are proposing the drones only are serious about stopping the flow of illegal immigration what are people in kansas telling you in kansas  support for the wall is very strong  we havent done any polling or outreach on the specific question of we build the wall organization  but certainly support for building a wall or a series of barriers on the border is very high have you reached out to people at homeland security  are they on board with this idea i have not personally but i believe others in our organization have  we intend to cooperate and to the extent possible collaborate with the department of homeland security  the objective is to assist and to create a system of sections that ultimately connect and serve one another i talked with the president  and the we build the wall effort came up  the president said the project has my blessing  and you can tell the media that do you see this as an alternative to a federal project i see it as a supplement to a federal project  the  5 7 billion would not secure the entire border  even if democrats gave the president everything hes asking for in the current discussion  there will be hundreds of miles of gaps collectively that still wouldnt be secured  so these private efforts will help supplement and fill in the gaps that still exist after  if and when the president is able to complete the sections of wall that hes proposing  some people might say securing the border is a government function just like air traffic control it is correct that securing the border is a government function  but when the government fails  it has a specific and significant impact on individual landowners  so the failure to secure the border affects me in kansas indirectly and it affects you in new york indirectly  but the landowner who has the ranch right on the border is affected in a way that is 1 000 percent greater than what you and i would experience  the biggest effects are litter and security  the traffickers  as theyre bringing their migrants through  theyre constantly dumping clothing  food containers and trash on the ranchers land  and then theres an environmental impact  but the biggest impact for individual landowners is security sounds like youre looking at this from the standpoint of private property rights and the rights of private landowners exactly  in this project the rights of private landowners intersect perfectly with the objectives of the u s  government  ostensibly  members of both parties say they want to secure the border  the landowner needs to secure the border because of the damage being done in terms of litter and in terms of public safety and in terms of trespassing i have heard stories of landowners who like the open border because theyve made friends with people who live on the mexican side and theyre neighbors in that case if a landowner doesnt want to have any fencing or barriers on his project  he wouldnt be someone we would be working with .
washington  in the two months since he stepped into jim mattiss size 9 shoes  the acting defense secretary  patrick m  shanahan  has sought to do what his predecessor did not  namely  stay in line with president trump mr  shanahan has repeated white house talking points at the pentagon even during private meetings with allies and congressional members  he has done little to ameliorate the withdrawal of american forces from syria  which prompted mr  mattiss resignation in december  and refused to criticize the presidents decision to do so and mr  shanahan has embraced mr  trumps vision of bolstering the southwestern border against what he described as a threat by central american refugees fleeing drug violence and heading to the united states the threat is real  mr  shanahan said last month at a cabinet meeting  the risks are real  we need to control our borders  sign up for the weekly at war newsletter to receive stories about duty  conflict and consequence  it is a view that few officials at the pentagon share  and it is testing mr  shanahans ability to remain in lock step with his commander in chief while still placating lawmakers who will ultimately decide whether he will be confirmed as the defense secretary  should the president nominate him on tuesday  the house rejected mr  trumps declaration of a national emergency along the southwestern border in a first step toward blocking his attempt to build a border wall with  3 6 billion in military construction funding  much of that money could be pulled from projects  like schools or dining halls  that congress generally protects for constituents earlier  senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina  angrily declared himself now your adversary  not your friend to mr  shanahan after what witnesses described as his repetition of mr  trumps talking points on the syria withdrawal to lawmakers at a security conference this month in munich the exchange came just days after senator jim inhofe  republican of oklahoma and chairman of the armed services committee  praised mr  mattiss humility and said mr  shanahan did not share that trait   mr  inhofe later told reporters he was kidding  interviews with more than a dozen congressional officials as well as current and former defense department officials provided insights on an acting defense secretary who is steeped in the details of procurement and expensive defense systems but shows little affinity for military strategy in combat zones  nearly all the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity  including some for fear of losing their jobs  to discuss the internal tensions lt  col  joe buccino  a spokesman for mr  shanahan  said he was deeply engaged in the full spectrum of policy and operational issues and received more than 1 000 intelligence and military briefings while serving as mr  mattiss deputy secretary mattis maintained an aggressive travel schedule and in his absence  deputy secretary shanahan frequently chaired and hosted operational updates and strategy reviews and briefings  colonel buccino said in a statement on tuesday mr  shanahan is also balancing his scrupulous approbation of the president with trying to assure the 1 2 million active duty service members that he is willing to defend their interests in military policies at home and around the world  like terrorism and border security one defense department official said the situation had placed mr  shanahan squarely between the dog and the fence post on tuesday  gen  terrence j  oshaughnessy of the air force  the head of the militarys northern command who oversees homeland defense  told the armed services committee that he saw no military threat from the border but on saturday  mr  shanahan toured the border at el paso  where he fired a paintball gun that had been converted to shoot crowd control pellets any place where someone can cross the border and disappear within seconds or minutes  thats where you need barriers  mr  shanahan said  this month  mr  shanahan told reporters that he had not yet determined whether the border wall was a military necessity  an off message aside that defense department officials quickly walked back as unintentional mr  mattis had only grudgingly acquiesced to orders to put forces along the southwestern border  according to two people familiar with his thinking  but mr  mattis slow walked the mission  keeping troops as far away from caravans of refugees as possible and ensuring that most forces were unarmed officials said mr  shanahan has tried to weather his first months at the pentagons helm by sticking to mr  trumps script  no matter what  that is not necessarily a bad thing  said derek chollet  a senior pentagon official under president barack obama he seems like the best we can expect of the administration right now  he stays inside the box  mr  chollet said  the last thing we need is more turbulence and uncertainty mr  shanahan holds a masters degree from m i t  and turned around boeings troubled development of the 787 dreamliner passenger plane  the vast majority of previous defense secretaries also came to the job from civilian positions  mr  mattis  a retired marine general  was a rare exception but mr  shanahan was largely shielded from many american foreign policy decisions  and has had to apply his more technical background to a steep learning curve of a plethora of political and security issues at the pentagon it has been an awkward transition he has laughed obligingly at mr  trumps corniest jokes  including one about how the defense department is really about offense  two weeks ago  during his first trip overseas as the pentagon chief  which was also his first trip to afghanistan  mr  shanahan arrived in kabul  the capital  dressed all in black  looking like a cross between johnny cash and dr  no  it was an all out fashion assault on taliban peace process  snarked task and purpose  the website that covers the military  mr  shanahan shrugged it off as funny senior staff members at the pentagon noted mr  shanahans frequent mentions of breakfast meetings with john r  bolton  the national security adviser  and secretary of state mike pompeo  the officials described mr  shanahan as far more pliable with mr  bolton than mr  mattis  who voiced unhappiness with the national security councils reluctance to hold meetings of top members of the administrations security agencies with the withdrawal of american troops from syria  a presidential directive loathed by the pentagons leaders and mr  mattis  several current and former officials said mr  shanahan may be sacrificing the defense department in hewing so closely to mr  trump they credited a host of high ranking  influential officials  gen  joseph f  dunford jr   the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff  gen  joseph votel  the head of united states central command  a choir of republican senators  and mr  bolton  who persuaded mr  trump to modify the drawdown  initially by leaving a small residual force of 200 american troops in syria mr  shanahan  the officials said  was not among the top authorities who held sway  and mr  trumps latest syria policy decision  for 400 american troops to remain and continue counterterrorism missions  caught leading pentagon officials off guard particularly in matters of the wars overseas  defense department officials said  mr  shanahan has a way to go in afghanistan  his understanding of the conflict stirred chatter among military officials who said that he had been coached by gen  scott miller  the commander of the american led war effort there after leaving the country  mr  shanahan was asked about the changing strategy on the ground  he spoke broadly about afghan commandos  one of the only groups he had briefly met with  as evidence of progress .
president trumps defeat in his border wall standoff with congress has clouded his already perilous path to a second term in 2020  undercutting mr  trumps cherished image as a forceful leader and deft negotiator  and emboldening alike his democratic challengers and republican dissenters who hope to block his re election the longest government shutdown in history inflicted severe political damage on the president  dragging down his poll numbers even among republicans and stirring concern among party leaders about his ability to navigate the next two years of divided government  mr  trump  close associates acknowledge  appears without a plan for mounting a strong campaign in 2020  or for persuading the majority of americans who view him negatively to give him another chance compounding the harm to mr  trump on friday was the indictment of roger stone  his political adviser for several decades  on charges of lying to investigators and obstructing the inquiry by the special counsel  robert s  mueller iii  into russian interference in the 2016 election  the indictment was taken by some republicans as the surest sign yet that mr  muellers investigation is likely to grow more painful to mr  trump and his associates before it wraps up mr  trump still commands the loyalty of a passionate electoral base that has rallied to him in trying moments  and advisers believe he will have room to right himself while democratic presidential candidates are mired in a long nomination fight  yet they are also growing anxious that he could face a draining primary of his own next year several prominent trump antagonists are actively urging other republicans to take on the president  and a popular governor  larry hogan of maryland  has indicated he is newly open to their entreaties in a sign of the white houses determination to project party unity  a top trump campaign official  bill stepien  traveled to the republican national committee meeting in new mexico this week to orchestrate an ornamental resolution of support for the president  it passed unanimously on friday afternoon  hailing mr  trump for his effective presidency even as his shutdown strategy collapsed david winston  a republican pollster  said the burden was now on mr  trump to restore his stature as a leader by forging some kind of border security deal with democrats  and to deliver a stronger message on the economy leadership means results  mr  winston said  when you have a shutdown  people look at it  basically  as  the political system has failed mr  winston said polling data suggested the border wall had been a problematic fight to pick  immigration is an important issue  he said  but people are waking up every day trying to figure out how theyre going to pay a set of bills in front of them for now  mr  trump remains wholly focused on appeasing his conservative base  comprising perhaps a third of the electorate  despite private g o p  polling suggesting that his agenda on immigration has failed to move the country in his favor  republicans who work closely with the president said but mr  trump emerged from the shutdown with nothing to show for it  having angered swing voters with his intransigence  while disappointing hard line supporters by failing to secure any funding for a border wall  read about president trumps retreat on the shutdown  conservatives still believe that mr  trump cannot afford to abandon his crusade for a barrier  not long before mr  trump agreed to reopen the government  representative mark meadows of north carolina  a white house ally who leads the hard line freedom caucus  argued that the wall fight was vital to the presidents re election hopes its not lost on any of us that a central component of what he said when he ran in 2016 has to be addressed in a meaningful way  he said in a recent interview privately  some of mr  trumps 2016 aides have said they are pessimistic about his path to 270 electoral votes after his partys midterm defeats in states like michigan  pennsylvania and wisconsin  an associated press poll on wednesday showed that mr  trumps overall approval rating had fallen to 34 percent  with his support among republicans dipping below 80 percent  a startling turn for a president who strives for total control of the g o p   and has usually achieved it the mueller investigation looms as another destabilizing force for the president  david kochel  a republican strategist based in iowa who is opposed to mr  trump  said the special counsels eventual report could determine whether mr  trump is vulnerable in a primary that will be a focusing mechanism for the party  mr  kochel said while core republican voters remain loyal to him and he is not currently facing a contest for the nomination  mr  trumps low standing with political moderates and especially women is leading some g o p  officeholders to voice unease about having him at the top of the ticket next year i think its healthy and appropriate for the party to consider in 2020 whether this is really the path it wants to continue taking  said david f  holt  the republican mayor of oklahoma city  where a democrat won a stunning house upset last year thanks in part to the suburban antipathy toward mr  trump the 2020 election is nearly two years away and mr  trump has ample time to build a political operation  marshal support from financial backers and make his case to the american people  mr  trump captured the presidency with a largely improvisational candidacy  guided by his own instincts for personal combat and cultural division  and lacking the strategic discipline of most presidential campaigns but even among his own political lieutenants  there is a general recognition that mr  trump currently lacks anything resembling a positive message mr  trump is especially fixated on two well known democrats  speaking frequently about joseph r  biden jr   the former vice president whom mr  trump regards as his most dangerous potential opponent  and senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts  some of his advisers are more preoccupied with two other would be challengers  who would offer a starker generational contrast with the 72 year old president  senator kamala harris of california and beto orourke  the former texas senate candidate in this volatile moment  however  mr  trump and his aides have been just as focused on heading off competition from fellow republicans  in addition to helping direct a resolution of support from the r n c   mr  trump tweeted approvingly saturday morning  suggesting re election should be easy  mr  stepien  the former white house political director  has been leading an effort to ensure there is no insurrection at next years convention in charlotte  n c now a top aide on mr  trumps campaign  mr  stepien and his deputies have been consulting party leaders about shutting off avenues to a challenge and ensuring that states cannot put forward favorite son candidates to contest the presidents renomination mr  trump has also dedicated a team of aides to guaranteeing that only political loyalists are elected to serve as delegates to the convention  to that end  mr  stepien dispatched some of his staff members this month to see that their preferred candidate remained in charge of the maine republican party the fruits of some of those efforts were on display at the r n c  meeting outside albuquerque  where enthusiasm for mr  trump was undimmed  at least publicly  the party leaders ignored mr  stones arrest  which took place just hours before they gathered  and ronna mcdaniel  the party chair  did not deviate from her prepared remarks  lashing the media for promoting manufactured scandals jeff kent  the party committeeman from washington state  offered perhaps the most ferocious tribute to the president  brandishing his red make america great again hat as he addressed officials to the press in the back of the room  said mr  kent  his voice rising  please go tell the world we will always proudly wear this hat and we will always proudly support our great president  donald a  trump   the presidents middle initial is j  other republicans view mr  trumps political stumbles as an opportunity to lure a challenger into the race  with mr  hogan emerging as a new subject of their efforts  at a december conference hosted by the niskanen center  a right of center think tank  mr  hogan spoke briefly with william kristol  an implacable trump critic in the conservative press  who argued that the president is weaker than widely understood  people briefed on the conversation said mr  hogan  62  is set to meet more formally in the coming weeks with mr  kristol and sarah longwell  a republican strategist helping marshal opposition to mr  trump  mr  kristol and ms  longwell have been meeting with republican donors and potential challengers  sharing focus group and polling data about the presidents vulnerability with what they call reluctant trump voters  according to a copy of their presentation reviewed by the new york times mr  hogan is planning a trip to iowa in his capacity as an officer of the national governors association  but his advisers also recently reached out to mr  kochel  the iowa based strategist  to ask that he put together a dinner with similarly minded republicans while mr  hogan is there  according to an associate of mr  kochel briefed on the exchange jerry taylor  president of the niskanen center  said mr  hogan had made it clear that the door is open to a potential candidacy  but no decision has been made in addition to mr  hogan  william f  weld  the former republican governor of massachusetts  is weighing a challenge to mr  trump as a small government moderate  people who have spoken with him said  mr  weld  73  who was the libertarian partys vice presidential nominee in 2016  has discussed either opposing mr  trump in the republican primaries or seeking the libertarian presidential nomination mr  weld declined to comment on his deliberations  and mr  hogan declined through an aide to be interviewed other republicans known to be entertaining campaigns against mr  trump include john r  kasich  the former governor of ohio  who ran in 2016  senator ben sasse of nebraska  and jeff flake  the former senator from arizona  but mr  sasse is said to have grown uneasy about the idea  and mr  kasich and mr  flake are pursuing opportunities in television bruce berke  a republican strategist in new hampshire aligned with mr  kasich  said he currently saw mr  trump as unassailable in a g o p  primary a primary challenge in 2020  as of today  would be futile for anyone  mr  berke said still  republican donors will want to know just how damaged the president may be by the end of this year before they truly commit to a challenge asked if he would be willing to raise money for a primary opponent to mr  trump  stanley druckenmiller  a new york based investor who has given millions to republican candidates  said  if i thought such a candidate would be a good president and had a realistic chance of securing the nomination  yes  of course .
washington  president trump and democratic congressional leaders dug in wednesday for a lengthy partial shutdown in a newly divided government after a white house meeting  the first in 22 days  could not break an impasse over mr  trumps demands for billions of dollars for a border wall during the contentious meeting in the situation room  mr  trump made his case for a wall on the southwestern border and rejected democrats proposals for reopening the government while the two sides ironed out their differences i would look foolish if i did that  mr  trump responded after senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  posed the question to him directly  according to three officials familiar with the meeting who described it on the condition of anonymity  he said that the wall was why he was elected  one of the officials said democrats were equally adamant  according to another official who was present for the discussion  pressed by vice president mike pence and representative kevin mccarthy of california  the incoming minority leader  they refused to budge from their offer to devote  1 3 billion to border security  the official also insisted on anonymity to describe the private conversation senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  said after the meeting that he had no intention of putting democratic bills to reopen the government to a vote if mr  trump would not sign them were hopeful that  somehow  in the coming days and weeks  well be able to reach an agreement  mr  mcconnell told reporters at the capitol  offering an ominous timeline the events underscored the personal and political crosscurrents standing in the way of any compromise between a president unwilling to lose face with his core supporters on his signature campaign promise and newly empowered democrats  poised to assume control of the house on thursday  who refuse to give ground on an issue that has come to symbolize mr  trumps immigration policies with the partial government funding lapse dragging into its 12th day and affecting 800 000 federal employees  the confrontation in the situation room only served to highlight the depth of the divide could be a long time  or it could be quickly  mr  trump said of resolving the shutdown  its too important a subject to walk away from representative nancy pelosi of california  who is in line to be elected speaker on thursday  said  we are asking the president to open up government  why would he not do it he could not give a good answer  mr  schumer said mr  trump tried creative ways to persuade the democrats that they should support his wall  at one point  he said ms  pelosi should back it because she was a good catholic and vatican city is surrounded by a wall  according to one of the officials familiar with the discussion  vatican city has walls  but they do not enclose the entire territory and visitors can easily enter some parts  read more fact checks from the president s cabinet meeting on wednesday  in her first legislative act as speaker  ms  pelosi plans on thursday to bring up two bills to reopen the government  one would fund the department of homeland security through feb  8  providing a month to break the impasse over border security funding  and a second would provide money for the remaining shuttered agencies and departments through september  the homeland security measure would devote  1 3 billion to border security measures  such as enhanced surveillance and fortified fencing  but not the wall mr  trumps rejection of those measures left the prospects of a resolution at their dimmest since the shutdown began on dec  22  it also highlighted the difficulty of the current situation  in which democrats  republicans and even some white house staff members have found themselves trying to anticipate what mr  trump will accept the president asked the congressional leaders to return to the white house on friday to continue the talks  after democrats had completed their leadership elections  according to an official who attended the meeting  a second official who attended said mr  trumps team believed it would be easier for ms  pelosi to negotiate once she was officially installed as speaker  both insisted on anonymity to describe the private gathering in a pair of evening tweets  mr  trump seemed to hold out hope of an agreement  writing  i remain ready and willing to work with democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders  supports the agents and officers on the ground  and keeps america safe  lets get it done but the path to such a deal is murky at best before he met congressional leaders on wednesday  mr  trump publicly rejected a compromise that mr  pence floated privately with democrats last month to stave off the government funding lapse  saying  2 5 billion in border security spending was insufficient  in the hours before a midnight deadline to avert a shutdown before christmas  the vice president had broached that number  which his team has quietly continued to push in the days after parts of the government ran out of money no  not  2 5 billion  no  were asking for  5 6 billion  mr  trump said during a cabinet meeting  hours before the situation room briefing his rejection of the figure seemed to confirm the concerns of democratic leaders who had questioned whether they could trust senior white house officials to broker any compromise that could then be rejected by a president who has often shifted his position at the last moment  especially when it comes to immigration the larger figure referred to the amount mr  trump has demanded for the wall  which the house endorsed in a vote last month  but which failed to garner even majority support in the senate  where it would need 60 votes to prevail but inside the situation room later on wednesday  the proposal resurfaced and mr  trump appeared open to it  according to one of the officials present  as mr  pence and mr  mccarthy pressed democrats to meet in the middle  ms  pelosi and mr  schumer said  1 3 billion was their highest bid wednesdays gathering in the situation room  a secure chamber in the basement of the white house where military operations are tracked and other sensitive discussions unfold  was a conscious effort by mr  trump and his aides to infuse a sense of national security crisis into the immigration discussion  it was the presidents first face to face meeting with democratic leaders since a combative session last month when he said he would insist that any government spending bill include money for a border wall  and would proudly own the consequences if that meant a shutdown but it quickly turned tense as mr  trump argued for his wall and called on kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  who appeared via teleconference from the border in san diego to stress the need for it  according to two of the officials who were at the meeting mr  schumer interjected  calling on ms  pelosi  who disputed ms  nielsens statistics  two of the officials said  ms  pelosi then laid out the legislative proposals she planned to bring up on thursday  detailing how the spending measures had all received broad bipartisan support either in committees or on the floor in the republican controlled congress the back and forth drew an angry response from the department of homeland security democrats in the room either dont care that there is a humanitarian crisis on the border or just prefer ignorance  katie waldman  a spokeswoman for the department  said in a statement on wednesday night  it was incredibly disheartening that they dont want to know the facts when making policy yet hours before the meeting began  what was billed as a somber security briefing had already taken on the sharp tone of a political showdown  as mr  trump charged that democrats were sacrificing border security for a partisan advantage in the 2020 elections the united states needs a physical barrier  the president said during the cabinet meeting  comparing the southern border to a sieve that allows criminals and drugs to enter the country and facilitates human trafficking walls work  he added  claiming inaccurately that former president barack obama has one around his compound in washington   parts of mr  obamas home in the northwest section of the city are bordered by a low brick retaining wall  and others have iron or chain link fencing  mr  trump repeated his false claims about the border wall  including that mexico was already paying for it  as he promised during his campaign  and that much of its construction had already been completed outside the white house  the search for a way out is getting more urgent  some lawmakers have grown anxious about the shutdowns impact on their constituents  including federal workers who are not receiving pay while their agencies are denied funding senator lamar alexander  republican of tennessee  wrote an opinion article in the washington post suggesting three ways out  grant the president the  1 6 billion for border security that he requested  without wall funding  plus an additional  1 billion for security at ports of entry  approve a bipartisan bill linking wall funding with protection for young immigrants brought illegally to the country as children  or resurrect the 2013 comprehensive immigration overhaul that included huge increases in border security measures  sweeping changes to immigration law and a pathway to citizenship for the nations 11 million undocumented immigrants incoming lawmakers vented new concerns about the shutdowns effect  this morning i requested that my pay be withheld until the shutdown is over  representative elect mikie sherrill  democrat of new jersey  said wednesday on twitter  where she posted a letter to the chief administrative officer of the house making her request official she noted that thousands of federal workers in her state were not receiving paychecks  i came here to govern  not engage in partisan politics at the expense of hardworking americans  she said .
from the moment president trump began speaking tuesday night  in an oval office address urging the public to support his controversial border wall  democrats who may run for the white house in 2020 were responding in real time with sharp criticisms and common themes  mr  trump is holding federal workers hostage  a popular word in the responses  and causing them economic hardship  a wall would be ineffective and medieval  another popular word  the presidents willingness to shut down the government over his demand for a wall has actually harmed border security by denying pay to customs and border protection officials  mr  trump  not congressional democrats  is responsible for the shutdown  the democrats repeatedly noted that the senate unanimously passed a bill last month that would have kept the government open  there is no immigration crisis at the border  and any crisis that does exist is a humanitarian one caused by the president himself here is a sampling of the responses from the 2020 democratic hopefuls  which came mostly on twitter senator cory booker  new jerseysenator sherrod brown  ohioformer representative john delaney  marylandmayor eric garcetti  los angelessenator kirsten gillibrand  new yorksenator kamala harris  californiasenator amy klobuchar  minnesotasenator bernie sanders  vermontsenator elizabeth warren  massachusettsms  warren  the only top candidate to have officially declared that she plans to run  had not responded to the speech as of 10 15 p m  a few minutes before it began  however  she tweeted that the way to make the country safer was not by building a wall  but by ending this ridiculous  trumpshutdown and making sure vital agencies like the us coast guard  tsa  and federal law enforcement have the funds they need to maintain our national security congressional democrats chimed in  too  from party leaders to new freshmen like alexandria ocasio cortez of new york and colin allred of texas richard j  durbin  senate minority whiphakeem jeffries  house democratic caucus chairman adam schiff  house intelligence committee chairmandianne feinstein  senate judiciary committee ranking memberrepresentative colin allred  texasrepresentative deb haaland  new mexicorepresentative katie hill  californiarepresentative alexandria ocasio cortez  new yorkrepresentative ilhan omar  minnesotarepresentative ayanna pressley  massachusetts.

denver  in georgia  a pecan farmer lost out on his chance to buy his first orchard  the local farm service agency office that would have processed his loan application was shut down in wisconsins dairy country  a 55 year old woman sat inside her new dream home  worried she would not be able to pay her mortgage  her loan had come from an agriculture department program for low income residents in rural areas  but all of the account information she needed to make her first payment was locked away in an empty government office and in upstate new york  pam moore was feeding hay to her black and white cows at a small dairy that tottered on the brink of ruin  she and her husband had run up  350 000 in debt to keep the dairy running after 31 of their cows died of pneumonia  and their last lifeline was an emergency federal farm loan  but the money had been derailed by the government shutdown it has just been one thing after another  after another  after another  ms  moore  57  said farm country has stood by president trump  even as farmers have strained under two years of slumping incomes and billions in losses from his trade wars  but as the government shutdown now drags into a third week  some farmers say the loss of crucial loans  payments and other services has pushed them  and their support  to a breaking point while many rural conservatives may loathe the idea of big government  farmers and the federal government are welded together by dozens of programs and billions of dollars in spending now  farmers and farm groups say that federal crop payments have stopped flowing  farmers cannot get federally backed operating loans to buy seed for their spring planting  or feed for their livestock  they cannot look up new government data about beef prices or soybean yields to make decisions about planting and selling their goods in an ever changing global market this is real  said jeff witte  president of the national association of state departments of

trump is expected to address a largely friendly audience on monday at the american farm bureaus annual convention  many farmers  including david nunnery  59  of pike county  miss   have stayed unflinchingly loyal to mr  trump and his demands for  5 7 billion for a border wall  even as the shutdown threatens their livelihood i may lose the farm  but i strongly feel we need some border security  mr  nunnery said but davinder singh  41  the georgia pecan farmer  said the border wall was not worth the price he had already paid  losing out on the chance to finally buy his own orchard instead of working other peoples land why spend money on the wall  he said  he just wanted the government to reopen  as soon as possible the agriculture department had tried to blunt the effects by keeping local farm service agency offices open through december  and it extended deadlines for farmers to apply for the administrations  12 billion bailout for farmers hurt by mr  trumps trade policies states like wisconsin  which lost at least 638 dairy farms last year  are particularly vulnerable the new farm bill passed in december contained programs to help dairy farmers weather swings in the market  and to help farmers struggling with stress and depression get mental health services  but those programs cannot be put in effect during the shutdown  said senator tammy baldwin  democrat of wisconsin more uncertainty and more stress  she said  we cant afford to wait months and months  we need to get this moving now in manitowoc county  wis   michael slattery  a grain farmer  is waiting on  9 000  money the federal government owes him under its trade bailout and a conservation program for farmers who take steps to reduce erosion and runoff from their fields mr  slattery said farmers needed these funds to make big off season purchases such as seed  chemicals and diesel as they prepared for the planting season  but he said everything had ground to a standstill  the county farm service agency committee cannot meet  mr  slattery  who is also an economist  said he cannot get any raw data to make farming forecasts were being played the stooge  he said in new yorks farming communities  the shutdown is heaping additional pain onto farmers after a year of tariff losses  destructive weather and labor shortages because of the trump administrations immigration crackdowns in ovid  n y   it has left john myer seething at mr  trump as he waits for at least  15 000 owed to him under the trade bailout  mr  myer needs the money to pay his property taxes  which are due by the end of january  mr  myer  64  filed his paperwork before the shutdown  but said no payments were being processed you could hardly call it a political stunt  said mr  myer  who voted for hillary clinton in 2016  its a personal power stance because he doesnt really care about anything  i dont think  besides himself this week  as ms  moore  the struggling dairy farmer  sipped coffee at sallies country kitchen on main street in the 2 500 person town of nichols  she said it felt like her financial problems were closing in in a corner booth  she spotted a neighbor who had done  147 90 of yard work and trash hauling on her farm  she did not have enough money to pay him with little money left for food  she went to a food pantry on thursday afternoon  picking out frozen fruits and vegetables  pasta  bread  dried beans and some onions to cook when her 9 year old grandson visited later in the week we just have to do what we have to do to get by  she said .
washington  president trump this week will turn his attention from a fight with congressional democrats to an even more formidable negotiating challenge  one with potentially higher stakes  china trade talks with beijing begin on wednesday in washington  kicking off a monthlong sprint of negotiations between the two nations that could prove more difficult than mr  trumps unsuccessful attempt to secure money from congress for a border wall the negotiations come at a critical moment for mr  trumps economic agenda and the global economy  which is beginning to slow in part because of the presidents trade policies this week  a chinese delegation led by liu he  the vice premier  will meet with an american delegation led by robert lighthizer  mr  trumps top trade negotiator  and steven mnuchin  the treasury secretary  a white house official said on monday that mr  liu will meet personally with mr  trump on thursday if the two sides cannot reach a trade agreement by march 2  the united states has said it plans to escalate the trade war and raise tariffs on  200 billion of chinese imports  china has indicated it will similarly retaliate  making the talks beginning this week critical to resolving the standoff mr  mnuchin said that there has been significant movement in the talks but cautioned that the two countries are still working through very complicated issues the treasury secretary added that securing intellectual property protection for american companies  ending regulations that require joint ventures with chinese firms  and including measures to enforce the agreement would be crucial to completing a deal we expect when we get a deal  that deal will be enforced  mr  mnuchin said  adding that he believed china understands that trump administration officials have pointed to recent signs of economic weakness in china  caused in part by tariffs imposed by the united states  as a reason beijing should urgently seek a deal with the united states  the 35 day government shutdown  however  has drained some of the presidents political capital  potentially weakening mr  trumps leverage during the homestretch of the talks  on monday  the congressional budget office estimated that the shutdown cost the economy  11 billion  with  3 billion of that lost permanently the length and political dynamics of the shutdown have highlighted the unpredictability and intransigence of the trump administration on economic issues  which could paradoxically end up working to the u s  advantage  said eswar prasad  the former head of the international monetary funds china division  of course  the damaging economic effects of the shutdown and trumps desire to score a cleaner win at least on trade could also make u s  negotiators somewhat more flexible and willing to strike a deal the administration continues to insist it has the upper hand  with mr  trump reiterating in a tweet last week that he is ready to raise tariffs and urging china to stop playing around but the chinese may be emboldened by the fact that the presidents reputation as a deal maker suffered in the wake of failing to secure a win on the border wall the chinese may see the presidents retreat as a sign of weakness and have them harden their resolve not to make major concessions  said scott kennedy  a china expert at the center for strategic and international studies pressure on the united states is also increasing from the corporate sector  as big american manufacturers with exposure to china start taking a financial hit  caterpillar on monday said its profit for 2019 would be lower than expected as sales of heavy machinery to china slow and costs for materials rise  in part because of tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum  nvidia  a big chip maker  cut its fourth quarter revenue estimates  in part because of weak demand for its gaming chips in china deteriorating macroeconomic conditions  particularly in china  impacted consumer demand  nvidia said in a news release  shares of both companies fell  dragging down equity markets in the united states larry kudlow  the director of the national economic council  dismissed the suggestion that the united states has been pushing china too hard to make changes  and that it risked blowback if its economy sours whats at stake here i think is the possibility of spreading prosperity  frankly  in both countries  mr  kudlow said at a white house briefing markets have been fixated on the status of the talks  with any inkling of optimism sending global stocks higher  advisers to mr  trump  fearful that he could strike a quick deal to give stocks a lift  have cautioned him against focusing too much on daily market swings the prospect of an unresolved trade war between the worlds two largest economies has dampened business confidence  a survey released on monday by the national association for business economics found that 36 percent of manufacturers in the united states have raised prices because of mr  trumps trade policies and 27 percent have delayed investments  business groups such as the u s  chamber of commerce have urged the administration to take a less confrontational approach to china with the deadline quickly approaching  trump administration officials have been downplaying expectations about a potential deal being reached soon  wilbur ross  the commerce secretary  said last week that the united states and china were miles and miles apart and mr  kudlow has suggested that details of a deal were not set in stone ahead of the discussions this week congressional aides who have been briefed by the administration on the status of the talks said china has agreed to make large purchases of american products to reduce the trade deficit  which is one of mr  trumps key goals  chinas commitment to addressing other concerns  such as forced technology transfer  protections for american intellectual property and reducing its subsidies of state owned enterprises  remains uncertain the trump administration has also made little progress when it comes to devising a way to ensure that china lives up to whatever commitments it makes in a final agreement  there is widespread concern among trade experts that china could be slow walking the negotiations and that it will offer repackaged promises that it has failed to deliver on in the past  to prevent that  officials have been considering snap back tariffs that could be quickly imposed  or carousel tariffs that would hit different swaths of chinese goods if beijing fails to follow through christopher adams  who until last year was the senior coordinator for china affairs at the treasury department  said it is not hard to imagine mr  trump settling for a smaller preliminary deal and extending the march deadline to continue talks on bigger issues  mr  adams suggested the administration could also conclude that it must rely on its own tools  such as export controls and the committee on foreign investment in the united states  the body that can investigate and block foreign transactions on national security concerns  if china proves unwilling to undertake meaningful reforms  that would likely mean that the tariffs mr  trump has imposed will stay in place for a while i think the ball is in chinas court  mr  adams said  it really comes down to whether liu he brings something from president xi and whether that something gets us close .

its funny that were still talking about the physical features of what president trump wants or will settle for on our countrys southern border  about whether it will be concrete or steel  solid or slatted  a fancied up fence or  in nancy pelosis hilariously acerbic dig  a beaded curtain  because its not really a wall that trump is after  if indeed it ever was  its a victory for victorys sake  its a show of his might  its proof of his potency  of course he discussed it in a much different manner on tuesday night  when  for the first time during his presidency  he formally addressed americans from the oval office in prime time  he spoke of a crisis of the heart on the border  he spoke of a crisis of the soul  he mentioned drugs  crime  americans who have lost their lives because of undocumented immigrants and americans who have lost their jobs to them  it was an epic threat that he painted  and a grossly exaggerated one  whatever it takes to deliver on a promise that he should never have made whatever it takes to salvage his pride the longer his stalemate with democrats in congress grinds on  the clearer that becomes  seldom has a presidents ego been this tender  and seldom has it required so much shoring up  theres not enough concrete in creation for that job  network executives had little choice but to grant him access to the airwaves  he had never made such a request before  so its not like this particular grandstanding is habitual  go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with frank brunis candid reflections on politics  culture  higher education and more every week  sign up for his newsletter  and had the networks refused him  they would have handed him a cudgel in the culture wars that he would have used the same way that he governs  shamelessly  putting his ludicrous claims of martyrdom above any national interest  better for the networks to go along  with a plan in place to check his assertions rigorously and call out his lies immediately  even this deep into a presidency of such incompetence and amorality  he deserves a hearing  thats how the rest of us demonstrate the very respect for traditions and norms that he refuses to show  but he doesnt deserve an unfiltered one  thats the road to autocracy trump isnt selling something that the country really needs  and thats why he and his allies have to lard the pitch with lies  according to the washington post fact checker  there are more bogus claims and hallucinated menaces when he talks about immigration and the border than when he talks about anything else he insists that would be terrorists see a porous southern border as a welcome mat  but thats bunk  most try to get into the united states by plane and are apprehended at airports  he wildly inflates the amount of crime committed by undocumented immigrants and just as wildly overstates the effect a border wall might have on the countrys opioid crisis  he did this again on tuesday night  even though he wasnt speaking off the cuff  in a revved up style  at one of his rallies  he read prepared remarks  and still there was fiction aplenty in them nancy pelosi and chuck schumer  who were given time immediately following trump to present a rebuttal  clearly expected and were ready for that  in ticking off reasons that an expensive and expansive border wall wasnt needed  pelosi kept saying  the fact is  the fact is  it was a mantra meant to humiliate trump  which is a sport that she is developing an ever greater taste for when it comes to the border and the wall  trumps willful estrangement from reality is so profound that network executives and newspaper editors spent part of tuesday in strategy sessions about how to respond to his inevitable barrage of falsehoods  should there be a crawl of words on the bottom of the television screen to correct him in real time  could fact checkers work speedily enough to post rebuttals online within minutes of his misrepresentations  before they took root  this is where we find ourselves  other presidents have been untrustworthy  and others have had to be called out on it  but not like this  this is surreal its a function of  more than anything  his ego  his vanity  to which the television networks  furloughed federal workers  all americans  are hostage  hes not remarkable among presidents in having a high opinion of himself and in desperately wanting others to share it  a robust measure of arrogance and some degree of neediness are what make the grind of the campaign trail and the glare of the media bearable  and all presidents want to rack up triumphs that make them look and feel large  but none in my lifetime has spun so many falsehoods in the service of that  none has been so naked in his hunger for that heft to live with his resounding defeat by that nasty woman in the popular vote  trump had to invent the specter of millions of illegally cast ballots  he never did produce any evidence of that  to not feel eclipsed by president barack obama  he claimed there was a media conspiracy to undercount his inauguration crowd  but photographs dont lie  not the way a president does the day after his inauguration  in a visit to the c i a  headquarters  against a backdrop of stars that symbolized men and women who had been killed on the job for america  he used his remarks to tally his appearances on the cover of time magazine  i think we have the all time record  he said  but we as usual meant i  theres no occasion unsuitable for bragging  no mission more vital than the exaltation of trump  when  over the recent christmas holiday  he at last paid a visit to a combat zone and spoke to american troops in iraq  he seemed less intent on thanking them for their service than in having them thank him  he dwelled on a pay increase that they had received and claimed  erroneously  that they had gone without one for 10 years  until he came along we got you a big one  he said  i got you a big one  i got you a big one  i  big  thats the trump credo in two words  and that  at this point  is the point of the wall  i  big  its like a manhood thing for him  pelosi reportedly told house democrats in a closed meeting last month  as if manhood could ever be associated with him but bigness eluded trump on tuesday night  he came across as cramped  frustrated and forced to plead when hed much rather command  hes bunched up and boxed in  and the rest of us are yoked to this crazy  self affirming monument thats a barrier only to reason and responsible government .

washington  kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  said on monday that cyberthreats against the united states were a national security crisis that she described as her top priority  not the situation for which president trump last month declared a national emergency on top of my list of threats  that many of you can guess  the word cyber is circled  highlighted and underlined  ms  nielsen said in a speech outlining her departments focus in the coming year  the cyberdomain is a target  a weapon and a threat vector all at the same time mr  trump has called the increasing flow of immigrants to the southern border one of the most urgent national security issues threatening the united states  last week  issuing his first veto against legislation that would have blocked him from diverting defense department funds to build a border wall  the president described a recent spike in migrants crossing the border as an invasion the department of homeland security oversees customs officers and immigration agents who are on the front lines of the trump administrations campaign to close the border to illegal immigration ms  nielsen did dedicate a portion of her speech on monday to what she called a humanitarian and security catastrophe of central american families traveling to the border  she also noted that the projected number of migrants who may be apprehended at the southern border this month was expected to rise to 100 000  up from 76 000 in february but mentions of digital threats were dispersed throughout her approximately 35 minute address to an auditorium of various department of homeland security officials among global jihadists and transnational criminals  ms  nielsen listed cyberthugs and hackers and resurgent nation state rivals as an emerging threat to the united states  she asked two cybersecurity officials who helped safeguard the 2018 elections to stand for a round of applause ms  nielsen also assailed president vladimir v  putin of russia and the kremlin for a concerted effort to undermine our elections and our democratic process using cyberenabled means  and she said the average american citizen or company was no match for virtual threats from russia  china  north korea and iran i am more worried about the ability of bad guys to hijack our networks than their ability to hijack our flights  ms  nielsen said  i am concerned about them holding our infrastructure hostage  stealing our money and secrets  exploiting children online and even hacking our democracy john cohen  a former acting under secretary for intelligence during the obama administration  said law enforcement could no longer look at the threats in the digital world and the physical world as separate issues  extremist groups now circulate videos on the internet to inspire terrorist attacks  and drug traffickers are using the dark web  something ms  nielsen also highlighted in her speech mr  cohen said he remained unclear on how ms  nielsen proposed combating cybersecurity threats there is an incredible amount of talent at d h s   said mr  cohen  also a senior adviser at the agency during the george w  bush administration  my concern is that talent and those capabilities are being underutilized  because in the eyes of many at the white house  the sole purpose for d h s  is to conduct its immigrant and border security activities ms  nielsen said the department was focused on increasing collaboration with the private sector  citing a summit meeting held in new york last year for industry and government officials  she said she expected the cooperation between various homeland security agencies to improve when the department consolidates at a former mental hospital next month she praised the departments work in defending the integrity of the 2018 midterm elections and said she was confident in her departments ability to secure the 2020 presidential vote  ms  nielsen also said homeland security would continue to pursue prosecutions against foreign entities that hack the american digital infrastructure what worries me  though  is not what these threat actors have done  ms  nielsen said  but what they have the capability to do .
good wednesday morning  here are some of the stories making news in washington and politics today                       president trump doubled down on one of the biggest gambles of his presidency with a televised appeal to pressure congress into paying for his long promised border wall  it was his first prime time oval office address  a strategy that he himself privately disparaged as unlikely to work  the nine minute speech made no new arguments but included multiple misleading assertions  the times fact checked the presidents remarks  the times sent correspondents to the four states bordering mexico and found few who shared the presidents sense of alarm  many said there was indeed a humanitarian crisis unfolding  but they blamed the trump administration for worsening it  president trump has repeatedly warned that terrorists are pouring into the united states from mexico  but his own governments assessments conclude that mr  trump has seriously overstated the threat  this week would have been payday for 800 000 federal workers across the country  but as the shutdown drags on  no paychecks are arriving to replenish their savings or pay down their maxed out credit cards  a formatting error by paul manaforts defense lawyer revealed that mr  manafort  a top official in mr  trumps campaign  discussed internal polling data during the 2016 race with a man tied to russian intelligence  former felons in florida have begun registering to vote  after the approval in november of a historic ballot measure that restored the voting rights of as many as 1 5 million people  the supreme court refused to intercede in a mysterious fight over a sealed grand jury subpoena that may be part of the mueller inquiry  president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey refused to meet john bolton  mr  trumps national security adviser  saying that mr  bolton made a grave mistake when he said that turkey must agree to protect syrias kurds in the event of an american withdrawal  emboldened house democrats  seeking a politically charged debate on gun control  unveiled legislation to expand background checks to nearly all firearms purchases  the federal budget deficit continues to rise and is on pace to top  1 trillion for the 2019 fiscal year  as increased revenue from mr  trumps tariffs fails to keep up with losses from his signature corporate tax cuts  writing his first supreme court opinion for a unanimous court  justice brett m  kavanaugh said that arbitrators rather than judges must decide whether disputes should be arbitrated                      todays on politics briefing was compiled by isabella grulln paz in new york were you forwarded this newsletter  subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox is there anything you think were missing  anything you want to see more of  wed love to hear from you  email us at onpolitics nytimes com .
this week  students took on some challenging topics via our writing prompts  including the debate over the border wall  sexual abuse allegations against r  kelly  and the relationship between the news media and the president as always  we were impressed with their thoughtfulness  humility and sharp analyses  but what really impressed us was how many students took the time to read and reply to each others comments with both disagreement and approval  most readers offered substantial and civil rebuttals  responses we know are not always easy to give to issues as complicated and emotional as these below  weve rounded up the best of the comments on two of these topics  along with some more lighthearted teenage musings about dream travel destinations were so happy to welcome new classes from downers grove  ill   sarah e  goode stem academy in chicago  and tallahassee  fla  this week  and we want also to give a special shout out to the students at the julia r  masterman school in philadelphia  who wrote excellent comments across all our prompts this week please note  all student comments have been lightly edited for length  but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted           the government shutdown and debate over a border wall have dominated headlines for the past few weeks  following president trumps prime time address to the nation on jan  8  we asked students what they thought about the standoff between mr  trump and congress and how they hoped it would be resolved the majority of students took issue with the impasse  but a few defended mr  trumps steadfastness  others suggested ways the deadlock could be resolved and how the  5 7 billion mr  trump wants for the border wall could be better spent  we highlight some of the best argued and most interesting ideas in our roundup below weighing the costs and benefits of a government shutdownin the midst of the government shutdown  there is a looming humanitarian crisis  however  it is not a scourge of illegal immigrants entering the us and committing unspeakable atrocities  but the roughly 800 000 federal employees who are not reviving paychecks as a consequence of government shutdown  each day it stretches on  their situation grows more perilous as they are forced to draw from financial savings that should be utilized for retirement or sending their children to college  it is absolutely abhorrent that almost one million people are having their livelihoods put on hold because the president does not want to negotiate the wall is perhaps the most ridiculous and controversial border control proposition created in the last fifteen years  in its full form  it would cost american taxpayers upwards of 50 billion dollars  and it has no guarantees of effectiveness  there is no denying that the us mexico border has an issue with illegal immigrants  but this is no way of solving the issue  a multifaceted  extremely complex problem that has continually defied resolution  a simple wall will not remedy the conundrum faced by both us and mexican authorities  in summary  the cost for the border wall  in both monetary and humanitarian terms  is far too high to justify its creation  instead  it would be exponentially more useful to explore alternate  less belligerent methods of border control that can be more universally agreed upon and implemented  jake hession  hoggard high school  wilmington  n c robert frost once wrote  good fences makes good neighbors  so do good walls  the united states government does not need the added work of taking care of all of these illegal immigrants  who sneaked here to flea danger in their country  not only is it fair to the u s  government  but it is also unfair to the many people trying to enter the country legally  who have been waiting for years only to have to wait longer because of these illegal immigrants  many people are making the argument that government workers are not being paid for their work  however  these workers do get backpay as compensation for the money they lost during that time  this one bit of information makes that argument almost completely irrelevant  jonah a   masterman schoolin all honesty  i am a supporter of the border wall  however  the recent actions and behavior mr  trump has displayed in order to fund the wall is absolutely not justified  a leader is supposed to unify the hoi polloi  not divide us even further  but mr  trump has failed to do this  instead of offering himself to the united states  mr  trump has decided to offer the united states for his own desires  this is wrong  and its not okay  800 000 americans are struggling to survive without a paycheck because of one mans selfishness  some of these citizens also have families to feed  many with young children  g jap  masterman school  philadelphia  penn i agree with the president in this matter  i understand that a lot of people are not being paid for their work  but sometimes that just has to happen for the greater good  the border will decrease a lot of illegal immigration  which should be our priority  the government shutdown provided a lot of the fund to build reinforce the border already  and im not saying its a good thing  but all of the funds are essential to a safe border  the democrats have a false sense of security  thinking that we are already protected well enough from illegal immigration  but that is false  hundreds or even thousands of people cross the border every passing day  and they are not doing anything to stop it  the border needs its funds in order to keep doing its job david w  the great  the great land of earthgovernment spending and the walldonald trumps prime time address did not sway my opinion at all  i still believe the wall is unnecessary money to take from america that could be used to help the people in flint  michigan or a years worth of housing for every homeless person in the us  there are much more urgent and important matters that the president has sidelined to focus on his wall  angela xhori  julia r  masterman  philadelphiai believe that yes our border needs protection just not keeping everyone out with a huge wall  what i feel would be more warranted would be background and weapon checks on those coming into the usa to ensure the safety of the country  reza chity guevara  masterman  philadelphia  penn i believe that the wall is a terrible idea  with the money the government would be spending on the wall  1 4 million people could get health care  double funding for mental health  and double funding for environmental causes  this wall wont fix anything  it will just prove america avoids their problems and builds barriers  new problems would arise with the wall  for example  people could destroy parts of the wall or dig under it  this is basically throwing money out of the window  molly flaxman  masterman school  philadelphiawhy isnt 5 billion dollars being spent in the cities that suffer from a drug epidemic  why not 5 billion dollars to the homeless  orphanages  hospitals  schools  medicine  and more  spend the money on what you really need to help this country  what does the wall benefit  not schools  not research centers  not even care centers  that money can be used to make places for those immigrants who have crucial reasons to be leaving their own home  spend money on the violence of our cities  young teens killing each other  spend money on educating the young people who will become our caretakers in the future  if you really want to make america better thats how you make america great again  not with a wall  jenesis moreno  masterman  philadelphia  penn democrats and republicans need to work togetheri think putting a wall on the border is not going to solve all the problems  i also think as a country  we should put our differences aside and work together  america has a greater destiny and purpose and should be an example for future generations  if we act as we do now  the future leaders will act worse seeing our behavior and political thinking  even though political views have split the country tremendously over the past 3 years  our main goal is to keep this country the best and running  now the republicans and democrats are wasting every precious second and because of this  many families are suffering and the national parks are slowly getting destroyed  eleena john  masterman  philly  penn trump is not willing to negotiate  but neither is nancy pelosi or chuck schumer  they are saying that they do not want the wall under any circumstance  all three of them are resisting each other and the u s  citizens are paying for it  or not getting payed  whatever floats your boat   i hope this will end by the republicans giving in  and the loads of money will be spent on different issues like global warming  while still not letting all the illegal immigrants in  arjun ahya  masterman school  philadelphia  penn           last week  the times travel section published its annual 52 places to go piece and announced the travel writer who would travel to and write about all 52 spots  in this student opinion question  we asked students which of these destinations theyd most like to visit and whether they would want the job of the 52 places traveler of the 52 places to go in 2019  students were most excited about visiting the setouchi islands in japan  other top spots included  puerto rico  the islands of tahiti  the ontario ice caves  and panama  they also recommended several places not on the list  including ghent  belgium  the galpagos islands  pittsburgh  and the great wall of china  below  they tell us why where students want to visit and whyevery single place in the list provided looked absolutely breathtaking and incredible  and while there were so many choices  i found myself stopping to take a closer look at aberdeen  in scotland  while it may not have been as beautiful or exotic as some of the other destinations on the list  i have always found myself to be fascinated with all things scottish  i love how the scottish accent flows  and i have always been amazed by the landscapes and lochs in scotland  what made this location appear even more impressive to me was the old fashion trains  which combine two things i love  old fashioned vehicles and overnight train rides  lily chancey  philadelphia  mastermanif i could travel to one of the places on the list  i would prefer to go to the setouchi islands in japan  before i even went through the list  i already had a passion to go to japan for a trip  i wanted to see japans beautiful nature and try some of their traditional foods  setouchi triennale 2019  a major art fair interests me considering it will be held at teshima and honjima which are less frequented to create a balance between the nature and the art  there are so many different places to go  some focusing on the natural beauty of japan like cycling on trails with citrus trees and olive groves  i would love to ride a sea plane with setouchi sea planes to take scenic flights to small and larger islands  the food that i could try on the trip also inticesme considering i could try authentic japanese food  japan seems like an ideal place for me to travel and relax to have a fun time in a calm place  janey l   julia r  masterman  philadephiain my lifetime  i have visited five of the seven continents  travelling has always lead me blindly into the most thrilling and unique experiences  i will take any chance i get to pack my bag and experience a new lifestyle  and i am constantly searching for ways to broaden my cultural horizon  there was one destination included in the article that sounded very rare and intriguing  isla palenque  panama  when reading the description  the part that caught my attention was the resort grows some of its own food  has furniture made from fallen trees and maintains a no plastics policy  including subbing papaya shoots for straws  it would be a totally new experience for me to live off the land  and get away from all of the sounds overpopulation  haven habrat  hoggard high school  wilmington  n c my biggest dream is to travel  having never left the country  i rely on the internet and experiences from friends to tell me about the world outside of the us  last year i got to know two foreign exchange students that had come to the us for a year and it only fueled my passion for travel  it amazes me how different cultures are and i want to learn about them all the tatra mountains in slovakia caught my attention  i live in a port city  right by a beach community so its always fairly warm  it would be interesting to go to a place that has snow and its sweltering hot for 75  of the year  also there are many outdoor activities that i have never tried before  due to lack of snow  like snowboarding  skiing  snow tubing  etc  paige phillips  hoggard high school  wilmington  n c i am your average student  stressed from the amount of homework and the constant pressure im always under  i will live in my little bubble for most of the year forgetting that there is an entire world out there to explore  after reading the fifty two recommended places i found the islands of tahiti to be one of the places i want to explore  i have always wanted to live on the water and be able to experience something that i could not find anywhere  what made it stand out was tahitis clear  warm waters offer views of more than 1 000 species of marine life  this would be something you would only receive once in a lifetime and living on the water while seeing more than a thousand species of marine life is something extraordinary  talia porzio  hoggard high school  wilmington  n c traveling is one of the best ways to learn  you are exposed to different cultures  as well as encounter the history embedded to the place  one of the proven best ways to learn is to experience what is being taught  personally  i would love to visit the setouchi islands in japan  thailand  or danang in vietnam  my mom was born in vietnam but was raised in america  a result of being forced to flee during the war  it would be so nice to go and revisit some of the few memories she has as well as enrich my knowledge in the culture  hope a  masterman  phillyon being the 52 places travelerhaving a job as the 52 place traveler sounds phenomenal because you would get to take a break and visit places that your heart desires  in addition  all you have to do is write about your experiences  everything is taken care of  and it would just be a extremely long vacation  although this job sounds great  there are also downfalls  you may have to be away from your family and friends  and that can always make you feel lonely  though there are downfalls  this job still sounds great  sometimes you have to sacrifice things in life  so that you can get another  sophia  mastermanit might be fun to go 52 different places  but if you even spend 3 days there  plus a day for flying there  thats four days  multiplied by 52 is 208 days   almost 2 3 of the year  i dont think i would want to spend that much time away from home because there are a lot of aspects of my home that i really enjoy  in conclusion  i probably wouldnt want to travel somewhere for more than 1 5 months  and only up to 1 5 months if its really fun  samuel  mastermani would absolutely love to have a job that travels 52 places  that is like a dream job  you have the opportunity to experience the world and do things others dream to do  the only challenging thing about this job might be leaving your family for long periods of time  however what you gain from traveling the world is absolutely worth it  elodie poussard  massachusettsi would be absolutely ecstatic about being the 52 places traveler  that opportunity to connect with people different from you  and learn something new is once in a lifetime  it would be so fun to meet people  visit historic places  eat new foods  and really learn about a new culture  i think the challenging part would be a language barrier  but that would never stop me from enjoying myself  im sure i can communicate well enough with hand jesters and google translate  bailey dyer  florida high school  tallahassee  fla           in our most popular picture prompt of the week  tight rope  we asked students to study the image above and interpret it in light of current events they came up with a variety of nuanced explanations  but all seemed immediately to grasp the theme of the frank bruni column that inspired our prompt  the relationship between president trump and the news media  of the many wonderful comments we got  we chose those that were grounded in the illustrations visual evidence and drew clear connections to specific events or issues  especially because  having just judged our own student editorial cartoon contest  we know it is this kind of thinking that results in sophisticated winning work like this here is what students came up with walking a fine linei believe that this picture is commenting on the difficult job of our press  in america  the press has to try so hard to stay neutral  not supporting one side over the other i know that newspapers and magazines have to walk a fine line  or tightrope  when it comes to publishing  it is either exposing the truth or risking large scale retaliation from the readers and people in power  sam doyle  philly phillyi think that this image is trying to represent how on edge the news feels today  president trump has repeatedly said that todays new is the enemy of the people  and whenever he doesnt like something on the news he calls it fake news  it shows how careful the reporters have to be  in the image they have to be careful to stay on balance and not fall  but in real life they have to make sure they say the right things so they dont get president trump mad  it must feel like walking on eggshells around him  reporters today have to balance on a tightrope to get to talk to trump without him calling them fake news or the enemy of the people  and thats not how things are supposed to be in a democratic country  ami s  masterman  philadelphiai assume the guy with the tanned face and blonde hair is president trump so i feel like the picture is showing the dangers of news outlets reporting on president trump  its almost like a tight rope that you are crossing when it comes to him and the controversy your news outlet can start  i feel like the people on the other side of the tightrope are news reporters that are passed all the controversy with trump and some of them may even support him  this may be the reason why he is depicted talking to them  when in other situations he is ignoring the reporters that confront him  this picture shows the other news reporters on the rope who may be in the controversy and their news outlet may be undergoing some type of drama with trump and have to record him from a distance  abdoul diallo  julia r  masterman  philadelphiai believe that this picture prompt represents how difficult it is for reporters and journalist just to talk to president trump  a reporters job is to get information from a person  but when the person is not cooperative then this cold be a rather hard job  we all know that trump is not easy to interview because he cuts people off and sometimes turns questions around  i can recall he even kicked a journalist out of a news conference for asking a question about a topic trump was very strict on  immigration   so when a reporter is trying to ask the president something its like they are walking on a tightrope because you never know how he could possibly lash out  jack dunphy  philadelphiaseeking the truthi think that this image is saying how maybe donald trump is keeping the truth away from us  he is making reporters and other people who are trying to figure out what s going on work very hard to get it  i feel this picture saying that he is hiding what he is doing and only a few people who are determined will continue to try to get to it  my opinion on what i think is this messages is why not tell them what is happening you are the president but it is still our lives  your people should know what is going on  sierra mckinley  philadelphia  penn in this illustration  donald trump is on one side while reporter are trying to get to him on a tightrope  i think the tightrope represents how hard reporters try to figure out what is happening in the trump presidency  there are so many secrets and things that we dont know especially in the trump presidency because of all of the things that have happened during his term and all of the lies he has told  we need to know the truth  and its these reporters jobs to tell us whats going on  maia keenan  masterman  philadelphiawe think this image depicts reporters trying to ask questions and will risk everything to know the truth and reality  the reporter holding the microphone is asking risky questions  especially because all of the other reporters could fall if he asks something that donald trump finds offensive  finally  everyone in the image can only move forward because if they go back everyone falls but trump is isolated  hall ms el masters  corte madera  calif the media circuswhen i look at this picture it reminds me of the media image in america  and how it is so focused on donald trump  since the presidential election all that has been in the news is donald trump  has been the on the headline of the news so many times that i cant even keep track anymore  we have been so focused on what he is doing that we are missing out on all the other stuff that is happening in america like all the mass shooting that are constantly happing in america or the mass population homeless people that we have on our streets  they say that he is digging this country into a deeper hole but what they dont say is that the media is there with him helping him dig this ever growing hole  niara hughes  masterman  philadelphia  penn  the image shows how donald trump is trying to get attention  even if people are risking their lives at the same time  for example  the government shutdown   he thinks his wall is more important than the people of america  maya kowal  masterman school  philadelphia  penn .
washington  president trump warned on wednesday that he reserved the option of declaring a national emergency to build his border wall without congressional approval the president  speaking a day after his address to the nation that even some supporters conceded was unlikely to increase public support  headed to a luncheon meeting on capitol hill where he faced the urgent task of persuading wavering senate republicans that he could still come to an accord with democrats on border security and end the partial shutdown of the federal government asked whether he was still considering declaring a national emergency  an extraordinary measure rarely used by presidents absent an urgent security threat  mr  trump said  i think we might work a deal  and if we dont  i may go that route  i have the absolute right to do national emergency if i want  read about whether mr  trump can use his emergency powers to build a wall  mr  trump was scheduled to meet later wednesday afternoon with democratic and republican congressional leaders at the white house in an effort to break the deadlock  so far  democrats have held firm to the position that the president must agree to reopen the government before they will engage on the larger issue of border security legislation and his proposed wall the president insisted that he maintained tremendous republican support  even as nearly a half dozen republican senators have said directly or strongly suggested that they wanted to reopen the government  then have the debate about the wall i think we have tremendous republican support  mr  trump said  the senate has been incredible  mitch mcconnell has been incredible  he said  referring to the senate majority leader the president  who has refused to sign any bill to fund the government that does not include  5 7 billion for the wall  also said some democrats were moving to his point of view  although he did not offer any names the fact is that there is tremendous support  he said if i did something that was foolish  like gave up on border security  the first ones that would hit me would be my senators  theyd be angry at me  he said  the second ones would be the house  and the third ones would be frankly my base and a lot of republicans out there and a lot of democrats that want to see border security mr  trump is scheduled to travel to southern texas on wednesday to dramatize his call for a wall  the democratic members of congress in that area of texas  and several of the republicans there  have said a wall along the entire texas border is not necessary this is not a fight i wanted  mr  trump said  i didnt want this fight .
washington  standing before a diverse new class of house democrats  in the shadow of their new female speaker  president trump showed on tuesday how he planned to govern in a divided washington the answer  judging by his words  is no differently than he did before mr  trump briefly acknowledged nancy pelosi as madam speaker  but dispensed with even perfunctory congratulations  he all but ignored the midterm elections that swept the republican party out of power in the house  and he vowed that the united states will never be a socialist country  likening the progressive democrats in the chamber to the discredited leader of venezuela the president did issue a call for bipartisan cooperation  and he invoked the heroism of world war ii to celebrate a shared history  but on the issues that have rived washington during mr  trumps turbulent presidency  he did not give an inch whether it was the border wall  which he insisted would be built  abortion  where he tried to fan conservative anger over comments made by virginias governor  or the investigations of his presidential campaigns ties to russia  which he dismissed as ridiculous and partisan  mr  trump chose to appeal to his political base rather than trying to build bridges to democrats if there is going to be peace and legislation  he declared  setting out the terms of his engagement with congress  there cannot be war and investigation  it just doesnt work that way save for the majesty of the setting  the presidents adherence to his script  and a single unscripted moment when mr  trump tipped his hat to the scores of democratic women elected to congress last november  parts of this state of the union speech could have been drawn from one of his make america great again rallies mr  trump warned of a new wave of invading caravans from central america  spoke of grisly crimes committed by illegal immigrants and accused what he said were wealthy politicians who oppose his immigration policies  presumably including ms  pelosi  of favoring open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards no issue better illustrates the divide between americas working class and political class than illegal immigration  he said in front of him  however  the divide was between the mostly male republicans  who applauded his red meat lines  and the democrats  many of them women  who were clad in white to signify the womens suffrage movement mr  trump delighted in his role as the dismantler of democratic legacies  he boasted of eliminating a very unpopular provision of obamacare  withdrawing the united states from the disastrous iran nuclear deal and renegotiating the catastrophe known as nafta as for how the republicans and democrats might work together  mr  trump revived his proposal for infrastructure legislation  calling it not an option but a necessity  but he offered no details and breezed through the proposal  which is less popular among republicans  in barely three lines  half as much time as he gave his campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs even mr  trumps conciliatory phrases carried a partisan sting  he said  for example  the agenda i will lay out this evening is not a republican agenda or a democrat agenda  using a shortened form of democratic that some republicans favor as a mild slur against the opposing party for a president whose party lost 40 seats in the house three months ago  and who just lost a battle with ms  pelosi over the 35 day government shutdown  mr  trump behaved like the insurgent who rode into washington two years ago with a congressional majority and a mandate to upend the establishment he claimed credit for a long list of economic and national security achievements  some of which were almost comically exaggerated  if i had not been elected president of the united states  he said  we would right now  in my opinion  be in a major war with north korea in addressing congress on tuesday  mr  trump found himself in an identical position to his three immediate predecessors  barack obama  george w  bush and bill clinton  facing a hostile congress after a devastating midterm defeat how each confronted the moment offers a window into their presidencies  together  they stand as a stark contrast to the current occupant of the oval office in 1995  mr  clinton responded to the republican revolution of the previous november by pivoting to the center and giving credence to the small government agenda of newt gingrich and his fellow warriors  he admitted to missteps in his first two years in office  which had allowed his republican opponents to caricature him as a tax and spend liberal mr  clinton sketched a vision of a leaner  more efficient government  with fewer regulations and an overhauled welfare system  the conservative commentator william kristol marveled that it was the most conservative state of the union by a democratic president in history twelve years later  mr  bush opened his state of the union address with a warm tribute to ms  pelosi  who assumed the speakers gavel for the first time after democrats swept to power in the house in 2006  he spoke of the pride her late father  thomas dalesandro jr   a congressman from maryland  would have felt in seeing his only daughter  nancy  presiding tonight it was a grace note for mr  bush  who was fighting to salvage his legacy after midterm elections that served as a referendum on the iraq war and his bungled handling of hurricane katrina  mr  trump  by contrast  appeared to rush his opening remarks to deny ms  pelosi the chance to introduce him mr  obamas speech in 2011 came days after former representative gabrielle giffords was nearly killed in a mass shooting in tucson  a tragedy that muted the normally partisan tone  mr  obama seized on the fleeting comity to declare  each of us is part of something greater  something more consequential than party or political preference like mr  bush and mr  clinton  he appealed to republicans to find common ground  in his case behind a national project to make the united states more competitive in a rapidly changing global economy this is our generations sputnik moment  mr  obama said  urging americans to out innovate  out educate and out build the rest of the world mr  trump referred to outspending and out innovating major competitors  too  but he put it in the context of building nuclear weapons  after explaining why he pulled the united states out of the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty for presidents  state of the union speeches rarely grease the wheels of bipartisanship  mr  clinton clashed repeatedly with republicans after their congressional takeover  outmaneuvering mr  gingrich after he precipitated a government shutdown  though he made a historic deal on welfare overhaul that set the stage for his re election in 1996 mr  bush stuck to his troop surge in iraq  reaping unexpected gains  but with the exception of a deal with the democrats late in his term on the fiscal crisis  his legislative agenda was over by the time he spoke in 2007 mr  obamas call for bipartisanship went nowhere in the republican senate  where the leader  senator mitch mcconnell  vowed to make mr  obama a one term president  he failed to strike a grand bargain on fiscal policy with speaker john a  boehner  with both sides blaming the other for bad faith in the failed negotiation for mr  trump  the portents for cooperation seem even less promising  he offered no tangible compromise on the border wall  he faces a newly energized democratic party and he is heading into a presidential election year we must choose between greatness and gridlock  results or resistance  vision or vengeance  incredible progress or pointless destruction  mr  trump said the president implored his audience to choose greatness  but he gave them no road map for pursuing it .
to the editor re president offers deal on dreamers to secure a wall  front page  jan  20  and senate will hold competing votes to end shutdown  front page  jan  23  president trump and congressional democrats appear to be locked in a political game of chicken  with federal government workers  government contractors and the public trapped in the middle  mr  trumps offer of temporary protections for the dreamers in exchange for  5 7 billion in funding for a border wall was quickly rejected by speaker nancy pelosi  two measures ending the shutdown that will be before the senate on thursday are not expected to pass the current situation is untenable  the burden on federal workers is onerous and unfair  creative solutions are needed to end this impasse  i offer two first  a proven mediator  such as former senator george mitchell  could be appointed in an attempt to bring the parties to an agreement  second  a bipartisan blue ribbon commission  composed of experts from government  business and academia  could be created to offer recommendations on how best to address our border issues  including people and drugs coming into our country time is of the essence  a deal must be struck soon to avoid irreparable harm to the federal government todd j  schwartzwall  n j  to the editor the democrats should seize on this chance to end the shutdown  theres no downside for them  it is not a question of bargaining anymore but of the suffering of the country  but even so  its a good deal  the dreamers will get something they would otherwise have not gotten  and president trump has learned his lesson his approval ratings have gone down  his base is unhappy  there will be no more trump shutdowns  and democrats will avoid the risk of a shift in blame to them for their intransigence  and  the clincher  ann coulter doesnt like it howard rachlinnew yorkto the editor how about this  democrats put forward a bill in the house for border security of  12 billion  this would be for more border patrol officers  upgraded equipment  improved facilities  etc   but not a wall this would allow democrats to show that they are tough on border security by more than doubling president trumps proposed funding  the bill must focus purely on border security  no other democratic wish list items or conditions would republican members of congress and the president bite  perhaps theyd see it as face saving  conversely  to reject it would be seen as obstructionist  risking voter wrath at the next election jim spanierhoustonto the editor set a date for all federal employees to picket in front of president trumps hotels  nothing gets his attention like money barbara lloydstratford  conn to the editor for all of his manifold and well documented deficiencies  president trump is not nearly as nave as charlie brown  if mr  trump buys into nancy pelosis assurances that border security  including a wall or other physical barrier  can be discussed once the government is reopened  he is no smarter than charlie thinking that this time lucy will not snatch the football away just as he is about to kick it david macneilchatham  n j  to the editor there was fencing around a construction site here in queens that my wife and i passed this morning  and on it was a sign that read  national rent a fence  seeing it  my wife laughed and said  maybe trump should try that james j  rushbayside  queens.

jousting lances  they line the streets for golf cart parades  they venture into mexico  shopping for cheap medicine  getting pedicures  undergoing low cost dental work and sipping goblet sized margaritas they are known as winter texans  and they concentrate mainly in the rio grande valley  the temperate region deep in south texas that is also the place where the largest number of migrants has been crossing lately from central america  president trump has declared a national emergency along the border and stationed army troops to help control the escalating influx  one of their base camps was a quarter mile from where seniors at the victoria palms resort in donna deploy by the dozens to occupy five pickleball courts the annual invasion of midwesterners  and a number of canadians

are white and in their early 70s  many of them voted for mr  trump in 2016  and their very presence this winter quietly subverted the presidents assertion that the border is in crisis  they have been coming to the region for years  in some cases  their parents were winter texans  too  and the political dynamics and national emergency rhetoric has no effect on how  or where  they spend their retirement we dont see what you see on tv  said terry goss  the general manager of victoria palms  one of the largest winter texan communities  with up to 2 500 retirees what do winter texans see  exactly a slice of border life that looks nothing like what many americans think of as border life  there was nathans fourth annual sock hop at ranchero village in weslaco one friday  there were fish

and advil and that kind of thing  ms  hitzemann said  i was like  oh my gosh  this isnt any cheaper than walmart  so we ended up not buying any medications in a region with a large latino population and tolerant attitudes toward immigration  many people have family members on both sides of the border  culture clash with the northerners is inevitable  the study released by the university of texas

washington  the house will file a lawsuit challenging president trumps declaration of a national emergency at the southwestern border  speaker nancy pelosi announced thursday  the latest in a series of efforts to stop mr  trump from securing money that congress refused to give him for his promised wall the presidents action clearly violates the appropriations clause by stealing from appropriated funds  an action that was not authorized by constitutional or statutory authority  ms  pelosi said in a statement the house will once again defend our democracy and our constitution  this time in the courts  she added  no one is above the law or the constitution  not even the president the trump administration has argued that mr  trumps moves to spend more taxpayer dollars on border barriers than congress had agreed to give him are lawful because he is invoking statutes that granted the president the power to move money around under urgent circumstances  those statutes placed few limits on a presidents authority to determine that such situations exist mr  trump and his defenders have also noted that presidents have declared national emergencies nearly 60 times since congress passed the national emergencies act in 1976  although critics point out that in no previous such instance did a president invoke extraordinary powers as an end run around lawmakers after failing to win legislative approval for a proposal the lawsuit was authorized by the bipartisan legal advisory group  which consists of the top leaders of both parties in the house  ms  pelosi  representative steny h  hoyer of maryland  the majority leader  representative james e  clyburn of south carolina  the majority whip  representative kevin mccarthy of california  the minority leader  and representative steve scalise of louisiana  the minority whip the group met briefly on thursday and voted along party lines to authorize the lawsuit  it is unclear when it will be filed legal action has been an option for house lawmakers since mr  trump declared a national emergency at the southwestern border in february to activate the power to redirect military construction funds  effectively trying to go around congresss refusal to fund a border wall at the level he had demanded  both chambers passed legislation that would have ended the national emergency  but mr  trump vetoed the bill  the first veto of his presidency  and the house could not muster enough votes to override it on thursday  a pentagon spokesman said that final decisions about what military construction projects would have their funds repurposed for his declaration have not yet been made the house will be joining several other lawsuits already filed  plaintiffs in another suit challenging mr  trumps border barrier plans sought on thursday to expedite obtaining a judicial order to block the government from taking further steps toward building new border barriers  even as administration officials raced to spend what money they had as quickly as they could the plaintiffs  the sierra club and the southern border communities coalition  which are represented by the american civil liberties union  filed a motion for a preliminary injunction that would bar the administration from building new barriers near yuma  ariz   and el paso until the litigation can be resolved on the merits  last month  the trump administration had identified those sectors as locations for new or replacement barrier projects  while redirecting  1 billion in excess military pay and pension funds for that purpose that part of mr  trumps plans relies not on his high profile invocation of emergency powers  but on another component that has received less attention  using the pentagons separate authority to redirect some of its annual budget in order to beef up its counternarcotics programs  which in turn can be tapped for blocking smuggling along the border  because that money must be spent before the fiscal year ends on sept  30  the administration is trying to move quickly to issue contracts but the a c l u  says that its clients are likely to prevail in their argument that it is unlawful for mr  trump to use such tactics to spend more on border barriers than congress appropriated  its motion maintains that freezing any further steps toward construction before a final ruling  even as the clock continues to tick toward the end of september  would be justified because any such construction would  among other things  disrupt these ecosystems and cause irreversible damage that case is pending before a federal district court judge in oakland  calif   haywood s  gilliam jr   who was appointed in 2014 by president barack obama  the plaintiffs have asked him to hold a hearing on the request on may 9 .
washington  as congressional leaders urged their colleagues to support a bipartisan border deal  president trump said on wednesday that he did not want to see the government shut down at midnight friday  indicating that he was leaning toward signing the compromise legislation i dont want to see a shutdown  a shutdown would be a terrible thing  mr  trump said  later hinting that he had options that most people dont understand to build his border wall without congressional approval the remarks  which were made to reporters in the oval office as mr  trump met with the president of colombia  inched him toward embracing a bipartisan border deal that fell far short of his demands for wall funding  but without a shutdown as leverage  he appeared to have little choice but to sign it if it clears congress on capitol hill  17 negotiators rushed to turn the border compromise into voluminous legislation  while both speaker nancy pelosi  democrat of california  and senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  encouraged their troops to support it  the 1 159 page bill and a full report from negotiators were filed wednesday minutes before midnight  the senate is expected to vote on the measure on thursday  followed by the house both leaders acknowledged that the legislation would not satisfy every member  the border security agreement deprives mr  trump and his republican base of a victory on the wall  but it gives more money for border fencing and immigration detention than the left wing of the democratic party wanted at least one of the negotiators did not sign off on the spending package  representative tom graves  republican of georgia  who said on twitter that he felt that he did not have enough time to review the details  he did not rule out voting for it but with the effect of the last government shutdown  the longest in the nations history  still fresh  few were in the mood to risk another funding lapse as with all compromises  i say to people  support the bill for what is in it  ms  pelosi told reporters on wednesday  dont judge it for what is not in it  we have other days to pass other legislation speaking on the senate floor  mr  mcconnell said the outcome reflected the way it goes in divided government and warned against letting unrelated cynical partisan plays get in the way of finishing this important process the compromise measure  assembled by senior members of both parties on monday night  includes just  1 375 billion for new fencing along the border with mexico  far short of the  5 7 billion mr  trump sought for a steel or concrete wall  and less than was included in the deal he rejected in december  which prompted the shutdown but mr  trump got cover from a few allies in the conservative news media and the senate  with some lawmakers making a point of selling the benefits of the agreement to the president senator richard c  shelby  republican of alabama  the chairman of the senate appropriations committee and one of the senior members who helped put together the compromise measure  said on twitter that he spoke to mr  trump after signing off on the agreement he was in good spirits  mr  shelby tweeted  its a down payment on his border wall  this is only the beginning of a multi year effort white house officials are still looking at how to allocate additional money for the presidents signature campaign promise  and have considered pulling from army corps of engineers projects in california and puerto rico  but officials cautioned that nothing had been settled on as of late wednesday afternoon  lawmakers and aides were working to resolve lingering issues in the spending package  which includes funding for the department of homeland security and six unfinished spending bills representative henry cuellar  democrat of texas and one of the negotiators  said there were late discussions about where new fencing could be built in the rio grande valley  to address local and environmental concerns  something white house officials pushed back against  ultimately  the new barriers cannot be built in five areas  including the national butterfly center in mission  tex a number of extensions  including a provision that would provide back pay to federal contractors deprived of payments during the last shutdown  will not be included in the package because bicameral leadership negotiations did not result in an agreement  according to a senior democratic aide  a republican senate aide said party negotiators believed that back pay could be handled by the office of management and budget without congresss involvement the unfinished items also include an extension of the violence against women act  which is set to expire friday mr  trump said on wednesday that the white house had not seen the legislative text of the deal  and when aides do  well be looking for land mines most democrats indicated they would support the legislation  even before the text was finished  in part because it would stave off another government shutdown and included democratic priorities in the other six bills some of the priorities include a  1 billion increase for census funding  a  1 3 billion increase for housing programs and  500 million in funding for medical support  food and clothing for migrants in detention and alternatives to detention federal employees will also receive a 1 9 percent increase in pay  representative steny h  hoyer of maryland  the majority leader  told reporters  noting that he and other members would most likely pursue a higher number in the future  along with other unaddressed immigration priorities other liberal lawmakers expressed concerns about the funding levels for the number of beds for detained immigrants and immigration and customs enforcement  which some had campaigned to abolish im trying to maintain an open mind  but i need details  said representative veronica escobar  a freshman democrat whose district includes most of el paso the barriers are going to be an issue  she added  noting that she would prefer no funding for the department of homeland security until it is audited at least one legislator  representative juan vargas  democrat of california  said he would vote against the bill  criticizing the inclusion of new steel post fencing i think most people just want to get this thing over with  he said  im not one of those people for some democrats  the biggest issue is detention slots under the control of the trump administration  the agreement authorizes the department of homeland security to fund about 40 000 beds for detainees  many of them in centers run by for profit companies and ice near the border in texas  arizona and california house democratic aides described the language as a glide path from the current level of 49 000 detention beds to obama era levels of 35 000 or fewer but a summary of the provisions drafted by senate republican staff members placed the average number of beds funded under the deal at a much higher number  45 274  including 2 500 for families  and that could rise to as many as 58 500 beds  republican aides asserted in internal communications  because federal cabinet departments have latitude in how they use funds representative pramila jayapal  democrat of washington and a leader of the congressional progressive caucus  said she was likely to vote no on the measure because of what she believed was a lack of accountability around the detention system weve reduced that number over the next nine months  but the average daily population that were appropriating is still too high  she said  unless we have a guarantee from the administration that theyre actually going to listen to what congress does and our appropriated amounts  we still have a president using every tool at his disposal but the lawmakers who said they were inclined to vote against the measure were not actively seeking support for their position under the complex funding formula in the agreement  the department of homeland security would also have reprogramming authority to transfer as much as  750 million from other programs to detention slots democrats have argued that with a new house majority  they can provide harsher oversight than their republican predecessors and push back on that maneuvering within the department and other federal agencies were intent on making sure that this process reflects the congressional intent of where they should be on barriers  on beds  on all these issues that matter to us  said representative pete aguilar  democrat of california and one of the negotiators .
president trump wants  5 7 billion to build a wall at the southern border of the united states  nancy pelosi thinks a wall is immoral  the fight over these slats or barriers or bricks shut down the government for more than a month and may do so again if mr  trump isnt satisfied with the way negotiations unfold over the next three weeks but lets be clear  this is a disagreement about symbolism  not policy  liberals object less to aggressive border security than to the walls xenophobic imagery  while the administration openly revels in its political incorrectness  and when this particular episode is over  well still have been fighting about the wrong thing  its true that immigrants will keep trying to cross into the united states and that global migration will almost certainly increase in the coming years as climate change makes parts of the planet uninhabitable  but technology and globalization are complicating the idea of what a border is and where it stands not long from now  it wont make sense to think of the border as a line  a wall or even any kind of imposing vertical structure  tearing down  or refusing to fund  border walls wont get anyone very far in the broader pursuit of global justice  the borders of the future wont be as easy to spot  build or demolish as the wall that mr  trump is proposing  thats because they arent just going up around countries  theyre going up around us  and theyre taking away our freedom in the jungle  a play about a refugee camp in calais  france  a kurdish smuggler named ali explains that his profession is not responsible for the large numbers of migrants making the dangerous journeys to europe by sea  once  i was the only way a man could ever dream of arriving on your shore  the smuggler says  but today  migrants can plan out the journeys using their phones  it is not about this border  its the border in here  ali says  pointing to his head  and that is gone  now president trump is obsessed with his border wall because technology has freed us from the walls in our heads for people with means and passports  its easy to plot exotic itineraries in a flash and book flights with just a glance at a screen  social feeds are an endless stream of old faces in new places  a carefree colleague feeding elephants in thailand  a smug college classmate on a babymoon in tahiti  that awful ex hanging off a cliff in switzerland  a friends parents enjoying retirement in new zealand likewise  a young person in sana  yemen  or guatemala city might see a sister in toronto  a neighbor in phoenix  an aunt in london or a teacher in berlin  and think that he  too  could start anew  foreign places are real  another country is possible if you zoom out enough in google earth  youll see the lines between nations begin to disappear  eventually  youll be left staring at a unified blue planet  you might even experience a hint of what astronauts have called the overview effect  the sense that we are all on spaceship earth  together  from space i saw earth  indescribably beautiful with the scars of national boundaries gone  recalled muhammed faris  a syrian astronaut  after his 1987 mission to space  in 2012  mr  faris fled war torn syria for turkey ones freedom of movement used to be largely determined by ones citizenship  national origin and finances  thats still the case  but increasingly  people are being categorized not just by the color of their passports or their ability to pay for tickets but also by where theyve been and what theyve said in the past this is what is happening on that front already a 2017 executive order barred people from seven countries  including five with muslim majorities  from entering the country  an older rule put in place during the obama administration compelled anyone whod even just visited seven blacklisted nations to obtain additional clearance before traveling to the united states  even as the trump administrations policy has met with legal challenges  it means that the barrier to entering the united states  for many  begins with their data and passport stamps  and is thousands of miles away from this country  the trump administration would also like to make it harder for immigrants whove received public assistance to obtain citizenship or permanent residence by redefining what it means to be a public charge  if the administration succeeds  it will have moved the border into immigrants living rooms  schools and hospital beds the walls of the future go beyond one administrations policies  though  they are growing up all around us  being built by global technology companies that allow for constant surveillance  data harvesting and the alarming collection of biometric information  in 2017  the united states announced it would be storing the social media profiles of immigrants in their permanent file  ostensibly to prevent twitter happy terrorists from slipping in  for years  customs and border protection agents have asked travelers about their social media  too the electronic frontier foundation has said these practices can chill and deter the free speech and association of immigrants to the united states  as well as the u s  persons who communicate with them  in other words  its no longer enough to have been born in the right place  at the right time  to the right parents  the trail of bread crumbs you leave could limit your movements its possible to get a glimpse of where a digital border might lead from china  look at its continuing experiment with social credit scoring  where a slip of the tongue or an unpaid debt could one day jeopardize someones ability to board a train or apply for a job  when your keystrokes and text messages become embedded in your legal identity  you create a wall around yourself without meaning to the berkeley political theorist wendy brown diagnoses the tendency to throw up walls as a classic symptom of a nation states looming impotence in the face of globalization  the flashy sports car of what she calls a waning sovereignty  in a recent interview for the nation  professor brown told me that walls fulfill a desire for greater sovereign control in times when the concept of bounded territory itself is in crisis  they are signifiers of a loss of a national we and national control  all the things weve seen erupt in a huge way  walls are a response to deep existential anxiety  and even if the walls come down  or fail to be built in brick and stone  the world will guarantee us little in the way of freedom  fairness or equality  it makes more sense to think of modern borders as overlapping and concentric circles that change size  shape and texture depending on who  or what  is trying to pass through its far too easy to imagine a situation where our freedom of movement still depends entirely on what has happened to us in the past and what kind of information were willing to give up in return  consider the expedited screening process of the global entry program for traveling to the united states  its a shortcut  reserved for people who can get it  that doesnt do away with borders  it just makes them easier to cross  and therefore less visible that serves the modern nation state very well  because in the end  what are borders supposed to protect us from  the answer used to be other states  empires or sovereigns  but today  relatively few land borders exist to physically fend off a neighboring power  and countries even cooperate to police the borders they share  modern borders exist to control something else  the movement of people  they control us those are the walls we should be fighting over .
washington  the house voted on tuesday to overturn president trumps declaration of a national emergency on the mexican border  with just 13 republicans joining democrats to try to block his effort to divert funding to a border wall without congressional approval house republican leaders kept defections low after feverishly working to assuage concerns among rank and file members about protecting congressional powers and about the precedent that mr  trump could be setting for democratic presidents to use for their own purposes is your oath of office to donald trump or is it to the constitution of the united states  speaker nancy pelosi asked her republican colleagues in a speech on the floor ahead of the vote  you cannot let him undermine your pledge to the constitution the resolution of disapproval  which passed 245 to 182  must now be taken up by the senate  where three republicans have already declared their support  only one short of the number needed for congress to ratify a stinging rebuke of mr  trumps efforts it remains highly unlikely that opponents will muster the votes to overturn a promised veto of the resolution  but final passage of a measure to assert congresss constitutional authority over spending is sure to bolster numerous lawsuits that maintain that mr  trumps declaration is an unconstitutional end run around congresss lawful power of the purse many of the 13 republicans who defected in the house were adamant in their arguments  representative jim sensenbrenner of wisconsin  a veteran lawmaker who once helped manage republican efforts to remove bill clinton from the white house  made it clear he supported the border wall but  he said  insufficient action  however frustrating it may be  is still the prerogative of the legislative branch  it is imperative that no administration  republican or democratic  circumvent the will of congress in the senate  where lawmakers are required to vote on the resolution in the coming weeks  those concerns persisted  even senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader and an open supporter of the declaration  declined to offer his opinion on the legal merits were in the process of weighing that  mr  mcconnell said when asked at a news conference on tuesday  i havent reached a total conclusion you cant blame the president for trying to use whatever tool he thinks he has to address it  he added  read the latest edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  but ahead of the senate vote  lawmakers have not said what their next steps would be if the resolution to stop the emergency declaration fails three republican senators  susan collins of maine  thom tillis of north carolina and lisa murkowski of alaska  have said that they will support the resolution  and several others have expressed extreme unease  vice president mike pence and a justice department lawyer joined republican senators on tuesday for a lunch on capitol hill to outline what they maintained was the presidents statutory authority for the declaration and need for additional money mr  pence faced some frustration from senators about mr  trumps decision to make the declaration and the legal grounds for doing so  particularly from senator rand paul  republican of kentucky  according to three people familiar with the exchange who asked for anonymity to describe a private meeting when mr  paul argued that mr  pence  a former representative  would have opposed mr  trumps use of an emergency declaration and compared it to president barack obamas use of an executive order to establish protections for young undocumented immigrants under the deferred action for childhood arrivals program  mr  pence objected  according to one person  he argued that there was a difference between the two uses of executive power  according to two people a spokesman for mr  paul said that the senator had raised concerns  along with other senators  about the declaration in an exchange  but did not raise the comparison to daca mr  mcconnell acknowledged that there had been a fulsome discussion during the meeting  and senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina and a close ally of the president  said he hoped that as a result of the discussion  we will prevail but some senators emerged from the lunch still reluctant to say how they would vote any action by the administration must comply with federal law  so i am reviewing and assessing the specific legal authorities and justifications put forth by the administration  said senator ted cruz  republican of texas  i am very worried about the slippery slope that could occur some republican lawmakers and aides said they were unconcerned because they were confident that they could prevent the two thirds majority needed in both chambers to override a presidential veto  possibly the first delivered by mr  trump there will be nowhere near the votes to override a veto  representative steve scalise of louisiana  the republican whip  said tuesday morning at a news conference  ultimately  were going to stand with the president in making sure we can secure this border the resolution of disapproval  under the national emergencies act of 1976  serves as the easiest mechanism for congress to end mr  trumps declaration  house democrats are still weighing the possibility of joining one of the lawsuits that have been filed to challenge the merits of the declaration democrats  who overwhelmingly endorsed the resolution of disapproval  framed the vote as an ultimatum on whether lawmakers would buck party loyalty in order to protect congresss constitutionally granted powers  ms  pelosi  in a floor speech on tuesday  listed a number of instances in which house republicans had objected to mr  obamas use of executive power  vowing that we are not going to give any president  democratic or republican  a blank check to shred the constitution of the united states representative joaquin castro called the vote on the one page resolution the most important vote  probably in a generation  on the separation of powers mr  castro  democrat of texas and the author of the resolution  warned republicans that if the presidents declaration went unchallenged  the issue would resurface if congress lets this stand  if the courts let it stand  how am i to tell a future president that gun deaths that number in the tens of thousands every year in this country  or opioid deaths that number in the thousands in this country  are not an emergency  mr  castro said in a brief interview  or climate change is not a national emergency if this becomes a short circuit to get other things done  he added  then how is a president not expected to use that tool in the future the debate over the merits of mr  trumps national emergency declaration has led some lawmakers to suggest that congress should re evaluate how much power it has shifted to the executive branch and the scope of the national emergencies act the larger issue is congress has delegated its authority to the white house in hundreds of instances  said senator john cornyn  republican of texas  i think we need to have a bigger conversation about the separation of powers and whether we want to continue to delegate all this authority to the next president overruling concerns from other republicans  mr  trump this month outlined his intent to use  3 6 billion from military construction projects to build his promised wall along the southwestern border  in the lunch with mr  pence and the justice department lawyer  republican senators secured a promise that they would be notified about details of which military construction projects would be affected before they voted on the resolution  according to two people familiar with the discussion mr  pence also assured senators that any money diverted from projects would most likely be replaced in the next years funding allocation  according to one person familiar with the discussion  while senator richard c  shelby of alabama  the chairman of the senate appropriations committee  later told reporters that he was confident that effort would be successful  democratic appropriators would most likely object house democrats also pressed the defense department on tuesday to release those details to congress we fear that reprogramming funding intended for military construction projects and counterdrug activities will come at the expense of troop readiness and departmentwide efforts to address the militarys aging infrastructure  wrote representatives john garamendi  democrat of california  and doug lamborn  republican of colorado  both members of the house armed services committee members of the house appropriations committee will hold a hearing on wednesday to examine the effect of the declaration on military construction and readiness  and members of the house judiciary committee will hold a hearing on thursday in part to examine mr  trumps use of powers under the national emergencies act the congress of the united states needs to have a spine  and not lay at the feet of the president  said representative steny h  hoyer of maryland  the majority leader  thats not what the people elected us to do .
washington  president donald trump vetoed a resolution passed by congress to end u s  military assistance in saudi arabia s war in yemen the veto  the second in trump s presidency  was expected  and congress lacks the votes to override it  but passing the never before used war powers resolution was viewed as a milestone for lawmakers  who have shown a renewed willingness to assert their war making authority after letting it atrophy for decades under presidents from both parties  this resolution is an unnecessary  dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities  endangering the lives of american citizens and brave service members  both today and in the future   trump wrote in explaining his tuesday veto congress has grown uneasy with trump s close relationship with saudi arabia as he tries to further isolate iran  a regional rival many lawmakers also criticized the president for not condemning saudi arabia for the killing of jamal khashoggi  a saudi who lived in the united states and had written critically about the kingdom  khashoggi went into the saudi consulate in istanbul last october and never came out  intelligence agencies said saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman was complicit in the killing the u s  provides billions of dollars of arms to the saudi led coalition fighting against iran backed rebels in yemen  members of congress have expressed concern about the thousands of civilians killed in coalition airstrikes since the conflict began in 2014  the fighting in the arab world s poorest country also has left millions suffering from food and medical care shortages and has pushed the country to the brink of famine trump said the measure was unnecessary because except for counterterrorism operations against islamic state militants and al qaida in the arabian peninsula  the united states is not engaged in hostilities in or affecting yemen he said there were no u s  military personnel in yemen accompanying the saudi led coalition fighting iran backed houthis  although he acknowledged that the u s  has provided limited support to the coalition  including intelligence sharing  logistics support  and  until recently  in flight refueling of non u s  aircraft the president also said that the measure would harm bilateral relations and interferes with his constitutional power as commander in chief he said the u s  is providing the support to protect the safety of more than 80 000 americans who live in certain areas of the coalition countries subject to houthi attacks from yemen  houthis  supported by iran  have used missiles  armed drones and explosive boats to attack civilian and military targets in those coalition countries  including areas frequented by american citizens  such as the airport in riyadh  saudi arabia   trump said   in addition  the conflict in yemen represents a  cheap  and inexpensive way for iran to cause trouble for the united states and for our ally  saudi arabia  house approval of the resolution came earlier this month on a 247 175 vote  the senate vote last month was 54 46 house speaker nancy pelosi issued a statement tuesday night saying   the conflict in yemen is a horrific humanitarian crisis that challenges the conscience of the entire world  yet the president has cynically chosen to contravene a bipartisan  bicameral vote of the congress and perpetuate america s shameful involvement in this heartbreaking crisis  pelosi added   this conflict must end  now  the house of representatives calls on the president to put peace before politics  and work with us to advance an enduring solution to end this crisis and save lives  sen  tim kaine  d va   said trump s veto  shows the world he is determined to keep aiding a saudi backed war that has killed thousands of civilians and pushed millions more to the brink of starvation  kaine accused trump of turning a blind eye to khashoggi s killing and the jailing of women s rights activists in saudi arabia  i hope my colleagues will show we won t tolerate the trump administration s deference to saudi arabia at the expense of american security interests by voting to override this veto   kaine said the top republican on the house foreign affairs committee  rep  michael mccaul of texas  acknowledged the dire situation in yemen for civilians  but spoke out in opposition to the measure when it was passed  mccaul said it was an abuse of the war powers resolution and predicted it could disrupt u s  security cooperation agreements with more than 100 countries david miliband  president of the international rescue committee  a humanitarian aid group  said   this veto by president trump is morally wrong and strategically wrongheaded  it sets back the hopes for respite for the yemeni people  and leaves the u s  upholding a failed strategy  trump issued his first veto last month on legislation related to immigration  trump had declared a national emergency so he could use more money to construct a border wall  congress voted to block the emergency declaration and trump vetoed that measure .
twenty two days into the longest government shutdown ever  president trump continued to press his case for a border wall  his tweet on saturday was crammed with statistics that were either exaggerated or omitted important context  immigrant prison populationmr  trumps figure for the percentage of unauthorized immigrants in federal prisons is exaggerated out of the bureau of prisons total inmate population of 183 058 in the first quarter of the 2018 fiscal year  21 percent were immigrants  both legal and undocumented  according to a government report  at least 13 percent of the total population  or 23 826 inmates  were in the country unlawfully  the immigration status of another 11 698 inmates was under investigation  while 2 608 inmates were lawful immigrants or had received relief from deportation the most common crimes committed by these immigrants were drug related offenses  46 percent  and immigration offenses  29 percent   its worth noting  too  that about half of the arrests made by the federal government are for immigration related offenses  perhaps explaining the high proportion of immigrants in federal prisons  the report acknowledges that it does not include data from state and local prisons  which house 90 percent of all inmates in the united states border arrestsmr  trump did not give a time frame for his 240 percent figure  nor did he specify what the number referred to  which may give the misleading impression that border crossings overall have increased threefold  the figure instead refers to a surge in families attempting to cross at the southwest border  the number of family units apprehended at the border more than tripled from 8 120 in december 2017 to 27 518 in december 2018  overwhelming immigration officials and creating a new humanitarian crisis overall  illegal border crossings have been declining for nearly two decades  and in the 2017 fiscal year  border crossing apprehensions were at their lowest point since 1971  in the 2018 fiscal year  however  annual apprehensions did increase by 30 percent from the previous fiscal year immigrant criminals in texasmr  trumps figures are accurate  but they need context  the texas department of public safety did report that the 186 000 unauthorized immigrants booked into local jails from 2011 to 2018 faced 292 000 charges the caveats  these offenses did not necessarily occur during that eight year time frame  more than half of these charges were uncategorized  and the charges mr  trump singled out did not always result in convictions  238 for homicide  13 559 for assault  1 689 for sexual assault and 1 280 for weapons  for comparison  data from the texas department of public safety shows that some 7 5 million arrests were made from 2010 to 2017  data for 2018 was not yet available   including 6 161 for murder  177 000 for aggravated assault  14 000 for rape and nearly 89 000 for weapons charges  a 2018 study from the libertarian cato institute found that in texas  conviction and arrest rates for illegal immigrants were lower than those for native born americans for most crimes .
this editorial was updated with his declaration of a national emergency at the southern border  president trump takes executive overreach to dizzying new heights  the damage to american democracy threatens to linger long after his administration is no more than a dank memory cornered into accepting a budget deal that lacked the  5 7 billion in border wall funding he demanded  the president could not handle being labeled a loser by conservative commentators like laura ingraham and sean hannity  his solution  sign the bill while simultaneously declaring a national emergency that  at least in his mind  would allow him to shift funds and order the military to start building his wall sarah huckabee sanders  the white house press secretary  announced the move on thursday afternoon  president trump will sign the government funding bill  and as he has stated before  he will also take other executive action  including a national emergency  to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border  she said  to repeat  the influx of migrant families at the southern border does not constitute a national security crisis  much less a bona fide emergency  there is  at this point  a worsening humanitarian crisis  actively fueled by the draconian policies of the administration  but the suffering on display requires thoughtful policy adjustments  not a steel monstrosity not that this is the end of this battle  mr  trumps emergency declaration is destined to wind up in the courts  where it could get bogged down indefinitely  this fit of presidential pique is about more than a wall  it constitutes a reordering of the power dynamic between the branches of government  mr  trump aims to usurp one of congresss most basic responsibilities  the power of the purse confronted with this power grab  every lawmaker should be bellowing in alarm  until recently  the threat of an imperial presidency was of grave constitutional concern to republicans  who spent much of president barack obamas tenure accusing him of misusing executive authority on  among other matters  immigration  health care and the environment to their credit  a few republican lawmakers have been warning against an emergency declaration for weeks  i believe the president does have the legal authority  if you read the statute  i also think it would be a poor use of that authority  representative david schweikert  a member of the conservative house freedom caucus  told politico in january senator marco rubio was more emphatic  if today the national emergency is border security  tomorrow the national emergency might be climate change the reaction of the house speaker  nancy pelosi  to mr  trumps intentions will do nothing to calm republican jitters  just think of what a president with different values can present to the american people  she observed  the poison cherry atop this sundae is that mr  trump is subverting american democracy for a cause opposed by a majority of the public  polls show that most americans do not want a wall at the southern border  and most definitely do not approve of mr  trumps faking a national emergency to make an end run around congress  two recent polls showed that two thirds of americans opposed it not that any of this seems of interest to the president  i have the absolute right to do national emergency if i want  he insisted to reporters last month  sounding more like a huffy kindergartner than a world leader this administration is forever coming up with creative new ways to disturb and dismay the nation  mr  trumps eagerness to undermine the constitution to serve his short term political gain remains among the most outrageous .

san antonio  donald j  trump got brenda hernandezs hopes up in 2016 when he indicated that he had a heart for young undocumented immigrants like her  who were brought into the country by their parents  but her hopes were dashed when mr  trump became president and ordered an end to the federal program known as daca that shields her from deportation after the presidents latest announcement on saturday  that he was proposing to end the standoff over the partial government shutdown by  among other things  temporarily extending that shield  ms  hernandez just shrugged i dont trust trump  i dont believe him  she said as she hoisted her 3 year old son onto a swivel chair at the d   h beauty salon in san antonio  the blue collar shop  with rows of wooden chairs in the waiting area  is a favorite among immigrants in the city  but in the hours after mr  trumps white house address  his latest offer of an immigration deal was finding little support  read  in trumps immigration announcement  a compromise snubbed all around in exchange for  5 7 billion to erect a barrier along the border with mexico  mr  trump said he would agree to extend protection for three years for the roughly 800 000 immigrants who benefit from the deferred action for childhood arrivals program  which covers people brought into the country illegally as children  the president held out the hope of similar relief for 300 000 immigrants living in the united states with temporary protected status  known as t p s   after fleeing earthquakes and other disasters in their own countries i am here today to break the logjam and provide congress with a path forward to end the government shutdown and solve the crisis along the southern border  mr  trump said  calling his offer a common sense compromise both parties can embrace but many of the clients waiting their turn for a  6 haircut or shave at the d   h salon  in a strip mall in the northern part of the city  greeted mr  trumps announcement with skepticism  if not downright indifference  most expressed deep reservations about a border wall  deeming it a waste of money eliseo castillo  60  an undocumented immigrant from mexico  said an extension of dacas protections from deportation  and its offer of work permits  could benefit his 26 year old son  he said his son had relied on the program for years to get a drivers license and a job and to live without the fear that even a minor misstep  like driving with a broken taillight  could land him in deportation proceedings but mr  castillo  a construction contractor who relies on a steady flow of workers from latin america  said he wondered what would happen to his business if a reinforced border wall halted the flow of workers  he said he is already having trouble hiring enough laborers the fact is  there is not an american who wants to mix cement  do carpentry and heavy work  said mr  castillo  who employs 18 people to lay down foundations for houses in san antonios expansive subdivisions mr  castillo  who wears cowboy boots and bluejeans and keeps his silver hair in a braid  has called texas home since the 1980s  but he harbors no illusions about legalizing his status  at least as long as mr  trump holds the highest office in the land waiting his turn for a haircut in paint splattered trousers that gave away how he earns his living  jose ramos  63  a naturalized american born in mexico  said he had no faith that mr  trump  whose favorite sport is blaming immigrants for everything  which is not right  would ever keep his word this isnt a deal  mr  ramos said  trump is just offering to give back what he already took away democrats in washington have criticized the president for offering to extend daca and t p s  protections  when it was he who had ordered those protections revoked  some have called the offer a nonstarter because it did not include any long term solutions  like a path to permanent legal status or citizenship for daca recipients  who are known as dreamers but many people in san antonio never had much faith that such solutions were even possible with mr  trump as president indeed  some in the city wonder how much the president knows about the border speaking with reporters on saturday  mr  trump cited the city as a place that had benefited from building a border barrier  you look at san antonio  you look at so many different places  they go from one of the most unsafe cities in the country to one of the safest cities  immediately  immediately  he said but san antonio is 150 miles from the border  and has no wall alicia alaniz  47  the stylist working at station 7 in the salon  rolled her eyes and said that the only thing she could agree with in mr  trumps statement was the notion that the immigration system was broken we need immigration reform  it would benefit the country and everyone who lives here  said ms  alaniz  a legal permanent resident who emigrated from mexico  people just want to work the right way  and support this country that has brought them many blessings president obama introduced daca in june 2012 as a temporary reprieve for young unauthorized immigrants  at a time when congress was in a stalemate over immigration policy  to qualify for daca protection  immigrants must have lived in the united states for much of their lives and meet certain other requirements  like passing a background check and completing high school on the campaign trail  mr  trump vowed to eliminate any program that mr  obama had created by executive action  including daca  a stance that generated deep anxiety among the dreamers but in december 2016  shortly after winning election  mr  trump softened his position were going to work something out thats going to make people happy and proud  he told time magazine  they got brought here at a very young age  theyve worked here  theyve gone to school here  some were good students  some have wonderful jobs  and theyre in never never land because they dont know whats going to happen once in office  however  mr  trump appointed one of the fiercest opponents of the daca program  senator jeff sessions of alabama  as his attorney general  mr  sessions rescinded daca in september 2017  but the action was challenged in court and has yet to take full effect  while the courts decide the programs fate without work permits provided under the program  young immigrants would face cascading  and possibly dire  consequences  they would lose their jobs  drivers licenses and the chance to attend college at in state tuition rates friday was the last day the supreme court could accept an appeal and schedule any arguments on the daca litigation in its current session  and the court let the day pass without addressing the trump administrations bid to kill the program  that ensures that daca will survive at least until the courts next session  which begins in october when the administration made its bid to end the program  i worried about what i would do  i was so sad  said ms  hernandez  who works these days for a casual dining chain known as zoes kitchen  but with the issue tied up in the courts  she said she has simply had to get on with her life  now  i dont even think about it  she said her daca permit expires in a year .

update  steve king was removed from his committee assignments over the comments made in this article  years before president trump forced a government shutdown over a border wall  triggering a momentous test of wills in washington  representative steve king of iowa took to the house floor to show off a model of a 12 foot border wall he had designed and long before mr  trump demonized immigrants  accusing mexico of exporting criminals and calling for an end to birthright citizenship  mr  king turned those views into talking points  with his use of misleading data about victims of undocumented immigrants and demeaning remarks about latinos immigration is mr  trumps go to issue  his surest connection to his most faithful supporters  and his prime time address on tuesday night underscored his willingness to use fear and misleading statements  to appeal to voters  just as he did with warnings about a migrant caravan before the midterm elections the republican party hadnt always intended to go this route  officials tried for years to come up with broad based immigration reform that would appeal to growing numbers of latino voters  but mr  trumps preoccupation with the wall and anti immigrant politics reflects how he has embraced the once fringe views of mr  king  who has used racist language in the past  promotes neo nazis on twitter and was recently denounced by one republican leader as a white supremacist with the federal government in a third week of paralysis over a border wall  mr  trumps positions are a reminder of how mr  kings ideology and his language maligning undocumented residents helped shape the republican message in 2016 and 2018 and define mr  trumps agenda and prospects for re election  mr  king may have been ostracized by some republicans over his racist remarks and extremist ties  but as much of the nation debates immigration  his views now carry substantial influence on the right early in mr  trumps term  the president invited mr  king  who was long snubbed by establishment republicans like the former house speaker john a  boehner  to the oval office  there  the president boasted of having raised more money for the congressmans campaigns than anyone else  including during a 2014 iowa visit  mr  king recalled in an interview with the times yes  mr  president  mr  king replied  but i market tested your immigration policy for 14 years  and that ought to be worth something mr  king  a 69 year old former bulldozer operator with a combative manner  who has been elected nine times  helped write the book on white identity politics that are ascendant in mr  trumps republican party  that provides both a template for mr  trump and a warning mr  kings full throated embrace of nativism has long found a supportive constituency in the rural midwest  the region that was a key to mr  trumps 2016 victory and represents his most likely path to re election but at the same time  mr  kings margin of victory in 2018 shrank to its narrowest in 16 years  he made national headlines for endorsing a toronto mayoral candidate with neo nazi ties and for meeting with a far right austrian party accused of trivializing the holocaust  on twitter  he follows an australian anti semitic activist  who proposed hanging a portrait of hitler in every classroom  and in october  the chairman of the republican house elections committee  representative steve stivers of ohio  condemned mr  king  saying  we must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms  mr  king lost corporate agriculture donors like purina  land olakes and smithfield  he dropped from an 18 point lead over his democratic opponent in his internal polls to barely squeaking out a three point win on election day  on wednesday  mr  king drew a formidable challenger for his fourth district seat in the 2020 republican primary  randy feenstra  an assistant majority leader in the state senate  who said mr  king had left iowa without a seat at the table because of sideshows and distractions mr  king  in the interview  said he was not a racist  he pointed to his twitter timeline showing him greeting iowans of all races and religions in his washington office   the same office once displayed a confederate flag on his desk  at the same time  he said  he supports immigrants who enter the country legally and fully assimilate because what matters more than race is the culture of america based on values brought to the united states by whites from europe white nationalist  white supremacist  western civilization  how did that language become offensive  mr  king said  why did i sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization after this article was published thursday  mr  king issued a public statement calling himself a nationalist and defending his support of western civilizations values  and said he was not an advocate for white nationalism and white supremacy  i want to make one thing abundantly clear  i reject those labels and the evil ideology they define  he wrote mr  kings influence over national politics derives from his representation of the reddest district in the first presidential nominating state  nearly all the 2016 republican presidential contenders sought his blessing at a forum he hosted in des moines in january 2015  mr  trump included donald trump came to iowa as a real nonideological candidate  mr  king recalled  mr  trumps first hire in iowa  chuck laudner  was a former chief of staff to mr  king  mr  trumps first iowa rally directly followed a visit to the mexican border the previous year  mr  trump had visited to endorse mr  kings re election  as the congressman warned of scenarios like islamic state terrorists or even africans with ebola illegally entering the country  mr  trump listened and nodded  when he stepped to the microphone  he echoed mr  king well  border security is a very big issue  he said  people are just flooding across tom tancredo  a former colorado congressman who once held the most conservative views in official washington on immigration  calling for a moratorium on even legal immigrants  said he handed the baton to steve king when he left the house in 2008 david johnson  a former republican state senator from mr  kings district  said he heard in the presidents rhetoric a direct echo of mr  king  they belong to the same subset of white nationalists who are afraid of how the country is changing  he said mr  king was born in storm lake  iowa  and attended high school in nearby denison  then a nearly all white rural farming region  where his father managed a state police radio station after founding an earth moving company  mr  king ran successfully for the state senate in 1996  his most notable legacy from six years in the legislature was a law making english the official state language  it was a time when packinghouses and other agricultural employers had dropped wages  and latino migrants increasingly were taking jobs that no longer attracted native born iowans elected to congress in 2002  mr  king attracted the attention of hate watch groups like the anti defamation league as he spoke increasingly about preserving western culture or western civilization  the groups consider those buzzwords that signal support to white nationalists  along with an obsession with birthrates and abortion rates among different ethnic groups he uses the concepts of either culture or civilization to obfuscate that hes talking about whiteness and race  said lawrence rosenthal  chairman of the berkeley center for right wing studies in 2011  mr  king objected to the affordable care acts mandate to cover contraception  thats not constructive to our culture and our civilization  he said in a speech in the house  if we let our birthrate get down below the replacement rate  were a dying civilization mr  king seems further emboldened during the trump presidency in an interview in august with a far right web publication in austria  mr  king displayed a deep familiarity with racist tracts and ideas embraced by white supremacists he spoke of the great replacement  a conspiracy theory on the far right that claims shadowy elites are working behind the scenes to reduce white populations to minorities in their own countries great replacement  yes  mr  king said in the interview  these people walking into europe by ethnic migration  80 percent are young men the accusation that a great replacement of whites is underway  which conspiracy theorists often link to prominent jews like george soros  animated the torch carrying white nationalists in charlottesville  va   in 2017  who chanted  you will not replace us and jews will not replace us mr  trumps refusal to condemn the marchers  and his insistence that there were very fine people on both sides  was cheered by neo nazi websites in mr  kings interview with the austrian website  he repeated his yearslong critique of multiculturalism what does this diversity bring that we dont already have  mexican food  chinese food  he said  those things  well  thats fine  but what does it bring that we dont have that is worth the price in recent years  mr  king has forged alliances with far right european leaders  including marine le pen of france and geert wilders of the netherlands  one of the most anti muslim politicians in europe  who calls for closing mosques ahead of dutch elections in march 2017  mr  king endorsed mr  wilders in a tweet  saying  we cant restore our civilization with somebody elses babies amid an ensuing controversy  he claimed the tweet wasnt about race  virulent white supremacists  however  heard otherwise steve king is basically an open white nationalist at this point  wrote andrew anglin  the founder of the neo nazi daily stormer mr  anglin and others celebrated that mr  trumps election had made once fringe beliefs about ethnonationalism acceptable to mainstream politicians as republicans have morphed from the party of george w  bush  who sought legal status for 12 million undocumented immigrants  to the party of mr  trump and mr  king  some party leaders fear for the future in a nation where hispanic voters are a rapidly growing electorate great damage has been done  said carlos curbelo  a moderate republican who lost a south florida congressional seat in the midterms  for anyone who cares about having a small government  free enterprise party in america that can aspire to win national elections  its a real concern mr  curbelo  who tried to forge compromise on immigration in the house last year  said mr  trump told him privately  including on air force one  that he wanted a deal with democrats but the president is paralyzed by the far right  mr  curbelo said  hes terrified of losing his base and the so called conservative media last week  as the new congress was sworn in  mr  king sat on his side of a chamber sharply delineated by demographics  the democratic majority included record numbers of african americans and women  including the first native american and the first muslim women  mr  kings side was mostly people who look like him you could look over there and think the democratic party is no country for white men  he said .
as president trump continues his mad purge of the department of homeland security  a sinister figure is emerging as the driving force behind all the chaos  stephen miller  the presidents top immigration adviser a fierce restrictionist  mr  miller seems to have rarely met an immigrant he didnt want to deport  he is among the hardest of hard liners  known for spurring his boss to pursue ever more draconian measures not that mr  trump needs much encouragement  he did  after all  ascend to the white house on an immigrant bashing  ethnonationalist platform as dishonest as it was divisive  many of the administrations uglier policy ideas have been a result of mr  trumps failure to deliver on his signature campaign promise of a big  beautiful border wall  small wonder mr  miller has emerged as his favorite consigliere on such matters  mr  millers preferred approach to immigration and border security is straight out of ann coulters fever dreams  he was a chief architect of the travel ban on citizens from muslim majority countries  he favors the building of tent cities at the border for warehousing asylum seekers  hes agitating to end the 20 day limit on detaining migrant children  and he wants to reinstate the practice of snatching migrant children from their families  though this time hed like to give parents a binary choice of having their kids taken from them or held with them in detention indefinitely mr  miller is being credited with the blood bath at the department of homeland security  since friday  a handful of top leaders have been  or are soon to be  shown the door  including the head of the secret service  the acting director of immigration and customs enforcement and secretary kirstjen nielsen  who was never quite ruthless enough for the presidents or mr  millers taste  more firings are expected as mr  miller moves to remake the department in his image bottom line  stephen miller is a man whose anti immigration zeal remains unfettered by concern for the law  international norms or basic humanity and yet  the portrait of the 33 year old policy adviser as a figure of singular evil is both overly simplistic and counterproductive  sure  the guy is a force for darkness  easing the president ever further into nativism  but no matter how much of the administrations immigration agenda mr  miller has been responsible for  its taken a village to make that vision a reality  giving too much credit to any one person builds up mr  miller  undeservedly  as a machiavellian genius and lets many other folks off the hook a society does not fall because of a small coterie of bad actors  widespread rot requires legions of enablers  many of whom are driven by varying blends of personal ambition  ideological expedience and the self aggrandizing delusion that  through their invaluable counsel  they can save the state from total destruction expect increasingly to hear this last rationalization from former administration officials starting redemption tours as they resume life outside the trump bubble advisers like kellyanne conway  lawmakers like senator lindsey graham and the former house speaker paul ryan  party apparatchiks like the republican national committee chairwoman ronna romney mcdaniel and a whole host of trump friendly media personalities may not personally share the presidents views or policy aims  but their willingness to swallow some of the administrations cruelest acts renders them complicit  neither their reputations nor their consciences should be wiped clean take ms  nielsen  since her departure was announced  shes enjoyed some sympathy for having behaved less viciously than some in the white house desired  throughout her tenure  stories bubbled up about how she incurred mr  trumps wrath by dragging her feet on policies that would have run afoul of the law or thrown the nation into chaos  but she still carried out and aggressively enforced her share of atrocities now  defenders are portraying the woman who was in charge of caging migrant children as a hapless victim of the administrations more unhinged forces the so called immigration hard liners have flailed about since the beginning of the administration  giving bad advice to the president and misdirecting resources toward the wrong solutions to the wrong problems  thad bingel  a homeland security official under president george w  bush and former aide to ms  nielsen  told the times  they apparently dont want anyone like a secretary nielsen or secretary kelly  who deals in reality  to tell them or the president any of this no doubt  ms  nielsen had a difficult  perhaps impossible  job  but it was no profile in courage for her to cling to her morally untenable position until mr  trump gave her a shove its tempting to see stephen miller as the archvillain of the trump administrations immigration policies  but there is much guilt to go around  and even reluctant collaborators cannot be allowed to absolve themselves of responsibility for the administrations continuing outrages .

president trump delivered an address to the nation on tuesday night from the oval office to make a broad based public push for border wall funding after his speech  speaker nancy pelosi of california and senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leaders  delivered a response from capitol hill  read our live analysis and fact checks of the remarks here  the following are transcripts of both mr  trumps speech and the democratic rebuttal  as prepared by the new york times           president trump  my fellow americans  tonight im speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border every day  customs and border protection agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country  we are out of space to hold them  and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country  america proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation  but all americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration it strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages  among those hardest hit are african americans and hispanic americans  our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs including meth  heroin  cocaine  and fentanyl  every week  300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone  ninety percent of which floods across from our southern border  more americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire vietnam war in the last two years  ice officers made 266 000 arrests of aliens with criminal records including those charged or convicted of 100 000 assaults  30 000 sex crimes  and 4 000 violent killings  over the years  thousands of americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we dont act right now this is a humanitarian crisis  a crisis of the heart  and a crisis of the soul  last month  20 000 migrant children were illegally brought into the united states  a dramatic increase  these children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs  one in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through mexico  women and children are the biggest victims  by far  of our broken system this is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border  this is the cycle of human suffering that i am determined to end  my administration has presented congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs  drug smugglers  and human traffickers  its a tremendous problem our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the department of homeland security  these are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep america safe  in fact  safer than ever before the proposal from homeland security includes cutting edge technology for detecting drugs  weapons  illegal contraband and many other things  we have requested more agents  immigration judges to process the sharp rise of unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support  furthermore  we have asked congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home finally  as part of an overall approach to border security  law enforcement professionals have requested  5 7 billion for a physical barrier  at the request of democrats it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall  this barrier is absolutely critical to border security  its also what our professionals at the border want and need  this is just common sense the border wall would very quickly pay for itself  the cost of illegal drugs exceeds  500 billion a year  vastly more than the  5 7 billion we have requested from congress  the wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with mexico senator chuck schumer  who you will be hearing from later tonight  has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other democrats  they changed their mind only after i was elected president democrats in congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis and they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation the federal government remains shut down for one reason  and one reason only  because democrats will not fund border security  my administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation  but the only solution is for democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government this situation could be solved in a 45 minute meeting  i have invited congressional leadership to the white house tomorrow to get this done  hopefully we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security some have suggested a barrier is immoral  then why do wealthy politicians build walls  fences  and gates around their homes  they dont build walls because they hate the people on the outside but because they love the people on the inside  the only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized americas heart broke the day after christmas when a young police officer in california was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien  just came across the border  the life of an american hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country  day after day  precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders in california  an air force veteran was raped  murdered  and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history  in georgia  an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing  beheading  and dismembering his neighbor  in maryland  ms 13 gang members who arrived in the united states as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16 year old girl over the last several years i have met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration  i have held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief stricken fathers  so sad  so terrible  i will never forget the pain in their eyes  the tremble in their voices  and the sadness gripping their souls  how much more american blood must we shed before congress does its job to those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security  i would ask  imagine if it was your child  your husband  or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken  to every member of congress  pass a bill that ends this crisis  to every citizen  call congress  and tell them to finally  after all of these decades  secure our border this is a choice between right and wrong  justice and injustice  this is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the american citizens we serve  when i took the oath of office  i swore to protect our country and that is what i will always do so help me god thank you and good night           speaker nancy pelosi  good evening i appreciate the opportunity to speak directly to the american people tonight about how we can end this shutdown and meet the needs of the american people  sadly much of what we heard from president trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice  the president has chosen fear  we want to start with the facts the fact is on the very first day of this congress  house democrats passed senate republican legislation to reopen government and fund smart  effective border security solutions  but the president is rejecting these bipartisan bills which would reopen government over his obsession with forcing american taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective wall  a wall he always promised mexico would pay for the fact is  president trump has chosen to hold hostage critical services for the health  safety  and well being of the american people  and withhold the paychecks of 800 000 innocent workers across the nation  many of them veterans he promised to keep the government shutdown for months or years  no matter whom it hurts  thats just plain wrong  the fact is  we all agree we need to secure our borders while honoring our values  we can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry  we can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation  we can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border  we can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings the fact is  the women and children at the border are not a security threat  they are a humanitarian challenge  a challenge that president trumps own cruel and counterproductive policies have only deepened  and the fact is  president trump must stop holding the american people hostage and stop manufacturing a crisis  and must reopen the government thank you  leader schumer senator chuck schumer  thank you  speaker pelosi my fellow americans  we address you tonight for one reason only  the president of the united states  having failed to get mexico to pay for his ineffective  unnecessary border wall  and unable to convince the congress or the american people to foot the bill  has shut down the government american democracy doesnt work that way  we dont govern by temper tantrum  no president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down  hurting millions of americans who are treated as leverage tonight  and throughout this debate and throughout his presidency  president trump has appealed to fear  not facts  division  not unity  make no mistake  democrats and the president both want stronger border security  however  we sharply disagree with the president about the most effective way to do it so  how do we untangle this mess  well  theres an obvious solution  separate the shutdown from arguments over border security  there is bipartisan legislation supported by democrats and republicans to reopen government while allowing debate over border security to continue there is no excuse for hurting millions of americans over a policy difference  federal workers are about to miss a paycheck  some families cant get a mortgage to buy a new home  farmers and small businesses wont get loans they desperately need most presidents have used oval office addresses for noble purposes  this president just used the backdrop of the oval office to manufacture a crisis  stoke fear  and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration my fellow americans  there is no challenge so great that our nation cannot rise to meet it  we can reopen the government and continue to work through disagreements over policy  we can secure our border without an ineffective  expensive wall  and we can welcome legal immigrants and refugees without compromising safety and security the symbol of america should be the statue of liberty  not a 30 foot wall  so our suggestion is a simple one  mr  president  reopen the government  and we can work to resolve our differences over border security  but end this shutdown now thank you .
to the editor re asking for unity  trump renews bid for border wall  front page  feb  6  president trump delivered a speech that was more showmanship than a serious discussion of the state of the nation and of his proposals to solve the problems that confront us  news outlets almost universally analyzed the speech from a political perspective  commentators pondered the effect on the presidents base  women and other demographic groups  much time was spent analyzing what drew applause and from whom the current president and his recent predecessors have turned the state of the union into a campaign rally featuring a laundry list of hot button issues  repeating well worn talking points  they introduce too many guests chosen to illustrate these talking points and to draw mandatory applause  they fail to use it for serious consideration of issues and for making realistic legislative proposals  and the length of these speeches taxes attention spans if the presidents do not change the tenor of these speeches to make them more inspiring and meaningful  we should consider speaker nancy pelosis suggestion that the state of the union report be delivered in writing william f  werwaissnew yorkto the editor president trumps call for  500 million to fight childhood cancer was greeted with deservedly loud applause  does it not occur to anyone that he wants more than 10 times that amount for his wall  heres a deal we can all live with   5 7 billion to fight childhood cancer  and  500 million for the wall  that way mr  trump can say he got money for the wall  and we can get our priorities straight in this country john m  imperialeharvey cedars  n j to the editor i cannot be the only person who found president trumps state of the union address simply rehashed rhetoric  how many times do we have to hear his horror story version of what goes on at our southern border  not surprisingly  the presidents speech lacked any mention of voting rights  sensible gun control or climate change  perhaps an hour and 22 minutes wasnt enough time stacey abrams  however  in giving the democratic response  addressed those missed issues and a lot more  and did it in under 15 minutes  as a bonus  she was passionate  wholly engaged and inspiring ms  abrams  who lost a contentious battle for governor of georgia and is not a member of congress  was well chosen to give the democratic response  she did an extraordinary job  her belief in an america shaped by all of us together was in sharp contrast to the presidents self glory filled rhetoric  patricia welleremmitsburg  md to the editor speaker nancy pelosi showed her disrespectful attitude for all americans to see tuesday night  could you imagine what the media would have done if a republican had sat up there behind president barack obama making scowl faces and looking at papers all night  wayne taralsonsioux falls  s d to the editor re wheres the unity  mr  trump   editorial  feb  6  the lofty goals put forth in president trumps state of the union speech  even surrounded by anodyne patriotic themes and military reminiscences  will be going nowhere fast in terms of legislation and action under a president who has no idea how to work with congress  especially a divided one we must continue to express our disapproval of this administration but also need to forge ahead ourselves to achieve change  as your editorial said  the wisest course for citizens interested in a stronger union is to focus on building it themselves speak up  speak out  and vote  d i y   america nancy sellarnew york.

crises are a time tested means of subverting democracy from getlio vargas and other better known dictators in the 1930s to indira gandhi and ferdinand marcos in the 1970s and on to vladimir putin and recep tayyip erdogan more recently  autocratic minded leaders have long used national emergencies  some real  some fabricated  to claim extraordinary powers  one of our greatest concerns about donald trumps presidency has always been that he would exploit  or invent  a crisis in order to justify an abuse of power  recent events have given this concern new immediacy authoritarian leaders often chafe under the constraints of constitutional rule  democratic politics is  after all  grinding work  family businesses and army units may be ruled by fiat  but democracies require negotiation and concessions  setbacks are inevitable  victories always partial  a presidents most cherished policy initiatives may be savaged in the media  derailed by congress or struck down by the courts president bill clinton  who was elected on a promise of health care reform  devoted the first two years of his administration to a universal health insurance bill only to see it die in congress  president george w  bush claimed a mandate to reform social security after his 2004 re election  but the initiative went nowhere  all presidents suffer such defeats  in a democracy  presidents must have patience and thick skin  they must be able to compromise  and crucially  they must be able to lose autocratic minded leaders  by contrast  find democratic politics intolerably frustrating  most lack the skills or the temperament for the give and take of everyday politics  they are allergic to criticism and compromise  they have little patience for the intricacies of the legislative process  to cite one example  an aide to former president alberto fujimori of peru noted that mr  fujimori couldnt stand the idea of inviting the president of the senate to the presidential palace every time he wanted congress to approve a law  for would be authoritarians  the checks and balances inherent in presidential democracy feel like a straitjacket  the media criticism  legislative oversight and adverse court rulings leave them feeling besieged crises offer these would be authoritarians an escape from constitutional shackles  national emergencies  especially wars or major terrorist attacks  do three things for such leaders  first  they build public support  security crises typically produce a rally round the flag effect in which presidential approval soars  citizens are more likely to tolerate  and even support  authoritarian power grabs when they fear for their safety  second  security crises silence opponents  since criticism can be viewed as disloyal or unpatriotic  finally  security crises loosen normal constitutional constraints  fearful of putting national security at risk  judges and legislative leaders generally defer to the executive national emergencies can threaten the constitutional balance even under democratically minded presidents like abraham lincoln and franklin roosevelt  but they can be fatal under would be autocrats  for they provide a seemingly legitimate  and often popular  justification for concentrating power and eviscerating rights  hitlers authoritarian response to the 1933 reichstag fire is the most prominent example  but there are many others  in peru  a maoist insurgency and economic crisis enabled mr  fujimori to dissolve the constitution and congress in 1992  in russia  a series of deadly apartment bombings in 1999  allegedly by chechen terrorists  triggered a surge of public support for mr  putin  who was then the prime minister  which allowed him to crack down on critics and consolidate his power  and in turkey  a series of terrorist attacks in 2015  along with a failed 2016 coup attempt  allowed mr  erdogan to tighten his grip via a two year state of emergency crises present such great opportunities for concentrating power that would be autocrats often manufacture them  in 1937  president vargas of brazil  resisting term limits that would force him to leave office the next year  used the discovery of a communist plot  the so called cohen plan  later revealed to be a fabrication  to dissolve the constitution and establish a dictatorship similarly  president marcos of the philippines did not want to step aside when his second term expired in 1973  but he needed a reason to subvert constitutional checks  an opportunity arrived in  1972  when a series of explosions rocked manila  following an apparent assassination attempt on his defense secretary  marcos  blaming communist terrorists  declared martial law and established a dictatorship  this crisis  too  was largely fabricated  the bombings are believed to have been carried out by government forces and the assassination attempt was staged  the communist menace that marcos used to justify martial law amounted to several dozen insurgents although president trump operates in a different political environment  his behavior  particularly since the november midterm elections  betrays similar autocratic instincts  the president manifestly lacks the patience or negotiating skills needed to deal with divided government  his response to democratic control of the house of representatives has been a refusal to compromise and  more dangerously  a refusal to lose  unlike presidents clinton and bush  who conceded defeat when it became clear that their initiatives lacked legislative support  mr  trump has refused to accept the failure of his border wall project  unable to obtain the necessary votes in congress  the president recklessly forced a government shutdown  when that didnt get him his wall  he moved to circumvent congress altogether by inventing  if not yet declaring  a national emergency  in his oval office speech on tuesday  he used the word crisis six times in eight minutes  that is how autocrats respond to legislative opposition  following in the tradition of vargas and marcos  mr  trump fabricated a security threat to make the case for bypassing congress the presidents border wall stunt may well fail  mr  trump is politically weak  outside of his core group of supporters  few americans believe that the southern border poses a national security threat  and there is a chance  though it is far from certain  that any effort by mr  trump to circumvent congress would be blocked by the courts  on friday  mr  trump seemed to acknowledge the weakness of his position when he announced that what were not looking to do right now is national emergency  although he continued to hold the threat over congress but no matter the outcome  these developments should set off alarm bells  our president is behaving like an autocrat  his willingness to fabricate a national crisis and subvert constitutional checks and balances to avoid legislative defeat places him closer to ferdinand marcos than to ronald reagan  american presidents wield vast authority during crises  during our countrys last major security crisis  the sept  11  2001  terrorist attacks  mr  bushs approval rating soared to 90 percent  the highest ever recorded by gallup  in the wake of the attacks  constitutional checks and balances receded  neither congress nor the courts were likely to intervene to check the presidents actions  for several months  the president had what was effectively a blank check mr  trump lacks the self restraint of lincoln  f d r   or even george w  bush  indeed  he seems incapable of exercising executive power responsibly  mr  trumps first encounter with divided government has produced what is proving to be the longest government shutdown ever  and any reckless use of emergency powers would set a dangerous precedent for overriding the legislative branch  unlike other national emergency declarations  this one would openly defy the will of congress this raises a terrifying question  how would a president who is willing to fabricate a national emergency over a simple legislative impasse behave during a real security crisis .
congress is on the verge of formally repudiating a presidents national emergency declaration  a historic first  last month  after losing a funding battle with congress over his desire for a border wall  president trump made his declaration  insisting that a national security crisis on our southern border precipitated his action  the senate has mustered enough support to pass a joint resolution  introduced and approved in the house last month  calling for the immediate termination of a national emergency that represented an unprecedented end run around congresss power of the purse mr  trump has threatened to veto the resolution if it passes  nonetheless  such a rejection from congress would be healthy for the nations constitutional order  among other things  itd demonstrate that the separation of powers still matters and that some republican lawmakers  after two years of looking the other way  are willing to stand up to a president with no respect for constitutional boundaries at the same time  the need for this legislative reprimand lays bare flaws in the national emergencies act  which congress passed in 1976 to restrain executive power  before the law  a president could declare a national emergency and unlock formidable powers under an array of statutes  giving him authority  according to a legislative analysis  to seize property and commodities  organize and control the means of production  call to active duty 2 5 million reservists  assign military forces abroad  seize and control all means of transportation and communication  restrict travel  and institute martial law  and  in many other ways  manage every aspect of the lives of all american citizens  the national emergencies act ended that regime  established limits on the duration of national emergencies and put an end to four longstanding emergencies  one of them dating to the start of the korean war that the government had used as late as 1972 to justify actions in vietnam senator charles mcc  mathias  a republican from maryland who was a chief sponsor of the legislation  called president gerald fords signing of the bill a historic act of relinquishing powers of the presidency and envisioned it would be a tool for restoring constitutional democracy but in the more than 40 years that the national emergencies act has been in effect  its been subject to few checks and balances  that congress has never invoked its own authority under the act to rebuke a president until now is a sign of the statutes weaknesses the resolution now before congress serves mainly to nullify mr  trumps border emergency declaration  but further reforms are called for to protect the nation from future excesses for one thing  the national emergencies act doesnt define what an emergency is  a loophole that mr  trump took advantage of by declaring that theres a crisis at the border  contrary to all evidence  congress could set clearer parameters  allowing a president to declare emergencies only when threats to the national interest are imminent and based on observable facts the current law also lets the president extend emergencies for years on end  simply by notifying congress  lawmakers would be wise to vest in congress  rather than the president  the ability to extend an emergency  and even then  the time period for an emergency ought to be capped  no more semi permanent emergencies of the sort that are still lingering on the books from as far back as the late 1970s  if a crisis becomes a nonemergency still requiring legislative action  congress can address it the best way it knows how by passing a bill the current standoff also shows that the law must be clarified to explain that being denied congressional funds toward achieving a policy goal is not  in fact  grounds for declaring an emergency  last week  the house judiciary committee took a good step in this direction  holding a hearing on the status of the 1976 law and what can be done to fix it  there was bipartisan consensus that congress needs to further limit the presidents discretion to declare emergencies strengthening the national emergencies act would erect a wall against any president  not just mr  trump  who insists on creating emergencies where none exist .
washington  president trump has stepped back from declaring a national emergency to pay for a border wall  under pressure from congressional republicans  his own lawyers and advisers  who say using it as a way out of the government shutdown does not justify the precedent it would set and the legal questions it could raise if today the national emergency is border security  tomorrow the national emergency might be climate change  senator marco rubio of florida  one of the ideas critics  said this week  another republican  senator mitt romney of utah  told an interviewer that declaring a national emergency should be reserved for the most extreme circumstances mr  trump  who according to aides has grown increasingly frustrated over the refusal of democrats to bend and sees the shutdown as a road with no off ramp in sight  hinted on friday that the warnings were having an effect what were not looking to do right now is national emergency  he told reporters gathered in the cabinet room as the shutdown approached its fourth week  minutes later he contradicted himself  saying that he would declare a state of emergency if he had to as speaker nancy pelosi and senator chuck schumer  the minority leader  have proved immune to mr  trumps threats  the idea of using the presidents constitutional powers to declare an emergency has received close scrutiny in the white house because it would enable mr  trump to obtain the  5 7 billion he has sought for construction of a wall without the approval of congress instead  mr  trump would use his authority to transfer funds to the wall that were appropriated by congress for other purposes  toward that end  the army corps of engineers has been directed to study whether it can divert about  13 9 billion in emergency aide set aside for puerto rico  florida  texas and california  and with the money secured  the president could drop his opposition to the appropriations bills whose passage would end the shutdown that would allow mr  trump to say he had never backed down from his fight with congressional democrats or abandoned his pledge to build the wall even if the construction became tied up in legal challenges former white house aides  who noted that mr  trump did not focus on the wall during the first two years of his presidency  said the optics of fighting for the wall were more important to the president than erecting it but opposition has come from many republican quarters  some conservatives see it as an unacceptable extension of executive power  kellyanne conway  a white house aide  has said it would essentially give congress a pass  representative mike simpson  republican of idaho and a member of the house appropriations committee  said it was not clear to him that an emergency declaration would even lead to the prompt reopening of the government he called it a bad escape hatch that was going to anger many house members mr  trumps reluctance is also frustrating allies ginning him up to take action  if its a crisis  treat it like a crisis  stephen k  bannon  the former chief white house strategist  said in an interview  his best option now is to declare a national security emergency and get on with it on thursday  mr  trump traveled to the border in texas to dramatize his support for a wall but used a photo op along the banks of the rio grande on thursday only to repeat his familiar arguments for building it  he sidestepped the issue when sean hannity  the fox news host  asked him in an interview that night to detail what a national emergency would look like theres some compromise needed  mr  trump said but mr  trump  who allies said was eager to spend time at his mar a lago club in florida and resented the advice of aides to deliver an oval office address and travel to texas on thursday  is left with few good options as he searches for a way to end the political stalemate with democratic lawmakers  mr  trump is finding himself boxed in  in a familiar position when it comes to immigration issues  former aides say that is because he conflates legal and policy issues with public relations campaigns and does not anticipate an endgame in march  mr  trump was facing pressure to meet a deadline on a decision about what to do with immigrants who were part of the deferred action for childhood arrivals program  which allowed young adults brought to the united states illegally as children to avoid deportation and become eligible for a work permit racked by anxiety as he quizzed aides for advice  mr  trump turned to an adviser and asked  how do i get out of this in the end  mr  trump was saved  at least temporarily  by a federal appeals court ruling last year that he could not immediately end the program  mr  trump moved on in the opening weeks of his presidency  mr  trump issued an executive order banning citizens from seven majority muslim countries from entering the united states  that ban was almost immediately halted in court  a second  rewritten version  however  was upheld by the supreme court and was seen as at least a partial victory for the administration but mr  trump vented  privately and publicly  that the version that passed legal muster was watered down and p c   and made him look weak how mr  trump found himself in his most recent predicament can be traced back to september  when white house aides and conservative lawmakers urged the president to engage in a fight for wall funding  but he was told to postpone the fight until after the election  to avoid forcing vulnerable republicans in swing districts to take a politically perilous stance on the wall when he looked like he might compromise and support a bill that provided far less money for the wall than he asked for  conservatives like ann coulter excoriated him  describing him as gutless  and he backed down  soon he was telling mr  schumer and ms  pelosi during a televised oval office meeting last month that he would proudly own the shutdown  thrilling conservatives buoyed by the praise  and encouraged by the acting white house chief of staff  mick mulvaney  mr  trump decided to keep digging in but that encouragement for what played well in a viral television moment never led to a coherent strategy for a prolonged stalemate  according to a half dozen people in the white house or working with the administration on a way to end the shutdown mr  trumps allies insist that he is winning the political battle democrats are boxed in  said greg mueller  a conservative strategist  every time the president and g o p  go to the democrats with a fix  they say no  which positions them as obstructionists ignoring the problem  and opening themselves up for major troubles in 2020 senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina  who had tried and failed to find an alternative to reopen the government earlier in the week  emerged from a meeting with mr  trump on friday declaring that it was clear democrats dont want to make a deal and will never support border wall barriers and he encouraged the exact action many of his colleagues were warning against  mr  president  declare a national emergency now  he said  build a wall now mr  trumps aides said they expected the stalemate over the wall funding to be resolved by the time he delivers the state of the union address on jan  29  but the white house also has drafts based on the shutdown being over  or well into its sixth week .
washington  democrats  transitioning into the house majority  have quietly sent dozens of letters in recent weeks seeking documents and testimony from president trumps businesses  his campaign and his administration  setting the table for investigations that could reach the center of his presidency clear targets have emerged in the process  and some others appear to have fallen away  at least for now  family separation and detention policies at the border have jumped to the forefront  so has the acting attorney generals oversight of the special counsel  robert s  mueller iii  but democrats  after slamming house republicans for their inadequate inquiry  do not plan to reopen a full scale russian interference investigation  they have also chosen to hold off on an immediate request for mr  trumps tax returns for eager liberals coming off two years of republican oversight paralysis  the next few weeks may feel something like a game of hurry up and wait  arranging witnesses and wrangling sensitive government documents take time  and most house committees have yet to be populated with lawmakers  not to mention much of the legion of lawyers who will do a lot of the work of investigations  the intelligence committee did not technically have a chairman until last week those people who are expecting some kind of hollywood movie here are going to be disappointed because it is going be very orderly  said representative jim himes  democrat of connecticut and a senior member of the intelligence committee here is what democrats will focus on first the impasse over mr  trumps proposed border wall and the death late last month of an 8 year old boy from guatemala in united states custody have catapulted the administrations divisive policies at the border to the top of house democrats agenda  representative jerrold nadler of new york  the judiciary committee chairman  and a handful of other chairmen plan to examine immigration policies their interest and detailed questions could prove problematic for mr  trumps efforts to make a case for his border wall  shining a light on gaps in the current policy and trying to highlight the human toll on migrants we are calling on d h s  to preserve any and all evidence related to these horrible incidents  the chairmen wrote  we as a country can and must do better mr  nadler has already invited matthew g  whitaker  the acting attorney general  to be the committees first public hearing witness  and indicated on wednesday that he would subpoena mr  whitaker if necessary to compel an appearance before the end of the month  democrats are intent on pressing mr  whitaker on his involvement in the ousting of former attorney general jeff sessions  his role in the oversight of the special counsel investigation and other policy matters  including the administrations decision not to defend the affordable care act in a lawsuit brought by republican state attorneys general mr  nadler has indicated that he intends to wait for mr  mueller to conclude his work before seriously considering an impeachment inquiry  a prospect weighing heavily on democrats that could swamp other oversight efforts  but he said in december that the committee would begin investigating facts presented by federal prosecutors that strongly point to mr  trumps involvement in hush money payments just before the 2016 election to two women who claim to have had affairs with him  a violation of campaign finance law  they will also look at what democrats view as improper communications between the president and federal law enforcement after seething over republican use of the house intelligence committee to turn an investigation of russian interference in the 2016 election into an attempt to discredit the presidents investigators  democrats plan to quickly flip the lens back on to mr  trump and his campaign itself  but the panels leaders have cautioned that their approach will be narrower than once predicted we are conscious of the fact that the senate continues to do their work  mueller continues to do his work  and at this point in the game  i would not expect the committee to announce an omnibus investigation  mr  himes said  the time has passed for that instead  democrats will initially pursue at least two questions  one discreet  the other potentially very complicated  that republicans in control of the committee would not touch  the panels new chairman  representative adam b  schiff of california  said it was initiating a request for phone records of the presidents eldest son  donald trump jr   to clarify whom he called while arranging a june 2016 meeting at trump tower in manhattan between members of the trump campaign and a russian lawyer  phone records already in the hands of congressional investigators show a call was placed to a blocked number  and donald trump jr  told investigators that he did not remember who he had called  democrats believe the blocked number may have belonged to his father  and could prove that the president had prior knowledge of the russian offer to share dirt on his opponent  hillary clinton the committee would also like to request financial records related to mr  trumps dealings with russia and other foreign powers  intelligence committee democrats appear to be circling around two well known but still mysterious transactions  mr  trumps sale of a palm beach  fla   mansion to a russian oligarch in 2008 and loans to the trump organization from deutsche bank in the real estate case  mr  trump bought a palm beach estate for  41 million in 2004 and  only four years later  amid a national housing crisis  sold it to the russian billionaire  dmitry rybolovlev  for  95 million  democrats say the deal stinks of potential money laundering  loans from deutsche bank  hundreds of millions of dollars extended by a bank later accused in an unrelated case of laundering russian money during a time when few other major banks would lend to mr  trumps businesses  also raise concerns that russia could have financial leverage over the president democrats on the house financial services committee  under representative maxine waters of california  have also been asking questions about the deutsche loans since early 2017  and plan to press their investigation ahead with the full powers of the majority democrats are prepared to subpoena the records if necessary  mr  schiff said staff had already begun informal conversations with institutions  potential witnesses and their lawyers about records requests  but because the panel has not technically been appointed yet  formal requests must wait  most likely until the end of january mr  schiff declined to name specific witnesses except michael d  cohen  mr  trumps former personal lawyer who has pleaded guilty to lying to congress about the trump organizations dealings with russia and to buying the silence of two women who say they had affairs with mr  trump democrats tried more than a dozen times over the past two years to obtain mr  trumps tax returns  but now that they finally have the opportunity to do so  thanks to an obscure 1920s tax code provision  the relevant democratic committee chairman appears to be in no rush in an effort to parry republican accusations of overreach  the house ways and means chairman  representative richard e  neal of massachusetts  has decided instead to try to first build a public case for why the returns ought to become public before he lodges a formal request  he plans to convene a hearing this month focused on presidential tax returns in conjunction with sweeping anticorruption legislation that includes language requiring all presidents and candidates to make their returns public ultimately  mr  neal and democrats do not need new laws  sometime after the hearings  probably in february  mr  neal plans to invoke section 6103 in the tax code  which allows chairmen of the house and senate tax writing committees to request from the treasury department tax returns or related information on any tax filer  in theory  committee investigators could then privately study the returns for any compromising or illegal financial dealings  the committee would have to vote to make any of the information public whether the administration will put up a fight remains unclear  mr  trump has said publicly that he does not care if democrats pursue the documents  steven mnuchin  the treasury secretary  has said he will defer to legal counsel  there is  however  scant precedent for this particular case  mr  trump is the first president or major presidential candidate in decades to refuse to release his returns representative elijah e  cummings of maryland  the chairman of the oversight and reform committee  had a stern and straightforward message when he sent off 51 oversight letters to cabinet secretaries and trump organization lawyers shortly before christmas  consider this a basic first step and not a voluntary one as he stands up the houses marquee investigative committee  mr  cummings has deliberately chosen to begin with targets that republicans once agreed should be studied  but failed to follow up on  they include records related to the administrations response to hurricanes irma and maria  which devastated american territories in the caribbean  ivanka trumps use of a private email account for government business  the use of government jets for personal travel  misconduct by the former environmental protection agency administrator  scott pruitt  and the flint  mich   water crisis laying the groundwork to look for potential violations of the constitutions emoluments clause  which bans payments from foreign governments to federal officeholders  he wrote to the trump organization requesting documents related to the companys procedures for identifying foreign payments  in each  mr  cummings said he expected the documents by friday   subpoenas could follow if they are not produced  but much of the committees investigative work is likely to remain private in the coming weeks  other targets appear to be imminent  representative carolyn b  maloney  democrat of new york  said she and mr  cummings agreed they would study what she called the trump administrations attempts to manipulate the 2020 census for political gain our whole democracy is based on representation  ms  maloney said  and if there is a conscious effort to undercount representation  that is an attack fundamentally on our democracy  .

washington  congressional efforts to reach a border security deal ahead of another government shutdown broke down on sunday over democratic demands to limit the detention of undocumented immigrants  as president trump moved more troops to the border and prepared to rally supporters in texas on monday the 17 house and senate negotiators had hoped to finalize a border security agreement on monday  but hours before that deadline  communications had stopped  lawmakers and aides said meantime  the trump administration was moving on its own to fortify the southwestern border with thousands of active duty military troops  the number of deployed troops on the mexican border was set to exceed the high of 5 900 reached around the november elections  as about 3 700 active duty troops were being sent to assist with the department of homeland securitys border patrol efforts senior officers are voicing greater worries that the deployed troops are not conducting the training needed for their regular missions  while other military units must now pick up the routine duties on behalf of their deployed colleagues but efforts to reach a broader  bipartisan deal on border security bogged down  days before much of the government is set to run out of funds at midnight friday  with memories of the 35 day partial government shutdown  the nations longest in history  still fresh ill say 50 50 we get a deal  senator richard c  shelby of alabama  the republican chairman of the senate appropriations committee  said on fox news sunday  the specter of a shutdown is always out there the impasse appears to center on democratic demands for a limit on the number of unauthorized immigrants already in the country who could be detained by immigration and customs enforcement officers  according to aides familiar with the talks  democrats say a cap of 16 500 beds in ice detention centers would force the trump administration to focus on detaining undocumented immigrants with criminal records instead of using indiscriminate sweeps that drag in otherwise law abiding residents for far too long  the trump administration has been tearing communities apart with its cruel immigration policies  representative lucille roybal allard  democrat of california and one of the negotiators  said on sunday  a cap on ice detention beds will force the trump administration to prioritize deportation for criminals and people who pose real security threats  not law abiding immigrants who are contributing to our country republicans demanded an exception to the cap for criminals  according to an aide familiar with the negotiations  democrats declined  saying their 16 500 bed cap left more than enough room for real criminals but just days after he used his state of the union address to take an uncompromising line on a border wall  mr  trump was being challenged on a new front in the immigration wars  the president took to twitter on sunday afternoon to say democratic negotiators are behaving  all of a sudden  irrationally they dont even want to take muderers into custody  whats going on  he said  a charge that democrats called categorically false the looming deadline is exposing fissures in both parties  the more liberal members of the democratic caucus  many of whom ran on abolishing immigration and customs enforcement altogether  have been lobbying their colleagues on the committee to resist any increases in ice funding democratic negotiators held a conference call on sunday morning to discuss options  according to a democratic aide  but did not settle on a final decision on how to move forward  another short term spending bill could prevent a lapse in funding on friday  though lawmakers have expressed reluctance at punting again on a final agreement still  mr  shelby and senator jon tester  democrat of montana and a member of the negotiating committee  said on sunday that they had not given up other sticking points remain  including how much money to allocate for barriers at the border  lawmakers were eyeing between  1 3 billion and  2 billion  far less than the  5 7 billion that the president demanded for his signature campaign promise  and shut down the government over in december  mr  trump  who has vacillated between publicly condemning the talks as a waste of time and privately showing flexibility  blamed democratic leadership for the breakdown i dont think the dems on the border committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal  he wrote on twitter  they are offering very little money for the desperately needed border wall   now  out of the blue  want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention pentagon and administration officials spent the weekend preparing for another partial government shutdown  and for the possibility that the president will fulfill his threat to declare a national emergency and fund the wall without congress  lawmakers from both parties have expressed extreme discomfort with the prospect of a national emergency declaration  and there is almost universal aversion to another shutdown one proposal circulating among some white house officials in an attempt to fend off legal challenges to an emergency declaration is to claim that the wall would be built to protect the more than 6 000 active duty and national guard troops now operating near the southwestern border or deploying there soon the wall will get built one way or the other  mr  trump wrote on twitter on saturday afternoon during the last lapse in funding  hundreds of thousands of workers were either furloughed or worked without pay  and it cost the united states economy  11 billion  another shutdown would hit some agencies at an even worse time  the internal revenue service  for instance  is just entering tax season lawmakers held out the possibility that mr  trump could find some face saving way to fortify border security and build some structures without resorting to a precedent setting emergency declaration  mick mulvaney  the acting white house chief of staff  said the president had asked him to comb through the law and go find money in any place we could to fully fund a wall theres pots of money where presidents  all presidents  have access to without a national emergency  mr  mulvaney said on nbcs meet the press senior republican aides said senator mitch mcconnell  the majority leader  and his leadership team were frustrated with the democrats because they believed they had persuaded mr  trump to agree to a package for border security improvements that consisted mostly of repairs and extensions to existing barriers  their major concern now  people close to the process said  is that stephen miller  the presidents hard line adviser on immigration  would convince him that accepting a compromise on detention beds would be a humiliation that would cost him with his base in what one defense department official described as a surreal scramble  pentagon officials met on friday and over the weekend to identify which army corps of engineers construction projects would be tapped for money to help build mr  trumps wall if the president declared a national emergency officials scoured the language of multiple draft declarations that mr  trump might invoke if a deal is not reached or he rejects what lawmakers agree upon  mr  trumps top national security aides are scheduled to meet on monday to discuss the matter  mr  trump is then to convene a full cabinet meeting on tuesday  officials said if mr  trump declares a national emergency to build the wall  democrats are expected to sue to block construction and halt any shifting of funds  house democrats are preparing legislation that would limit the presidents ability to unilaterally commandeer wall funding mr  trump is set to hold a rally in el paso on monday night  using the border city as evidence for his exaggerated claim that a wall would reduce crime  read about the message el paso is sending to mr  trump before the rally  dont speak for us  prominent democrats from the area  including beto orourke  a possible democratic presidential candidate and former representative for most of the city  and his freshman successor  representative veronica escobar  have denounced mr  trumps claims that el paso became a safe city only after a physical barrier was built there  ms  escobar called the president a liar ms  escobar was one of a group of lawmakers  including representative steny h  hoyer of maryland  the majority leader  who visited the area before mr  trumps rally its frustrating to know that he is still unwilling to acknowledge the truth about immigrants  the truth about the border  said ms  escobar  speaking earlier this week after growing visibly angry as the president made similar claims during his state of the union address  he has failed to set out any kind of real plan and real solution .
washington  the reopening of the federal government signals the start of three weeks of intense negotiations over border security in an ideologically divided congress that threaten to leave republican and democratic leaders right where they began  at risk of a government shutdown the stopgap spending bill president trump signed into law on friday night gives leaders in both chambers until feb  15 to devise a bipartisan resolution to their impasse over the presidents demand for  5 7 billion for a border wall  but whatever they come up with is likely to face obstacles from resurgent liberals in the house and a more conservative senate and mr  trump is a wild card  the president will have the final word on any deal  and he has already vowed to shut down the government again  or invoke his emergency powers to build a wall  if congress does not offer a solution he likes nodding to the tight deadline  he acknowledged the difficulties ahead  will not be easy to make a deal  both parties very dug in  mr  trump wrote on twitter on saturday  the case for national security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the border   through dialogue  we will build the wall meanwhile  the clock is ticking i think everybodys relieved that the governments getting back open  said senator james lankford  republican of oklahoma  but i think everyones still a little tenuous because weve got a sword of damocles hanging over us three weeks from now to see if we can get things worked out the shutdown  the longest on record  left 800 000 federal employees without pay for 35 days  and left lawmakers in both parties feeling scarred and jittery  tensions were running especially high on friday  air traffic controllers called in sick  flights were delayed across the northeast  work slowdowns at the i r s  threatened to postpone tax refunds and the f b i  director  furious that his agents were working without pay  lashed out this coming week  negotiators from the house and the senate  led by the top democrats and republicans on the appropriations committees  will begin meeting to hash out a plan to secure the southwestern border  the appropriators have a history of working in a bipartisan way  and there are some areas of agreement democrats and republicans  including mr  trump  have both called for border security packages that would include money for new technologies to detect drugs and weapons  more personnel at the border  more immigration judges  infrastructure improvement at ports of entry and humanitarian assistance for migrants mr  trump  for his part  has softened his messaging  conceding in a speech in the rose garden on friday that we do not need 2 000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea  we never did  that semantic evolution could provide a face saving way forward for both the president and democrats  who have previously supported bills that include money for border fencing  though not a wall and democrats have moved closer to mr  trumps  5 7 billion price tag  representative james e  clyburn of south carolina  the no  3 house democrat  told reporters this past week that lawmakers in his party were prepared to spend that much on a border security package that would include what he called a smart wall  featuring drones  sensors and more border patrol agents this has become a shutdown over semantics  said steve israel  a democratic former congressman from new york  who ran the partys campaign committee  this has become donald trumps shutdown over the definition of a wall  and democrats have succeeded at redefining border security from bricks and mortar to investments in modern technology but the path ahead remains complicated  mr  trump is desperate to fulfill his 2016 campaign pledge for a big  beautiful wall along the southern border  a huge sticking point for democrats  who see the president in a weakened position now that he has caved to their core demand of reopening the government first and negotiating border security later progressives especially are feeling emboldened and do not like the idea that mr  trump is once again tying the debate over border security to a threat to shut down the government i think its offensive  even to some of the centrists and moderates  that he links his program on immigration with the functioning of government  said representative ro khanna of california  a leader of the house progressive caucus  the vast majority  not just the progressives  will say not a dime goes for the border wall  and thats especially true because we just won this fight even so  mr  trump may have already put forth the broad outlines of a deal  with his proposal to pair money for a barrier with protections for some undocumented immigrants  the senate rejected that plan this past week  still  if the protections were expansive enough  and included a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants known as dreamers  some centrist democrats might be persuaded to sign on but expanding the border security discussion to include changes to immigration law could open a pandoras box  giving conservative republicans a window to pursue more far reaching restrictions on legal immigration  one such republican  senator marsha blackburn  a freshman from tennessee  said on friday that she intended to continue pushing not only for a border barrier  but also for an end to the program that protects dreamers and an end to family based migration  a position that is anathema to democrats much will depend on speaker nancy pelosi  who solidified her position as a powerful leader of her caucus during the shutdown fight  on friday  ms  pelosi ducked questions about whether she could accept any money for a physical barrier  insisting instead that democrats want a border plan rooted in evidence based knowledge about how we best secure our border ms  pelosi has previously said that a wall would be immoral  an utterance that may have backed her into a corner  said charlie dent  a moderate republican who retired from the house last year i hope she can walk that back  because if she meant what she said that walls are immoral  how can she allow a bill to come to the floor that might include some additional money for barriers  mr  dent said  as to mr  trump  mr  dent said  the question is  can the president be a reliable negotiator for democrats  that is the proverbial  64 000 question  mr  trump is extremely sensitive to criticism from the right  and is known to change his stance in response to commentary from conservative pundits  already  one of them  ann coulter  has ridiculed the president as a wimp on twitter over his decision to reopen the government without wall funding during the shutdown mr  trump sent vice president mike pence and the acting white house chief of staff  mick mulvaney  to the capitol to negotiate with democrats  but it quickly became clear that mr  pence and mr  mulvaney were not speaking for mr  trump i ask myself  is this going to be a trump negotiation  negotiated in good faith  or is he going to say one thing through his advisers and another when he hears from rush limbaugh and ann coulter  asked representative nita m  lowey of new york  who as chairwoman of the house appropriations committee will be leading the talks im an appropriator  im used to making deals  ms  lowey said  though she added  i dont know how this negotiation is going to go some of the more pragmatic voices in congress insist the two sides are not that far apart  senator rob portman  republican of ohio  noted that last year congress approved  and mr  trump signed into law  a bipartisan bill to fund the department of homeland security that included  1 375 billion for new fencing along the border  mr  portman said mr  trumps budget proposal for the 2019 fiscal year included money for just 234 miles of new fencing  hardly an enormous wall from one end of the country to the other both the president and his democratic critics have mischaracterized what the proposal is  mr  portman said  adding that he sees reasons for optimism  he has been heartened by comments from ms  pelosi and house democrats about the importance of border security and by remarks from moderate democrats in the senate who have said they are open to more fencing and he said nobody  or at least nobody on capitol hill  was in the mood for another shutdown  were sort of at the end of the rope now  right .

washington  senate democrats next week may block legislation proposed by their republican counterparts that would allocate billions of dollars for disaster recovery across the country  citing opposition from house democrats and a push to add more aid to puerto ricos slow efforts to recover from a pair of devastating hurricanes more than a year ago democrats in the senate have said they would support companion disaster aid legislation passed by house democrats this year  but on thursday lawmakers left washington for the weekend with the issue of money for puerto rico still unresolved the impasse ahead of votes early next week has revived both a renewed legislative push to grant the island statehood  lawmakers introduced a measure on thursday that would make puerto rico the 51st state  and criticism over president trumps stingy approach to the islands recovery efforts ive taken better care of puerto rico than any man ever  mr  trump told reporters on thursday mr  trump has offered his support for the senate disaster relief package in individual conversations with senators  republican aides say  but he has long castigated the island and its officials for their handling of the recovery efforts why are we paying them  91 billion  mr  trump asked in a closed republican lunch on tuesday  according to a person familiar with the exchange and later confirmed by a lawmaker who was present  for  91 billion  we can buy puerto rico four times over it is not clear where the  91 billion figure came from puerto rican leaders have pushed back  gov  ricardo rossell told cnn on thursday that if the bully gets close  ill punch the bully in the mouth and senator chuck schumer of new york  the minority leader  told members in a closed lunch on thursday that they needed to defend the island  which as a united states territory does not have voting representation  according to a person familiar with the meeting the measure would send about  14 billion in relief across a half dozen states and territories  house lawmakers have warned that if the bill passes the senate without more money for puerto rico  it will not make it through the lower chamber  and another round of negotiations would be needed before any relief could be disbursed senate democrats are pushing three alternatives  passing the house version of the bill  entering into bipartisan negotiations with the house or adding an amendment to the senate measure that would allow more aid for puerto rico the people of puerto rico are suffering  mr  schumer said in a speech on the senate floor  they have received a sliver of the funding they need  its hard to fathom the depths of cruelty that it takes for the president to treat the people of puerto rico this way despite the impasse  lawmakers voiced optimism that a resolution was still possible ahead of the votes  even as senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  invoked procedural rules this week that would limit how amendments can be added to the legislation were stalled right now  said senator richard c  shelby of alabama  chairman of the senate appropriations committee  there are a lot of demands for puerto rico  we are trying to get over a few hurdles  i think well get there  but we are not there yet mr  shelby  who was standing near the elevators outside the senate chamber  then linked arms with senator patrick j  leahy of vermont  the committees ranking democrat if anyone can get it done  dick and i will  mr  leahy said congress has failed to reach a consensus on disaster aid since december  when house members tried to use it as a sweetener to ease passage of legislation to keep the government open  that measure failed to pass the senate because it also funded mr  trumps border wall  while the house passed a disaster relief package in january  it was ultimately left off the bipartisan compromise measure that reopened the government and has not been taken up by the senate the senators involved with the bill  including senators david perdue and johnny isakson of georgia  have been working on it for close to six months  regularly speaking to mr  trump about it republican aides familiar with the negotiations said that because the house legislation was passed in january  it does not have roughly  2 billion in aid for midwestern states devastated by floods and tornadoes this month  and they believed that democratic priorities  including about  610 million for nutrition assistance for puerto rico  were accommodated in the bill   a house democratic aide familiar with the negotiations said that the measure could be amended to accommodate such a request  senators who represent states still struggling to recover from hurricanes  wildfires and other natural disasters are growing frustrated  senator john cornyn  republican of texas  railed on the senate floor on thursday about the bureaucratic red tape delaying funds for texas senator rick scott  republican of florida and a chief proponent of the bill  said  im sick and tired of this theyre not using this because they care about puerto rico  mr  scott said of the democrats  theyre using this to block the whole thing .
three decades ago  donald j  trump waged a public battle with the talk show host merv griffin to take control of what would become mr  trumps third atlantic city casino  executives at mr  trumps company warned that the casino would siphon revenue from the others  analysts predicted the associated debt would crush him the naysayers would be proved right  but throughout the turmoil mr  trump fixated on just one outcome  declaring himself a winner and mr  griffin a loser as president  mr  trump has displayed a similar fixation in his standoff with congress over leveraging a government shutdown to gain funding for a wall on the mexican border  as he did during decades in business  mr  trump has insulted adversaries  undermined his aides  repeatedly changed course  extolled his primacy as a negotiator and induced chaos he hasnt changed at all  said jack odonnell  who ran a casino for mr  trump in the 1980s and wrote a book about it  and its only people who have been around him through the years who realize that mr  trump briefly seemed to follow a more conventional approach for a president seeking consensus  encouraging his party leaders in congress to negotiate a deal  senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the republican majority leader  shepherded a compromise in december that would have kept the government open and put off negotiations over a wall and other border security measures mr  trump was expected to sign off on the deal  but then came the suggestion from conservative critics that he had caved in to democrats  that he was a loser  it was a perception mr  trump could not bear  and he quickly reversed course he also reverted to lifelong patterns in business  people who worked with him during those years say they see multiple parallels between mr  trump the businessman and mr  trump the steward of the countrys longest government shutdown his lack of public empathy for unpaid federal workers echoes his treatment of some construction workers  contractors and lawyers whom he refused to pay for their work on his real estate projects  the plight of the farmers and small business owners wilting without the financial support pledged by his administration harks back to the multiple lenders and investors who financed mr  trumps business ventures only to come up shortchanged and his ever changing positions  ill own the shutdown  you own the shutdown  the wall could be steel  it must be concrete  then again  it could be steel  have left heads in both parties spinning  even after his televised proposal on saturday to break the deadlock  mr  trump has no progress to show i think he was always a terrible negotiator  said tony schwartz  co author with mr  trump of the art of the deal that book  published in 1987  was intended to be an autobiography of mr  trump  who was 41 at the time  mr  schwartz said that he created the idea of mr  trump as a great deal maker as a literary device to give the book a unifying theme  he said he came to regret the contribution as he watched mr  trump seize on the label to sell himself as something he was not  a solver of complicated problems rather  mr  schwartz said  mr  trumps virtue in negotiating was his relentlessness and lack of concern for anything but claiming victory if you dont care what the collateral damage you create is  then you have a potential advantage  he said  he used a hammer  deceit  relentlessness and an absence of conscience as a formula for getting what he wanted in a brief telephone interview on sunday  mr  trump was not specific in defending his tactics  but he described himself as successful in his chosen fields of real estate  entertainment and finally politics  i ran for office once and i won  mr  trump said the presidents supporters say he gets an unfair rap as a poor negotiator  saying that his style and unusual approach  and unwillingness to accept defeat even in the worst situations  have often had positive results  and in a washington that doesnt like outsiders  he has clearly forced his adversaries out of their comfort zones president trumps success in business has translated into success as president  sarah huckabee sanders  the white house press secretary  said  hes ignited a booming economy with rising wages and historically low unemployment  negotiated better trade deals  persuaded our allies to contribute their fair share to nato  and secured the release of american hostages around the world representative peter king  republican of long island  said that even as mr  trumps personal popularity had taken a hit during the shutdown  public support for his stated ambition  the border wall  had grown having the bad hand that he dealt himself at the beginning  i think hes making the best of it  better than anybody else could  mr  king said  only he would have the stamina  the determination to just keep going one example of that stamina  seen by others as evidence of unreliability  recounted in mr  odonnells book  trumped  the inside story of the real donald trump  his cunning rise and spectacular fall  written with james rutherford  involved the construction of an exclusive lounge at the top of a casino mr  trump liked very high ceilings  according to the account  he screamed and cursed when he was told some ceilings had to be low to allow for pipes  he begrudgingly acquiesced  but he had forgotten by the time he next visited the construction site  he cursed again  was reminded again  to the bewilderment of his executives  that cycle repeated itself several times finally  toward the end of construction  mr  trump reamed an executive with vulgarities  leapt up and punched a hole in one of the low ceilings  after that day  mr  odonnell wrote  donald never set foot inside it again if he could help it in recent weeks  mr  trump has similarly laced into his acting chief of staff  mick mulvaney mr  mulvaney pursued a rather standard tactic in ending the impasse over border security and a wall  he tried to find middle ground between the  1 3 billion to which democrats had once agreed  and the presidents demand for  5 7 billion  but upon learning of mr  mulvaneys efforts  mr  trump snarled in front of a crowded room that mr  mulvaney had messed it all up  using a vulgarity  according to two white house officials familiar with the remark  we are getting crushed  mr  trump told mr  mulvaney  after watching television coverage of the shutdown during his years in business  mr  trump earned a reputation as someone whose word meant very little  when a commitment he made no longer made sense  he walked away  often blaming the other party with a fantastical line of reasoning to win financing from deutsche bank to build a trump hotel in chicago  for example  mr  trump personally guaranteed  40 million of the debt  when he could not make his payments during the 2008 financial crisis  deutsche bank executives were open to granting him more time to repay the loan  a person briefed on negotiations later recalled but before a compromise could be reached  mr  trump flipped the script  he filed a lawsuit and argued that the bank had helped cause the worldwide financial meltdown that essentially rendered mr  trump unable to make his debt payments  at the time  deutsche bank called the lawsuit classic trump the bank eventually settled with mr  trump  saving him from having to pay the  40 million  mr  trump expressed his gratitude to the lawyer who fought on his behalf by not fully paying his bill  he left me with some costs  said the lawyer  steven schlesinger from the time he built his first manhattan apartment building  mr  trump left a string of unpaid tabs for the people who worked for him the undocumented polish workers who did the demolition work for that first building  trump tower  eventually won a  1 375 million settlement  since then  scores of lawyers  contractors  engineers and waiters have sued mr  trump for unpaid bills or pay  typically  he responds by asserting that their work did not meet his standard that might sound familiar to furloughed federal workers  mr  trump recently retweeted an article  attributed to an anonymous senior official in his administration  arguing that 80 percent of federal workers do nothing of external value and that furloughed employees should find other work  never return and not be paid mr  trump has claimed  without evidence  that maybe most federal workers going without pay are the biggest fan of his use of the shutdown to fund a border wall  in ordering thousands back to work without pay  he has put the pain for the shutdown on them mr  trump has also embraced his business practice of giving the most latitude and trust to family members  no matter their prior experience he put his first wife  ivana  a model  in charge of an atlantic city casino and the plaza hotel in manhattan  he put his younger brother  robert  who had some background in corporate finance  in senior positions at the casinos  not long after three of his children graduated from college  he vested authority in them over golf courses  hotels and licensing deals in the white house  mr  trump has increasingly leaned on his son in law  jared kushner  for guidance on dealing with congress amid the current stalemate  mr  kushner  who like mr  trump is the son of a wealthy real estate developer  has not always impressed old hands on capitol hill he began some early conversations by saying that democrats would need to yield because his father in law would not budge  a statement that lawmakers found nave  according to democrats familiar with the remarks with democrats now in charge of the house of representatives  mr  trump also has a new set of adversaries  and other old habits from his years in business have re emerged through his twitter feed  he has verbally pummeled senator chuck schumer  the minority leader  and tried to drive a wedge between mr  schumer and his fellow democrat  speaker nancy pelosi barbara res  who said she enjoyed much about working for mr  trump as a construction executive in the 1980s and 1990s  sees in ms  pelosi a new challenge to mr  trumps lifelong tactics  one blind spot she observed was that mr  trump believes hes better than anyone who ever lived and saw even the most capable of women as easy to run over but there was never a woman with power that he ran up against  until pelosi  she said  and he doesnt know what to do with it  hes totally in a corner in the interview  mr  trump described ms  res  mr  odonnell and mr  schwartz as disgruntled workers whom he had shunted aside  who had experience with him for relatively brief periods and who were simply using his name for attention during his years in business  mr  trump rarely displayed an interest in details or expert opinions that might have informed whether his plans would actually work  that pattern has also emerged in the shutdown dispute thirty years ago  his claimed defeat of mr  griffin turned out to be a pyrrhic victory within months of completing construction on his third casino  the trump taj mahal  he could not pay interest to the bondholders who had financed the project  having overpaid and overleveraged himself on other deals  banks forced him to turnover or sell almost everything his wealthy father helped bail him out  but mr  trump blamed everyone else  he fired nearly all his top executives and stopped paying contractors who had built the casino in describing the border wall  mr  trump has expressed unending confidence in its efficacy  others  including representative will hurd  a republican whose texas district includes part of the border with mexico  have described it as a tall speed bump  nearly useless without technology to spot illegal crossings immediately and dispatch border agents to quickly respond mr  odonnell  the casino manager  said long term consequences never concerned mr  trump  he was always willing to pay too much in order to get a deal signed so he could declare victory  he said he just wants to get the deal  mr  odonnell said .
washington  at first  he vowed to take the mantle for closing part of the federal government  then he blamed democrats  saying they now own the shutdown  by friday  president trump was back to owning it again  im very proud of doing what im doing  he declared two weeks into the showdown over a border wall  mr  trump is now crafting his own narrative of the confrontation that has come to consume his presidency  rather than a failure of negotiation  the shutdown has become a test of political virility  one in which he insists he is receiving surreptitious support from unlikely quarters not only are national security hawks cheering him on to defend a porous southern border  but so too are former presidents who he says have secretly confessed to him that they should have done what he is doing  not only do federal employees accept being furloughed or forced to work without wages  they have assured him that they would give up paychecks so that he can stand strong never mind how implausible such assertions might seem  the details do not matter to mr  trump as much as dominating the debate  after an oddly quiescent holiday season in which he complained via twitter about being left at home alone  poor me  he has taken the public stage this week clearly intent on framing the conflict on his own terms  president trump warned that he was considering declaring a national emergency to build the border wall  people close to the president described him as emboldened since members of congress returned to washington after the break  giving him not only a clear target to swing at but helping him focus on a fight that he is convinced is a political winner  one aide said mr  trump believes he has gained the upper hand in the public battle although surveys at first showed more americans blaming him for the shutdown than democrats  later polling showed the fault more evenly split  and the voters he cares most about  his core conservative supporters  are more enthusiastic than the public at large  he has told people that my people love the fight  and that he believes he is winning in the past three days  mr  trump has appeared in public three times to get his version of the story out while democrats celebrated their takeover of the house  at a lengthy cabinet meeting on wednesday  an appearance with border patrol union leaders on thursday and a news conference with republican congressional leaders in the rose garden on friday  he engaged in quintessentially trumpian stream of conscious discussions that ranged widely and unpredictably at one point  he argued that the soviet union was right to invade afghanistan in 1979 to stop terrorists  a revisionist version that provoked a strong reaction in kabul and earned a sharp rebuke from the often supportive editorial page of the wall street journal  which said  we cannot recall a more absurd misstatement of history by an american president at another point  mr  trump mocked india for doing no more in afghanistan than building a library  which generated headlines in new delhi about the jab at its prime minister  not to mention more head scratching because  according to indian news media  the country has not built a library in afghanistan in many years he repeatedly claimed that the new trade agreement he has negotiated with mexico and canada means that mexico really is paying for the wall  even though the pact has yet to be approved by congress and has no direct connection to border security  he has made misleading claims about how many terrorists might be coming across the border mr  trumps version of events differed even from the other people in the room at fridays meeting at the white house  when democratic congressional leaders emerged after two hours  they described a contentious session with no meaningful progress as the president threatened to keep the government closed for months or even years  when mr  trump emerged shortly afterward  he described a very  very productive meeting and predicted the standoff could be fixed very quickly two people briefed on the meeting said that white house officials viewed the conversation as the first civil discussion that had taken place between the two sides  and it left some of mr  trumps aides hopeful  indeed  mr  trump made a point of publicly saying nothing but relatively positive things about the democrats on friday optimistic that a deal really is within reach  the president said he would have vice president mike pence  kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  and jared kushner  his son in law and senior adviser  meet with democrats over the weekend but there were questions about his own side of the aisle  senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  unlike other congressional republican leaders  was not present for the rose garden news conference  hes running the senate  mr  trump explained  even though the senate had adjourned hours earlier and mr  mcconnells spokesman said the senator did not know about the news conference the president nonetheless was feeling energized by support he said he had received for the fight  including the very federal employees who are not being paid as a result of the partial shutdown a lot of people that you think are upset  and certainly theyre not thrilled  but they say  sir  do the right thing  we need border security  mr  trump said  and these are people that wont be getting paid as for his predecessors  he said  this should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me  and they all know it  some of them have told me that we should have done it by all public accounts  mr  trump had not spoken with his living predecessors since his inauguration until former president george bush died last month  mr  trump called mr  bushs son  former president george w  bush  to offer condolences  but the subject of the wall did not come up  according to mr  bushs office  a few days later  at the elder mr  bushs funeral  mr  trump encountered his predecessors for the first time since taking office  but he sat quietly without talking with them during the service the younger mr  bush built miles of wall and fencing along the mexico line while he was president  but said it could not cover the entire border and insisted that enforcement should be coupled with an overhaul of immigration law to permit many people in the country illegally to stay  former president barack obama has repeatedly criticized mr  trumps proposed wall  and former president jimmy carter has said technological improvements would be more effective at protecting the border the white house did not say afterward which presidents mr  trump was referring to  but a senior administration official said he was probably referring to public comments his predecessors have made about the need for border security  not necessarily for a wall specifically as he careened this week from subject to subject and assertion to assertion  an energized mr  trump seemed to be enjoying himself  he went on for more than an hour and a half on wednesday and another hour on friday should we keep this going or not  folks  he asked reporters at one point before noticing that it was a cold january day in the rose garden should we keep this going a little bit longer  he asked again  let me know when you get tired one thing mr  trump was not was tired .
to the editor re trump walks out when pelosi says no to wall funds  front page  jan  10  much has been made of the fact that as a candidate donald trump promised repeatedly to build a border wall that mexico would pay for  we should not forget  however  that he also claimed that nobody negotiated better deals than he did and that americans would soon be winning so much that we would tire of winning even someone who isnt the worlds greatest negotiator can recognize that demanding i want this much money to do something you oppose  i will accept no less and i will give up nothing in exchange is  in general  a terrible negotiating strategy  we have 800 000 federal workers either furloughed or working without pay  countless contractors put on hold  and millions of americans already negatively affected by mr  trumps petulant shutdown  all because the worlds self proclaimed greatest negotiator is hung up on getting funding for a wall that he promised we wouldnt have to pay for and most of us know we dont need if this is winning  mr  trump is right  im tired of it  jonathan maskitgranville  ohioto the editor when are the democrats going to realize that president trumps wall has nothing to do with border security  mr  trump is first and foremost a builder  for him  a wall is the ultimate vanity project  hadrian had his eponymous wall  and the ming dynasty emperors had their great wall of china  he wants the world to look back across the ages in perpetuity and see his sinuous monolith snaking across the southwestern border  a potent symbol of his masculinity  why not just let him build a giant monument to himself in the middle of the national mall and be done with it david j  andersonpasadena  calif to the editor at last the secret of president trumps legendary negotiating prowess has been revealed  1  ask your opponent if she is willing to cave in completely  2  slam hands down on table  3  stomp out of room anthony m  paulcoral gables  fla to the editor frank brunis column about the neediness and narcissism of president trump is very well written and documented  a symbol of trumps neediness  jan  9   the question is  what to do  the leading democrats are  in fact  playing his game by making not financing the wall a top priority  this is just as ridiculous as mr  trumps stand  the democrats should give in on the wall  or at least appear to  while making sure they gain something that really is a top priority taking down a bully is not always the best idea  sometimes its much better to outmaneuver him  even if he then thinks hes won and gloats about it melinda certainmadison  wis to the editor re f d a  suspends most safety inspections of food  news article  jan  10  some 128 000 americans are hospitalized and 3 000 die annually from food borne illness  thats with the food and drug administration operating at full force  now  because of the government shutdown  41 percent of the agencys workers are on furlough  we are one e  coli outbreak away from the clearest demonstration that the government shutdown that president trump insists is necessary to achieve his goal of building a barrier along the mexican border for the safety of our people is perversely having the opposite effect bernard j  kabaknew york.
london  in parliament  lawmakers are mired in gridlock over britains departure from the european union  with no clear path forward  in washington  president trump stormed out of a meeting with congressional leaders who oppose his border wall  hardening a standoff that has shut down much of the government for longer than ever before two governments paralyzed  two populist projects stalled  two venerable democracies in crisis rarely have british and american politics seemed quite so synchronized as they do in the chilly dawn of 2019  three years after the victories of brexit and donald j  trump upended the two nations political establishments  the countries seem subject to a single ideological weather system  one that pits pro globalization elites against a left behind hinterland the similarities abound  brexiteers love to compare their cause to americas war for independence  at a recent right wing rally  one man marched with a scale model of the liberty bell  mr  trump has exuberantly backed brexit  while his friend  the brexit godfather nigel farage  appears on fox news  invoking europes migrant crisis as a reason to back mr  trumps wall its stunning how parallel this is  said stephen k  bannon  who was an architect of mr  trumps immigration policy as his former chief strategist  and is an ally of mr  farage  if youre going to challenge the system  the system is going to fight back mr  bannon likened what he said was the growing possibility that mr  trump will declare a state of national emergency to build his wall over the objections of congress to the once inconceivable but now real possibility that britain will withdraw from the european union in march without reaching a deal with brussels  a so called hard brexit trump is getting ready for his own no deal  hard out  mr  bannon said  even as republicans and mr  trumps aides and family are urging him not to take such a step the trans atlantic dysfunction has far reaching ramifications  given the role the united states and britain  pillars of the nato alliance  play in counterterrorism operations  intelligence sharing  sanctions enforcement  and dealing with conflict zones like syria with both countries also turning away from multilateral trade agreements  china has the opportunity to step in and play an even bigger role in the global economy  and russia has seen an opening to expand its influence in europe  where rising nationalism has threatened to fracture the european union mr  trump and the brexiteers have ridden a nationalist tide in their countries as well  using a potent anti immigration message to appeal to mostly white voters who yearn for a more homogeneous society that no longer exists in britain  immigration has provided an electric current to conservative politics since at least 1968  when the lawmaker enoch powell delivered a seminal speech calling for immigrants to be repatriated  quoting a greek prophecy of the river tiber foaming with much blood  mr  powells speech is credited with propelling the conservative party to victory in the general election of 1970  though it also turned mr  powell into a political pariah opposition to immigration spiked over the last two decades as britain was hit with a series of terrorist attacks by islamist militants and watched as migrants from syria  libya and other war torn countries flooded across europe in the united states  where the right was once preoccupied by social issues like abortion and same sex marriage  immigration surged as an issue because of the changes wrought by globalization  manufacturing jobs moved overseas  where labor was cheaper  while immigrants took both unskilled and high tech jobs previously held by americans by 2008  the financial crisis had wiped out millions of jobs  keeping people out of work for years and deepening the sense of grievance among many trump supporters that immigrants were working for less and robbing them of their livelihoods local politicians in california and elsewhere shot to stardom by introducing anti immigrant ordinances  the tea party movement emerged  with core issues similar to those of mr  farages pro brexit u k  independence party the culture war has been replaced by a border war  said michael lind  a visiting professor at the lyndon b  johnson school of public affairs at the university of texas  the residents of rural postindustrial areas came to view globalism sourly  he said  as an urgent problem the people in those areas just said  o k   were not giving them any more time  the people in london and d c   your time is up  were not going to wait a few more years for a recovery  said mr  lind  the author of land of promise  an economic history of the united states  they decided  theres a limited pie  this pie is not growing the urge to solve these problems by walling off the country from its neighbors is not a new one in either britain or the united states  it partly reflects geography  both are separated from much of the world by water  allowing them to experiment with isolationism brexit and the border wall are driven by the same impulse  said robert kagan  a foreign policy theorist at the brookings institution  both reflect the island nation approach to the world  wouldnt it be great if we could just cut ourselves off from everybody else britain  to some extent  is returning to one version of its roots  and america is returning to one version of its roots  said mr  kagan  whose most recent book is the jungle grows back  america and our imperiled world britain has sometimes acted as a political early warning system for its former colony  margaret thatcher took power less than two years before her conservative ally ronald reagan  the british voted to leave the european union five months before mr  trumps victory  the reverse was true in the 1990s  when bill clintons election anticipated that of tony blair if the two countries are both vulnerable to gridlock  that is partly for historic reasons  as two of the worlds oldest democracies  they spring from the same  centuries old model  the electoral system known as first past the post or winner take all  democracies that developed later  like sweden and finland  introduced proportional representation  which allows for smaller parties to enter parliament winner take all  by contrast  tends to increase polarization between two large parties  and exaggerate geographical divides  setting up stark conflict between sections of society and if britain traditionally had a strong  stable  efficient central state that wielded control over policymaking  this has been changing  as parliament reasserts its power to block the governments agenda  much as a house of representatives controlled by the democrats is thwarting mr  trump in my lifetime  britain has never been in a more fragile state  said matthew goodwin  an author of national populism  the revolt against liberal democracy  british politics is in an almost nonstop state of crisis  there are very high levels of polarization both countries have seen the mainstream center really be squeezed  mr  goodwin added  that moderate  pluralistic marketplace of ideas  thats really been challenged  both countries have seen the rise of populist entrepreneurs the most successful of these populist entrepreneurs is mr  trump  though he is adapting only fitfully to the realities of divided government in washington  mr  bannon cast the standoff over the wall as a case of the establishment striking back against mr  trumps insurgent victory in 2016 i call it the nullification project  he said  theyre not going to let you run on those populist themes and then implement them  if youre going to be a disrupter  youre going to have to take it from them mr  kagan argued that the paralysis in washington and london was not a case of populists versus elites  but merely democracies showing their periodic inability to settle deeply rooted divisions in society  and some argue that is not necessarily a bad thing the process of consensus has broken down  but neither side is capable of imposing its will on the other side  mr  lind said  the purpose of having veto points is to build an eventual consensus  its not to paralyze things forever in washington  mr  trump may break the impasse by declaring his emergency  a risky assertion of executive power that would be challenged in the courts but would enable the government to reopen  either way  the fate of the united states will not hang in the balance in london  where the political and economic consequences of a chaotic departure from europe are far more profound  it is much more difficult to compromise  mr  lind said  the side that loses is really  really going to lose .

the next issue delivered to your inbox when brian posada was growing up in the mexican border city of mexicali  the other children would tease him about his name  brian  the name  was so american  brian  the boy  never identified that way  he had been born in las vegas  yes  but he lived there for just one year with his undocumented mother before moving with her back to mexico  he never learned english these days  mr  posada  19  sees things differently  he makes the short trip between his two lives several times a week  crossing from mexicali  where he still lives  over a broad walkway to the california border town of calexico  where he sees his future i walked home with him one day last week  beginning in calexicos overcast downtown plaza  within sight of the border fence  music blasted loudly in spanish from a nearby stereo store  as he pushed past the turnstile to cross into mexico  mr  posada gazed quietly at the farm workers on their way back to mexico from american field jobs  their faces worn and muddy in mexicali  his tone turned a bit caustic  he averted his gaze from indigent seniors splayed out on the ground asking for money  he pointed at the irony of a church situated next door to a brothel this is what youll find here  he said  poverty  drugs and prostitution if his feelings toward his american citizenship had been fraught in the past  adulthood clarified a few things  he began to wonder what it meant that he was technically american  what opportunities might be open  he started working toward an american high school equivalency diploma  though he admits his lack of english proficiency remains a significant obstacle my mom told me a short time ago  look  i couldnt give you nice things like other people have  but i gave you american citizenship  which is what so many people are fighting for  he said he recognizes that now  but i feel mexican  im not going to lie to you  he said when he turned 18  seeking a foothold to life in the united states  mr  posada got a job at one of the nearby farms that supply a large portion of americans winter vegetables  it was backbreaking work  he would awaken at 1 a m  and cross the border with other migrant farmworkers and begin picking by 3  he saw the physical toll the work had taken on mexican men who had done it for decades that was not the future he wanted  he thought  its a job that kills you now  he has a job registering low income residents of calexico for government funded wireless plans on cellphones once colloquially known as obama phones  because nearly everyone in calexico speaks spanish  mr  posada can do the job without language getting in the way but its a competitive business in a poor area like calexico  and not necessarily lucrative for people like mr  posada  who works on commission  on the day that we met up  he had signed up two customers  making  20 for a days work we crossed back into mexicali to meet with a friend of his at the plaza la cachanilla  a mall with clothing stores  piercing stands and anime shops  his friend  ivan  is also mexican and speaks good english  he agreed to help mr  posada draw up a study plan to work on the diploma coursework  theyd work together  he offered hows that  hes mexican  but he can speak english  mr  posada said  smiling toward his friend  hopefully he can help me as i waited for a taxi to head back across the border  i shouted to him  see you soon he asked me to say it again  then one more time after that  he repeated the words to himself a few times under his breath  then grinned  see you soon  he yelled

crossingtheborder nytimes com mark napier is the sheriff of pima county  ariz   which includes tucson and 125 miles of border  since taking office in 2017  mr  napier  a republican  has drawn headlines for criticizing president trumps focus on a border wall  he appeared on an episode of the daily podcast last month to talk about the border wall he recently spoke with manny fernandez  the houston bureau chief of the new york times  to offer a view from the front lines of the drug war  the following is an edited and condensed version of that conversation q  whats the current state of drug trafficking in your county a  the nature of the drug war has fundamentally changed in the last 10 years  it used to be primarily large quantities of marijuana coming in between the ports of entry  and that was the major threat  and that drug trade seemed to be very  very violent and not as well organized or as sophisticated as the current drug trade  now what were seeing are unimaginably large quantities of hard drugs  and it is true  that primarily we see it coming through the ports of entry  because thats a current vulnerability  the drug cartels will always exploit whatever the current vulnerability is we just in the last couple of weeks interdicted 14 pounds of heroin  you go back five or six years ago  that was unimaginable  and multiple pounds of methamphetamine and 10 000 fentanyl pills  now think of that  10 000  each one of those is a potential overdose what was a typical load of heroin a few years ago years ago  were talking in ounces  if you interdicted in our area several ounces of heroin  or methamphetamine for that matter  that was a big deal  that was a pretty good collar  now were talking about pounds what does the fall of el chapo  the mexican drug lord  mean to a local sheriff on the ground on the border   read more here about the conviction of joaqun guzmn loera  the crime lord known as el chapo  and read here about how drug money still lubricates the u s  mexico border  we have to understand that the drug cartels are the ultimate entrepreneurial organizations  when you take down an alleged kingpin like el chapo  there is succession planning there  i mean  theyre a business  while that does help  and maybe creates a little void in the organizational function for awhile  theres so much money involved  that that will be filled very rapidly  and theyll be back in business one thing thats missing from the discourse about how we discuss this problem  which is unfortunate  is dealing with the demand side of the equation  the fundamental fact is this  as long as we have this appetite for illegal drugs in this country  there will be somebody somewhere finding a way to satisfy that  and they will become incredibly creative about how to do it so our demand will create more el chapos its encouraging that we can bring significant elements of the drug cartels to justice  thats an encouraging sign  but i dont know that its going to be a long term fix or something that will significantly ameliorate the problems we have in our communities  that vacuum will be filled by another version of the same character late last week  the american civil liberties union and two other groups sued the trump administration over a recent policy requiring people who are seeking asylum to wait in mexico here are four ways to go deeper into the conversation

washington  the senate will vote wednesday on whether to cut off american military assistance for saudi arabias war in yemen  preparing again to rebuke president trump for his continued defense of the kingdom after the killing of the dissident journalist jamal khashoggi the yemen vote sets up something of a one two punch for senators hoping to defy the president  the second punch may land thursday  when the senate has the chance to give final passage to a resolution overturning the presidents declaration of a national emergency to secure funding for his border wall passage of the measures would prompt the first vetoes of mr  trumps presidency the resolution we will vote on in the senate tomorrow to end u s  support for the saudi led war in yemen is enormously important and historic  senator bernie sanders  independent of vermont  said tuesday in a statement  this war is both a humanitarian and a strategic disaster  and congress has the opportunity to end it supporters of the yemen resolution have faced a long and grueling road to get the legislation onto the presidents desk  the senate  led by the resolutions authors  mr  sanders  mike lee  republican of utah  and christopher s  murphy  democrat of connecticut  first passed the measure 56 to 41 in december  but paul d  ryan  the speaker at the time  refused to take up the resolution his successor  speaker nancy pelosi  did take it up  and the house easily passed it last month  but house democrats inadvertently derailed the process by supporting a surprise procedural motion offered by republicans to declare the chambers opposition to anti semitism  by attaching an unrelated amendment to the yemen resolution  the house ended its privileged status  which would have forced the senate to quickly take it up and send it to mr  trump wednesdays measure is essentially a do over and will have to again clear the house  while it is expected to pass  it may not enjoy the same level of republican support that it received in december  aides said the resolution gives the senate another opportunity to condemn a nearly four year conflict in yemen that has killed thousands of civilians and inflicted a devastating famine  it also underscores the simmering anger among senators even in the presidents party at his administrations tepid response to the killing of mr  khashoggi  a virginia based columnist for the washington post after first playing down his own intelligence officials reports that the saudi crown prince  mohammed bin salman  was responsible for the killing  mr  trump then blew past a legally mandated deadline that required the white house to report to congress whether it believed the prince was personally responsible for mr  khashoggis death the white house sent two aides from the state and treasury departments last week to a closed door briefing before the senate foreign relations committee to try to defuse the senators rising anger  but senators on the committee  hungry for either a justification for why the white house defied the congressional mandate or information about the crown princes role in the killing  left unimpressed it was a complete waste of time  senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina  told reporters afterward senator marco rubio  republican of florida  said it was time for the senate to act  adding that the chamber will have to decide whether its going to impose its own sanctions but the foreign relations committee  now overseen by senator jim risch of idaho  a trump loyalist  has yet to mark up bipartisan legislation  the measure  introduced last month by senator robert menendez of new jersey  the ranking member of the committee  and mr  graham  would prohibit certain arms sales to saudi arabia and impose sanctions on individuals supporting the houthis in yemen seeing as the trump administration has no intention of insisting on full accountability for mr  khashoggis murderers  it is time for congress to step in and impose real consequences to fundamentally re examine our relationship with the kingdom of saudi arabia and with the saudi led coalition in yemen  mr  menendez said in a statement mr  risch has pledged that the panel will not let the killing go  but he has also suggested that both the sanctions act and the yemen vote would be ineffective saudi arabia has engaged in acts that just are simply not acceptable  unfortunately  as i said  we hear a lot of descriptions about the problem  but we dont hear any answers  he said at a hearing considering the nomination of the ambassador to saudi arabia  there have been some modest suggestions that have been made  none of which would resolve the problem .
you could always slight the very rich by calling them moneybags  robber barons  fat cats or plutocrats  billionaire was a neutral word  grounded in math  such a person could spend  10 million a year  for 100 years  before the pile was gone then came howard schultz  a billionaire times two  insisting that people not use the b word in describing him  better to refer to the 540 americans in his sensitive class as people of means  for this he was roundly mocked  and rightly so the pushback to the pusher of our favorite south american drug is a fair start  but there is much more to clean up  for we live in a time when language has been weaponized for high crimes and petty cruelties  while neutralized when it should state the obvious  democracy may die in darkness  as the slogan of a rival newspaper has it  but it also slips away under cover of euphemism you can date it to republican repackaging of the estate tax as a death tax  or tax cuts for the rich morphing into tax relief for the overly burdened  and were french fries really freedom fries during a spasm of faux patriotism maybe the food marketers started us down this road when natural was slapped onto any label  turpentine  for example  which also happens to be gluten free  or big pharma  using wellness to describe treatment by drugs with names from a dance party  lyrica  celebrex  and then the cialis gets passed around all of that can be excused as framing to get an advantage  the democrats are doing it now with the green new deal and medicare for all  both of which sound pleasantly pie in the sky and historically resonant until you look at the details  which their sponsors didnt bother to do the most egregious of political language fraud  as george orwell noted in his seminal essay on the subject  is used for the defense of the indefensible  to that end  the trump administration has been a fount of criminal circumlocution we all know about alternative facts and truth isnt truth and fake news  used by the administration to describe reality  but less attention has been paid to this governments description of cages for young children separated from their parents  the trump administration has invented tender age shelters to defend the indefensible  it sounds so caring and trump is downgrading national emergency from something that comes with a siren for a soundtrack to just another term for cheap political expediency  it used to be a big deal for a reputable news organization to flat out call the president a liar  now  liar must be the most used descriptor linked to this president  its also the right word  but liar has lost its sting  because trump clearly doesnt care about telling the truth  as a journalist  id get in more trouble if i said the president is fat  my bad  i mean plus sized the word socialist is back in play  this term also used to sting  evoking cold war authoritarians and empty store shelves  that was true then  whats true now is that socialist has lost its meaning  especially among millennials  as peter buttigieg  the young presidential aspirant and mayor of south bend  ind   said if used to describe help for the elderly  subsidized college or affordable health care  socialist is a net plus  if it implies total government control without choice  its a loser  weve only just begun the modern reframing of this power word at the white house  executive time is the bogus term for the majority of the presidents day spent watching fox news hosts praise him  tweeting insults or playing virtual golf in the new room sized simulator just installed in the house where lincoln slept  kramer did more work in the seinfeld episode where he pretended to have a job the border wall is a complexifier  to use the odd word that multibillionaire jeff bezos introduced  but also central to trumpian newspeak  the wall doesnt exist  not in the form trump has described it  a great  great wall made of hardened concrete  and yet  itll soon be finished  how so in a masterstroke of up is down  trumps rally in el paso this week switched the build the wall slogan of his cult to finish the wall  as my colleagues at upshot showed  trump keeps weaseling out of his wall promise by changing the wording  a fence  a barrier  some german shepherds the language is crucial here  because its the central lie of his presidency  like schultz  trump wants to use his own verbal wallpaper to cover the truth  .

one night a year  during the state of the union address  president trump sets aside his affinity for combat to offer up 90 minutes of stand up comity to a national audience the agenda i will lay out this evening is not a republican agenda or a democrat agenda  mr  trump said  opening his speech on a conventionally presidential note on tuesday  it is the agenda of the american people  a couple of hours earlier  during a private lunch with network anchors that did not stay private long  mr  trump called senator chuck schumer  the democratic leader  nasty  described former vice president joseph r  biden jr  as dumb  ripped into senator john mccain  and derided senator elizabeth warren as pocahontas the speech itself  embedded with patriotic language and delivered in a reassuring tone  veered between two moods  combative and conciliatory  reflecting a president at a crossroads ahead of an uncertain 2019 here are four takeaways for more than a month  mr  trump has threatened to invoke a state of emergency along the southern border with mexico  in an attempt to circumvent congress  which has refused to give him  5 7 billion for a border wall but it was not until this week that senate republicans  many of whom vehemently oppose the idea on the grounds that it tramples legislative prerogative  made it clear that diverting funding from other projects for a wall  in the name of a national emergency  was a nonstarter for the moment  mr  trump heeded their wishes  the emergency declaration was not among his demands for increased border security it was  to a significant degree  an act of political self protection at the weekly republican senate lunch held in the capitol a few hours before mr  trumps speech  senator john thune of south dakota  the majority whip  was asked about the likelihood of the president invoking emergency powers  mr  thune replied by saying he believed that the president would avoid a confrontation with his own party because too many republicans opposed it  and it would take only four republican defections to pass a measure opposing the move mr  trump would do the right thing  he predicted  because all you have to do is count to four  mr  thune quipped  according to a person in attendance mr  trump began the night by optimistically playing up a new opportunity in american politics  if only we have the courage to seize it and he expressed support for a variety of popular initiatives that enjoy widespread popularity among democrats  including new funding to eradicate aids  a campaign to reduce childhood cancers and yet another commitment to try to fix the countrys crumbling infrastructure then  about 15 minutes into the address  mr  trump hit on an issue foremost in his consciousness  the looming threat of congressional investigations into his conduct first  he offered what amounted to a plea for the new democratic majority in the house to avoid ridiculous partisan investigations and cautioned his enemies not to seek revenge against him then came the bluntest of threats to the woman sitting behind him  speaker nancy pelosi  if there is going to be peace and legislation  there cannot be war and investigation  it just doesnt work that way  he said we must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad  he said already facing a divided congress  mr  trump has been rebuked by members of his own party in recent days over his decision to pull troops from syria and his demands for a border wall in response  he invoked two issues that have been used to rally divided conservatives for decades  the fights against abortion and socialism there could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days  he said  referring to efforts by democrats in new york and virginia to loosen restrictions on abortion rights in recent days  republicans on capitol hill have been circulating talking points urging them to highlight plans by democrats  including the freshman representative alexandria ocasio cortez of new york  to increase taxes on the wealthy here  in the united states  we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country  mr  trump said  america was founded on liberty and independence  and not government coercion  domination and control mr  trump dedicated several minutes to listing his economic accomplishments on behalf of women as he faced row upon row of seats occupied by democratic women wearing white  in a visual demonstration of their unprecedented power in a house run by one of their own no one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women  who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year  said mr  trump  who seemed genuinely surprised by the thunderous applause it evoked from women on both sides of the aisle you werent supposed to do that  said the president  who went on to praise the record breaking election of 117 women to congress in 2018 that  too  garnered a hearty ovation  he has a long way to go  however recent polls show that large majorities of women disapprove of his performance with 10 days left for congress to pass a border security package and avert another government shutdown  mr  trump devoted a significant portion of his speech to making the case for his signature campaign proposal  a wall at the southern border this is a smart  strategic  see through steel barrier  not just a simple concrete wall  he said  adding  simply put  walls work and walls save lives but as mr  trump raised the time frame to keep the government fully funded  the democrats tensed and republicans continued to applaud  representative ilhan omar  democrat of minnesota  buried her head in her hands  as he detailed a litany of familiar talking points about caravans marching toward the united states  there was a disgruntled round of groans  punctuated by a couple boos as they looked around at each other  shaking their heads  trump wants a border wall  heres whats in place already  representative veronica escobar  democrat of texas  whose district includes most of el paso  was visibly angry after mr  trump referenced her district and the decrease in crime  she appeared to mouth that it was safe before the wall and after the wall  oh my god  oh my god  she mouthed to her colleagues  her arms crossed as other representatives looked over in her direction there were also some unhappy murmurs when he described the increase in troops at the southern border and scoffs at his description of the savage ms 13 gang the audience for mr  trumps state of the union address looked like a striking sea of white  with democratic women  many dressed in white in a nod to the womens suffragist movement  sitting together  midway through the presidents speech  they did something completely unexpected  they stood up and cheered no one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women  who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year  mr  trump said  prompting the women to roar their approval  after all  many of them had new jobs  in the house  which they took from men you werent supposed to do that  the president said  smiling all americans can be proud that we have more women in the work force than ever before  mr  trump went on  adding  dont sit yet  youre going to like this and then he delivered his biggest applause line  exactly one century after congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote  we also have more women serving in congress than at any time before it was a striking moment for a president who has been routinely accused of misogyny  who paid hush money to a pornographic film actress and a playboy model and who spoke in vulgar terms as he admitted on videotape that he had sexually assaulted women stacey abrams  the former minority leader of the georgia legislature  narrowly lost her bid to be the first african american female governor in the south  but it was the way she lost  amid charges of voter suppression and vote rigging  that really rankled in choosing ms  abrams to give the democratic response  her partys leaders were tapping a crusader for voting rights  and that is what she delivered while i acknowledged the results of the 2018 election here in georgia  i did not and we cannot accept efforts to undermine our right to vote  ms  abrams said  this is the next battle for our democracy  one where all eligible citizens can have their say about the vision we want for our country  we must reject the cynicism that says allowing every eligible vote to be cast and counted is a power grab  americans understand that these are the values our brave men and women in uniform and our veterans risk their lives to defend she also tackled race  even as a democratic governor  ralph northam of virginia  fights for his political survival after photos of a man in black face and another in a ku klux klan robe emerged in his medical school yearbook we fought jim crow with the civil rights act and the voting rights act  yet we continue to confront racism from our past and in our present  she said  which is why we must hold everyone from the very highest offices to our own families accountable for racist words and deeds  and call racism what it is  wrong mr  trump plans to sit down with north koreas leader  kim jong un  this month in vietnam  a country chosen as a neutral location for their second nuclear summit meeting  but one that also has plenty of symbolic significance mr  trump hopes the meeting will jump start a diplomatic effort that has stalled since their first encounter  last june in singapore  while north korea since then has refrained from overtly provocative actions like testing nuclear warheads or ballistic missiles  it has yet to agree to actually give up any piece of its atomic arsenal much work remains to be done  but my relationship with kim jong un is a good one  mr  trump said  chairman kim and i will meet again on february 27th and 28th in vietnam after spending the first portion of his speech patting himself on the back for what he views as his administrations accomplishments  including low unemployment  mr  trump issued a stern warning to the democrats now in charge of the house an economic miracle is taking place in the united states  and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars  politics or ridiculous partisan investigations  he said  if there is going to be peace and legislation  there cannot be war and investigation  it just doesnt work that way speaker nancy pelosi smirked behind him  representative adam schiff of california  chairman of the house intelligence committee  smiled  he has already begin examining whether money laundering could have motivated mr  trumps coziness with russian oligarchs this years state of the union address was the second longest in recorded history  according to the american presidency project at the university of california  santa barbara  the projects data dates to 1964  tonights address surpassed mr  trumps first state of the union speech by about two minutes  but falls short of former president bill clintons 2000 address by about six minutes president trump delivered a message of bipartisan unity on tuesday night in his first address to congress in the new era of divided government  but any hope of enduring harmony was dispelled long before he arrived at the capitol mr  trump  who has warred with democrats for weeks over his plan to build a wall along the nations southwestern border  hoped to use the nationally televised speech to present himself as a leader who can work across party lines even as he continued to press lawmakers to give him money for the barrier together  we can break decades of political stalemate  mr  trump told lawmakers from the rostrum of the house of representatives  we can bridge old divisions  heal old wounds  build new coalitions  forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of americas future  the decision is ours to make mr  trump signaled that he would not back off his hard line immigration policies that have polarized the country  no issue better illustrates the divide between americas working class and americas political class than illegal immigration  he was to add  according to excerpts released by the white house  wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards read more from peter baker speaker nancy pelosi was spared any discomfort that might have come with the ritual introduction of the president of the united states  the president jumped the gun before she could utter the traditional  ladies and gentlemen  i give to you the president of the united states  mr  trump had already started speaking while mr  trump forgot to have ms  pelosi introduce him  another republican president  george w  bush  made a big deal of ms  pelosis introduction of him in 2007  the year she first became speaker tonight  i have a high privilege and distinct honor of my own  as the first president to begin the state of the union message with these words  madam speaker  mr  bush said then  fact check  what president trump got right and wrong in his speech .

washington  as he prepared to finally emerge from the white house on monday morning  after days of complaining that he had been cooped up there waiting for democrats to negotiate with him to end a 24 day government shutdown  president trump momentarily seemed to forget where he was headed getting ready to address the farm convention today in nashville  tennessee  the president said in a twitter message  see you in a little while farmers in tennessee would have to wait  mr  trump was actually scheduled to visit an agricultural conference in louisiana on monday  and when he did  he was on the ground for little more than two hours before flying back to the white house mr  trump has made it a repeated point of pride that he has been confined to the capital in recent weeks while waiting for his democratic adversaries to give in and agree to spending  5 8 billion on his border wall  but he has actually been stuck in what his allies say is an uncomfortable limbo  it has made him wax wistfully about being unable to visit mar a lago  his gilded bunker by the sea where if members disagree with him on anything  from the firmness of the house meatloaf recipe to his isolationist approach to foreign allies  they tend to keep those opinions to themselves so  unable to resume his weekend routine of soliciting friendly advice from club members on the patio or spending sunny mornings at his nearby golf club  mr  trump has tried to make the snowy confines of washington feel more like his palm beach cocoon the results are mixed since the shutdown began dec  22  mr  trump has left the white house fewer than 10 times  he has shared his shut in routine with america  when not at work in the oval office  he has frittered away the hours by watching the multiple flat screen tvs installed in the white house residence  gazing out of secured windows  tweeting at his enemies and phoning his friends wish i could share with everyone the beauty and majesty of being in the white house and looking outside at the snow filled lawns and rose garden  mr  trump tweeted on sunday as the chaos of an embittered capital was all but silenced by snow  melania trump  the first lady  then shared a photo of the wintry wonderland to give americans a visual but the flurry of tweets mr  trump sent shortly afterward attacking assorted perceived foes  including senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts  his first announced democratic opponent in 2020  and the billionaire jeff bezos  seemed to show that not even the most dedicated of homebody presidents is immune from a bout of cabin fever i think it was harmful to him psychologically that he didnt make it down here over the holidays  laurence leamer  a longtime palm beach resident who has known mr  trump since the 1990s and has written a book on mar a lago  wrote in an email  despite his impulsive exterior  hes a man of routine  and thats what mar a lago is all about both mr  trump and white house officials have said that he will remain in washington for as long as the shutdown persists  though allies expect him to give in and make an appearance in palm beach over the long martin luther king jr  day weekend in a statement  sarah huckabee sanders  mr  trumps press secretary  said the president was at work whether he was at the white house  one of his personal properties or riding on air force one the president is always working  ms  sanders said  during the time leading up to the shutdown and since  he has been almost entirely at the white house working to find solutions to deal with the humanitarian and national security crisis at our southern border democrats  ms  sanders added  have spent their time at beach resorts  watching broadway shows and attending cocktail receptions with lobbyists ms  sanders was referring to a trip organized by the political arm of the congressional hispanic caucus  which flew three dozen or so house members to san juan for two days of receptions and meetings on the damage to the island from hurricane maria as well as a performance of hamilton with its creator  lin manuel miranda  although republicans said speaker nancy pelosi was one of those attending  a spokesman said she  like the president  stayed in washington for the weekend a person familiar with the presidents thinking who spoke on the condition of anonymity described mr  trump as both a workaholic and a homebody  the president  that person said  has been sensitive to the criticism that he is vacationing when he visits his assorted properties on the weekends  when in fact that has been his preferred mode of weekending for decades stuck in washington over the weekend  mr  trump called into the fox news personality jeanine pirros tv show to remind americans that he was still in work mode in a lengthy phone call with ms  pirro on saturday evening  the president angrily defended his demand for  5 billion in border wall funding and attacked news reports that the f b i  has conducted an investigation into whether he has worked on behalf of russia and the president stated once again that he relished the idea of stewing at home alone i like the symbol of me being here and them being at some play in a nice location having a good time  mr  trump said  joining in the bashing of the puerto rico trip the last time mr  trump visited puerto rico  he was panned for throwing paper towels into a crowd i havent actually left the white house in months  mr  trump said to ms  pirro before acknowledging that he had in fact left  ive been here virtually every night  i guess every night other than one day i flew to iraq and then to germany to see our troops mr  trump has long enjoyed puttering around his homes  said timothy obrien  the author of the 2005 book trumpnation  the art of being the donald  the president does not enjoy extensive travel  or sleeping or eating under a roof that is not his own  and he has long imported friends and associates to visit him for dinner before he was president  mr  obrien wrote in an email  he favored the familiar because it allowed an antisocial teetotaler to mingle selectively with other people  on his own terms and under his control  before retreating back inside to do what he enjoys spending most of his time doing  sitting in front of a tv with a cheeseburger watching sports mr  leamer  the author  said that mr  trump is as isolated as any public figure could conceivably be  and added that mr  trumps gregarious exterior masked the habits of a loner  he has walled himself off from the rest of the world  mr  leamer said  he loves to go out and receive the accolades of his adoring supporters  but as soon as the applause dies out  hes back into his own private world at the conference in new orleans on monday  mr  trump received a standing ovation  the same reception he gets whenever supporters spot him at mar a lago  he praised the new orleans saints and bragged that an ally had placed about 100 phone calls to make sure that he would actually turn up then he returned to washington for another at home event  welcoming members of the clemson university football team to the white house to celebrate their national championship last year the president greeted reporters in the white house dining room  where he proudly displayed a table piled high with burgers from mcdonalds  wendys  and burger king  another table in back was covered with dominos pizza and fries ms  sanders had an explanation for the menu  putting it in political terms  because the democrats refuse to negotiate on border security  much of the residence staff at the white house is furloughed  so the president is personally paying for the event to be catered with some of everyones favorite fast foods mr  trump himself called it great american food  but maybe it was really something else  comfort food for a president who feels stuck at home .
the australia letter is a weekly newsletter from our australia bureau chief  sign up to get it by email    parliament approved a bill this week to allow medical evacuation for asylum seekers on nauru and manus over the opposition of prime minister scott morrison  throwing australia into another visceral debate over immigration in the coming months  with an election approaching  we can expect to hear all kinds of intense and moralistic rhetoric mr  morrison and his supporters are already arguing that opening the door even a little to settlement in australia will encourage a flood of migrants and deaths at sea  labor  the greens and others on the left are maintaining that immigration is a net positive for australia and that cruelty must be restrained this is all part of a broader conversation across the west about migration and national identity  the white house announced just today that president trump will declare a state of emergency to build a border wall and its a conversation that matters  these disputes  however they end up  will shape many countries  and the world  for decades but for me  theres a certain familiarity to the discussion  not just in washington but also in canberra ive written about immigration for nearly 20 years  from various countries  from the neighborhoods and towns where immigrants cluster to the halls of power where decisions are made along the way  there are a few things ive learned to look out for the hero vs  villain trapin heated moments like this one  immigrants and the nuances of their lives and motivations tend to be reduced to the most simplistic of archetypes either they are criminals  the worst of the worst  rapists  murders  pedophiles  or they are blameless hard working heroes  say  doctors or professional basketball players from australia in the n b a   the reality  and this should be obvious  but often gets overlooked  is that most migrants are in the messy middle with the rest of us  theyre good and bad  theyre parents and workers  and theyre mostly just trying to make life a little bit better for themselves and their loved ones this idea that they are somehow different and more extreme reflects little more than the political need for narrative and division  beware of the packaging of simplicity its a fact free zonewhen i was reporting a series of stories back in 2012  the first to show that the era of mass mexican migration was over  an expert i talked to warned that policymakers would ignore my findings immigration  he said  is an issue driven by emotion  its a fact free zone  he said  and he was right no matter how many cold hard facts get put into the public domain in the next few months  and i hope there are a lot of them  dont expect the politicians to adjust their arguments  theyre appealing less to the head than the heart and look out for whats missing too you probably wont hear anyone  for example  pointing out that the decision to migrate is typically a long term bet  calculated and paid for over several years  which rarely responds to immediate policy changes in predictable ways there are both push  from a country  and pull  to a country  factors and  according to sociologists and demographers  it is often impossible to make sweeping cause and effect conclusions based on one element alone every immigrant has a story all their own  people move and flee for reasons that often have very little to do with what policymakers do to deter or assist them interaction winsduring a long road trip from the mexican to the canadian border  for a project exploring immigration in middle america  i met dozens of americans with all kinds of views about immigration but there are two people  both older white women  who i still think about one was in farmers branch  texas  an area that had tried  but failed  to push out immigrants who might not be documented with a series of strict residential rental rules and policing  she told me through her locked screen door that she wanted tougher enforcement  she was afraid another was in wichita  in kansas  in an area that had gone from a declining white  working class community to one that was reviving but more mixed in terms of ethnicity and origin the womans name was francene sharp  you can read her full story here  but what stuck with me was her reaction to a break in at her home by some local mexican teenagers she had cause to be angry  but because shed spent years getting to know many of her other immigrant neighbors  including a friend who she called for help right after the break in  her response and her views were tempered and calm what she had  that the woman in texas did not  was real life interaction  enough of it to prevent her from making sweeping judgments about people or policy she relied on her own deep experience and a remarkable openness to combat the fact free zone and the hero villain trap border policy was on her radar  she was no supporter of open borders  but she was far more interested in why those teenagers who broke in were not at home studying  integration and community mattered more to her than border walls which brings me to what ill be looking for in this years australian  and american  immigration debate will there be people pushing the conversation beyond border enforcement and detention who  if anyone  will be asking  how can immigration be studied  discussed and shaped in conjunction with immigrants to ensure that australia  the country that often calls itself the worlds most successful multicultural nation  lives up to that promise now for a

all of donald trumps major policies have failed substantively  politically  or both  his one big legislative achievement  the 2017 tax cut  remains unpopular  his attacks on obamacare have only enhanced public approval of the program  his fearmongering has cemented majority opposition to his proposed border wall but while todays g o p  cant do policy  it commands a powerful propaganda machine  and this machine is now dedicated to a strategy of portraying democrats as extremists  it might work  but it shouldnt  because democrats arent extremists  but republicans are the attack on democrats has largely involved demonizing two new members of congress  representative ilhan omar and representative alexandria ocasio cortez  omar is muslim  and the usual suspects have gone all out in using an out of context quotation to portray her  completely falsely  as sympathetic to terrorists  aoc  who calls herself a democratic socialist  although shes really just a social democrat  has been the subject of obsessive coverage on the right  over a six week period  fox news and fox business mentioned her more than 3 000 times  invariably portraying her as ignorant  radical  or both its surely not an accident that these two principal targets are both women of color  theres a sense in which supposed concerns about extremism are just a cover for sexism and white nationalism  but its still worth pointing out that while both omar and aoc are on the left of the democratic party  neither is staking out policy positions that are extreme compared with either expert views or public opinion take aocs famous advocacy of a 70 percent tax rate on very high incomes  economists who knew anything about public finance immediately recognized that number as coming from a widely cited paper by peter diamond and emmanuel saez  two of the fields leading figures  you dont have to agree with their analysis to recognize that aoc  far from showing her ignorance  was actually drawing on solid research  for an even deeper look at whats on paul krugmans mind  sign up for his weekly newsletter  nor does the public find the idea outrageous  an overwhelming majority believe that people with high incomes pay too little in taxes  and polls show wide support for aocs proposal is echoing leading experts and matching popular opinion extremist  actually  what aocs position on the democratic left tells us is that the party as a whole is  if anything  to the right of the general public on major policy issues republicans  on the other hand  really are extremists  as thomas mann and norman ornstein put it in 2012  long before the rise of trump  the modern g o p  is ideologically extreme and uninterested in facts  evidence  and science  for example  major figures in the party routinely dismiss global warming as a hoax perpetrated by a vast global conspiracy or consider the views of stephen moore  who trump is trying to put on the board of the federal reserve what you need to know about moore  aside from his inability to get facts right  is that  unlike herman cain  trumps other fed pick  hes very much a part of the right wing establishment  hes a former editorial writer for the wall street journal  a former chief economist at the heritage foundation  a fixture at conferences like freedomfest  given this background  it may not be surprising that hes a firm believer in failed economic doctrines  especially the insistence that tax cuts for the wealthy have magical effects whats coming out only now  however  is the extent of moores political extremism  many of his past statements  like his assertion that capitalism is a lot more important than democracy  sound like a liberal caricature of conservatism  but its not a caricature  moore shows us what the right actually thinks i mentioned that an overwhelming majority of americans believe that the rich pay too little in taxes  moore  on the other hand  wants to eliminate income taxes and replace them with sales taxes  which would dramatically shift the tax burden away from the rich and onto the middle class  and he has called the 16th amendment  which created the federal income tax  the most evil act that has passed in 100 years he also wants to privatize social security  a program that is both hugely popular and the bedrock of retirement security for american workers  moore would convert it into a 401 k  type system  he is also fiercely hostile to medicaid  which covers 65 million americans finally  moore has proposed  in advance  a purge of the institution trump wants him to join  calling for firing hundreds of federal reserve economists who are worthless  these would  presumably  be the economists who considered low interest rates and monetary expansion valuable tools in fighting the great recession  at the same time moore was predicting that these policies would send inflation soaring  guess who was right so even if you cherry pick left leaning democrats  a look at their actual positions shows them to be not at all extreme  at the same time  pillars of the right wing establishment hold views that are utterly at odds with both evidence and public opinion  republicans are the real extremists .
sacramento  calif   california gov  gavin newsom has kept up a frenetic pace in his first 100 days  jousting with president donald trump  traveling to central america  placing a moratorium on executions and pledging bold action on housing and clean water it s in contrast to jerry brown  his predecessor and fellow democrat who favored a more measured approach to governing the nation s most populous state  while newsom publicly reveres brown  he s said it s time for a greater emphasize on poverty and affordability issues  he s substantially altered two of brown s signature projects  the high speed rail and twin water tunnels  but says it s with an eye toward improvement in a monday interview with the associated press  newsom summed up his approach   i could wait for things to take shape and hope things come around  or i could try to advance an agenda and hold myself to a higher level of accountability      i m willing to take the heat on these things  i m willing to engage on the front end not the back end  battling trumpcalifornia has added several lawsuits to its 40 plus against the trump administration under newsom  including one to block an emergency declaration to pay for a border wall in removing most national guard troops from the border  newsom called trump s immigration actions  absurd  he s also moved to protect the individual mandate that requires people to buy health care and slammed trump s threats to withhold federal emergency aid from last year s wildfires  we have to be the positive alternative to trump and trumpism   newsom said el salvadornewsom visited el salvador this month to learn about the poverty and violence forcing thousands to seek asylum in the united states he defended the trip against critics who said he should instead focus on poverty at home  i don t know of another issue that s more resonant and more topical and relevant  in california and this nation  than the issue of asylum seekers  the issue of immigration   he said but a governor has limited power over immigration and the most tangible idea newsom left with centered on economic development  he said california could help el salvador market its surfing industry and invited salvadoran officials to california to pitch investors death penaltynewsom s most significant action may be his moratorium on executions for the 737 people on death row the state hasn t executed anyone since 2006  but voters passed a ballot measure in 2016 to speed up the process  newsom said he couldn t allow it knowing the state might execute innocent people he also dismantled the  death chamber  at san quentin state prison and halted lethal injection protocols he may go a step further in commuting some death row sentences entirely  but he said monday he s waiting for clarity from the state supreme court  which blocked several of brown s commutation requests relatives of murder victims have launched a tour urging newsom to change his mind high speed railnewsom s changes to a troubled high speed rail project marked a challenge to brown s priorities and a lesson in the perils of an unclear message he declared there wasn t a current path to complete the train from los angeles to san francisco  his office them scrambled to clarify newsom was still committed to the project the confusion gave trump an opening to threaten pulling back  3 5 billion for the project  that would drastically undercut the state s ability to finish current construction in the central valley the state s high speed rail agency will release an updated plan to lawmakers may 1  newsom wants to build 171 miles  275 kilometers  of track in the central valley before heading west to the san francisco bay area he said his remarks were designed to address the project s ballooning costs and unrealistic deadlines newsom chafed at suggestions he was dismantling brown s legacy  in the same february speech  he also rolled back brown s plan to build two giant tunnels to reroute the state s water  saying he favored one affordability and povertynewsom has already sued one city for failing to meet its housing goals and threatened to take away transportation funding from others that don t comply  lawmakers are skeptical about the idea of linking money for road repairs to housing  perhaps sensing their resistance  newsom drafted sample legislation that wouldn t link that money until 2023 in his budget  newsom gave  1 billion in tax credits and loans to accelerate housing development and added  750 million to help local governments ramp up housing production  all of that is still winding through the legislature newsom also said addressing the state s affordability crisis is a priority he has focused on improving access to clean water in the central valley  where he said as many as a million people don t have drinkable water he s proposed a tax on water users and farmers  an idea that failed in the legislature last year  he visited a town with water problems during his first week in office  it s my effort to change the conversation from last year that ended up short   he said .

washington  william p  barr  president trumps nominee for attorney general  assured senators at his confirmation hearing on tuesday that he would permit the special counsel  robert s  mueller iii  to complete the russia investigation and said he was determined to resist any pressure from mr  trump to use law enforcement for political purposes mr  barr  whose confirmation seems virtually assured  pointed to his age and background  he served as attorney general from 1991 to 1993  as buffers to potential intrusions on the justice departments traditional independence  he suggested he had no further political aspirations that might cloud his judgment  the way that future ambitions might give pause to a younger nominee  as well as the experience to fight political interference i am in a position in life where i can provide the leadership necessary to protect the independence and reputation of the department  mr  barr  68  told the senate judiciary committee  adding that he would not hesitate to resign if mr  trump pushed him to act improperly i will not be bullied into doing anything i think is wrong  by anybody  whether it be editorial boards or congress or the president  mr  barr said  im going to do what i think is right he also pledged that he would refuse any order from mr  trump either to fire mr  mueller without good cause in violation of regulations or to rescind those rules first it is in the best interest of everyone  the president  congress and  most importantly  the american people  that this matter be resolved by allowing the special counsel to complete his work  mr  barr said mr  barrs first stint as attorney general came under president george bush  who was known for his prudent and measured approach  if confirmed  mr  barr would serve under a president hardly known for self restraint  mr  trump repeatedly excoriated jeff sessions  the former attorney general  for recusing himself from the russia investigation  which mr  trump has called a witch hunt  and pushed him to open criminal investigations into political adversaries like hillary clinton  president trump says he alone can do it  his attorney general nominee usually agrees  over hours of testimony  mr  barr displayed a grasp of policy and demonstrated his experience as a washington hand and member of the republican legal establishment  he is expected to be confirmed  both because republicans control the senate and because democrats are deeply suspicious of matthew g  whitaker  the acting attorney general whom mr  trump installed after ousting mr  sessions in november mr  barr is qualified by any reasonable standard  senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina and the committees chairman  said after the hearing  adding that he saw no reason to doubt mr  barr would be confirmed  and if hes not qualified  i dont know who they are ever going to pick during his testimony  mr  barr described being asked whether he was interested in joining mr  trumps defense team in june 2017 by a friend of the presidents  although mr  barr agreed to meet with mr  trump  and told him  he said  that mr  mueller was both a personal friend and a straight shooter who should be dealt with as such  he declined to join his legal team my wife and i were sort of looking forward to a bit of respite  and i didnt want to stick my head into that meat grinder  mr  barr said asked by senator richard j  durbin  democrat of illinois  why as a rational person he would want the job after seeing mr  trumps unrelenting criticism of mr  sessions  mr  barr portrayed himself as an institutionalist because i love the department and all its components  including the f b i   mr  barr said  i think they are critical institutions that are essential to preserving the rule of law  which is the heartbeat of this country mr  barrs testimony also touched on many other issues regarding mr  trumps demand for funding for a border wall  which has prompted the longest government shutdown in american history  mr  barr expressed qualified support for expanding barriers along the border with mexico where they could be part of common sense immigration enforcement  but he sidestepped questions about whether mr  trump could lawfully redirect military funds to build a wall without congressional authorization  as the president has threatened to invoke emergency powers to do asked by senator dianne feinstein  democrat of california  about remarks he made in 2005 defending the george w  bush administrations enhanced interrogation techniques program and the idea that it was lawful to use pain  discomfort and other things to make people talk so long as it does not cross the line to torture  mr  barr said he would obey and uphold a 2015 law restricting american interrogators to using only those techniques listed in the army field manual under questioning about whether he had sought to push out the deputy attorney general  rod j  rosenstein  who is widely expected to leave if mr  barr is confirmed  the nominee said he had not  and  indeed  had asked mr  rosenstein to stay on longer for a transition period and he assured senators from both parties that his views on the criminal justice system had evolved from the early 1990s  when he advocated stiffer sentences for drug offenders  and that he would fully carry out substantial sentencing and prison law changes passed last month but the hearing repeatedly returned to russias attempts to manipulate the american election process and the open investigation by mr  mueller into moscows campaign of subversion  and possible links to mr  trump and his associates early in the hearing  mr  graham brought up the f b i s newly revealed counterintelligence investigation into whether the president was working with the russians  asking incredulously whether mr  barr had heard of such a thing in all the time you have been associated with the department when mr  barr answered that he had not  mr  graham sought and obtained mr  barrs assurance that he would look into who opened the investigation into the president at the f b i  or the justice department and to tell the committee whether it was appropriate later  mr  barr also defended as entirely proper his decision to write an unsolicited  lengthy memo to the trump administration legal team in june arguing that laws against obstruction of justice cannot criminalize a presidents use of his constitutional powers  like when mr  trump fired james b  comey as f b i  director insisting he had not been not trying to ingratiate himself with the trump administration by writing the memo  mr  barr played it down as based on mere speculation about the basis for mr  muellers obstruction inquiry  he said that he believed that other potential actions by a president  like witness tampering  would be a legitimate basis for an obstruction investigation in any case  mr  barr repeatedly said he would let mr  mueller  whom he described as a friend of his for decades  finish his work and dismissed mr  trumps attacks on the inquiry i dont believe mr  mueller would be involved in a witch hunt  mr  barr said  but in another moment  he called mr  trumps use of that term understandable and refused to criticize the presidents attacks on mr  mueller and the justice department mr  barr also appeared to emphasize a softer vision of presidential power than the unusually expansive view he has largely advanced throughout his career  for example  previously portraying the president instead of the attorney general as the nations top law enforcement official  who wields unfettered power to start or stop a law enforcement proceeding his philosophy on executive authority has raised the question of whether his permissive theories would unleash mr  trump  but in several ways on tuesday  mr  barr appeared to walk back or qualify some of his earlier writings  putting greater emphasis on the justice departments independence and legal limits on the presidency for example  mr  barr said that if a president directed the department to close an investigation to protect himself or his family  that would violate the constitution  and asked by senator patrick j  leahy  democrat of vermont  whether a president could pardon someone in exchange for a promise not to incriminate him  mr  barr said  that would be a crime he also pledged to seek the advice of ethics lawyers in the justice department about whether he should recuse himself from overseeing the russia inquiry  while stopping short of committing to accepting their recommendation  late last year  justice department ethics officials recommended to mr  whitaker that he recuse himself from overseeing that investigation  but mr  whitaker declined to do so separately  representative jerrold nadler  democrat of new york and the chairman of the house judiciary committee  announced in a letter on tuesday that mr  whitaker had agreed to testify publicly before his committee on feb  8  regardless of the status of the border wall impasse or whether or not the senate has confirmed a new attorney general  the hearing promises to be a blockbuster session  and should turn on many of the same questions mr  barr faced  including about mr  mueller the fate of mr  muellers findings  an expected report  was a recurring topic  mr  barr said that mr  muellers report to the attorney general would be confidential  but that the attorney general would then produce his own report to congress based on that material  he said that he intended to be as transparent as possible given grand jury secrecy rules  but that he would not let the white house edit or change it  as the presidents lawyer rudolph w  giuliani had suggested might occur that will not happen  mr  barr said .
game of thrones returns on sunday  and with it  the inevitable onslaught of winter is finally here memes and a sudden obsession with dragons  knights and internecine feudal politics  but the show isn t just warmed over fantasy tropes  its conflicts have become part of our public discourse  and westeros  its fictional kingdom  has become an allegory for america this isnt the first time a medieval fantasy has served this purpose  lord of the rings grew out of j r r  tolkiens traumatic experiences as a soldier in world war i  it achieved widespread popularity in the united states during the 1960s and 70s  when hippies joked about electing the wise wizard gandalf as president and wore frodo lives  buttons  an emblem of their solidarity with the idyllic  communal life of the shire  after the sept  11 attacks  the massive multiplayer game world of warcraft dominated the global gaming market  its story of war between the orc led horde and human led alliance was set in an immersive  intricately detailed medieval fantasy world  j k  rowlings harry potter novels  in which the young heroes battle an evil wizard who perverts democracy  climbed the best seller lists during the same period  magic rules all of these realms  reducing complex social and political conflicts to battles over spells and ensorcellment whenever theres trouble in the land  it seems  our narrative appetites lead us backward in time  offering escape in tales of a world before modern statehood and techno capitalism  but escapism isnt just a flight from reality  ursula le guin  the celebrated fantasy author  once asked  if a soldier is imprisoned by the enemy  dont we consider it his duty to escape  she was writing about tolkien  arguing that escapism in all its forms is a survival strategy  a way to think ourselves out of traps  in ms  le guins earthsea novels  wizards craft magic out of words  trying to prevent a creeping global sickness by  in essence  telling the right story  if we think of fantasy as a way to escape from a dark fate  game of thrones is a skeleton key  in that case  what is the prison  and why does the path always seem to lead through the middle ages  one possible answer is that game of thrones is not actually about the past at all  it fits within a long tradition of books suggesting that our planets distant future might look a lot like the distant past  this idea goes back generations  in edgar rice burroughss pulpy 1912 novella a princess of mars  a medieval martian civilization is all that remains of a previously hyper advanced  technologically sophisticated world  jack vances wildly popular 1950s series dying earth imagined an earth so old that its sun is fading  the moon is gone and magic rules  more recently  david mitchells cloud atlas and n k  jemisins broken earth trilogy hint that the far future might look very much like ancient history  both authors describe worlds in which people have returned to neolithic or medieval ways of life  largely because their civilizations have made catastrophic political and environmental mistakes it isnt easy to imagine our distant future without fiction  we have computer models to forecast what centuries of climate change might do to the earth  and some vague notions of how this might transform our social and economic systems  but when the crisis at hand is about elections and economic recessions  its hard to make decisions that take that faraway world into account  perhaps game of thrones functions as a cultural reset button  inviting us to imagine how we might redo nationhood and industrialism if we had the chance  what if we could enter the modern era again  and do it right this time  maybe this time  enlightened despots wont grind up the peasants in an endless war thats why pseudo historical stories are  oddly  the keys to thinking about what comes next for planet earth  will our fortified border walls be all that remains after climate disaster  or will we finally put aside political rivalries to save ourselves  we can explore our options while acknowledging the likelihood that well make mistakes game of thrones feels relevant now  not simply because it allows us to speculate about which terrible real life leader most resembles the sadistic king joffrey  or see how climate change can blight the land with supernatural force  like other medieval tales  game of thrones is not a precise allegory  instead  it slakes our thirst for narratives that remind us that humanity will have a distant future  in whatever form it takes  we are building it right now in the near future  as we face the increasing likelihood of catastrophe  we need to unleash our imagination  we will need it to find the escape route  .
washington  under pressure to show they have solutions  democrats are honing proposals to address the surge of families entering the u s  at the southern border  a problem they say president donald trump s restrictive immigration policies are enflaming house democrats plan to introduce legislation soon addressing the recent waves of central american migrants reaching the border  senate democrats are pursuing multiple tracks  including exploring whether talks with the white house might be feasible the house measure  described by lawmakers  aides and lobbyists  would stand virtually no chance of winning approval by the republican led senate  let alone getting trump s signature  but it would let democrats show voters they re responsive to the rush of migrants that has overwhelmed federal officials and left border communities struggling to cope  rather than simply objecting to trump s moves the bill  which participants said is still being finalized  is expected to increase federal resources at border entry points for processing refugees  counseling children and treating people needing medical care  it would create centers in central america where asylum applications could be processed and provide aid to reduce poverty and violence in the region so fewer people would flee  you don t just wait for people to show up at the border  it s the worst way to deal with it   said rep  zoe lofgren  d calif   who s working on the legislation with house judiciary committee chairman jerrold nadler  d n y   and party leaders the measure represents democrats  effort to find the sweet spot between addressing a burgeoning humanitarian crisis and not lending credibility to trump s assertion that hordes of immigrants are invading the country  they say trump has exacerbated the situation by aggressively detaining migrants caught entering the u s  illegally and slowing the processing of asylum seekers  which can take months or longer  this is a manufactured crisis   said rep  ruben gallego  d ariz trump has accused democrats of  obstructing   he complained tuesday about their refusal to tighten asylum laws  restrict legal immigration by relatives of migrants already here or ban the release of detained migrants until their court dates  a practice used by recent administrations  including his own  they don t want to act   trump said in the senate  sen  dianne feinstein  d calif   a senior member of the judiciary committee  said she plans to introduce a bill that would beef up immigration courts to reduce a huge backlog of cases and prohibit separations of migrant families   the measure would face an uphill climb sen  dick durbin  d ill   said democrats were in early discussions about what legislation to craft and were trying to arrange meetings with the white house on the issue  but he cautioned that last year s collapse of immigration talks with trump did not bode well  this president is not an easy person to work with on this subject   said durbin  senate democrats  no  2 leader no one disputes that the number of migrants seeking entry into the u s  is swelling  authorities were expecting to prevent 100 000 people  mostly families  from crossing the southern border last month  the most in 12 years in response  trump has moved to cut nearly  500 million in aid to honduras  guatemala and el salvador  whose citizens have trekked toward the u s  in growing numbers  he has curbed the number of asylum applications that authorities process  he has been blocked by a federal court from forcing refugees to wait in mexico while their cases are decided  and he has warned he ll close the southwest border  a threat he s intermittently eased and renewed frustrated with his team s resistance to carry out some of his policy proposals  he s also replaced homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen and moved to purge other top officials at the department  democrats  joined by many republicans  said trump s shake up was unwise  he doesn t like the law   said no  2 house leader steny hoyer  d md   and he s firing people who are determined that they have to act within the confines of the law  i think that s very dangerous  trump says the u s  faces a security and humanitarian calamity  in a letter to lawmakers last month  nielsen asked for  immediate congressional assistance  to address  a system wide meltdown   she requested funds for more detention beds  medical teams and processing facilities but specified no dollar amounts democrats are skeptical of such requests  they ve already taken and transferred money from things to their ridiculous wall   said rep  pramila jayapal  d wash   referring to trump s effort to build a border wall that democrats have mocked as ineffective   it s pretty difficult for me to say i d give them more  i d have a lot more accountability built in  and i d cut the amount we re giving to homeland security until they can show us they really need it  democrats contend that trump s goal is to rile up his conservative voters as his 2020 re election campaign gets underway  he s shown that over and over  he s just anti immigrant  and this is a campaign talking point for him   said rep  nanette barragan  d calif republicans say democrats are simply out to block trump  they don t want to give trump any victory on anything  ever   said rep  john katko  r n y   a member of the house homeland security committee    associated press writer darlene superville contributed to this report .

oakland  calif   senator kamala harris of california officially kicked off her campaign for the democratic presidential nomination on sunday at an outdoor rally where she warned that the nation and the world were at an inflection point in history and called on all americans to speak truth about whats happening in the trump era before a crowd that her advisers estimated at more than 20 000 people  ms  harris threaded together a biography from her years in the bay area with her work as a prosecutor and a senator  and set those details against a broader populist vision about running to be president of the people  by the people and for all people  follow the democratic presidential field with our new candidate tracker ms  harris  54  who became the second black woman to serve in the united states senate when she took office in 2017  has joined an increasingly crowded field of democratic candidates that lacks a front runner  the pack is the most diverse in history  with ms  harris among four women currently serving in the senate or house who are now running for the democratic nomination in her remarks and at other recent events  she stressed unity and fighting for people  and her support for policies that are currently popular among democrats  like medicare for all and combating climate change  but she also laid out a vision of america and cast the 2020 election as a historic one we are at an inflection point in the history of our world  she said at the rally in downtown oakland  we are at an inflection point in the history of our nation  we are here because the american dream and our american democracy are under attack and on the line like never before  and we are here at this moment in time because we must answer a fundamental question  who are we  who are we as americans when we have leaders who bully and attack a free press and undermine our democratic institutions  thats not our america  she said  when white supremacists march and murder in charlottesville or massacre innocent worshipers in a pittsburgh synagogue  thats not our america  when we have children in cages crying for their mothers and fathers  dont you dare call that border security  thats a human rights abuse ms  harris spoke of an america where we welcome refugees and denounced president trumps border wall plan as a medieval vanity project ms  harris also pledged  if i have the honor of being your president i will tell you this  i am not perfect  lord knows  i am not perfect  but i will always speak with decency and moral clarity and treat all people with dignity and respect  i will lead with integrity  and i will tell the truth among those at the rally were lyndsey schlax  38  a school administrator  who attended with her husband and two sons ive been a big fan of kamala for a long time  said ms  schlax  who wore a phenomenal woman t shirt that she said was produced by a relative of ms  harriss  i like how shes not afraid to be strong violet sinnarkar  20  from san jose  who is currently a junior at the university of california berkeley  said many people she knew on campus were not fans of harris  they think shes a cop  ms  sinnarkar said about ms  harriss years as district attorney of san francisco and some past remarks praising law enforcement but ms  sinnarkar said she came with an open mind  im here to hear what she has to say while ms  harriss work as a prosecutor has drawn some criticism  she sought to frame her record as focused on helping regular people in my whole life  ive only had one client  the people  and fighting for the people meant fighting on behalf of survivors of sexual assault  a fight not just against predators  but a fight against silence and stigma  she said .

meetings in washington in a few weeks between a delegation of senior chinese officials  robert lighthizer  mr  trumps top trade negotiator  and steven mnuchin  the treasury secretary china  which appears hobbled by the trade war  has offered a mix of concessions  the u s  might be losing its leverage  as companies cut revenue forecasts and with future interest rate hikes on the horizon that could weaken the economy timing  both sides are trying to defuse trade tensions ahead of a march 2 deadline  when u s  tariffs on  200 billion of chinese goods will increase to 25 percent from 10 percent for years  educated uighurs functioned as a bridge between the minority muslim and turkic communities of far western china and the wealthier han chinese  working with them to better the lot of the minority group and preserve uighur culture but more than 100 uighur scholars  including university professors  computer programmers  poets and writers  have been swept up in the chinese governments crackdown in xinjiang  which has ensnared almost a million people in indoctrination camps why it matters  the detention of the most accomplished uighurs underscores the communist partys attempt to erase the communitys unique identity  and also removes a force that worked to integrate uighur society into modern china president tsai ing wen called on domestic and international support for the islands independence  a rebuke to xi jinping  the chinese president  who days earlier said unification with china was inevitable why it matters  the unusually firm comments helped ms  tsai position herself as a defender of democracy and inspired a groundswell of support ahead of next years elections  it also may reinforce support from the u s context  the u s  broke ties with taiwan in 1979  when it had been under martial law for decades  to establish full relations with beijing  since taiwan embraced democracy in the 1990s  many in washington have seen it as a like minded partner

washington  president trump declared on monday morning that he expects a very tremendous summit later this week with kim jong un  the north korean leader  suggesting again that his eventual goal is to convince mr  kim to abandon his nuclear weapons mr  trumps comments  at a breakfast meeting with the nations governors  followed a morning tweet in which he predicted that with complete denuclearization  north korea will rapidly become an economic powerhouse  mr  trump departed without further comment on air force one hours later for the flight to hanoi  vietnam  the site of the summit meeting on wednesday and thursday the presidents optimistic assessment came amid indications that the administration may be preparing to deliver something that mr  kim desperately wants  a joint political statement declaring an end to the korean war president moon jae in of south korea has also called for an end of war declaration  which could put pressure on the united states to withdraw the nearly 28 500 troops stationed in south korea  a move that the administration says it opposes  but it is uncertain how much progress toward denuclearization mr  trump is prepared to demand from mr  kim in exchange for a declaration of peace that would stop short of replacing the 1953 armistice ned price  a former spokesman for the national security council for president barack obama  on monday warned of what he called a pollyannaish approach by mr  trump that could lead the united states to give mr  kim too much in exchange for little real progress in abandoning his nuclear weapons the chance for a diplomatic resolution to north koreas nuclear ambitions is too critical an opportunity to allow trump to squander  mr  price wrote in an email message monday morning  we must be comfortable holding the trump administrations feet to the fire senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina  said it was mr  trumps strong tactics that pushed mr  kim into negotiations in the first place  but in his own series of tweets on monday morning  mr  graham described the upcoming talks in hanoi as our last  best chance to end the nuclear conflict with north korea on peaceful terms at a white house reception on sunday evening  mr  trump told the governors that he had told mr  kim that north korea could be one of the great financial and economic countries anywhere in the world  but only if the north gives up its nuclear weapons  mr  trump said it was unclear whether the north korean leader would agree we have a special feeling  and i think its going to lead to something very good  and maybe not  mr  trump said sunday  i think ultimately it will  but maybe not even as the president prepared to travel abroad  a series of monday morning tweets suggested that he remains focused on other topics closer to home  before meeting with the governors  mr  trump tweeted about oil prices  movie director spike lee  the nations economy and border security his tweet about mr  lee was a response to the directors call  during sundays academy awards broadcast  for mobilization against the president in the 2020 election at the governors breakfast  mr  trump repeated his belief in the need for a wall across the southwest border to stop illegal immigrants and drugs from coming into the united states  and he complained about migrants flowing into the country from central american countries mr  trump said he has told leaders in guatemala  honduras and el salvador to stop caravans of people from traveling through mexico toward the border with the united states theyre not sending their best  he said  adding that the central american countries are sending rough hombres  immigration advocates have said that most of the people in caravans are families fleeing gang violence and severe poverty mr  trumps foreign trip will keep him out of the united states for a week  but he is likely to be dogged by domestic issues while overseas on tuesday  congress is expected to vote on a resolution blocking mr  trump from declaring a national emergency so that he can fund construction of his border wall  if the resolution passes  that vote could lead to mr  trumps first ever veto the next day  on wednesday  michael d  cohen  the presidents one time personal lawyer and fixer  is scheduled to begin public testimony in front of a congressional committee  among the topics he is expected to discuss is his effort to help mr  trump block news stories that alleged his affairs with two women .
washington  president trumps confrontations with potential democratic challengers in 2020 have mostly been limited to sniping on twitter  but on monday night in el paso  he will engage in his most direct conflict with a possible rival  former representative beto orourke  a native of the city that shares a border with mexico mr  trumps rally in el paso is his most significant since the midterm elections that delivered the house of representatives to democrats  it will provide the president with a backdrop that he will use to again argue for a border wall to stop what he said is a surge of crime and drugs being brought into the country by migrants seeking illegal entry mr  orourke has been among those who have strongly rebutted the presidents case that el paso serves as an example of where building a wall has indeed provided a solution to crime if immigrants are good for the country  the border is secure and walls end lives instead of saving them  then why does the president try to scare us about immigrants and the border and take our land to build a wall we dont need  mr  orourke said on twitter mr  orourke has also used twitter to make his own case  fact by fact  that mr  trumps argument is flawed and inaccurate mr  trump is scheduled to begin speaking at a make america great again rally at the el paso county coliseum at 7 p m  mountain time  9 eastern   mr  orourke and his supporters will meet up at bowie high school at 5 p m   then march to chalio acosta sports center  about a half mile away  he will also begin speaking at 7 p m during his state of the union address last week  mr  trump falsely cited el paso as an example of a city where building a wall worked to deter crime the border city of el paso  tex   used to have extremely high rates of violent crime  one of the highest in the entire country  and was considered one of our nations most dangerous cities  now  immediately upon its building  with a powerful barrier in place  el paso is one of the safest cities in our country  he said  read about what president trump plans to discuss at his el paso rally  but before the border barriers were completed in el paso  in 2008  the city had the second lowest violent crime rate among more than 20 similarly sized american cities  in 2010  after the fence construction  it retained its ranking  also  el paso was never one of the most dangerous cities in the united states mr  trump relishes political combat and this is the first time in the 2020 election cycle that he will be on a dueling  if separate  stage with a democrat who may try to unseat him  mr  orourke told oprah winfrey that he would make a decision about running for president by the end of february it seems a near certainty that mr  trump will try to counter the protest in el paso and its unofficial leader  mr  orourke  how frontally he criticizes the former congressman  and whether he tries to brand him with a derogatory nickname will be measures of how seriously he takes mr  orourkes potential candidacy mr  orourke is the near opposite of the president in tone  during his losing senate campaign last year  he offered himself as a candidate who could bridge divides and wanted to go beyond convenient party labels  that modulated approach is seen as part of his larger appeal  he was able to attract donations nationwide and build a following even as he lost his race now he will face a different test in an opponent whose first instinct is to fight cable news outlets are expected to cover the rallies  and the president almost always takes priority over the words of someone who does not even hold elective office  this time may be different  at a minimum  prepare for a split screen approach that will offer the freshest soundings of what promises to be a long and bitter presidential campaign .
when he wrote it in 2016  the composer huang ruo couldnt have imagined that his immersive multimedia work resonant theater  the sonic great wall would be so timely  but before conducting it on monday at national sawdust in brooklyn  mr  ruo asked audience members to take up a pen and paper write down what comes to mind when you think of a wall  he said  any wall earlier in the day  president trump  who has brought the federal government to a partial shutdown in an effort to obtain funding for a wall along the southern border of the united states  had announced he would speak from the oval office to make his case for this wall as a national imperative  the sonic great wall became a way for its audience to grapple with the concept of barriers and borders in the piece  mr  ruo  whose expansion of his opera an american soldier was one of my favorite musical events of 2018  attempts to break down walls between musicians and audiences  the great wall of china  he said on monday  was erected as a barrier against chinas enemies  but its watchtowers also became a series of signaling stations  the great wall was a kind of ancient telegraph system the 30 minute work  presented as part of national sawdusts annual ferus festival of new work  began with mr  ruo leading the audience in a period of meditation  everyone standing  eyes closed  and humming  the cluster of hummed sounds became richly trembling and resonant  the main body of the piece began when players started blowing sustained drones on long tubes  thwacking drums  and playing delicate  tinkling riffs on gongs  among other sounds as the music gained in density and variety  the larger elements of the piece were driven by a steady  rumbling 4 4 meter played on percussion  mr  ruos style  well suited to theatrical works  vividly blends chinese melodic elements and skittish dance riffs with tartly modernist contemporary sounds and pointillist bursts   those qualities also came through in his alternately pensive and fraught chamber concerto no  2  the lost garden  which opened the program  audience members were seated in five paths  as they were called  each with two facing rows of seats  everyone had been asked earlier to jot down thoughts about a wall  choosing one key word to write in bold letters  and then to exchange papers with each other  at certain points during the piece  a musician from the ensemble of 14 would walk down one of the paths those seated  as asked  whispered the written down words as the musician approached and then spoke the word clearly when he or she was in earshot  depending on what the musician heard  he or she then varied the music played in response  choosing from various composed phrases or  it sometimes seemed  improvising  so each performance of the sonic great wall will be somewhat different embracing the participatory aspects of the piece  the audience members leaned forward to whisper and speak words to the attentive performers as they walked past  the message seemed to be that  by working together  performers and listeners could together create a situation in which the wall between them was merely sonic  and easily permeated as it turned out  president trumps fixation on a border wall nearly ended this performance before it began  players from asko schnberg  the ensemble that gave the premiere of the piece in amsterdam in 2016  had trouble getting travel visas processed because of the government shutdown players from the dream unfinished ensemble leapt in to perform the program  in the end  through the efforts of diplomats in the netherlands  four asko schnberg players did make the trip   two others could not obtain visas in time   this international collaboration represented the symbolic breaking down of yet another wall .
las vegas  president trump on saturday again declared that the united states was full and called its asylum system a scam  tying his push to close the countrys borders to undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers to an entreaty for jewish voters to support his re election campaign our systems full  our countrys full  mr  trump said  speaking to an audience that included descendants of holocaust survivors  jews in red skullcaps emblazoned with trump in white thread and people carrying israeli flags  you cant come in  our country is full  what can we do  we cant handle any more  our countrys full  you cant come in  im sorry he was met with raucous applause and cheers at the republican jewish coalitions annual leadership meeting in las vegas  underscoring how many conservative jewish voters  alarmed by rising threats of anti semitism and energized by his pro israel policies  have embraced a president with a history of trafficking in anti semitic tropes  including remarks that he has made before the coalition fresh from a visit on friday to a california border town  the president doubled down on his attacks on migrants seeking asylum at the border  the administration has recently toughened its policy for accepting asylum seekers  with stories of fleeing violence and corruption no longer meeting the standard for entry the asylum program is a scam  he said  describing people who look like they should be fighting for the u f c   with large muscles and face tattoos  some of the roughest people youve ever seen mr  trump has sought to paint himself as a chief supporter of israel  trumpeting the fulfillment of his promise to move the american embassy to jerusalem and his decision to recognize israels authority over the long contested golan heights  vice president mike pence  in a speech later saturday  called the president the greatest friend of the jewish people ever to sit in the oval office like the lawmakers who spoke before him  representative lee zeldin of new york  one of two republican jewish representatives  and representative kevin mccarthy of california  the minority leader  the president framed democrats as unwilling to combat anti semitism republicans believe that we must never ignore the vile poison of anti semitism  mr  trump said  he brought the crowd to its feet by introducing timothy matson  a police officer wounded during the shooting in october at the tree of life synagogue in pittsburgh in condemning anti semitism  all three men singled out representative ilhan omar  the freshman democrat from minnesota and one of the first two muslim women elected to congress  who for weeks has fended off accusations of anti semitism over comments critical of israel special thanks to representative omar of minnesota  mr  trump said  expressing gratitude to other attendees  including sheldon g  adelson  the billionaire casino magnate and prominent republican donor  and his wife  miriam  oh  i forgot  she doesnt like israel  im so sorry  ms  omar herself was recently the target of death threats  this week  federal agents arrested a new york resident  patrick w  carlineo jr   after he reportedly called her office  described her as a terrorist and promised  in an expletive laden threat  to put a bullet in her skull  ms  omar later responded on twitter by quoting a prayer of forgiveness  my lord  forgive my people for they do not know mr  trump also appeared to blur the lines between the american jews in the audience and israelis  referring at one point to prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel as your prime minister and warning that congressional democrats could leave israel out there all by yourselves at one point  he asked the crowd  how the hell did you support president obama  how the hell did you support the democrats  reminded by the audience that members of the republican jewish coalition did not  in fact  support mr  obama  he laughed before conceding  you guys didnt  thats right a few protesters were escorted from the arena early on in the speech  chanting jews are here to say  occupation is a plague  according to ifnotnow  a jewish organization that issued a statement afterward  logan bayroff  a spokesman for j street  the liberal jewish organization  said the presidents remarks about immigrants and minorities were extremely discordant and extremely disgusting to the majority of jewish people but the crowd of supporters in the ballroom at the venetian hotel and casino were enthusiastic as the president delivered a cornucopia of boasts  complaints and exaggerations typical of his campaign rallies  efforts to overhaul trade deals with mexico and china  and his pledge to build a border wall  cheers of four more years rang out after mr  trump left the presidents claims about the countrys capacity to support more immigrants echoed an argument he made on friday during his visit to a border town in california  backing down from a threat to close the legal ports of entry between the united states and mexico allies of the president have argued that he is right to push to overhaul the process  with the surge of families turning themselves in to border patrol agents at the ports of entry or in between them what you see happening here is an abuse of asylum laws  senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina and a close ally of the presidents  said in a brief interview after mr  trumps speech  if asylum is going to be that everybody who is economically impoverished can come to america  there will be no way we can handle the flow bottom line is  he added  we accept refugees .
washington  the trump administration  setting the stage to move forward with one of its most consequential climate policy rollbacks  announced thursday that it had decided to scrap negotiations with california over the presidents plan to undo obama era fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks the move makes a protracted legal battle almost certain  at the heart of the talks was californias longstanding right to opt out of national auto emissions rules and set its own tailpipe standards  state officials have vowed to sue to protect that authority if the administration tries to impose weaker federal standards on california and the dozen states that follow its lead xavier becerra  the california attorney general  said thursday the state was prepared to defend our national clean car standards even if the trump administration intends to go awol under rules established by president barack obamas administration to cut planet warming greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes  national fuel economy standards would nearly double by 2025  the trump administration said in august that it intended to freeze that measure after 2021  when new cars must average around 30 miles a gallon  it also said it would challenge the right of california and the states that follow its lead to set their own rules there appears to have been very little movement in the negotiations since they began almost a year ago  and both sides on thursday accused the other of negotiating in bad faith despite the administrations best efforts to reach a common sense solution  it is time to acknowledge that carb has failed to put forward a productive alternative  a white house statement said  referring to the california air resources board  the states clean air regulator  accordingly  the administration is moving forward to finalize a rule later this year with the goal of promoting safer  cleaner and more affordable vehicles stanley young  a spokesman for the air resources board  said meetings between the sides had been held but were always at a superficial level  with no effort to engage in a conversation mandy gunasekara  who served as principal deputy assistant administrator in the environmental protection agencys office of air and radiation before leaving this month to start a private consulting business  and who was involved in the talks  said that california had put forward only one counterproposal  a plan to delay implementation of the fuel economy rules by one year  trump officials saw that as a nonstarter looking at it now  it seems they were more interested in stalling the progress of the conversation than actually working to make a deal  ms  gunasekara said the decision to abandon talks does not necessarily mean that a final proposal from the administration is imminent  the e p a  had planned to complete the rollback proposal by the end of march  but the partial government shutdown early this year set that target back to may or june  agency officials said automakers  who fear that competing rules will bring chaos to the domestic auto industry  called for continued talks we continue to believe there is a middle ground solution that supports the goals of the administration  state of california  as well as automakers  said john bozzella  chief executive of global automakers  which represents automakers and parts suppliers with operations in the united states we always knew achieving one national program would be challenging  said gloria bergquist  a vice president at the alliance of automobile manufacturers  which represents the countrys biggest automakers  but a compromise is worth striving for  she said  we encourage everyone to keep focusing on how we get there the announcement comes amid fast deteriorating relations between washington and california in recent weeks the trump administration has said it was terminating a  929 million federal grant for the states struggling high speed rail project  and the transportation department said it was exploring legal options to claw back  2 5 billion that had already been spent  president trump has also threatened to cut off federal funding for wildfire relief after devastating blazes that killed 89 people mr  trump also lashed out on twitter when 16 states sued over his decision to declare a national emergency in order to obtain funding for a border wall  writing that california  the state that has wasted billions of dollars on their out of control fast train  with no hope of completion  seems in charge .
washington  the supreme court took no action on tuesday on the trump administrations plans to shut down a program that shields some 700 000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation the courts inaction almost certainly means it will not hear the administrations challenge in its current term  which ends in june  the justices next private conference to consider petitions seeking review is scheduled for feb  15 even were they to agree to hear the case then  it would not be argued until after the next term starts in october under the courts usual procedures  a decision would probably not arrive until well into 2020 the move left the program in place and denied negotiating leverage to president trump  who has said he wanted to use a supreme court victory in the case in negotiations with democrats over immigration issues mr  trump tried to end the program in 2017  calling it an unconstitutional use of executive power by his predecessor and reviving the threat of deportation for immigrants who had been brought to the united states illegally as young children but federal judges have ordered the administration to maintain major pieces of the program  deferred action for childhood arrivals  or daca  while legal challenges move forward in november  the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit  in san francisco  ruled against the administration  it acknowledged that presidents have broad powers to alter the policies of earlier administrations but said that the legal rationale offered by the trump administration did not withstand scrutiny  the court also questioned the cruelty and wastefulness of deporting productive young people to countries with which they have no ties mr  trump has criticized that ruling and has said he would be vindicated in the supreme court  he also predicted that a supreme court victory in the case  united states department of homeland security v  regents of the university of california  no  18 587  would strengthen his hand in negotiations with democratic lawmakers over immigration issues i think its going to be overturned in the united states supreme court  and i think its going to be overwhelmingly overturned  mr  trump said at a cabinet meeting this month  adding  so if we win that case  and i say this for all to hear  well be easily able to make a deal on daca and the wall as a combination mr  trump has taken inconsistent positions on the program  even as he tried to end it  he called upon congress to give legal status and an eventual path to citizenship to the young immigrants  who are sometimes called dreamers  more recently  he offered to extend the program in exchange for concessions on a border wall the administration has argued that the program  instituted by the obama administration  was an unconstitutional exercise of executive authority  relying on a ruling from the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit  in new orleans  concerning a related program  the supreme court deadlocked  4 to 4  in an appeal of that ruling but the ninth circuit said the two programs differed in important ways  undermining the administrations legal analysis  the appeals court affirmed a nationwide injunction ordering the administration to retain major elements of the program while the case moved forward  such nationwide injunctions  which have been used by courts to block executive actions in both the obama and the trump administrations  have been the subject of much commentary and criticism also on tuesday  the administration told the court that it would ask it to hear an appeal of a trial judges ruling barring the addition of a question on citizenship to the next census  the administrations filing said it would ask the justices to bypass the appeals court and put the case on a very fast track  culminating in arguments in april or may that was necessary  the solicitor general  noel j  francisco  wrote  because the government must finalize the census questionnaire by the end of june 2019 to enable it to be printed on time it is exceedingly unlikely that there is sufficient time for review in both the court of appeals and in this court by that deadline  mr  francisco wrote .
for all of president trumps political eccentricity  the man delivers a fairly conventional state of the union address  as he did last year  mr  trump showed up with a standard list of broad policy aims  many of them ambitious  some enjoying bipartisan support and few likely to go anywhere in this hyperpolarized climate  his vows to tackle the cost of prescription drugs  protect american jobs and fix americas crumbling infrastructure could have been lifted straight from his 2018 state of the union note cards  his call to fight childhood cancer was new  but the money he proposed for it   500 million over 10 years  is hardly adequate to the task the president issued a paean to unity that could just as easily have come from a predecessor who might have meant it  not that mr  trump avoided hot topics  he brought up abortion and syria and a tremendous onslaught of migrants on the southern border  but the thematic heart of his address  as released and hyped in advance by the white house  sounded like the anodyne output of a random speech generator  together  we can break decades of political stalemate  we can bridge old divisions  heal old wounds  build new coalitions  forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of americas future mr  trumps soothing message  in short  was wholly at odds with the acrid reality of how he has governed  in that way  the entire spectacle  reflected in the vibrating hostility between the two sides trapped together in the house chamber  evinced the true state of the union  fractured  fractious  painfully dysfunctional the state of the union address is one of those moments that allows mr  trump to play the role of president  with pomp  standing ovations and  sweeter still  a captive audience of his opponents  even mr  trump grasps that  for this one night  he is called upon to rise above partisanship and address the entire nation rather than merely his rump political base  beyond the general theme  he nonetheless failed this challenge the president  facing several investigations and a democratic house determined to hold him to account  called for an end to ridiculous partisan investigations  if there is going to be peace and legislation  the president said  there cannot be war and investigation  it just doesnt work that way in the lead up to his big night  the presidents tweets and remarks were designed to incite  he assailed democratic leaders and repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency if lawmakers didnt provide billions for his border wall  in a preview session with network anchors  he called chuck schumer  the senate democratic leader  a nasty son of a bitch democrats responded with a set of guests intended to score political points  there were dreamers and undocumented immigrants  some of whom formerly worked for mr  trump or a trump resort   family members of victims of mass shootings  transgender service members  a  metoo activist and a bevy of federal workers who went without pay during the shutdown democratic women showed up by the dozens dressed all in white  a nod to the suffragists of the early 20th century  in a display of sisterly solidarity with all women  again and again in the speech  the president tried  for an evening at least  to change the tone he has set since the day he announced his candidacy with an attack on mexican immigrants   we can make our communities safer  our families stronger  our culture richer  mr  trump said early in his address  but we must reject the politics of revenge  resistance and retribution  and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation  compromise and the common good if mr  trumps words ring hollow  his actions still matter enormously  given how bitterly divided the government is  how wounded and uneasy the nation is  its impossible not to cling to a hope that he might yet rise to the office and do something for his fellow americans  but  rather than wait for that to happen  the wisest course for citizens interested in a stronger union is to focus on building it themselves  the times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  wed like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  here are some tips  and heres our email  letters nytimes com .
once more  president trump stands ready to dazzle with his willingness to sacrifice the national interest on the altar of his political whims for days  the president has been indulging in one of his made for tv teasers by threatening to shut down the united states mexico border  not beef up the border patrol  not tighten security at ports of entry  just hang up a closed sign and call it a day as the white house tells it  the failures of mexico and congressional democrats to stop illegal crossings have left the president no choice  the influx of drugs  criminals and other undesirables has reached the point where drastic action is required mr  trump is nothing if not a man of drastic action  or at least ominous vows of drastic action dismayed critics have rushed to object that shutting the border will do nothing to solve the humanitarian strains caused by the flood of migrant families from central america  that such a move will  in fact  make things only worse by disrupting the legal flow of people and commerce  wreaking social and economic havoc such warnings are spot on  they also miss the point  in threatening to shut down the border  mr  trump isnt looking to solve a crisis  his primary aim is to make life unpleasant for those who have crossed him  or simply had the misfortune to get in his way in politics  as in life  there are fixers and there are punishers  fixers shine a light on problems or injustices and work to find ways to resolve them  theirs is a constructive vision  one that values cooperation and pragmatism and getting stuff done punishers  too  are about spotlighting problems  a skill at which they may excel even more than fixers  but punishers arent looking to make things right so much as to find someone to blame  and chasten  for the perceived wrongs neither party holds a monopoly on either category  charlie baker  the republican governor of massachusetts  is a fixer  ilhan omar  the freshman democratic house member from minnesota  is fast establishing herself as a punisher  president barack obama was a fixer  while the entire house freedom caucus sprang from the conviction that anyone willing to work with mr  obama should be cast into the abyss  punished with extreme prejudice  as it were punishers have their charms and their purpose  and whether you see them as avenging angels or vengeful demagogues often depends on whether you share their particular worldview  but every now and again  along comes a punisher so wanton that he rattles even members of his own team  mr  trump is one of this rare breed the desire to crush those who displease him is a defining characteristic of this president  when challenged  his impulse is to lash out  preferably with personal  degrading insults  this has been on most vivid display with the myriad investigations into sketchy presidential behavior  but it also has been a hallmark of mr  trumps approach to key policy issues  border security  health care  trade  you name the debate  mr  trumps answer is to stake out his position  vowing pain and regret for those who do not embrace it on sunday  the acting white house chief of staff  mick mulvaney  went on television to rub democrats noses in the growing border tumult and defend the presidents closure threat  we hate to say we told you so  he said  we need border security  and were going to do the best we can with what we have he also dismissed questions about the wisdom of mr  trumps plan to end financial aid to el salvador  guatemala and honduras  complaining about the troubled nations failure to stop their people from fleeing north  mr  mulvaney brushed off administration experts who have cautioned that cutting aid would further destabilize the countries  likely worsening the migrant crisis translation  fine  no one will give us a border wall  well show you the meaning of chaos the presidents fans cheer his pugilism  as though he was bravely defending himself  and them  against big  bad bullies  but all too often  the price is paid by the innocent and vulnerable  migrant children snatched from their parents at the border  federal workers thrown into financial turmoil by the government shutdown  farm workers and manufacturers caught up in the trade war  the millions of americans who stand to lose their health insurance if the administration keeps laboring to kill obamacare  for mr  trump  anyone who stands between him and his objective becomes collateral damage  and pity those considered part of an unfriendly demographic  such as the people of puerto rico  whom the president dismisses as a tool of the democratic party and mistreats accordingly  as the senate has worked this week to hash out a comprehensive disaster relief package  mr  trumps contribution has been to fire off a series of obnoxious  dishonest tweets charging that corrupt or incompetent island officials have wasted epic levels of relief funding and are now hot for democrats to give them more  taking dollars away from our farmers and so many others  disgraceful  a white house spokesman  hogan gidley  subsequently appeared on tv with a spirited defense of his bosss broadside against that country  as for those who actively defy the president  the goal is not simply to punish them for a single transgression but to discourage them from future rebellions  deliver a painful enough lesson  and everyone will fall into line  .

from the country as recently as sunday  mr  trumps national security adviser  john bolton  placed conditions on the withdrawal that could leave american forces there for months or even years yesterday

after terrorists brought down the world trade center on sept  11  2001  terence opiola  then an agent with the united states customs service  worked amid the debris for months  recovering body parts and other evidence to help identify victims in 2015  like many who had been at the site  he was told he had leukemia linked to his work there  two years later  his illness forced him to retire at the age of 49 and he applied for benefits through the september 11th victim compensation fund  created to help sick sept  11 emergency workers  civilian survivors and their families  recently he learned that he and others might get only a small fraction of what was promised when the federal government set up the fund as a father of three school age children  he said  that news has devastated him  the anxiety is through the roof  he said on feb  15  the fund announced it planned to slash payments to survivors and their families by 50 percent to 70 percent because it is running out of money as the number of people sickened or killed because of their exposure to toxic dust from the towers collapse rises rapidly  doctors say they have seen a surge in illnesses in recent years not only among firefighters and emergency medical technicians  but also among students  teachers  journalists  government workers and others who were exposed congress added  4 6 billion to the fund in 2015 and extended its life by five years after extensive lobbying  fund officials said they have paid almost  5 billion in claims to 21 000 survivors or their families from the  7 3 billion account  over the past two years  20 000 more people have applied for benefits  rupa bhattacharyya  the funds administrator  said in a message on its website on feb  15  the figure is expected to rise if congress does not provide more money  thousands of these sick firefighters  emergency medical technicians  police officers and civilian volunteers will be without the help the country promised them  charlotte berwind  whose husband  charles flickinger  died of a sept  11 linked cancer in 2017  said she wont be able to stay in their home without the full benefit from the fund  ms  berwind  65  said that she felt that most americans had long ago moved on from the attacks and that they didnt understand that people were still getting sick and dying  we are yesterdays news  she said  theyve forgotten  its over for them all those years ago  the horrifying attacks brought the nation together in common cause  now america forgets these people  but finds the money for a  1 5 trillion tax cut for the wealthy  the country turns its back on these citizens  even as president trump demands a border wall that could cost up to  70 billion  fortunately  a bipartisan group of congressional members  most but not all from new york  have again taken up the cause of everyday americans who served  lived and worked at the world trade center and the pentagon  on monday the group introduced a bill to replenish the fund and extend its life permanently  aiding their efforts is the comedian jon stewart  who has lent his fame to this cause for years  the bills sponsors are waiting for a congressional budget office analysis before determining how much money the fund needs  for years  much of the focus has been on emergency medical workers  which is understandable  but congress can do more to help the other americans who are sick or may become sick from attack related diseases  it might consider requiring the federally run world trade center health program to monitor the health of civilians who were exposed to toxins at the site before they become sick  for instance  doctors say that doing so would help save lives  and give officials and researchers a better sense of how many people are sick or may become sick  and a must for congress is to close an egregious loophole in the public safety officers benefits program run by the department of justice that has excluded a small group of emergency medical workers who worked on private ambulance crews from receiving the help they need and to which they should be entitled  that has left people like marvin bethea  who worked for st  vincents medical center on sept  11 and has for years struggled with illnesses linked to the toxic cloud  without access to the benefit  though mr  bethea worked for a private ambulance crew  he was dispatched to the world trade center by the new york fire department and required by law to respond  we did our duty that day  and they called us heroes  he said  the survivors of the deadliest terrorist attack on american soil have been forced to beg washington for help  that they have to ask at all is a slap in the face and a sign of national priorities run far astray .
washington  a pair of measures to reopen the government  one with president trumps border wall  the other without it  failed in the senate on thursday  sending lawmakers from both parties into frenzied efforts to forge a compromise that could end the nearly six week partial shutdown in back to back votes  the senate first blocked mr  trumps proposal to add  5 7 billion for his border wall to legislation to resume funding for the government  then turned back a democratic measure that omitted the wall  neither side was able to garner the 60 votes needed to advance its bill but the results undercut the president by revealing that his proposal drew less support in the republican controlled senate than did the democrats plan  which attracted a half dozen republicans willing to break with mr  trump  and with the shutdown reaching a grim milestone on friday as 800 000 federal workers miss a second consecutive paycheck  pressure is mounting in both parties to find a solution in a lunch meeting before the votes  republican senators vented their concern to vice president mike pence about the prolonged shutdown  according to two people familiar with the discussion  which grew tense at times  senator mitch mcconnell  the majority leader  who has previously counseled against allowing government funding to lapse  was among those arguing that it should never have occurred  they said almost as soon as the roll calls were finished in the packed senate chamber  a round of telephone calls and conversations began among mr  trump  republican and democratic congressional leaders and other senators who have been quietly searching for weeks for a bipartisan compromise to end the gridlock dont give up hope  because now is the time that we all must come together to address these issues  said senator lisa murkowski of alaska  one of the six republicans who voted for the democratic measure  but you cant do it when the government is shut down senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina  announced on the senate floor that he had spoken with the president  who had said he would be open to a three week stopgap measure to reopen the government and provide time for a broader border security deal  as long as it included some of his priorities it gets us back in the ballgame  mr  graham said  as a group of 16 senators  eight from each party  rose in turn to endorse the idea of the three week spending measure but hanging over those talks was continued uncertainty about the presidents bottom line for a deal  mr  trump spoke positively of talks between mr  mcconnell and senator chuck schumer  the democratic leader  but he said was not dropping his demand for wall funding one of the ideas suggested is they open  they pay some sort of prorated down payment on the wall  which you need  the president told reporters at the white house  if they come to a reasonable agreement  he said of mr  mcconnell and mr  schumer  i would support it  yes he again mentioned other alternatives that he could turn to if he did not secure wall funding from congress  presumably an emergency declaration that could allow him to shift funds from the military or army corps of engineers but democrats were unlikely to agree to that  senator schumer and senate democrats have made clear to leader mcconnell and republicans that they will not support funding for the wall  prorated or otherwise  said justin goodman  a spokesman for mr  schumer  others emphasized that they shared the presidents goal of adding security measures at the border  as long as he would first agree to end the shutdown  and house democrats were circulating proposals for a smart wall  with drones  sensors and some additional fencing  but no edifice from the pacific to the gulf of mexico what we have put on the table is our reputation as legislators  that given three weeks  well come up with a successful conclusion on the border security issue  said senator benjamin l  cardin  democrat of maryland urgency is rising in both parties to reopen the government  even if that means making concessions their leaders might not have considered a few weeks ago  house democrats  prodded on by rank and file lawmakers from conservative districts who are eager to promote their own border security ideas  are poised as early as friday to outline more than  5 billion in measures they support  a far larger sum than they initially entertained were not that far apart  said senator rob portman  republican of ohio  imploring members of his own party and democrats to stop talking past each other recent polls have found that the ordeal is taking a heavy toll on mr  trumps approval rating  including among his core supporters  it has also created a damaging narrative for his administration  fueling a perception that the president  who often promotes his concern for the countrys forgotten men and women  and his team are unconcerned with the plight of working americans who are suffering during the breach in government operations in separate appearances over the past 48 hours  the commerce secretary  wilbur ross  the presidents chief economic adviser  larry kudlow  and lara trump  his daughter in law  all made comments seen by some as callous toward federal workers who have now gone more than a month without pay i dont really quite understand why those employees are lining up at food banks  mr  ross said on cnbc  he suggested they could go to a bank to get a loan to cover lost wages democrats jumped on the comments is this the let them eat cake kind of attitude  speaker nancy pelosi said of mr  ross confusion  or call your father for money  the second remark was a version of one she made to mr  trump in the situation room this month  when she tartly noted that the people affected by the shutdown did not have the luxury of being able to depend financially on a parent the democratic funding bill included  14 billion in disaster aid  but otherwise it was similar to one the senate approved unanimously in december  only to see mr  trump reject it and the house cancel a planned vote on it  republican views in the senate have shifted sharply since then to reflect the presidents mr  trumps proposal paired  5 7 billion in wall funding with temporary legal protections for some immigrants and measures to make it more difficult to claim asylum in the united states  only one democrat  senator joe manchin iii of west virginia  crossed party lines to vote for the measure  two republican senators  mike lee of utah and tom cotton of arkansas  voted against it  considering it too lenient to immigrants mr  trumps plan was loosely modeled after an idea that was the centerpiece of quiet bipartisan talks to strike a compromise over the past several weeks to end the shutdown  among the ideas discussed was legislation that would pair money for border security with permanent legal status for dreamers  the immigrants brought to the united states illegally as children who stand to lose their deportation protections and work permits after mr  trump rescinded the deferred action for childhood arrivals program  or daca  created by president barack obama in 2012 while it included some of those components  the measure that failed on thursday was dismissed as a nonstarter by democratic leaders because it substantially narrowed daca eligibility  and extended it for only three years  while making major changes to asylum law that would make it harder for migrants fleeing violence and persecution  including children from central america  to find refuge in the united states  it would also extend three year reprieves for those living in the united states under temporary protected status  granted in times of conflict or natural disaster  who stand to be removed after mr  trump ended their protections senator doug jones  democrat of alabama  said he had considered supporting the presidents proposal after he described it in a televised address from the white house  but found the asylum provisions unacceptable when i saw what the president had added to the plan he announced just five days ago  particularly as it pertains to the limitations and additional hardships placed on families and children who are legitimately seeking refuge in this country from violence in their own countries  and doing so through the legal asylum process  i could not vote for it despite my consistent support for stronger border security  mr  jones said in a statement house leaders had kept their chamber in session through the afternoon to leave room for the possibility that the democratic measure would prevail in the senate  and they could call a vote on it later thursday and send it to the white house  but that never happened  and rank and file democrats  many of whom had marched across the capitol to the senate chamber to witness the votes for themselves  spent the afternoon instead highlighting the stories of people devastated by the shutdown the house took separate action earlier thursday to pass legislation to fund the department of homeland security through feb  28  with all but five republicans voting no  one freshman democrat  representative alexandria ocasio cortez of new york  also voted against it because it would reopen immigration and customs enforcement  which she wants closed .
most federal workers  even those with rent owed and bills due  would gladly forgo their paycheck as a measure of support for his  5 6 billion border wall  president trump said on friday he also noted that mexico would actually be paying for the wall through a new trade agreement  which at the very least raised the question of why the government had to be shut down over a funding dispute involving american tax dollars if the funding was coming from another country  and then there was a plan c  he said he could use emergency powers to build the wall  the wall was needed for many reasons  mr  trump said  stopping drug and human trafficking  and a nonspecific reference to a torrent of terrorists and coyotes easily flowing in over the southern border  they drive right in  and they make a left  he said but there also was sunshine amid the gloom  mr  trump spoke of a stunningly positive jobs report and a stock market that soared  at least for a day  lower gas prices  one person to thank the purpose of the presidents hastily arranged  hourlong news conference in the rose garden was to give his side of the negotiations over a partial government shutdown that stretches into its third week on saturday  and  for the record  mr  trump is not calling the partial closing of the government a shutdown i dont call it a shutdown  he said  i call it doing what you have to do for the benefit and for the safety of our country the news conference was freewheeling  and the president seemed in high spirits  even with the government shuttered in many places  should we keep this going or not  he said here are some takeaways and fact checks  mr  trump has called for a concrete wall on the border with mexico  though he denied it  telling reporters  i said i was going to build a wall  i never said im going to build a concrete   just four days ago  mr  trump tweeted that an all concrete wall was never abandoned  now  he said  steel might be the preferred material  suggesting that would also help a resurgent steel industry in the united states  and could be preferable for its see through and more aesthetic qualities  all of the border things that well be building will be done right here in the good old usa by steel companies that were practically out of business when i came into office as president  and now  theyre thriving  later  he said  the steel industry was almost dead  dead  is an exaggeration  steel production has been in decline  as has the number of employees in the industry  but the metals industry still employed over 360 000 workers and produced 80 million tons of raw steel in the year before mr  trump took office at any rate  mr  trump continued  weve already built a lot of the wall and renovated a tremendous amount of wall   the trump administration has replaced some existing barriers with new barriers  and will begin constructing 14 miles of new wall in february  but to date  construction on his border wall has not started  in his first meeting about a shutdown with representative nancy pelosi and senator chuck schumer in the oval office last month  the president forcefully said that he alone would own the shutdown  on friday  he was selling shares in it  you can call it the schumer or the pelosi or the trump shutdown  he said  doesnt make any difference to me  its just words could he reach a compromise with democrats to end the shutdown by coupling wall funding with a pathway to citizenship for the young immigrants known as dreamers  mr  trump responded that democrats lost interest as soon as the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit upheld an injunction against his administrations termination of the deferred action for childhood arrivals program   a deal on the program and to avoid an earlier government shutdown in early 2018 faltered last january  after mr  trump made vulgar remarks on immigration  the court ruled on the case in november  that was such a bad decision from the court  mr  trump asserted  that even his predecessor  when he signed the daca  with the executive order  made a statement to the effect  this isnt going to work   president barack obama did not sign an executive order to implement the deferred action for childhood arrivals program  he announced it as a department of homeland security policy in a speech in 2012  he did not say it would not work  but called it a temporary stopgap  for federal workers who may need a safety net or financial assistance as they go without pay  mr  trump said the safety net is going to be having a strong border  especially because government employees support his wall   a recent poll of more than 1 400 by government executive suggests the opposite  most oppose the shutdown and the wall   the president said that the new trade deal with mexico and canada will yield billions of dollars for this country  that is paying for the wall  he said  many  many times over  in fact  what we save on the u s m c a   the new trade deal we have with mexico and canada  what we save on that just with mexico will pay for the wall many times over  just in a period of a year  two years and three years  so i view that as absolutely mexico is paying for the wall   congress has yet to ratify the united states mexico canada agreement  and it does not compel mexico to pay for the wall  whatever federal revenue it generates would come from american taxpayers  not mexico  and  mr  trump said  why shouldnt mexico pay for the wall through trade  given that we are losing close to  100 billion a year on trade with mexico   the united states had a  69 billion trade deficit with mexico in 2017  mr  trump also took another shot at the north american free trade agreement that the new trade deal seeks to replace  arguing that we lost millions of jobs through nafta   the left leaning economic policy institute estimated that the united states lost 850 000 jobs because of nafta  the times was unable to find any credible estimate that supported mr  trumps millions figure  asked about ongoing trade talks with beijing  mr  trump reported that china is paying us tremendous tariffs   the united states does not send china a bill for the cost of tariffs  which are often passed on to american importers or consumers  china  by the way  is the biggest beneficiary of apple  so mr  trump is not concerned that the company reduced its revenue forecast this week  sending stocks tumbling  nonetheless  mr  trump said apple is investing  350 billion because of what we did with taxes and the incentives that we created in the united states   apple was already on track to spend  275 billion in the united states over the next five years  after a  38 billion tax payment  the companys investment would be roughly  37 billion  after suggesting that terrorists were pouring into the country over wall less portions of the border  mr  trump turned to kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  for specifics  she said there were 3 000 such terrorists that we know about  but said she could not divulge other information because it was classified  the 3 000 figure referred to special interest aliens stopped at the border  a term that applies to people from any country that has exported or produced one terrorist  according to the libertarian cato institute  besides this ambiguous figure  mr  trump has yet to provide evidence for his claim  the state department said in a september report there is no credible evidence that terrorist groups had sent operatives to enter the united states through mexico  the report warned of the vulnerability  but said it was more likely terrorist groups would seek other means of entry  mr  trump said that the government would have to use its powers of eminent domain to take private land to build the wall when owners would not agree to sell  he said thats how interstates  schools and other public buildings have been constructed many in his base disagree  especially in texas where private property rights are often paramount mr  trump said  mostly in jest  that he had raised the matter of impeachment with ms  pelosi  asking her why she did not use the border security issue as grounds  and nancy said were not looking to impeach you  i said thats good  nancy  thats good he added  you cant impeach somebody that is doing a great job  thats the way i view it .

the 90 minute drive from tucson to rancho de la osa  a recently reopened dude ranch on the border with mexico  is a lonely one  turning onto highway 286  your car may be the only southbound vehicle for 44 miles while the occasional u s  border patrol van trolls north  the road runs directly to the border fence  here made up of eerie metal posts spaced less than a foot apart  at the town of sasabe  minutes before reaching it  a right turn onto a dirt road delivers you to the historic adobe ranch  painted a warm terra cotta  with a porch lined with turquoise adirondack chairs you got the right place  and we got the right horse  said a cowboy in the driveway  when i pulled in last winter  fully living up to wrangler stereotype with a handlebar mustache and weathered 10 gallon hat once  the border fence was such a strong deterrent to visitors that it helped drive the 1920s dude ranch out of business  but  if anything  president trumps campaign for a border wall has helped revive interest in a region that already has a barrier at the border like trump or hate trump  now the border is an attraction  said russell true  who with partners  bought rancho de la osa at auction complete with its vintage western furnishings and period art in late 2016  they dont publicize the ranchs proximity to the border fence and had hoped the border would be a neutral feature of the ranch  instead  mr  true said it has piqued the interest of guests  the first thing they want to do is see the wall  he said  we could not have planned for the political shift and that it would become interesting originally opened in the 1920s  rancho de la osa drew many celebrated guests  including joan crawford  cesar romero and john wayne  for whom three of the 18 bedrooms are named  double room rates from  235 a person  all inclusive   the cowboy actor of the silent film era  tom mix  made one of his many films here  authors checked in too  including the western novelist zane grey and margaret mitchell  presidents franklin d  roosevelt and lyndon b  johnson led the political a list along with william clayton  who drafted the marshall plan to aid european countries after world war ii in a two bedroom house on the property more current events also helped drive the ranch out of business  according to mr  true  who also co owns white stallion ranch near tucson  in 2010  jan brewer then the governor of arizona  decried beheadings in the desert she said were linked to illegal immigration and drug trafficking  allegations that were never corroborated and that she later called an error on her part  we just had an absolute  possibly even slightly irrational need to save it  mr  true told me as we sat in the main lodge  where the adobe walls are washed in orange  red and yellow hues and an antique leather sofa is embossed with an image of a saddle  somebody else would have bought it  but nobody else was going to run it as a dude ranch as a dude ranch  the 590 acre rancho de la osa  restored and reopened in 2017  offers more than vintage charm  beyond the central compound  which includes an outdoor swimming pool and a bar in a building dating back to 1720  lies some of the lushest areas of the sonoran desert  at about a 3 500 foot elevation  and the distinctive baboquivari peak  which is considered sacred to the indigenous tohono oodham people horseback riding is the main activity here but the new owners have expanded activities to include fat tire electric mountain biking  off road vehicle tours  clay pigeon shooting and bird watching trips to the neighboring buenos aires national wildlife refuge  a 117 500 acre preserve with grasslands that resemble the savannas of africa in addition to exploring the desert  morning and afternoon rides introduce guests to the ranchs veteran wranglers ross and lynne knox  the couples stories  including his close brushes with death running pack mule trains in the grand canyon  conjured a western past that doesnt seem so distant here in some of the more desolate parts of the southern border if youre not living on the edge  he said with a chuckle about his daring cowboy lifestyle  then youre taking up too much space of course  the degree to which the desert is deserted is up for debate  and on my first ride i spotted the well patrolled fence   mostly out of sight from the ranch dwellings  that undulates east with the hills as far as the eye can see it abruptly stops at the nearby territory of the tohono oodham people who have prevented the fence  erected in 2007  from crossing tribal land  when the knoxes drove me and four fellow guests in an off road cart to see it  we took turns walking around to the mexican side of the border and posing for photos  a few foot paths snaked into the hills on the american side staked with spiky ocotillo cactus still  it was easy to forget about politics in a place where a juvenile great horned owl  flying low at dusk  roosted in a tree just 10 feet from my patio seat  and where cozy rooms with original fireplaces came stocked with mesquite wood  mr  knox  a celebrated cowboy poet  recited some of his work after dinner  concluding when the memories come calling  you still cant help but pray lord  please make me a cowboy again for a day .
washington  speaker nancy pelosi asked president trump on wednesday to scrap or delay his jan  29 state of the union address amid the partial government shutdown  an extraordinary request that escalated the partisan battle over his border wall even as bipartisan groups of lawmakers pressed him to reopen the government and make room for compromise in a letter to mr  trump that underscored how the shutdown fight has poisoned hopes of bipartisan comity at the start of divided government  ms  pelosi cited security concerns as her reason for proposing that the president postpone the annual presidential ritual of addressing a joint session of congress in a televised speech during prime time  or perhaps submit a written message instead security aside  her move would deprive mr  trump of one of the brightest spotlights of a presidents year  intensified this year by democratic control of the house and the drama of the longest government shutdown in the nations history sadly  given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week  i suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your state of the union address in writing to the congress on jan  29  ms  pelosi wrote  read the full text of the letter here  the request was a bracing piece of theater  even in a presidency that has bent so many historical norms  ronald reagan postponed his 1986 address after the challenger space shuttle exploded  franklin d  roosevelt transmitted a written message in 1944 as his health began to fail  but mr  trump had no intention of giving up the spotlight several white house officials  speaking on condition of anonymity to describe the presidents frame of mind  said that he was utterly unbothered by ms  pelosis missive  which they noted was not an absolute cancellation but a half measure suggesting a postponement  one of them said it opened up options for mr  trump for creative alternatives to the staid  tradition bound speech  and that he could deliver a speech anywhere he chose still  while she couched her request in logistical concerns  ms  pelosis proposal served as a reminder to mr  trump that she now has the power to frustrate his agenda and upend his plans  it drew rebukes from republicans who said ms  pelosi was politicizing the state of the union address  representative kevin mccarthy of california  the republican leader  told reporters in the capitol that the decision was unbecoming of a speaker it came as pressure intensified on the president from two separate groups of centrist democrats and republicans  one in the senate and one in the house  to drop his demand that wall funding be included in any measure to end the shutdown in a meeting with mr  trump in the situation room wednesday morning  seven house republicans and seven democrats who are members of the problem solvers caucus told mr  trump that they were eager to have a bipartisan discussion with him about border security  among other matters  but that he needed to first sign legislation to get government funding flowing again both sides listened to each other  and believe that theres a way forward  said representative josh gottheimer  democrat of new jersey  who attended the session  he called it a productive conversation  but added  its critical that we reopen the government first  for our safety  our security  our economy sarah huckabee sanders  the white house press secretary  called the meeting constructive  and said  they listened to one another  and now both have a good understanding of what the other wants another attendee who insisted on anonymity to describe the private discussion said neither side considered it a negotiating session  and mr  trump did not embrace the idea of reopening the government before the border barrier issue was settled  the president began the session with an extended talk about what he described as the crisis at the border  while lawmakers told him about the effects of the shutdown on their districts in the senate  a group of republicans and democrats was also working to persuade the president that no progress was possible as long as the government remained shuttered  it circulated a letter that called on mr  trump to drop his demand for wall funding as a condition of ending the shutdown  urging him to agree to sign a three week stopgap government funding measure to allow time to forge a broad bipartisan agreement on border security spending we commit to working to advance legislation that can pass the senate with substantial bipartisan support  said the letter  which was spearheaded by senators lindsey graham  republican of south carolina  and chris coons  democrat of delaware  during those three weeks  we will make our best efforts following regular order in the appropriate committees and mark up bipartisan legislation relating to your request the letter has support from several other republican senators  including lamar alexander of tennessee  susan collins of maine  lisa murkowski of alaska and rob portman of ohio  as well as centrist democrats including senator joe manchin iii of west virginia  according to several officials familiar with it who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the effort  but the white house was quietly lobbying against it  and proponents were having a hard time persuading republicans to sign on im not sure if it moves the process forward or not  said senator mike rounds  republican of south dakota  who was summoned to a meeting at the white house on wednesday afternoon to discuss the issue  i want to find out whether or not theres a possibility that if we offer support  republicans and democrats alike  if we offer support for a three week continuation  does that help the president  or does that hurt the president  in terms of allowing him some middle ground to find a consensus on getting some work done on the wall if its just seen as a weakening of his position  mr  rounds added of mr  trump  then he probably wouldnt do it that is precisely the reason mr  trump has ruled out similar plans both publicly and privately  saying he would not reopen the government without first securing funding for the wall mr  coons  in terse remarks as he left the senate floor on wednesday  offered a gloomy assessment of the plans chances  this letter is going nowhere unless there is sufficient clarity of support from republicans in the absence of progress  democrats kept up a drumbeat of pressure on republicans to break ranks with mr  trump and support measures to reopen the government without border wall spending  senator chuck schumer of new york  the minority leader  led democrats in chants of open the government  on the capitol steps  a group of house democratic freshmen made their second trek through the rotunda in two days to the office of senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  to deliver him a letter calling for action on a bill to end the shutdown were trying to figure out how to leave it with him in as many places as possible so he cant keep hiding from us  said representative katie hill  democrat of california  who led the group  which at one point wandered onto a mostly empty senate floor in vain attempts to orchestrate a face to face encounter with mr  mcconnell neither the white house nor the secret service  the lead agency coordinating security for the state of the union address  had an immediate comment on ms  pelosis letter suggesting that the shutdown push off the speech but kirstjen nielsen  the secretary of homeland security  said in a tweet that her department and the secret service were fully prepared to support and secure the state of the union ms  pelosis office  appearing to borrow mr  trumps tactic of citing nameless federal employees who he says have sent him messages of support on the shutdown  countered that a furloughed department of homeland security employee had reached out to warn her aides that the department did not have sufficient staffing to manage security needs around the event with the leadership of all three branches of government gathered in one place  the state of the union address is one of the highest stakes events for federal law enforcement each year  requiring weeks of preparation  the secret service is among the agencies affected by the shutdown both the u s  secret service and the department of homeland security have not been funded for 26 days now  with critical departments hamstrung by furloughs  ms  pelosi wrote buttressing her point  another arm of the department of homeland security  the transportation security administration  acknowledged wednesday that staffing shortages and airport lines were the result of the shutdown  saying in a news release that many employees are reporting that they are not able to report to work due to financial limitations  an agency spokesman had previously denounced a cnn report that t s a  workers were calling out sick to protest working without pay or seek other employment as  fakenews  a denial mr  trump enthusiastically retweeted beyond the staffing issues  rescheduling the speech would have other benefits for democrats  too with democrats and mr  trump at an impasse over his wall demands  the speech would give mr  trump a nationally televised bully pulpit to hammer away at ms  pelosi and her party what are democrats afraid of americans hearing  representative steve scalise of louisiana  the no  2 republican  said in a twitter post  branding ms  pelosi  shutdownnancy  that 17 000  criminals were caught last year at the border  90  of heroin in the us comes across the southern border  illegal border crossings dropped 90   in areas w  a wall the constitution says the president shall from time to time give to the congress information of the state of the union  but what is now a speech to a joint session of congress in the capitol has taken different forms over the years  including in writing for much of the 19th century  the house speaker typically arranges the address by invitation  though its date is the subject of mutual agreement with the white house in her letter  ms  pelosi said there was no precedent for holding a state of the union address during a government shutdown .

washington  president trump appeared poised on tuesday to end two months of scorched earth confrontation without the money he demanded for a border wall as republicans pressured him to accept a bipartisan spending deal rather than close the government again on friday mr  trump pronounced himself unsatisfied with the agreement brokered by house and senate negotiators  and he refused to publicly commit to signing it  but he all but ruled out another government shutdown and emphasized that he would find other methods to finance a border barrier  leading aides and allies to predict he would grudgingly go along with the deal am i happy at first glance  the president said  speaking with reporters at the beginning of a cabinet meeting  i just got to see it  the answer is no  im not  im not happy but he said he was moving things around in the budget from far less important areas to finance a wall even without explicit congressional approval  and he expressed no desire to repeat the standoff that shuttered many federal agencies for 35 days  i dont think youre going to see a shutdown  he said hours later  after a further briefing  mr  trump seemed to signal acceptance of the agreement  saying that it will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources and provide plenty of resources for border security even if not for the wall itself  regardless of wall money  he wrote on twitter on tuesday evening  it is being built as we speak the compromise measure  assembled by senior members of both parties on monday night  includes just  1 375 billion for new fencing along the border with mexico  far short of the  5 7 billion mr  trump sought for a steel or concrete wall  and less even than the deal that he rejected in december  prompting the longest government shutdown in american history the new measure will be taken up as early as wednesday by the house  which is controlled by democrats  followed by the senate  which is run by republicans while some conservatives denounced it as a sellout  senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  spoke with mr  trump by telephone on tuesday and urged him to accept the compromise  i hope hell sign it  mr  mcconnell told reporters afterward  i think he got a pretty good deal mr  mcconnell had initially sought to avoid the confrontation that has consumed the nations capital by pressing mr  trump to accept the previous measure in december  only to be surprised when the president changed his mind  however unenthusiastically  mr  mcconnell stood by the president for weeks and declined to put spending bills on the senate floor that mr  trump would not sign on tuesday  however  mr  mcconnell made clear that he was ready to put the new spending package to a vote even though the president had not endorsed it and  notably  did not rule out overriding a veto if mr  trump turned against the compromise as he did two months ago in an attempt to appease mr  trump  republicans repeatedly referred to the deal as a big down payment on his wall and indicated that they were open to him transferring funds within the government to build more barriers  mr  mcconnell said he had no objection to the president using whatever tools were available  senator lamar alexander of tennessee suggested using  800 million in drug interdiction funding to shore up border security in areas used by narcotic traffickers republicans also asserted that they scored a victory by fending off democratic efforts to impose a stricter cap on the number of detention beds for arrested immigrants and by securing any money for a barrier given that speaker nancy pelosi at one point rejected even a single dollar for a wall she deemed immoral its amazing how shutdown fatigue challenges your flexibility on things  said senator kevin cramer  republican of north dakota  adding that he would most likely support the bill if the final text matched the descriptions he had been given current and former administration officials said on tuesday that mr  trump seemed to be preparing to sign the bill and then reprogram as much money as he can on his own  although they cautioned that the president is unpredictable and his decision would depend on details still to be examined senator ted cruz of texas  who joined mr  trump on monday at a rally in el paso  told attendees at a senate republican lunch on tuesday that his conversations with the president left him with the impression that mr  trump was preparing to pivot to a yes on the deal  according to a person in the room even sean hannity  the fox news host who denounced the deal on monday night as a garbage compromise that republicans would have to answer for  said on tuesday that he expected mr  trump to sign it to keep the government open and get his down payment  hes telegraphing what hes going to do  mr  hannity said on his radio program ann coulter  the conservative commentator whose criticism helped push mr  trump into taking a tougher stand in december  agreed but castigated the president for it  trump talks a good game on the border wall but its increasingly clear hes afraid to fight for it  she wrote on twitter  call this his yellow new deal democrats  who had consented in december to give mr  trump  1 6 billion for border security  said this weeks agreement showed the folly of mr  trumps brinkmanship  the president had a better deal back in 2018  said representative henry cuellar  democrat of texas  he just ended up in a worse situation mr  trump told reporters that he was still thinking about declaring a national emergency to bypass congress and finance wall construction on his own authority  but aides increasingly doubt he will  given opposition by mr  mcconnell and other republicans instead  mr  trump seemed to be trying to frame the outcome on his own terms by insisting he would still be able to protect the border  right now  were building a lot of wall  he said in fact  no new walls have been built or financed by congress based on the prototypes that the trump administration unveiled in october 2017  projects to replace or repair about 40 miles of existing barriers have been started or completed since 2017 construction of the first extension of the current barriers  14 miles of a levee wall in the rio grande valley  is scheduled to begin this month  but a butterfly center has asked a judge to block construction because the barrier would bisect its property in his remarks on tuesday  mr  trump flip flopped again on taking responsibility for the government shutdown  during the weeks leading up to the impasse  mr  trump said he would be proud to shut down the government for border security and would not blame democrats  then during the shutdown  as 800 000 federal workers were caught in the middle without paychecks  he blamed democrats after all on tuesday  he switched gears again and took responsibility  i accepted the first one  and im proud of what weve accomplished because people learned during that shutdown all about the problems coming in from the southern border  he said  i accept it  ive always accepted it  but this one  i would never accept it if it happens  but i dont think its going to happen  but this would be totally on the democrats as mr  trump weighed his options  one person familiar with his thinking described him as frustrated by months of republicans not doing what he hoped to see done at the border a few weeks ago  in a meeting with restrictionist immigration group leaders  mr  trump faulted former speaker paul d  ryan  a fellow republican  for repeatedly deferring action on the wall  with promises of doing it down the road  now hes out fishing  mr  trump declared  according to an attendee the new agreement includes a provision that could give the trump administration broad discretion to increase the number of slots to shelter detained migrants  a win for republicans that could ease the sting of mr  trumps failure to secure full funding for his wall on its face  the agreement authorizes the department of homeland security to fund about 40 000 beds for detainees  many of them in facilities run by for profit companies and immigration and customs enforcement near the border in texas  arizona and california in background briefings  house democratic aides described the language as a glide path from the current level of 49 000 detention beds back to obama era levels of 35 000 or fewer but a summary of the provisions drafted by senate republican staff members placed the average number of beds funded under the deal at a much higher number  45 274  including 2 500 for families  and that could rise to as many as 58 500 beds  republican aides asserted in internal communications  because federal cabinet departments have latitude in how they use funds under the complex funding formula in the agreement  the department of homeland security would have reprogramming authority to transfer as much as  750 million from other programs into detention in short  there is more than enough flexibility for ice to respond to any forthcoming surges in illegal immigrations and apprehensions  the document said two democratic aides said the republican memo was accurate in theory  but added that such a drastic expansion in beds was unlikely because it would require taking money from other important programs  such as disaster relief democrats on the committee that hashed out the deal  under pressure from immigrant rights groups and their partys ascendant liberal wing  stalled talks over the weekend by demanding that any deal include a cap of 16 500 beds dedicated to housing detainees apprehended through sweeps of communities away from the border  there are currently 20 000 such slots immigrant rights advocates expressed disappointment  for the last two years  weve been in a defensive posture  working to hold the line and prevent the bad  but now house democrats have the power to start doing good  said lorella praeli of the american civil liberties union  which has sued the trump administration over its detention policies on the other side of the ideological divide  representative tom graves  republican of georgia and one of the 17 house and senate lawmakers negotiating a deal  said on twitter that he had not signed off or seen a final agreement  but based on the reports  i have concerns  he said  lots of questions too senator richard c  shelby  republican of alabama  the chairman of the senate appropriations committee and one of four lawmakers who worked out the accord  said he was not worried about objections from the right in some areas  we probably got more than a lot of people expected  and in some areas we didnt get as much  he said  but thats the nature of the beast .

from day 1 in the oval office  president trump has shown a unique obsession with the financial markets  tweeting that high stock prices proved he was making america great again  but a new chapter opened in october  when the markets dropped sharply  and mr  trump began making critical presidential decisions with an eye to pushing stock prices back up as soon as the markets turned downward  mr  trump softened his hard line on chinese trade practices  trying to quiet market fears that his tariff threats against beijing would start a global trade war  then he started attacking the united states federal reserve  saying its interest rate policies were undermining stock prices  and followed with rants about firing the chairman of the fed  jerome powell  and last week  axios quoted a source who had spoken to mr  trump as saying that the president had delayed his threat to close the mexico border out of concern over how the markets would react for mr  trump to base serious decisions about trade  monetary policy and immigration on market mood swings ensures that the zany uncertainty of his tenure will continue to reach new heights mr  trumps sudden moderation on china was particularly striking because  in an otherwise mercurial career  he had remained consistent on trade  going back to the 1980s  mr  trump has been accusing asian competitors in particular of using unfair trade deals to steal americas lunch moreover  mr  trump has been drawing broad support for his hard line on trade with china  even among his critics in congress and in europe  many of them agreed that china was using state power to dominate the global information technology industry  exclude american companies from its domestic market and steal intellectual property  they were openly rooting for mr  trump to win on this issue  and to cut a tough deal yet when the markets fell on fear of a united states china trade war  mr  trump began to retreat  after taking office  his tweets on china attacked it for militarism  currency manipulation and unfair trade practices right up until the markets dropped in october  mr  trumps first conciliatory tweet came on nov  1  describing a pleasant chat about trade with president xi jinping  and he has been talking up their incredible relationship and progress in trade talks since by last month  amid reports that trump advisers were calculating how big of a stock market pop they could expect from a trade deal  washington insiders from both parties were worrying aloud that the president might accept any deal china would sign mr  trump  meanwhile  was executing a similar about face on the fed  as a candidate  he had attacked the central bank for keeping rates so low and inflating a big fat ugly bubble in the markets  once he took office  mr  trump stopped tweeting attacks on the fed  until november  when he began to blame the central bank for dampening market spirits with high interest rates  in recent weeks  mr  trump has not only fulminated about replacing mr  powell  he has also started considering market friendly loyalists for seats on the fed board of governors mr  trumps most recent market driven u turn appears to have come on immigration  another subject near and dear to him  so far  the stock markets have not reacted negatively to his aggressive efforts to secure funding for a border wall  including the government shutdown and the declaration of a national emergency  nonetheless  when mr  trump backed off on his threat to close the southern border  the axios source explained the presidents decision this way  its the markets  closing the border  the markets would plummet no president has shown this kind of deference  jimmy carter  ronald reagan and both bushes mentioned the stock markets rarely and cautiously  bill clinton counseled against responding to their gyrations  in early 2009  barack obama suggested it was a good time to buy battered american stocks and was proved right when the markets hit bottom a week later  but mr  obama was criticized for acting as stock picker in chief and did not talk about stock prices again as president mr  trump is not only reading the markets as a daily measure of his success  he is also shaping policy to keep prices high  and recent market rises have rewarded him for it  after mr  trump turned conciliatory on china  the fed announced it was suspending further rate increases  and stocks began climbing back toward record highs so whos in charge  mr  trump or the markets  one critical test is the united states china trade talks  which are set to wrap up soon in a meeting between mr  trump and mr  xi  a tough agreement would help confirm that markets arent completely dictating policy even then  mr  trumps willingness to bend policy to please the markets is now clear  and its risky  in recent years the stock markets have grown larger than the economy  and they are now big enough to take the economy down with them when they deflate  policymakers are wary of poking this beast  but feeding it will only make the markets larger and more demanding .
washington  in declaring a national emergency to try to build his long promised border wall  president trump invoked extraordinary and seldom used authorities to bypass congresss constitutionally granted power of the purse democrats are fuming  and many members of mr  trumps party are uneasy about the precedent that such a declaration will set  lawmakers seeking to block the president have two paths  one in congress  the other in the courts democrats  who control the house  will drive the opposition  party leaders did not detail their plans on thursday  as they reviewed options and awaited the text of the presidents declaration  but outspoken senior lawmakers indicated that they will likely use both paths at once he may want to talk to a good lawyer  said senator patrick j  leahy of vermont  the top democrat on the appropriations committee no  congress does not have the power to stop the president from declaring a national emergency  but when lawmakers granted the president emergency powers in the first place  they built a check into the law under the national emergencies act  the house and the senate can take up what is called a joint resolution of termination to end the emergency status if they believe the president is acting irresponsibly or the threat has dissipated  representative joaquin castro  democrat of texas and the head of the congressional hispanic caucus  said late thursday that he was ready to introduce such a resolution if mr  trump followed through  with a comfortable majority in the chamber  democrats will most likely pass it or a similarly worded resolution i will fully support the enactment of a joint resolution to terminate the presidents emergency declaration  in accordance with the process described in the national emergencies act  and intend to pursue all other available legal options  said representative jerrold nadler of new york  the chairman of the judiciary committee to keep a presidents party from bottling such a measure up  the law says that if one chamber passes such a resolution  the other one must bring it up for a vote within 18 days  though democrats are in the minority in the senate  they would need only a handful of republicans to join them to pass the resolution there and send it to mr  trumps desk  it is easy to imagine a half dozen or more republican senators joining democrats out of concern for the precedent that mr  trumps declaration will set as with any other bill that comes to the presidents desk  mr  trump can veto a joint congressional resolution terminating the national emergency  though supermajorities in both the house and the senate could ultimately override him congress did not originally intend to give the president this recourse when it enacted the law during the post watergate reform era that has governed how and when presidents may invoke emergency power statutes  but the supreme court struck down what it calls legislative vetoes in 1983  ruling that for a congressional act to take legal effect  it must be presented to the president for signature or veto  because it takes two thirds of both chambers to override a veto  the ruling made it substantially harder for congress to stop a presidents declaration this is the crucial question  half a dozen or so republicans made their disapproval of an emergency declaration clear on thursday i dont believe that the national emergencies act contemplated a president repurposing billions of dollars outside the normal appropriations process  said senator susan collins  republican of maine  i also believe it will be challenged in court and is of dubious constitutionality senator rand paul  republican of kentucky and an ally to the president on other issues  said a national emergency declaration of this sort ran counter to the separation of powers outlined in the constitution  senator patrick j  toomey  republican of pennsylvania  agreed my view is that this is better to be resolved through the legislative process  he said still  it is highly unlikely that democrats can pick up enough republican supporters in the house or the senate to override mr  trumps likely veto  the best case for the presidents opponents is that they show deep fissures among republicans over the wall  they could also try to build bipartisan support for legislation preventing mr  trump from drawing money for the wall from funds allocated by congress for disaster relief here democrats appear to have two choices  the house could either support a lawsuit challenging the emergency declaration brought by a third party or file a suit of its own  there are questions about the houses legal standing if it were to try to sue on its own  and house leaders and their lawyers will have to decide if it is worth risking filing suit themselves only to be dismissed by a judge for lack of standing  regardless  a legal challenge is likely to tie up mr  trumps efforts in court for an extended period of time .
washington  the senate on wednesday again rebuked president trump for his continued defense of saudi arabia after the killing of the dissident journalist jamal khashoggi  voting for a second time to end american military assistance for the kingdoms war in yemen and to curtail presidential war powers the 54 to 46 vote  condemning a nearly four year conflict in yemen that has killed thousands of civilians and inflicted a devastating famine  sets the foundation for what could become mr  trumps first presidential veto  with the house expected to overwhelmingly pass the measure  possibly this month  the vote also might be the opening salvo in a week where senate republicans have the opportunity to hit back at the presidents aggressive use of executive power  on thursday  the chamber will vote on a resolution that would overturn mr  trumps declaration of a national emergency to secure funding for his border wall the united states congress is going to reassert its constitutional responsibility over issues of war that have been abdicated for presidents  democrats and republicans  for too many years  said senator bernie sanders  independent of vermont senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  encouraged lawmakers on wednesday to oppose the yemen resolution  calling it inappropriate and counterproductive and warning them not to conflate their displeasure with the administrations response to mr  khashoggis death with the broader issue of the conflict in yemen  but in a show of defiance  seven republican senators broke ranks to join the resolution  mike lee  of utah  susan collins of maine  steve daines of montana  jerry moran of kansas  lisa murkowski of alaska  rand paul of kentucky  and todd young of indiana still  senator christopher s  murphy  democrat of connecticut and one of the lead backers of the yemen resolution  warned that we shouldnt overstate the republican anti trump renaissance  noting that both resolutions under consideration this week had 50 vote thresholds and that republican defections were relatively limited supporters of the yemen resolution have faced a long and grueling road to get the legislation onto the presidents desk  the senate  led by the resolutions authors  mr  sanders  mr  murphy and mr  lee  first passed the measure 56 to 41 in december  but paul d  ryan  the house speaker at the time  refused to take up the resolution his successor  speaker nancy pelosi  did take it up  and the house easily passed it last month  but house democrats inadvertently derailed the process by supporting a surprise procedural motion offered by republicans to declare the chambers opposition to anti semitism  by attaching an unrelated amendment to the yemen resolution  the house ended its privileged status  which would have forced the senate to quickly take it up and send it to mr  trump the vote on wednesday was essentially a do over  and house leadership and the congressional progressive caucus  wary of a repeat derailment  are already urging democrats to oppose any unrelated amendments that republicans might add the resolution is a rare use of the 1973 war powers act  which gave congress the ability to compel the removal of military forces absent a formal declaration of war  those powers  created after the vietnam war  have almost never been used  as lawmakers have demurred from intervening in politically delicate matters of war  peace and support for the troops the conflict in yemen is proving to be different  and the resolution vote came as republicans have become increasingly willing to register their unhappiness with mr  trumps foreign policy  the senate has rebuked the president on his plan to withdraw troops from syria and afghanistan  and the house overwhelmingly registered its opposition to his threats to pull the united states from the north atlantic treaty organization but anger over the administrations dismissive response to the killing of mr  khashoggi  a virginia based columnist for the washington post  has been intense and sustained after first playing down his own intelligence officials reports that the saudi crown prince  mohammed bin salman  was responsible for the killing  mr  trump then blew past a legally mandated deadline that required the white house to report to congress whether it believed the prince was personally responsible for mr  khashoggis death in an attempt to defuse rising anger on capitol hill  the white house sent two aides from the state and treasury departments last week to a closed door briefing before the senate foreign relations committee  but senators on the panel were left unsatisfied  with some suggesting it was time for the full senate to act the senate will have to decide whether its going to impose its own sanctions  said senator marco rubio  republican of florida the foreign relations committee  now overseen by senator jim risch of idaho  a trump loyalist  however  has yet to report out bipartisan legislation introduced last month that would impose new sanctions on the kingdom  mr  risch condemned the passage of the resolution on wednesday evening  calling it a terrible message of u s  division and lack of resolve and a bad precedent for using the war powers resolution to express political disagreements with a president last month  saudi arabia  anxious to turn a new page after the killing of mr  khashoggi  appointed princess reema bint bandar bin sultan as its new ambassador to the united states  she will replace prince khalid bin salman  a son of king salman and a younger brother of the crown prince  who took the post in 2017 .

expected  apples numbers were a flop  to blame  chinas economic lethargy and a dwindling consumer demand for iphones   facebook  on the other hand  or thumb   reported record profits  it would seem that facebook won this round  until apple rained on its parade by shutting down an app that facebook was using to snoop around in users online activity  apple hasnt been shy about policing privacy

the federal reserve  jerome powell  said last wednesday that the case for raising rates has weakened somewhat  signaling that rates may not go up this year after all  this was an about face from the feds previous indications that it was planning to raise rates twice more in 2019  the markets were cheered by mr  powells remarks  and american stocks surged to their best january levels in 30 years  but some investors were puzzled by the feds sudden change of heart  and others worried that it revealed the risk of a recession on the horizon president nicols maduro of venezuela issued a threat to the united states last wednesday  saying if the trump administration doesnt quit trying to oust him and install the opposition leader  juan guaid  its officials would get a vietnam worse than they can imagine  hes widely viewed as an illegitimate dictator who drove his once prosperous country into an economic catastrophe  but hes got some heft on his side  russia  which has provided financial and military backing to venezuela for years  is also none too pleased about the united states oil sanctions against mr  maduros government  not by coincidence  the russian state owns part of venezuelas energy sector  a cash cow that it doesnt want to lose  now that the government has  temporarily  reopened  mr  trump will deliver the postponed state of the union address on tuesday  he has said he will emphasize unity  and he will surely point to the countrys economic growth and low unemployment numbers   januarys jobs report was better than expected  even with the shutdown   he may also reiterate his demand for a border wall  which he said last thursday he would build regardless of whether he gets congressional support before the feb  15 deadline for a new spending bill  if he decides to bypass congress  the government could close again  which no one wants  the congressional budget office has estimated that last months shutdown would cost the countrys economy an estimated  3 billion in reduced output in 2019  china and the united states made some progress in trade talks last week  but china still isnt willing to make all the concessions that united states officials have demanded  so what will it take to settle this trade war before the 90 day truce ends on march 2  mr  trump says he wants china to buy more american goods  on top of beijings recent pledge to purchase five million tons of soybeans  and open its markets to american businesses more than it has ever done  he is planning to meet with president xi jinping of china sometime in february  ostensibly to sign a deal in person  but details are still forthcoming  as is the deal itself  and around we go again  british lawmakers voted on tuesday to send the beleaguered prime minister theresa may back to european union leaders to renegotiate the terms of britains departure from the bloc  the problem is  those european union leaders are done talking  as theyve said before and will say again  that gives mrs  may little time  and even fewer options  to come up with a new plan before the next scheduled vote in parliament on feb  14  followed by the actual brexit deadline on march 29  as a no deal scenario appears more likely  more british companies are hoarding products and moving operations elsewhere to protect themselves from a potential economic meltdown  the record low temperatures that gripped the country last week could cost the economy up to  5 billion in business closings  property damage  flight cancellations  power cuts and even beer deliveries  the entire nation of tonga had

the wall by john lanchesterearlier this year  the times reported that president trumps pledge to build a border wall had been invented by his advisers as a memory trick to keep an unpredictable candidate focused on the issue of immigration  this tells us a lot about trump  but it also speaks to the power of the wall as a symbol  which is both monumental in its simplicity and elusive enough to sustain any number of meanings  often based  as ursula k  le guin notes in the dispossessed  on which side of it the observer happens to stand this is the wall that fascinated jorge luis borges  who marveled that the emperor who ordered the construction of the great wall of china also burned all of the books in his kingdom  and pink floyd  who put it on the cover of an album about a celebrity who dreams of becoming a dictator  john lanchesters new novel  also called the wall  arrives at a moment in which the definition of a wall is a matter of national debate  and it actively invites such associations  as the main character says on the first page  as he searches for words to describe the wall of the title  you look for metaphors the narrator is a young man with the kafkaesque name of joseph kavanagh  he has just arrived at the wall  a long low concrete monster that runs for thousands of kilometers around the periphery of an unnamed island nation  closing it off completely from the outside world  all citizens are required to serve there for two years as defenders  forming the last line of resistance against the threat of an armed invasion  this recalls the nights watch of game of thrones  except that the country is recognizably britain  and the enemies on the other side arent supernatural white walkers  but human beings in rowboats and dinghies as in many dystopian novels  the narrative hints at its back story through the ominous appearance in the text of unexplained proper nouns  the change  the breeders  the others  before revealing that an environmental cataclysm has produced rising sea levels and extreme weather across the globe  britain  which has been spared the worst  uses the wall  a literal brexit  to keep out both water and unwanted immigrants  as kavanagh makes modest plans for his future  falls in love and finds small forms of consolation  there are shades of kazuo ishiguros never let me go  but trouble lies ahead  and the second half turns into an ordeal that evokes cormac mccarthys the road like most of its literary precursors  the wall opens long after the change  which allows lanchester to present his society as a given  without having to worry about the details of the transition  a luxury granted to novelists  if not politicians  the catastrophe evidently happened over a short period of time  creating a historical dividing line as decisive as the wall itself  and everyone knows whose fault it was  the world hadnt always been like this and  the people responsible for it ending up like this were our parents  them and their generation this kind of moral clarity has little to do with the real devastation wrought by climate change  which promises to be just gradual enough to allow those who caused it to avoid blame during their lifetimes  lanchesters vision of an agonized cultural reckoning seems like its own sort of wishful thinking  and even if we grant his premise  many of his conclusions  like the notion that most people would stop having babies out of sheer guilt  are less than persuasive  yet if the novel succeeds only intermittently as a parable  its gripping as a story  especially when it leaves the wall  as lanchester puts distance between himself and his gigantic symbol  the plot grows less constrained  and the last hundred pages are full of tense action and sudden reversals that are mercifully unburdened by any allegorical significance the result marks a step forward for lanchester  a formidably intelligent author who has sometimes stumbled over his undeniable gifts  his debut  the debt to pleasure  was so pleased by its nabokovian conceit  a murderers confession posing as a cookbook  that it settled for a series of variations on the same dark joke  more recently  capital was a credible effort at a big social novel that was so densely reported that its characters barely had room to interact or change for a certain type of realistic novelist  a shift to speculative fiction  which allows the writer to invent as well as observe  can be liberating  the wall revels in this opportunity  but it occasionally falters under lanchesters decision  which echoes never let me go  to keep most of his people slightly colorless  as if to contrast their ordinary inner lives with their horrific situations  in practice  the narrators restricted voice prevents us from seeing his world as clearly as we should  and we learn frustratingly little about its most vulnerable actors  the climate refugees on the far side of the wall the novel gathers momentum as it goes  and few readers will stop until they reach its final page  early in the book  lanchester toys with the idea of concrete poetry  in which a poem is typeset to look like its subject  like a house or a christmas tree  in its closing lines  like the album of the same name  the novel doubles back on itself to take the shape of the wall  but it lives most vividly in the places where its meticulous structure breaks down  lanchester constructs a more elegant wall in prose than any politician could in concrete  but the limits that it imposes on itself are still barriers  no matter how artistically designed .
by many measures  america is thriving  the economy is humming  and unemployment is at 4 percent  high school graduation rates are at an all time high  and teenage pregnancy rates are at an all time low  the crime rate is way down  and illegal immigration has been declining for over a decade and yet  polls show that three in five americans think the country is on the wrong track  a majority expect things to get worse in the coming year  the presidents job approval numbers are underwater  congresss even more so as president trump prepares to deliver his delayed state of the union address on tuesday  he might want to ask himself why people are so unsettled our dysfunctional political system is surely taking a toll  witness the recent partial government shutdown over the presidents demand for  5 7 billion in border wall funding  for 35 days  a quarter of the federal government was derailed and 800 000 workers stripped of their livelihood  at an estimated loss of  3 billion in economic activity  all in service of nothing but a presidential tempest one certainty  there was not  and is not  a border emergency meriting the infliction of such pain and damage  or the waste of billions on a futile wall  mr  trump has said that his big speech on tuesday will cover a lot of territory and emphasize unity  considering that he pledged the same last year  its wise to remain skeptical  but if he is interested in assuring the public that he can see beyond his narrow politicking on immigration to tackle truly urgent problems  heres a starter list of possibilities health care  were going to have insurance for everybody  mr  trump promised  instead  after laboring to gut the affordable care act  he has so far produced only higher premiums and  according to a recent gallup survey  seven million more uninsured americans opioids  mr  trump was on the right track when  in october 2017  he declared opioid abuse a public health emergency  yet almost 50 000 americans died of opioid overdoses in 2017  more than were ever killed by guns or h i v  in a single year  economic inequality  in many ways this is the greatest economy in the history of america and the best time ever to look for a job  the president tweeted last june  not for all americans  real wages have barely budged for decades  the federal minimum wage of  7 25 an hour has not risen in nearly 10 years  though oversimplified  bernie sanderss claim that the top 0 1 percent control almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent is basically correct  before falling silent on the question  trump once vowed to eliminate a tax loophole that benefits wealthy hedge fund managers and private equity executives  that might be one proposal on which he could team up with the newly democratic house infrastructure  the president once sought  1 5 trillion in new spending on infrastructure  but congress allocated only  21 2 billion or slightly more than 1 percent of mr  trumps pledge  one quarter of bridges in the united states are structurally deficient or not designed to handle the current traffic  the department of transportation estimates  the lead contamination in the water system of flint  mich   shocked america  but it was one of many examples of lead poisoned water around the country  new yorks subways and public housing have fallen into decrepitude  schools in baltimore went without heat during last winter foreign policy  on the campaign trail  mr  trump pledged a middle east peace plan  where is it  meanwhile  we are spending roughly  700 billion annually on the military  our troops have been fighting in afghanistan for 17 years  thousands more troops remain in iraq  the high price of higher ed  student loan debt has topped  1 5 trillion and now constitutes the second largest category of consumer debt  behind only mortgages  education secretary betsy devos  who recently declared the debt load a crisis in higher education  has proposed no credible plan to address it gun safety  weve seen too much of it  and were going to stop it  mr  trump said in the wake of the parkland  fla   school shooting last february  yet in 2017  more people were killed by guns than in any other of the past 50 years and at the highest rate since the crack epidemic of the mid 1990s  climate change  most scientists  and nations  see it as the mother of all crises  mr  trumps approach thus far  champion fossil fuels and  when the weather gets chilly  tweet a joke about how the nation could use more global warming  compromise on how to address the climate crisis will be hard to come by  but if the nations leaders are going to have a showdown  cant it at least be over a real problem  .
good morning  heres the sign up  if you dont already get california today by email  how californians get power has been in the news a lot lately  between pacific gas   electrics  woes and mayor eric garcettis recent announcement that the los angeles department of water and power would phase out three natural gas power plants on its way toward 100 percent renewable energy sources we have an obligation to end dependence on fossil fuels  embrace the technologies of tomorrow  and prioritize renewable energy  mr  garcetti said in a statement to the times this week the question now is how to do that today  the residential solar power provider sunrun released a report with what its leaders said could be the answer  a mass deployment of residential solar panels  along with batteries  that collectively form a kind of virtual power plant operated by a utility if one of the challenges is that we want to decommission three of these gas plants  we believe that with rooftop solar and storage  we could pretty easily replace one of them by 2030  said lynn jurich  sunruns chief executive and co founder according to the report  although l a  already has 36 000 homes with rooftop solar units  as a percentage  its fractional  2 5 percent of residential customers  compared with san diegos 11 percent  or 139 000 homeowners expanding l a s total to 75 000 homes and apartment buildings  with batteries  could provide enough power to replace one of the retiring plants and cost  60 million less  the report says the batteries  ms  jurich said  would give customers a backup power source when its less sunny  addressing a primary concern about solar  read about sunruns challenge to tesla  the report suggests a virtual power plant could also counter another concern about residential solar power  that upfront costs make it too expensive for many would be customers you can contract with the utility  so you can use that credit  she said sunrun  however  has an interest in promoting solar power  so how realistic is its suggestion i put that question to bill powers  an engineer in san diego who serves as an expert witness on behalf of consumers before utility regulators across the country what sunrun is proposing is absolutely doable  it is the future and it will happen  he told me  from a technological and cost standpoint  it would be straightforward to make the transition the problem  he said  is that it is so diametrically counter to the way investor owned utilities and even large publicly owned utilities have made money and done business historically but  mr  powers said  as pushback against the investor owned pacific gas   electric has built up  large scale solar power in l a  could be a model for cities like san francisco  which is exploring creating city owned utilities whats happening in the state is a general grass roots fatigue with investor owned utilities  he said aura vasquez  a commissioner for the los angeles department of water and power  said she thought that  ultimately  rooftop solar will be a big  cost effective source of the citys power in the future  but getting there will be the tough part staff are excited and they want to do it  she

the trump organization said late tuesday that it was implementing a system to weed out undocumented immigrants who try to get jobs at its properties  the move followed reports in the new york times last month that the presidents company was employing people at its flagship golf club in new jersey who are in the country illegally we are actively engaged in uniforming this process across our properties and will institute e verify at any property not currently utilizing this system  eric trump  an executive vice president of the company  said in a statement  as a company we take this obligation very seriously and when faced with a situation in which an employee has presented false and fraudulent documentation  we will take appropriate action thousands of employers have enrolled voluntarily in the governments e verify electronic system  which checks documents provided by new hires against social security administration and department of homeland security records  a mismatch suggests that the person is unauthorized to work all federal contractors must use e verify  and 22 states require at least some private and public employers to do so  the federal e verify database suggested that the trump organization did not use heightened employment document verification procedures at several of its properties  meaning that the chances of employing undocumented workers was high the new york times reported in december that undocumented immigrants had been employed for years at the trump national golf club in bedminster  n j   as housekeepers  landscapers and kitchen staff they were kept on the payroll despite the fact that management was aware that they had used phony documents to secure employment  as is common among undocumented immigrants victorina morales  an undocumented immigrant from guatemala  said that a manager at bedminster helped her secure a new fake social security number and legal permanent residency card after telling her that those on file had expired since the articles were published  about a dozen workers deemed ineligible to work in the united states because they lacked legal immigration status have been terminated at the bedminster club  according to people familiar with the matter another dozen were fired at the trump national golf club in westchester earlier this month  a development first reported by the washington post i must say  for me personally  this whole thing is truly heartbreaking  mr  trump said in the statement on tuesday  our employees are like family but when presented with fake documents  an employer has little choice he said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the trump organization  and that it demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately the trump organization said last month that it would immediately terminate those who were not authorized to work in the united states  but for several weeks it failed to respond to questions about what measures it was taking to rectify the situation president trump has made border security and protecting jobs for americans cornerstones of his presidency  from the border wall he has pledged to build  it recently resulted in the partial government shutdown  to the workplace raids and payroll audits that his administration has carried out mr  trump launched his bid for the g o p  presidential nomination in june 2015  declaring that the united states had become a dumping ground for everybody elses problems  mexico was sending people to commit crimes and bring drugs  theyre rapists  and some  i assume  are good people  he said in a speech in arizona shortly after  he deemed illegal immigration a major  major problem in this country  vowing to erect a wall along the southwest border in august 2015  mr  trump told the times that his companies employed only people with legal work papers when the trump international hotel opened for business in washington  the president boasted that he had used e verify to ensure that only those legally entitled to work were hired we didnt have one illegal immigrant on the job  mr  trump said then about 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the united states and about eight million of them are in the labor force  according to the pew research center  a nonpartisan think tank  it is an open secret that many businesses  especially in the service sector  employ them to deter illegal hiring  immigration and customs enforcement conducts audits of businesses  having slapped tens of millions of dollars in administrative and criminal penalties on those found to employ undocumented workers since the early 2000s  these inspections have intensified under the trump administration from oct  1  2017  through july 20  2018  ice opened 6 093 work site investigations and made 675 criminal and 984 administrative work site related arrests  several times more than in the entire 2017 fiscal year from oct  1  2016 to sept  30  2017 employers who use e verify contend that they struggle to attract enough workers to perform menial  physically onerous jobs  the vast majority of businesses simply require applicants to fill out a federal form  the i 9  and present identification and social security card  which they assume are genuine .

tom brokaw  the former anchor of nbc nightly news  apologized sunday evening for comments about hispanics and assimilation he made earlier in the day on the networks meet the press i feel terrible a part of my comments on hispanics offended some members of that proud culture  mr  brokaw tweeted  i never intended to disparage any segment of our rich  diverse society which defines who we are mr  brokaw  who retired as anchor in 2004 and currently serves as a special correspondent for nbc  had nonchalantly said that hispanics should make a greater effort to blend into american culture  his comments  made during a discussion about president trumps desired border wall  led to an immediate backlash hispanics should work harder at assimilation  mr  brokaw said  thats one of the things ive been saying for a long time  they ought not to be just codified in their communities but make sure that all of their kids are learning to speak english  and that they feel comfortable in the communities  and thats going to take outreach on both sides  frankly yamiche alcindor  the white house correspondent for pbs newshour and a former new york times reporter  was also on the panel and responded to mr  brokaws comments youre talking about assimilation  i grew up in miami  where people speak spanish  but their kids speak english  and the idea that we think americans can only speak english  as if spanish and other languages wasnt always part of america  is  in some ways  troubling  ms  alcindor said among those who criticized mr  brokaw was representative joaquin castro  democrat of texas  he explained in a twitter thread that even though there are generations of hispanics in the united states  they are  in his opinion  never truly considered american for a celebrated journalist who spent years chronicling american society you seem stunningly ignorant of the hispanic community in this country  mr  castro tweeted  unfortunate to see xenophobia pass for elevated political commentary the national association of hispanic journalists denounced mr  brokaw in a statement released on sunday brokaws comments also ignore the fact that most u s  hispanics are born in the united states  english is their native language  the statement read the organization also criticized him for what it viewed as an insufficient apology the sorry some hispanics were offended apology tweeted by tom brokaw earlier this evening is not an apology at all  the group said  it only further demonstrates brokaws lack of understanding of what forced assimilation does to communities in a 2016 national survey of latinos  pew found that 41 percent of hispanic adults between the ages of 18 and 35 use english as their dominant language  the study found that 40 percent of hispanics in the same age group are also bilingual another pew study found that americans with hispanic ancestry are less likely to identify as hispanic as generations go on  by the third generation  the share that self identifies as hispanic falls to 77 percent assimilation is denying one culture for the other  said hugo balta  the president of nahj and a senior producer at msnbc  hispanics are no less american for embracing their country of origin or that of their ancestors  being bicultural and bilingual is a strength in an increasingly multiethnic  multilingual society mr  brokaw opened his commentary by claiming that people on the republican side do not want their children to marry hispanics a lot of this  we dont want to talk about  but the fact is  on the republican side  a lot of people see the rise of an extraordinary  important new constituent in american politics  hispanics  who will come here and all be democrats  he said  i hear when i push people a little harder  i dont know whether i want brown grandbabies  i mean  thats also a part of it one of former president george h w  bushs grandchildren took offense to the brown babies comment with all due respect  tombrokaw i am one of those little brown ones and can assure you that my grandparents conveyed to me that they loved and were proud of me before they passed  tweeted george p  bush  the texas land commissioner and a son of former gov  jeb bush of florida mr  bush and his two siblings  who are mexican american  were once famously referred to as the little brown ones by their late grandfather  who claimed to use the term affectionately as the anchor of nightly news  mr  brokaw  78  was the face of nbc for more than 20 years  since he stepped down in 2004  he has appeared on the networks news shows  most often to discuss politics  elections and historical events  mr  brokaw has also produced and directed documentaries and special segments mr  brokaw sent out a bizarre string of tweets along with his apology  at one point writing  my tweet portal is whack finally  i am sorry i failed to convey my strong belief that diversity  dynamic and inclusive  is what makes america  he said in a statement released monday night  a spokesperson for nbc news said  toms comments were inaccurate and inappropriate and were glad he apologized .
washington  the government shutdown that ended last month has taken a lasting hit on the coast guard  which has grounded aircraft  stopped major ship repairs and will leave parts of an air station in puerto rico without emergency generators for the start of hurricane season because of a backlog that will take months to process internal documents obtained by the new york times show that the coast guards ship maintenance command lost at least 7 456 productive workdays  or 28 5 years worth of workdays  as a direct result of the partial shutdown  which furloughed 6 400 civilian employees this reality poses significant risk to operational availability of cutters and boats  the documents concluded the service also noted a domino effect that has caused delays in repairs and maintenance on its roughly 200 aircraft  which  in turn  could keep them from being immediately available there are tremendous backlogs of contractor work  the documents said  sign up for the weekly at war newsletter to receive stories about duty  conflict and consequence  the delays are expected to significantly limit the number of ships and aircraft available for coast guard operations  which generally include drug interdiction as well as search and rescue and maritime safety missions  they will also affect the training of the uniformed and civilian coast guard force you can get the money  but you can never get the time  said mark f  cancian  a senior adviser at the center for strategic and international studies  its going to hurt them for quite a while the shutdown ended on jan  25  but over 35 days  as president trump held out for  5 7 billion in congressional funding for a border wall  most federal agencies were unable to pay their employees or contractors  that included the coast guard  the only branch of the military that is not part of the pentagon as a branch of the department of homeland security  the coast guard went without pay until the shutdown ended  according to the documents  the coast guard finance center in virginia processed about  46 000 in mutual assistance loans  funds often reserved for dire personal hardships  and at least one special request for a service member who sought approval for outside employment during the shutdown  coast guard members continued activities authorized by law that provided for national security and protected life and property  chief warrant officer barry lane  a coast guard spokesman in washington said in a statement to the times on friday  the coast guard stopped or curtailed some specific mission activities that did not fall into those categories the documents  dated the day before the shutdown ended  outlined a grim forecast for the small service of 55 000 active duty  reserve and civilian employees over the last decade  the coast guard has struggled to secure steady funding levels from congress  it did receive a  600 million lift this month after a spending bill funded a replacement for the polar star  the coast guards only heavy icebreaker but the shutdown hobbled the vessel  which the documents described as one of the coast guards highest priority ships  the spare parts inventory for the 400 foot polar stars three pratt and whitney gas turbine engines were below safety stock levels  the documents said  and an employee was taken off furlough to work on a maintenance contract issue for the vessel other examples of the shutdowns effects on the coast guard included  roughly 600 employees at the aviation logistics center in elizabeth city  n c   potentially would have to work overtime for five to seven months to make up for production lost during the impasse  the number of aircraft across the coast guard deemed not mission capable doubled to 10 percent of the aircraft  from 5 percent  twenty five aircraft  roughly 12 percent of the coast guard fleet  that are under maintenance have had their completion dates pushed back a total of 277 days in the short term  that has created a weekslong delay of delivering a training helicopter to mobile  ala   and a surveillance aircraft to miami  the surveillance aircraft are often used for maritime patrols and spotting drug runners  in alaska  a dry dock needed for repairs to the 110 foot cutter liberty was closed as a result of the shutdown  the liberty patrols some of the worlds most dangerous waters  and was preparing to go to sea from its home port in auke bay in mid january when one of its diesel engines seized  an engine replacement in one legend class cutter and modifications to the small boat launching equipment in the rest of the fleet were delayed  the legend cutters were built specifically to support pentagon operations  the ships already were plagued by cost overruns and delays  crucial maintenance was pushed back for two buoy tenders  smaller boats meant to ensure the position of navigational markers on internal waterways and rivers  one was based in keokuk  iowa  on the upper mississippi river  where thousands of tons of cargo pass through annually  the other  in chattanooga  tenn   maintains markers in the tennessee river and seven other rivers  as well as two creeks and one other waterway  at coast guard air station borniquen in puerto rico  where hurricane maria tore through in 2017  a project to install emergency generators for base housing will not be in place before the start of hurricane season  which begins june 1 .
if you had to pick the weirdest moment of the week  would it be feel free to add your own  whatever you say  ill probably believe you  its as if weve fallen down a rabbit hole and landed in a wonderland totally devoid of wonder even if you really  really want donald trump to be a total failure hurtling his way back toward civilian life  its not comforting to have a president whos so out to lunch  just think about that trip to texas  mcallen  the city trump chose to demonstrate the terror of wall free borders  was recently listed by u s  news   world report as one of the best places to retire in the nation  but the president  who was making only his second trip to the border since he took office  assured the public he knew how terrible things are because i have been there numerous times and that was just one tiny piece of his week  the big news  of course  was our catapult toward an all time government shutdown record pop quiz  when trump was invited to comment on the pain of the unpaid government workers  did he say a  that its better than being killed by an illegal immigrant b  that a lot of them think its worth missing their salaries to get a wall c  that he  too  had to suffer by spending the holidays in the white house d  all of the above o k   i know that was too easy it does feel as if weve fallen down a rabbit hole into an alternate universe that is definitely not wonderland  just keep telling yourself that it isnt going to last forever  soon the presidential primary races will be underway and concerned citizens will have something to talk about besides the mad hatter  it looks as if the democrats are going to have lots of serious policy discussions  and the fact that this week beto orourke posted videos of himself having his teeth cleaned is just one hint that there will also be plenty of cheering diversion meanwhile  your best options near term are either to get together with friends and drink heavily  or crawl under your bed and assume a fetal position if the floor under the bed looks too dusty  you can always hire a government employee to vacuum just for the sake of perspective  try to imagine how the nation would have responded if trumps week had happened under barack obama  obviously obama didnt have a yen for border walls  but he was a big proponent of gun regulation  suppose  just for the sake of comparison  he told congress he wanted billions of dollars to confiscate all the automatic weapons in the country then imagine the opposing party dug in its heels  and obama announced he was going to veto any spending package that didnt include his plan  the government shuts down  then obama makes a special address to the nation from the oval office  my fellow americans  tonight i am speaking to you because there is a growing crisis over guns  he begins no fair pointing out that at least he wouldnt sound like he was gasping for breath every time he read a sentence off the teleprompter by now  in our parallel universe  the nation  which had heard the gun speech several thousand times before  begins to drift away or debate whether his sniffling was from hay fever or nerves  nobodys mind gets changed  but the next day congressional leaders try to sit down and work out a compromise that might  say  invest a lot more money to enforce the existing laws  obama ignores them and demands  do all guns go  when they say no  he slaps the table  walks out the door  and lets the government just  stop  and maybe whines a little bit about how he had to spend christmas in washington well  obviously republicans would be shrieking for obamas impeachment  but trump just goes babbling along  secure in his conviction that the best way to protect our safety involves stopping the pay for air traffic controllers when a reporter asked whether he accepted the old harry truman line about how the buck stops here  our president responded that the buck stops with everyone  he wont even admit where the buck stops  do you think thats because hes just incapable of accepting responsibility or because he doesnt know who harry truman was on the plus side  in the future you can tell your grandchildren that you were there when the government set records for not being open for business  for now  take a federal worker to lunch .
mexico city  the guatemalan government said monday that it would expel a united nations backed anticorruption panel  giving its prosecutors a day to leave the country in the most decisive effort yet by president jimmy morales to remove the body that has been investigating him and other top politicians at a news conference in guatemala city  mr  morales  accompanied by members of his cabinet and several people accused in panel investigations or their relatives  defended his expulsion order cicig has put public security and governability at risk  he said  using the acronym for the panel  cicig has repeatedly violated the human rights of guatemalans and foreigners in guatemala through selective and partial justice earlier on monday  foreign minister sandra jovel accused the panel of interfering in guatemalas internal affairs  and said the government was withdrawing from an agreement with the united nations that established the panel more than a decade ago the panels international prosecutors had 24 hours to leave the country  ms  jovel said at a news conference at the united nations  after meeting with antnio guterres  its secretary general  mr  guterres has publicly expressed support for the panel  called the international commission against impunity in guatemala the expulsion of the commission  which works alongside guatemalan prosecutors to bring corruption cases  was immediately challenged in the countrys constitutional court in the 16 months since mr  morales first began trying to block the commissions work  the court has consistently ruled in its favor  his decision to summarily end the panels work sets the stage for a possible constitutional crisis if the court again rules against the government in a statement  stephane dujarric  a spokesman for mr  guterres  said that the secretary general strongly rejects the decision to end the agreement  and that he recalls the important contribution of cicig to the fight against impunity in guatemala mr  guterres expects the government of guatemala to protect the commissions personnel and fulfill its obligations under the agreement  mr  dujarric said mr  morales was not always so hostile to the corruption panel  which played a large role in his election in 2015 he swept into the presidency as an outsider candidate after the panels investigations had discredited many of his potential rivals and forced the president  otto prez molina  accused of leading a customs fraud scheme  to resign and after he took office  mr  morales promised to work closely with the commission  which under the leadership of ivan velsquez  a colombian prosecutor  had become increasingly effective at peeling back layers of corruption across much of guatemalas political and business elite but the panels success turned it into the focus of attack  after the panel and the attorney generals office accused mr  moraless brother and son in a fraud scheme  the governments relationship with the panel became tense when it accused mr  morales himself  of campaign finance irregularities  the government began an overt effort to block the panel  the government succeeded in keeping mr  velsquez out of the country  but he continued to work remotely last year mr  morales announced that he would not renew cicigs two year mandate when it expires in september  a decision permitted under the agreement with the united nations but now  rather than let the mandate simply run out  the government has moved to eject the panel ahead of the presidential election in june  under guatemalan law  mr  morales is not eligible to run for re election there was no immediate comment from the trump administration  which has cooled the united states longstanding support for the commission under intense lobbying from the morales government but representative norma torres  a democrat from california who was born in guatemala  was quick to condemn the guatemalan governments decision the commissions abrupt departure would be a major setback for guatemalas fight against corruption  she said  complex cases involving organized crime  drug trafficking  and human smuggling would fall apart  powerful criminals and corrupt politicians would get away with serious crimes american support for cicig  which includes paying for part of its budget  has been based on the premise that reducing corruption and improving the rule of law would help the broader effort to tackle the poverty and violence that are driving guatemalans to leave their country in the hope of reaching the united states thousands of destitute families from guatemala and honduras have gathered at the united states southern border in the past few months  many in large caravans that mr  trump has called an invasion  and used to argue for construction of a border wall .
we need to look at the bright side of donald trumps border wall fixation sure  hes shut down the government and thrown the nation into chaos  but it could be worse  he could be demanding a fiery moat between us and canada  or building a 36 000 foot deep barrier across the pacific ocean to drive home his commitment to tariffs see  theres always a silver lining trump wants a  5 7 billion down payment to build a wall along the mexican border to protect us from caravans of terrorists and drug dealers  we hadnt heard a lot about the caravan menace since the midterm elections  but the president brought it back on wednesday  this was shortly before he walked out of a meeting with democratic leaders about the government shutdown the two sides disagreed on who caused the talks to collapse  obviously  it was something about the you know what  senate minority leader chuck schumer claimed that when the wall came up  trump sort of slammed the table  and said we have nothing to discuss  republican leaders tried to pin all the blame on obdurate democrats i said bye bye  tweeted the president o k   this one is pretty clear  the meeting was brief  after only about 30 minutes  he who says bye bye is the culprit  even if  as house republican leader kevin mccarthy claimed  trump brought a little candy for everybody maybe all this wall obsessing makes trump tired  he certainly seemed low energy during his oval office address  he makes jeb bush look like a combination of mighty mouse and bruce springsteen  a friend of mine said after the president finished his nine minute speech to the american people  for every viewer whose response to the talk was wow  we should do something about immigration  there must have been a hundred whose first reaction was why does this man keep sniffing  deviated septum  nasal polyps  trumps breathing has actually sounded strange for a long time  but most of us have chosen to ignore it rather than engage in a national conversation about the presidents nose if you watched the address  and really  you could have  it was only about as long as it takes to microwave popcorn  you saw a 72 year old guy squinting at the teleprompter and making rather alarming breathing sounds while reading a speech about how we need a wall to protect women who are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through mexico this is not a man who should wrap his arguments around the idea of protecting women from sexual assault  but also  gee  he sounded like uncle fred who you havent seen for a while and suddenly he shows up for thanksgiving with weird colored hair and vacant eyes and hes talking into his mashed potatoes now we know why trump never made a speech from the oval office before  hes a guy whose great political talent is yelling applause lines to a howling mob of supporters  if they cheer  he goes back again and again  when he first announced he was running for president  he got an enthusiastic response to a speech that called mexicans drug dealing rapists  we will always wonder what would have happened if hed said pre k  all the way  and gotten a similar reaction  maybe this week hed be on tv refusing to fund the government until he got more money for early childhood education trumps political advisers encouraged him to carry on about a wall during the presidential campaign because they wanted him to focus on immigration and understood how difficult it is for him to stay with  a thought  as julie hirschfeld davis and peter baker of the times reported recently  the advisers knew he liked to brag about building stuff  so they decided to get him to talk about hes going to build a wall again  think of the bright side  what if theyd wanted his signature issue to be american pre eminence throughout the globe and got him to peddle a plan to build a huge tower that would reach all the way to heaven  hasnt been attempted since genesis  but if you stacked a million hotels on top of one another  make america great  by now trump would have closed off a quarter of illinois to make room for the foundation theres no way to be cheery about the government shutdown  this is really terrible  some of those suffering most are smaller government contractors  whose businesses could very well fail while they wait to be paid for work theyve already done   stiffing contractors is possibly the only area of his job in which our president has a lot of pregovernment experience  but about the wall  people  how do you feel about putting a concrete or whoops maybe steel slats barrier between us and mexico a  great way to avoid the constant danger of caravans b  meanspirited waste of money c  better than the fiery moat the beat goes on  thursday had trump scheduled for a visit to the texas mexico border  a trip that the president told a lunch with tv newscasters is not going to change a damn thing he sure sounds negative  do you think he believes hes already been to the border enough  after all  he already went there in 2018  next thing you know  theyll be expecting him to go there every year .
washington  a last ditch gambit to spare senate republicans a hostile showdown with president trump over the constitutions separation of powers was torpedoed on wednesday by the president himself  increasing the likelihood that the senate will vote on thursday to overturn the presidents emergency declaration and force the first veto of his term hoping to avoid a confrontation with mr  trump over his declaration of an emergency to build his coveted border wall  republicans tried to rally behind legislation to limit the power of presidents to declare emergencies in the future while allowing the current presidents end run around congress but speaker nancy pelosi quickly derided that idea and then mr  trump threw cold water on it himself  phoning the republican author of the new legislation  senator mike lee of utah  during a senate luncheon to inform him it was no deal as a result  mr  lee said he would now vote to end the emergency declaration  the fifth republican yes vote  and other republicans  with no alternative route  are likely to follow unfortunately  it appears the bill does not have an immediate path forward  so i will be voting to terminate the latest emergency declaration  said mr  lee  who had earlier said he did not think the presidents actions were unconstitutional the outcome left republicans with a difficult choice  they can back the president in what is widely seen as a surrender of congresss core power of controlling federal spending  or they can join democrats and break with a president who is popular within the party on his maneuver to build a wall that is also popular with republicans to mr  trump  the decision is not all that tough i think anybody going against border security  drug trafficking  human trafficking  that is a bad vote  the president told reporters at the white house as he delivered another warning shot to republicans who would dare to buck him  he also defended the constitutionality of his declaration despite the bipartisan refusal of congress to fund the wall i think it is bad for a republican senator  i also think it is bad for a democrat senator  to vote against border security and to vote against the wall  he said  i think to vote that way is a very bad thing long into the future but republicans are struggling with the vote  conservatives such as mr  lee and senator rand paul of kentucky  another republican who says he will vote for the resolution of disapproval  believe that members of congress have ceded far too much power to the executive branch over the years in an effort to avoid taking politically tough stances themselves  republicans regularly accused president barack obama of executive overreach on issues such as immigration  health care and the environment and now risk being accused of hypocrisy if they stand by while mr  trump ignores congress to do as he wishes many republicans believe that allowing mr  trump to redirect money at his own discretion after congress explicitly forbade it would amount to a final acquiescence to the executive branch that could set a precedent for future democratic presidents  but they are also in no rush to irritate a president who has shown vast capacity to stir republican voters or to rile the activist groups that back him on wednesday  the hill newspaper reported that conservative groups such as the club for growth were considering backing a primary challenge next year to senator thom tillis  republican of north carolina  because of his opposition to mr  trump on the emergency declaration and other issues looking for a way to not anger mr  trump and salvage some congressional pride  mr  lee introduced his proposal that would require congress to approve any emergency declaration or it would terminate after 30 days at most  that would mean approval by congress would be required rather than the current arrangement in which congress is given the option of disapproving an emergency declaration and the president can veto it  under the current legislative arrangement  congress can block an emergency declaration only if opponents can muster the two thirds vote to override a veto if we dont want our president acting like a king  we need to start taking back the legislative powers that allow him to do so  mr  lee said the lee bill  however  would have no impact on the presidents current emergency declaration  republicans saw it as a way to both back mr  trump and close the door to future use of the declarations by presidents  notably democratic presidents  to circumvent congress but the reception was not good  senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  mocked the proposal as bunk what a fig leaf  he exclaimed ms  pelosi effectively killed it by declaring that the house would not even consider the plan  republican senators are proposing new legislation to allow the president to violate the constitution just this once in order to give themselves cover  she wrote in a statement on wednesday morning  the house will not take up this legislation to give president trump a pass even before he spoke to reporters  mr  trump took issue on twitter with republican senators and their reticence to back him republican senators are overthinking tomorrows vote on national emergency  the president said  it is very simply border security no crime  should not be thought of any other way  we have a major national emergency at our border and the people of our country know it very well but the presidents stand only increased the likelihood that the democratic resolution to block his emergency would pass  less than 24 hours after the senate rebuked him on a separate issue by voting to end military assistance for saudi arabias war in yemen while it would be a loss for mr  trump  it may not be as bad as it could have been when the president first announced his determination to move forward with the emergency after signing a spending bill to end the government shutdown in february  there was significant dissent among republican senators and the white house faced a wider revolt in the interim  through a concerted personal campaign  mr  trump has had some success in limiting defections  proponents of overturning the declaration are likely to be far short of the 67 senate votes needed to override the promised veto still  congressional passage of a resolution of disapproval could help the plaintiffs in a number of lawsuits who are suing to block the declaration as a flagrant violation of the constitution .
president trump has declared a national emergency  purely in order to fund his wall  the courts may  or may not  reject his gambit  but the fact that he may actually possess the legal authority to require agencies to waste billions of dollars simply to fulfill a foolish campaign promise he thinks won him the election is itself scandalous  the theatrics surrounding his petulant threat to do so obscure a vital question for our democracy going far beyond this  non crisis  a question to which congress should immediately turn  who decides what constitutes a national emergency in hundreds of laws  congress has given the president the power to decide   the brennan center for justice has compiled an exhaustive list   but by failing to define crucial terms  legal standards and accountability rules  congress has handed presidents an all too handy tool of tyranny commonly used by autocrats to amass more power  crush dissent and eviscerate democratic institutions  in mr  trumps case  it has handed an unguided missile to an ignorant  impetuous man child congress should have known better  after all  it enacted the national emergencies act of 1976  which purported to regulate such declarations  only two years after president richard nixons abuses of power forced his resignation  the act actually made matters worse in a key respect  it defined a national emergency as a general declaration of emergency made by the president  this circular definition  of course  is no constraint at all  or as humpty dumpty says to alice  it means just what i choose it to mean  neither more nor less in the nature of national emergencies  some definitional leeways are unavoidable  but congress could readily specify certain conditions that must exist before the president can make such a declaration and thus arrogate to himself extraordinary powers  curtailing liberties  seizing property  spending funds appropriated for other purposes and suspending protective laws  that congress would not otherwise be likely to grant him in advance  or perhaps ever   indeed  congress has the power to override mr  trump s declaration and it should in this case  though it probably wont  one can easily specify some of the factors in a national emergency condition that any responsible congress would insist on before allowing such a declaration to take effect  magnitude  the feared incremental harms of the condition are very large  not just marginal   geographic scope  those harms should be nationwide even if the triggering condition is more localized   extraordinary  the condition should be rare  if not unprecedented   imminence  the anticipated harms should be so close in time that congress cannot deliberate   and likely effectiveness  the presidents action should promise to substantially solve the problem  reasonable people may disagree  of course  about precisely how congress should define and weigh these factors  how they should be applied to the facts on the ground and whether other factors should be considered  president trumps wall cannot survive such a rigorous analysis  even assuming that recent illegal border crossings harm the nation  they are not greater  indeed  they are probably fewer  than in recent decades  congress has been deliberating  in its fashion  for decades about immigration reform  including border walls  and many americans believe that the wall would be ineffective and a bad idea  congress simply disagrees with the president about which border security measures would do the job  an instance of decidedly normal politics but my larger claim  that congresss delegation to presidents of vast  essentially unconstrained power to declare national emergencies has been an irresponsible surrender of its constitutional responsibilities  does not depend on whether my assessment of this particular case is correct  not since the new deal has the supreme court struck down a statute for this kind of standardless delegation of legislative authority to administrative agencies  but the roberts court  activist  conservative and suspicious of broad delegations of power to agencies  recently reached out to review a case  gundy v  united states  that gives it an opportunity to revive the long dormant and doubtful non delegation doctrine another way to make the national emergencies act more compatible with the rule of law is through a procedure that would broaden participation in all future decisions to declare national emergencies  under one such reform  the president would have to consult with the leaders of both parties in congress before issuing a declaration  even if congress could not override such a declaration  members would have to take a public position on the facts and reasons invoked as justification by the president  if time were of the essence  not so in this case  congress has legislated about a wall for more than a decade   their responses would have to be expedited  with such a procedure in place  judicial review of the declaration could be narrow  if at all if national emergency declarations are as important as presidents  with congresss acquiescence  claim them to be  then they are important enough to be subjected to such standards and procedures  in the long run  this is more crucial to the vitality of our democracy than whether president trump ultimately gets his wall this article has been updated to reflect news developments  .

on thursday  nancy pelosi became the first person in 64 years to return to the position of speaker of the house of representatives  completing the most startling comeback in american politics since richard nixon became president her return says a great deal about ms  pelosi and about our politics  but above all it is a triumph of nerve and ability  republicans have tried for years to make ms  pelosis very name a curse  president trump and members of his party have called her  among many other things  the promoter of a socialist agenda and the unhinged face of her party  while others have labeled her as both the san francisco democrat that she is  and a machine politician from baltimore  where her father and an older brother both served as mayor the strategy seemed to be working  through most of last years midterm campaigns  many democrats also warily avoided endorsing her  speaking instead of the need to embrace a new generation of leadership and replace a toxic brand  but when the vote for speaker was over last week  there was ms  pelosi with gavel in hand again  having lost only 15 votes from her caucus how did this happen qualifying for congress today has come to seem more and more like the college admission process  where you pile up incredible achievements that will rarely benefit you on campus  the speakership  by contrast  is a place for pluggers  its an odd post  rare in democratic politics  where one can serve simultaneously in opposition and the majority  leading your own party in the house while dealing with a president from the other side there have been political stars in the office  henry clay put in the second longest time there  james g  blaine  the plumed knight of post civil war republicans  held the post for nearly six years  neither of them made it to the position they coveted  in the white house  though the one former speaker who did become chief executive  james k  polk  was the most successful one term president in our history  say what you will about his agenda  and a lot of people  then and now  had a lot to say  polk was a model of efficiency and won the mexican war  nearly doubled the size of the united states  lowered tariffs and instituted an independent treasury system before refusing to run for re election and quietly dying three months after leaving office  a very speaker like performance  when you think of it  ms  pelosi  the only woman to be speaker  is also the first person to repeat in the office since sam rayburn  who served a record 17 years as speaker over three different stretches in the office  the last of which only ended with his death  in 1961  mr  sam  a moderate texas democrat  twice exchanged the speakers gavel with his republican counterpart  joe martin  a moderate massachusetts conservative  this was back in a more parliamentary era  when no one considered the vagaries of voters in a national election to be a reason to kick out a perfectly able congressional leader rayburn helped steer the country through world war ii and much of the cold war  served faithfully under presidents franklin roosevelt  harry truman and dwight eisenhower  became a mentor to lyndon johnson  and insisted l b j  join the national ticket under john kennedy  rayburn also built up one of his successors  the diminutive carl albert from oklahoma  who  after gaining the speakership  twice found himself first in the line of succession to the presidency during the watergate scandals  on each occasion  albert did all he could to put others in place before him  believing  as he said on becoming speaker  i hope we will get together  and work for the country  and not work for the two political parties such a sentiment  not to mention the idea of stepping away from power for the good of the country  seems so alien to our politics today that it might have come from a different age  in light of such service  talk of toxic brands and a new generation of leaders seems misplaced rayburn  albert and tip oneill  who negotiated a key bill with president ronald reagan to preserve funding for social security  formed the ideal of the modern speakership  they shaped policy  worked with presidents from either party  molded their successors and tried to move the wheel forward  they sought compromise but also tried to bring about what progress had to be made  above all  they respected the institution they led  the most thoroughly democratic part of our national government it was a model that worked very well  or at least it did until newt gingrich wrecked it  as he wrecked so much that he put his hand to  mr  gingrichs rebellion was aimed at cozy  low level corruption and complacency  which certainly existed in the old speaker system  but his brand of self aggrandizing hyperpartisanship proved exactly wrong as a corrective  unable to conquer or to compromise  he ended up fleeing the capitol engulfed in investigations and hounded by allegations about his own personal conduct ms  pelosi represents a restoration of that ideal  and she brings formidable talents and a legendary work ethic  back  to the job  in what was described as an unbelievable marathon to secure obamacare  she personally took on the task of winning over 60 wavering democrats  to win back the speakership this time  she swayed another 60 or so members of her caucus for pelosi  the strategy in every campaign she runs is owning the ground  writes her friend steve israel  a former congressman  which is not just a matter of a campaign field operation  but extends to message as well ms  pelosi doesnt hesitate to associate her own ambitions with the quest for womens equality  you know why i do it  i do it because i want women to see you do not get pushed around  she told cnns dana bash  and some  including representative rosa delauro of connecticut  have attributed ms  pelosis ability to whip a caucus to the mothering skills that come from having five children and eight grandchildren  she has eyes in the back of her head at the same time  she regularly displays what have traditionally  wrongly  been considered male attributes in politics  she keeps her head when all about her are losing theirs and is adept at the deadpan gibe  usually delivered right between the ribs  when president barack obama and his chief of staff rahm emanuel seemed about to abandon the affordable care act in despair  she mocked their proposed alternative as incrementalism and kiddie care  and told them  well never have a better majority in your presidency in numbers than weve got right now  we can make this work  she proceeded to get it done  vote by vote  maneuver after maneuver republicans have already received a full barrage of what ms  pelosi can do  she quietly but directly called mr  trump out on his lying and fearmongering about immigration  labeled the governments closing the trump shutdown and mocked his planned border wall as a beaded curtain and a manhood thing for him the day after mr  trump subjected us to a cabinet meeting that seemed like a lost outtake from charlie chaplins great dictator  ms  pelosi turned the opening of the new congress into a jubilant festival  one that celebrated the youth and diversity of her party  complete with a table full of bibles and a male representative rocking a baby  she took her oath of office surrounded by children  and followed it up by pushing through a series of bills that both parties had previously voted for  challenging republicans to reopen the government and giving a speech that quoted reagan in her second stint as speaker  ms  pelosi goes into the job with a majority that is 21 seats smaller than what she enjoyed previously  and without a democratic white house or a senate majority to aid her  she has limited herself to four years in the job  part of the price of regaining it  and her remarkable energy notwithstanding  she will be nearing her mid 80s when she finishes it  she must navigate a much nastier washington culture that is likely to turn even uglier as congressional investigations into the president begin  and the mueller report is delivered on the other side is ms  pelosis restive new democratic majority  which demands a say in setting the agenda  this is not mr  sams house of representatives  the brightest new democratic star  alexandria ocasio cortez  joined a protest in ms  pelosis office before she even took her seat  when carl albert showed up for his first day at the house  he was given a pile of papers to deliver to an office by an older congressman who mistook him for a page   albert did as he was told   ms  pelosi would never so disrespect a member  and it may well be that both her new majority and her old school skills will serve her well  as ronald brownstein pointed out in the atlantic  changing demographics have left her with far fewer conservative democrats from blue collar or rural districts  democrats who hobbled ms  pelosi and such previous democratic speakers as tom foley and tip oneill  her current majority may squabble over economics  but it is unlikely to fight over social issues like immigration  gay rights or abortion the san francisco democrat and product of the baltimore machine may be just the person to lead this new coalition  asked on her first day back as speaker why she would not compromise on the border wall  ms  pelosi told the press  seemingly off the cuff  a wall  in my view is an immorality  before adding  its the least effective way to protect the border and the most costly there was the old democratic liberalism at its best  idealistic and pragmatic at the same time  the wall is wrong because its wrong  plus it wont work  its worth noting that ms  ocasio cortez cast her first vote in congress to return nancy pelosi to the speakership  mr  sam would be proud .
even in a room dotted with hollywood luminaries  the arrival of lady gaga and bradley cooper at a table at the national board of review awards gala tuesday night caused a special kind of commotion chairs were pushed aside  a group of onlookers formed seemingly out of nowhere  many raising their phones over each other trying to snap a picture  when a server balancing a platter of food approached the fray  a waitress offered her colleague two words  good luck generally speaking  the mood at the gala  held at cipriani 42nd street  was more casual than other awards season events  due in part to the fact that  as is always the case  the nights winners had already been announced   green book won best picture and actor  a star is born took best director and actress   also  the event isnt televised so acceptance speeches  unencumbered by broadcast time limits  were much looser and longer  and at times more rambling  than the golden globes on sunday  walkoff music played only when speeches were actually finished the nights winners took advantage of that freedom to comment on the diversity in the teams behind this years movies constance wu  who starred in crazy rich asians  which won for best ensemble  seemed to channel the 2002 oscar acceptance speech by halle berry when she said  this award isnt just for us but its for all underrepresented people to finally be seen michelle yeoh  another crazy rich asians star  was applauded when she spoke of the film as a landmark  historical moment for our culture  she added  you dont have to treat us special  just give us equal opportunities  thats all we ask there were also cheers in the audience when the orange is the new black star uzo aduba presented best supporting actress to regina king for her turn as the matriarch in the james baldwin adaptation if beale street could talk  aduba pointed out that we rarely see such a multidimensional african american woman on screen  let alone over 40 in a time when we must unite as a single nation  she added  when we must remember there are still the same issues facing us as mr  baldwin wrote about in if beale street could talk over 40 years ago  these stories have to be told as the ceremony was unfolding  president trump was addressing the nation about his long promised border wall  and his presence was heavily felt in the room thomasin harcourt mckenzie  who won for breakthrough performance in leave no trace  said she wanted to acknowledge the goodness in people  through the goodness in people  we can make a start toward a better world  a world that wont come about if we build walls to keep each other out  the comment was met with applause soon after  barry jenkins  winner of best adapted screenplay for if beale street could talk and perhaps inspired by a profanity laden speech robert de niro gave at last years gala  delivered the nights most direct and harshly worded rebuke of the president there is a film here called minding the gap that is being celebrated by bing liu  jenkins said  referring to one of the board of reviews top five documentaries  his family  they immigrated here and the president does not want them here  chlo zhao  who directed the rider  which is a masterpiece  the president does not want her here  there was a film this year called roma made by a man named alfonso cuarn  the people in that film  the president does not want here and then  using a decidedly stronger word than forget and eliciting some of the loudest applause of the night  jenkins said  forget him a big cheer came when the directors betsy west and julie cohen began their acceptance speech for best documentary for rbg with a medical update on the films subject  justice ruth bader ginsburg we are told by her family that justice ginsburgs recovery from recent surgery is going very well  west said lady gaga  walking onstage to accept the award for best actress for a star is born  asked  is judge kavanaugh still in office  she went on to comment on how her own work helped her understand the challenges her character would face as a young woman in the music business  saying  in my career  i have over and over again tried to subvert the influence of powerful men every time they told me to go left  she went on  i would take a sharp  sharp right she also expressed gratitude toward her collaborators  especially bradley cooper  whom she called a modern directorial houdini later  after being presented with the award for best director by steven spielberg  cooper said that the recognition for his directorial debut gave him the courage to disregard fear and to continue to pursue truth with love .

this article is part of the david leonhardt newsletter  you can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday ill confess to being torn about the major television networks decision to air president trumps speech tonight on the border wall  on the one hand  the networks said no to president barack obama when he asked for airtime to give a speech on immigration in 2014  they said it was too political to deserve a free prime time spot  and trumps speech is clearly political  as well  but if they had said no to trump  the decision would have dominated the political conversation for at least a couple of days  the issue would be a fight between trump and the media as much as it would be about the government shutdown or immigration policy  and i think fights between trump and the media tend to benefit trump  they turn attention away from his own presidential incompetence and misbehavior toward journalists  who arent exactly the most popular group of people in the country of course  this whole situation means that trump is effectively rewarded for his scorched earth style of politics  with a prime time address  but dont despair  the speech probably wont matter  as jonathan bernstein of bloomberg opinion explains  we have plenty of evidence on this one  presidential speeches rarely change minds  he writes this morning  voters most likely to tune in to such a speech are the partisans least likely to change their minds  either about the policy or the president i do hope the networks fact check trump as soon as the speech is over  its likely to be filled with his usual array of false claims gerrymanderingin the run up to the midterms  some wild claims made the rounds about the likely impact of gerrymandering  one much quoted analysis predicted that democrats would need to win the popular vote by 11 percentage points to retake the house these claims  which mostly came from the political left  were wrong  democrats won the popular vote by 9 points and also won a 36 seat majority in the house  gerrymandering wasnt as big of a deal as many had feared since the midterms  though  weve seen a mirror image version of those wild pre election claims  the new argument  mostly from the political right  is that the midterms have shown that gerrymandering isnt a problem at all  the gerrymander excuse implodes  a wall street journal editorial declared this argument is also wrong  gerrymandering remains a problem  in many states  politicians have drawn oddly shaped congressional  and state legislature  districts to keep members of their own party in power  the practice is an insult to voters  whichever party is in charge  the editorial board of the the charlotte observer recently wrote  it essentially robs millions of voters of their voice  since the outcome is preordained the problem exists in states where democrats last drew the districts  like illinois and maryland  and its even more severe in republican drawn states  like ohio  north carolina and pennsylvania the simplest way to see gerrymandering is to compare the current house to the previous one  in 2016  republicans won the house popular vote by a mere 1 percentage point  but that translated into a 47 seat advantage  even larger than the current democratic margin  gerrymandering continues to make the votes of some americans count more than others the good news is that some states are starting to draw districts more fairly  thanks either to judicial rulings or voter initiatives  in november  anti gerrymandering ballot measures passed in colorado  michigan and missouri but the ultimate solution should be federal  to create a uniform set of rules and keep both parties from being tempted to gerrymander  which brings us to the news on friday that the supreme court agreed to hear two gerrymandering cases     the justices and democracyunfortunately  the justices may decide to make the gerrymandering problem even worse when anthony kennedy was on the court  the court repeatedly sidestepped a definitive ruling on the issue  as amy howe of scotusblog explains  the four justices appointed by democratic presidents favored such a ruling  but the five republican appointed justices did not  and other than kennedy  who seemed torn  the republican justices were willing to uphold gerrymandering plans now that brett kavanaugh has replaced kennedy  the legal scholar richard hasen predicts that the court is likely to support gerrymandering  by reversing lower court rulings that have found it to be unconstitutional  even worse  hasen writes in the atlantic  the court could eventually hear a case challenging ballot initiatives that restrict gerrymandering  if so  the court would be engaging in an aggressive move to reverse the democratic process this is likely to be a long fight  i continue to think a federal law to restrict gerrymandering is the best long term plan .
washington  president trump raised the possibility on friday of declaring a national emergency to allow him to build a wall along the southwest border without congressional approval  hours after department of homeland security officials requested additional support to erect temporary barriers between the united states and mexico mr  trumps comments followed a contentious meeting with democratic leaders at the white house  it failed to produce a deal to end the two week partial shutdown of the federal government  a funding lapse that began with the presidents insistence that congress allocate  5 6 billion for the wall we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly  mr  trump told reporters in the rose garden when asked about an emergency declaration asked if his claim was intended to scare democrats into making a deal  he replied  i never make threats  president trump took the public stage this week clearly intent on framing the conflict on his own terms  under the national emergencies act of 1976  presidents are allowed to take unilateral action in times of crisis  provided they notify congress  specify the circumstances that necessitated the declaration and document all uses of executive authority that are covered by the emergency officials at the homeland security  justice and defense departments have researched the issue for mr  trump  however  no emergency order has been drafted or approved  one official with knowledge of those plans said the homeland security department submitted an official request for assistance from the pentagon on friday  a defense department official said  but the military has yet to determine what resources are needed and if any additional troops are required for the mission  the official said the moves come as the president finds himself trapped between a central campaign promise to build a wall and rising anxiety among republicans over political damage inflicted by a shutdown that mr  trump has defiantly owned speaker nancy pelosi has ruled out paying for a border wall  even at a much lower funding level  despite suggestions by mr  trump that the government shutdown could last months or even years administration officials have been scrambling to tackle the legal and logistical problems involved with steering previously allocated funding toward any project that can be described as a wall  a fence or a barrier the definition of a wall has grown ever more elastic the white house and homeland security officials have been pushing the pentagon to continue to use military troops at the border  mainly to install  extend and repair a section of concertina wire used to stop immigrants from entering unmanned sections of the southwest border mr  trump tweeted last month that the military will build the remaining sections of the wall  a reference to several hundred miles of fencing along the border the temporary troop deployments are just one of many recommendations that the homeland security secretary  kirstjen nielsen  and her staff have made to the pentagon one possible solution  in the absence of new congressional allocations  is figuring out a way to steer contracts already planned for army corps of engineers projects toward some kind of barriers  but lawyers at the homeland security and justice departments have yet to determine if doing so could withstand court challenges  two senior administration officials said mr  trump spent the holidays at the white house to demonstrate his determination to secure new border funding  yet he has struggled to dramatize his cause  as stories of federal employees and other americans suffering from the effects of the shutdown pile up on thursday  homeland security officials abruptly canceled a scheduled press briefing by kevin k  mcaleenan  the commissioner of united states customs and border protection  when mr  trump decided that he wanted to appear in front of the cameras himself  he did so  in the white house briefing room  with border patrol and other immigration enforcement employees who had been meeting with him in the oval office it was completely off the cuff  art del cueto  a border patrol agent in the room with mr  trump  said shortly after leaving the white house  i dont know who in the room  it may have been him  that was like  we should go out there and do a presser  so we did mr  del cueto and other members of the border patrols labor union have met with mr  trump several times in his presidency  so frequently  they said  that they could not remember the number of times they had been to the oval office separately  on friday  mr  trump in a tweet denied as fake news a new york times article reporting that he was considering nominating former senator jim webb  democrat of virginia  as his next defense secretary  defense secretary jim mattis resigned last month to protest mr  trumps decision to withdraw troops from syria .
president trump  as his twitter feed amply demonstrates  is more of a fox news guy than an hbo guy  its too bad  mornings might be less stressful if the president spent them opining on my brilliant friend rather than on fox   friends but he has lately developed an affinity for one of hbos shows  or at least its advertising in november  announcing sanctions on iran  the president tweeted out a picture of himself on a mock game of thrones promo  with the caption sanctions are coming  a variation on the shows tagline winter is coming  he apparently liked the image so much that he bought the poster  a copy lay in front of him at his cabinet meeting wednesday thursday  on his instagram account  he rolled out the sequel  the wall is coming  with the president giving an ice king stare over a rendering of a spiky barrier it was  superficially  an apt use of imagery  hbos epic does feature a massive border wall  stretching across the border wastes of the fantasy realm of westeros  the slight problem  spoiler alert for anyone who isnt caught up  including  apparently  the entire white house staff  is that at the end of the most recent season that wall spectacularly collapsed  done in by the  blue  fire and fury of a zombie dragon but theres a bigger dissonance than that  mr  trump is a fan of tough guy imagery  and he  or whoever makes his memes  probably just liked the idea of depicting himself as the patriarch of house trump  first of his name  protector of the realm  going medieval on national security however  he might not like what game of thrones actually has to say about leadership in general  and walls in particular certainly mr  trump could find role models on the show  it involves the rise to dominance of a cunning  wealthy family that doles out power positions to relatives and has a penchant for gold   although there is some question as to whether mr  trump  like the lannisters  pays his debts  and yes  looming over the whole thing  there is  or was  a great  big  beautiful wall  but it was never intended to keep out people in the story  based on a book series by george r r  martin  the ice wall was built thousands of years ago  with magical assistance  to keep out the white walkers  the others in the novels   a race of frigid beings dedicated to snuffing out all life   ill let you google the details   plan ahead for the season to come with our culture calendar  but as the walkers lay dormant for centuries  people in westeros started to forget  this nightmare enemy of all mankind  they decided  was a fairy tale  instead  they came to believe  the wall was there to protect the seven kingdoms of westeros from the wildlings  their term for the poor suckers who happened to live on the desolate northern side of the wall when it went up over generations  the nights watch  the force created to patrol the wall  changed its self image too  thinking of itself as a kind of border patrol  an icebound i c e   there to defend westeros from what it saw as savages who wanted to pour over the border and steal the riches of honest  hardworking westerosi if youve watched game of thrones  you know where it goes from there  the walkers rise again  and the nights watch leader jon snow  kit harington  wants to make common cause with the wildlings  they were born on the wrong side of the wall  he says  that doesnt make them monsters his comrades  declaring this fake news  stab him to death   only temporarily   but by the most recent season  with the zombie army encroaching  a resurrected jon has convinced the squabbling armies of westeros to pause their war for the iron throne  sort of  to fight the undead in game of thrones  in other words  nationalism and tribalism are not essential forces for preserving society but an existential threat to survival  the wall is a mighty symbol of protection but ultimately an ineffective one  the only salvation  if there is one  is people deciding they have more to gain by working together  and the worst leaders  if sometimes the most successful  are those like cersei lannister  lena headey   who see disaster as an opportunity to decimate and divide rivals the president is a creation of tv and a voracious consumer of it  but his tastes are limited and specific  he likes cable news in general  and news about himself best of all  he became a star in reality tv  which relies on condensing human experience into catchphrases and simple  broad symbols  and he applied its lessons on the campaign trail by rendering the idea of security as a great big wall he has never  however  seemed to be much of a follower of scripted tv dramas  which at their best draw out lifes complexities so to him  or the social media staff in charge of realizing his worldview  winter is coming  the motto of house stark  is a macho threat   better look out  sucker  im bringing some winter down on you  as any fan of the series knows  its not  its a warning  a caution  a reminder that if we fall into pettiness and division  the storm will come for us all  all the same .
president trump seems to think that his hard line immigration stance is a political winner  saying hes willing to keep much of the government shut down in order to get funding for his border wall  polls suggest voters dont see this mr  trumps way  and blame him  not the democrats  for the impasse  with democrats taking control of the house of representatives on thursday  he now has the excuse he needs to make a deal but if he doesnt compromise  if he instead continues to try to transform his once proudly pro growth party into the anti immigration party  he will threaten republican prospects for a generation  novembers midterm elections provided a clear indication that mr  trumps strident positions on immigration were not widely popular  ignoring the pleas of top republicans  the president made the elections a referendum on the issue  vowing to end birthright citizenship  sending the military to deal with a caravan of asylum seekers and championing fringe legislation to cut legal immigration in half  house republicans paid dearly for mr  trumps gambit  they lost 40 seats  mostly in suburban districts  many of which were longtime republican bastions whose younger  moderate  college educated and female voters turned out for democrats  in increasingly asian american orange county  calif   which voted for hillary clinton in 2016  the first time it had gone democratic since franklin roosevelt was president  republicans lost four house seats  they also lost suburban races in traditionally republican areas outside of dallas  des moines  houston  miami  philadelphia  richmond  va   and even salt lake city  those results suggest mr  trump may be doing to the national republican party what pete wilson did to the party in california in the 1990s  hard as it is to believe today  california once reliably voted republican in presidential elections  other than lyndon johnson  no democratic presidential candidate won the golden state in the four decades between harry truman and bill clinton  now  democrats control the entire state government and hold 46 of its 53 house seats and both senate seats what happened  mr  wilson  then governor  went after immigrants  championing proposition 187  a 1994 ballot initiative that barred illegal immigrant children from attending public schools and using other social services  though the measure passed after a contentious fight  it was a hollow victory  an injunction was granted three days after passage  and the measure was ultimately deemed unconstitutional  several studies have found that republican support of proposition 187 and other anti immigrant efforts alienated white and latino voters in california from the republican party  one of these studies  published in the american journal of political science  points out that proposition 187 actually reversed the trend of latinos increasingly supporting republicans  with no counterbalancing gain in party supporters from other groups  particularly non hispanic whites  the authors conclude that the results raise serious questions about the long term efficacy of racially divisive strategies for electoral gain  this study should be required reading for trump republicans  the hispanic portion of the united states population today is similar to the portion in california in the early 1990s  about 20 percent of the country is hispanic  in 1990  26 percent of californias population was  you dont have to be a political wizard to understand that alienating growing blocs of voters  not just latinos  but also other immigrants and younger people  is bad political strategy if national republicans want to avoid the fate of their 1990s california brethren  they must reject mr  trumps approach and make a republican case for immigration  prominent republicans who have criticized mr  trumps divisiveness  such as utahs incoming senator  mitt romney  should pick up this mantle my organization  the becoming american initiative  seeks to persuade conservatives that expanding immigration will benefit the country  members of our board  including william kristol  linda chavez and mona charen  have worked in the administrations of ronald reagan and george w  bush  they have seen firsthand how those presidents support for more open immigration systems was not just good for america  but also helped neutralize immigration as a political issue mr  reagan and mr  bush both called for more work visas  a policy that would allow foreigners to pursue the american dream while contributing to the economy  similar  immigration proposals  which would help ensure that mr  reagans shining city on a hill isnt surrounded by a wall  would appeal to the more than one quarter of the population who are either first  or second generation immigrants republicans should make common cause with immigrants on shared values like work ethic  family and faith rather than writing them off  judging by mr  trumps shutdown rhetoric  theyve got their work cut out for them  .
washington  the pentagon is poised to send at least 2 000 more active duty troops to the southwestern border  defense department officials said tuesday  deployments that have already cost the military hundreds of millions of dollars and thrust the department into the center of the debate over border security and president trumps proposed wall the acting defense secretary  patrick shanahan  told reporters that the united states would be sending several thousand additional troops to provide more support for the department of homeland securitys border patrol efforts  defense department officials later said that they expect that number to be around 2 000 that would come on top of the 2 400 troops who are there now  bringing the deployed number at the border close to the high of 5 900 that it reached in the weeks surrounding the midterm elections in november the deployment of several thousand military troops to secure the southwestern border will total more than  600 million by the end of the fiscal year in september  pentagon officials also told the house armed services committee on tuesday the deployment of active duty troops through the end of january is estimated to cost  132 million  said vice adm  michael gilday  the director of operations for the joint staff  the cost of the national guards operations at the border through the fiscal year  he estimated  will cost  550 million since mr  trump declared what he called a national security crisis at the border that warranted the deployment of active duty troops  the defense department has sought to limit their role  but the administration has kept them in the mix  the additional troops will be used to install concertina wire and provide more surveillance of the border area  mr  shanahan said mr  shanahan replaced jim mattis  who resigned in december as defense secretary  in a rebuke of much of mr  trumps national security policy at one point last year  mr  trump described a wall of people to stop caravans of central american refugees and called for up to 15 000 troops to defend the border  the pentagon reluctantly sent 5 900  then cut that number quickly back to 2 400  the president also spoke of telling the military to respond to migrants throwing rocks as if they were rifles but the deployments can go only so far  the posse comitatus act  dating to reconstruction  bars american forces from engaging in law enforcement activities within the borders of the united states democrats say the deployments  especially the ones just before the midterms  were flagrantly political i am extremely concerned that we preserve the reality and perception that the u s  military is apolitical  said representative elissa slotkin  democrat of michigan  it is hard to feel it wasnt political given how close it was to the midterms representative bennie thompson  democrat of mississippi and the chairman of the committee on homeland security  upon being told that kirstjen nielsen  the secretary of homeland security  declined his invitation to testify on the issue of border security  cried foul your attempt to use the presidents recent shutdown as an excuse not to testify before congress prior to the impending shutdown is outrageous  mr  thompson wrote to ms  nielsen in a letter on tuesday appearing before the house committee for the first time since democrats took control this month  admiral gilday and john rood  the under secretary of defense for policy  defended the deployments and said the militarys presence have yielded very successful results we believe that our militarys presence and support has served to increase the effectiveness of operations at the border  admiral gilday said  adding that the defense department has a long history of supporting efforts to secure american borders were not trying just to have a photo op down there  he continued as negotiators from the house and the senate begin meeting this week to hash out a plan to secure the southwestern border and fund the government  republicans on the house armed services committee seized on the pentagons cost estimates to press for more border security funding were here at this moment in time because we failed to provide adequate resources to the department of homeland security  said representative paul mitchell  republican of michigan democrats on the committee remained skeptical it is unclear why this is an appropriate use of the militarys time and resources  said representative adam smith of washington  the chairman of the committee  it appears service members are laying concertina wire and performing other tasks that are better suited for civilian law enforcement agencies admiral gilday said active duty troops were deployed before the midterms because thousands of migrants were massing along the border  the trump administration chose to send troops because they could be deployed more quickly than the national guard  he said  the department of homeland security is currently tracking three migrant caravans containing 12 000 people moving toward the border  mr  rood said democrats pressed defense department officials to identify which projects would be affected if mr  trump declares a national emergency and moves funds to build a border wall  mr  rood declined to answer  and added that the department had only done the preliminary preplanning for such an event we are supporting our federal partners on the border  and that mission has been extended until september  said lt  col  jamie davis  a pentagon spokesman  we are currently sourcing the units involved and there will be an increase of a few thousand troops .
every day  the same scene plays out in the mexican border city of ciudad jurez  mixed into the flow of students  commuters and travelers are asylum seeking families  arriving at their final destination  the entrance to the united states port of entry the families drop the required 4 pesos into the turnstile to begin their walk up the international bridge that arches over the rio grande and connects this part of mexico to the united states  yet when they reach the halfway point  demarcated by orange cones  customs and border protection officers are waiting to turn them away from seeking safety in the united states  a right granted to them under american and international law instead  these asylum seeking families are provided with the same explanation  we are full conversations surrounding president trumps focus on spending billions on a border wall have overshadowed border realities  for the past two years  as the number of asylum seeking families and children has increased  the administration has ushered in a range of additional restrictive border policies  united states government officials have told migrants to go to ports of entry rather than crossing the border without authorization  however  simultaneously  they have imposed other policies that reject asylum seekers trying to do just that in july  a family of five arrived  navigating their way through mexico with the help of smugglers  at the eagle pass piedras negras border crossing to apply for asylum  the parents and their children  ages 12  6  and 3  had fled el salvador after receiving targeted threats of violence from barrio 18  a major gang in central america the family approached border officers to assert their right to ask for asylum  they were also seeking help for a son who no longer had medicine for his chronic heart condition  in response  a border officer noted that he was not a doctor  physically pushed the family back across the international line into mexico  and told them to return to piedras negras and the local migrant shelter there in the shelter  the family put their names on an informal waiting list for their chance to seek asylum again  however  their smugglers learned they had not yet entered the united states and began demanding more money  promising to infiltrate the shelter and kill the family if they did not send additional payments  several days later  while the family walked to a convenience store  a white van screeched to a halt and armed men forced the family into the vehicle the family was taken to a house and spent two days in captivity  until mexican state police arrived  however  these officers had not come to save the family but rather to sit down at the table for a leisurely breakfast and to accept money from the kidnappers  when the police did pay attention to the family  it was to call mexican immigration agents to deport them  these agents proposed a deal  to release the family for  1 000  but with no more money  the family was transported to a mexican migration detention center  after languishing for two months  the parents and children were released into mexico city  where the threats continued both from their former kidnappers and barrio 18 gang members searching for the family this familys harrowing story is far from an isolated case  in february 2017  a honduran woman and her three children were kidnapped in the border city of reynosa  tamaulipas  the migrant kidnapping capital of mexico  after trying to seek asylum with border officers on three occasions  and in november 2018  a transgender mexican asylum seeker was robbed and assaulted in tijuana  the next month  a cameroonian asylum seeker was stabbed and two honduran asylum seeking teenagers were murdered routine turnbacks and the expansion of metering systems at ports of entry began in 2016  yet last summer  border officers doubled down on the practice  stationing its agents mid bridge from el paso to brownsville and at border gates from new mexico to san diego with instructions to reject people seeking asylum  today  these turnbacks are occurring daily at major ports of entry along the southwest border asylum seekers who are denied entry to the united states must wait in mexican migrant shelters or on the bridges themselves  vulnerable to a range of rights violations and safety concerns  this follows perilous journeys to escape violence at home to reach the united states and legally request protection the situation could be improved if united states officials allocated sufficient personnel and resources to efficiently process asylum seekers immediately upon their arrival to the border  however  the trump administration has not taken these steps and has instead expanded metering and turnback policies  just last week  the department of homeland security announced it will implement a pilot initiative in california to return arriving asylum seekers to mexico to await their eventual hearings before an immigration judge  such a policy deliberately places thousands of people in situations similar to the young family of five that was kidnapped and extortedas violence and insecurity across central america continues to go unaddressed  families will continue to join our border communities in search of protection for themselves and their children  despite attempts to vilify and demonize them as political pawns  asylum seekers from around the world continue to see the promise of the united states  seeking asylum is a right  one this country must uphold  it is not only the law  it is the moral imperative of this nation  .
on tuesday the designer and filmmaker tom ford was the second highest trending topic on twitter for a reason that had nothing to do with the actual news he was making he was trending because of a quote that had been attributed to him stating melania trump was a glorified escort and that he was refusing to dress her  his office  however  was quick to point out that he had never said any such thing  rather  in a 2016 interview on the view  he said that  at one pre campaign time  he had been approached to dress mrs  trump  but he declined because she wasnt really his image and besides  he believed the first lady should wear american and wear affordable  and his clothes were neither of those things this matters not so much because it is yet another example of the nefarious ways false information spreads over the internet  though it is that  but because on tuesday mr  ford also became chairman of the council of fashion designers of america  the industry lobbying group  watchdog and  occasionally  scapegoat  that makes him the effective face of the industry  and that means that what he says  or what he is said to have said  and what he stands for  will become even more fraught  because he no longer simply speaks for himself  but for american fashion  he succeeds diane von furstenberg  who held the post for 13 years  making her the second longest serving leader in the groups history  her predecessor  stan herman  lasted 16 years   people keep saying to me  why did you agree to do this  mr  ford said on a call from los angeles  where he is based  the answer is  out of a sense of duty  i guess  at a certain point in your life youve learned enough and done enough  you should share what you know  i think that sense of giving back is very american  its certainly much less a european thing  i think i can do a good job and i think i have a vision for it  so why not add it to my list of things to do its an interesting time to add the cfda to a to do list that includes womens wear  mens wear  beauty  accessories and filmmaking  the lack of racial diversity at many fashion brands is still very much an issue  calvin klein  once a tent pole of american style  just announced it was closing its designer led collection line  theres a general sense of an identity crisis at new york fashion week as young designers jump ship for other cities or decide to sit seasons out  and everyone is worried about the future of department stores  once the style conduits to the country  not to mention the fact that fashion still has a somewhat fractious relationship with the current presidential administration diane approached me and then anna approached me and then steven approached me and then diane approached me and then anna approached me and then steven approached me  said mr  ford  referring to ms  von furstenberg  anna wintour  the editor of vogue and artistic director of cond nast  and steven kolb  chief executive of the cfda i was courted for awhile  mr  ford said  the hard sell reflects both the seriousness of the job and the complications of taking it on at this time  they put a heavier onus on what could be a ceremonial position  and mean it will be incumbent on mr  ford to articulate some sort of way forward for the industry and the cfdas 495 members as to what  exactly  that way forward might be  however  he declined to go into detail until his term officially starts in june  after the organizations annual fashion awards  nominations were just released  and the fact that sander lak of sies marjan is in the running for womens wear designer of the year  when last year he won emerging designer  reflects the general confusion   what mr  ford would say was that he felt his international background  his years as creative director of gucci and  later  yves saint laurent from 1990 to 2004  his time based in london with his own brand from 2010 to 2016  would inform his message i think the key to the future of american fashion is to become more international and more global  mr  ford said  having recently returned to america  one of the things that struck me the most in every industry and in american life was how isolated america was and how inward looking  ive always thought of myself as an international designer  designing to a global market  and i think that american fashion needs to think that way  even if youre just starting a business you have to be immediately thinking about whats going to help you be marketable to the world  and not just to america and even more than that  not just to new york  although the cfda is based in manhattan  mr  ford  who has been a member since 2000 and has won seven cfda awards  including the lifetime achievement prize in 2014  has no plans to move  or to be in the city more than the four or five times a year he currently visits  he also has no plans to make himself an example of a designer who recommits to new york fashion week on a long term basis i have a global business and sometimes i may need to show in another country  he said  he has shown in london and los angeles   sometimes i may need to show in asia  i may need to show in europe  i was very honest and upfront about that  but i think the cfda is an american thing and not so much a new york thing  arguably new york is the center of a certain america  and i realize part of the cfda is organizing and  i dont want to say policing  new york fashion week  but it is also encouraging american designers to be successful and part of that is embracing the fact we live in a big world  he said its an interesting statement  and one that verges on the political in a time when the fight over a border wall has been one of the defining discussions of the year  under ms  von furstenberg  the cfda lobbied for greater intellectual property protections for designers  embarked on a model health initiative  raised the volume on the conversation about diversity and inclusion  and brought new american designers to paris for a fashion week showcase  now it is up to mr  ford to choose his issues and decide how to direct his new cast im pretty steel willed  he said .
washington  the fate of president trumps  5 7 billion demand for a border wall is now in the hands of a 17 member bipartisan panel that includes some of the most senior members of congress and  perhaps more tellingly  lacks the most vocal immigration hard liners on capitol hill under the agreement mr  trump reached last week with congressional democrats  a committee of republican and democratic lawmakers from both chambers  known as a conference committee  has until feb  15 to come up with a border security package during the 35 day shutdown  many americans accused mr  trump and congress of acting like toddlers  with mr  trump insisting that he had to have the wall  and democratic leaders insisting that they would not give him a penny for it now  a group less dominated by ideology will be in charge one conference committee member  senator jon tester  democrat of montana  departed from democratic orthodoxy on monday when he told reporters that he would be in favor of including some money for a wall in the border security package  late last year  mr  tester and other democrats on the appropriations committee voted for a spending bill that included  1 6 billion for 65 miles of fencing along the border what i hope can happen is we end up with a set of broad based measures to secure the border  including manpower  wall  technology  mr  tester said  noting that physical barriers already exist along roughly 600 miles of the border  he added  i think to take that off the table entirely  this is my opinion  o k    would be not the best direction to go the conference panels members  appointed by house and senate leaders  are drawn exclusively from the appropriations committees in each chamber  which have a long history of working in a bipartisan way   senator john mccain was fond of saying  there are republicans  there are democrats  and then there are appropriators   the first meeting will be wednesday afternoon with nine democrats and eight republicans  the panel traverses the philosophical spectrum  representative barbara lee  democrat of california  is an ardent liberal critic of mr  trumps immigration policies  as is senator richard j  durbin  democrat of illinois representative tom graves  republican of georgia  has co sponsored legislation to provide  23 4 billion in wall construction money  while representative steven m  palazzo  republican of mississippi  has backed a bill that would allow americans to purchase bonds to help finance a wall  but neither is closely identified with that cause and the panel includes members of both parties  beyond mr  tester  who have been calling for compromise this is much more than just a wall  another republican member  representative chuck fleischmann of tennessee  told fox business network last week  in urging an end to the shutdown  weve got to look at border security where there are areas where a wall wont work  weve got to secure it that way  but yes  i think we can sit down and come up with something  the american people want a reasonable compromise that will work for all mr  durbin helped write the development  relief  and education for alien minors  dream  act in 2001  which would offer a path to citizenship for young immigrants who were brought illegally to the country as children  members of both parties have suggested some version of the dream act could be exchanged for some wall funding conference committees  once an elemental part of congress  occur when the house and senate have to reconcile two bills  but in the recent past  much of the reconciliation has been done by leadership  genuine conference committees have become so rare that many lawmakers have never been on one that worked as intended the border security panel conference includes several democrats from border states  including ms  lee  representative lucille roybal allard of california  representative henry cuellar of texas  and representative pete aguilar of california it will be led by the top democrat and republican appropriators in both chambers  representatives nita m  lowey  democrat of new york  and kay granger  republican of texas  and senators richard c  shelby  republican of alabama  and patrick j  leahy  democrat of vermont together  they have more than 100 years of legislative experience  mr  leahy alone has been in the senate for 43 years  and are senior enough to remember the days of real conference committees  when lawmakers worked across party lines to hash out deals in my judgment  the next three weeks will be one of the most important work periods in recent history  in my job here  said ms  lowey  who was elected to the house in 1988 and is the first woman to lead its appropriations committee  she will be the chairwoman of the conference panel  mr  shelby will be its vice chairman ive been an appropriator for a long time  she added  im always willing to work across the aisle and find compromise what that compromise might look like  and whether it will satisfy mr  trump  is unclear at least one trump ally on capitol hill  senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina  is suggesting that mr  trump go ahead and declare a national emergency to build the wall  without congressional support the republicans on the panel are representatives granger  fleischmann  graves and palazzo  senators shelby  john hoeven of north dakota  shelley moore capito of west virginia and roy blunt of missouri the democrats are representatives lowey  roybal allard  lee  cuellar  aguilar and david price of north carolina  senators durbin  leahy and tester  at wednesdays meeting  each member will be able to give an opening statement weve got to come together  the question is  will we  said mr  shelby  asked if he was optimistic  he said  optimistic  im cautious  guarded  anxious .
unlike donald trump  the former starbucks chief executive howard schultz is a genuinely successful businessman who built a company thats become part of the daily lives of people across america  for this  those of us who are horrified by trumps relentless grifting should be grateful  it gives us something concrete to boycott should schultz decide to launch a narcissistic spoiler campaign for president in an interview with scott pelley on 60 minutes on sunday  schultz decried extremes on both sides and said hes considering a run for president as a centrist independent  he hasnt yet made up his mind  and perhaps the overwhelmingly negative reaction from almost all segments of the democratic party  as well as some nevertrump republicans  will dissuade him  theres a danger  though  that the reality distorting effects of being a billionaire will warp his judgment  convincing him that his business acumen is transferable to the realm of politics  if so  he could end up helping donald trump get re elected shultz appears to share the  conviction  endemic among american elites  that the country hungers for a candidate who is socially liberal but fiscally conservative  after all  if youre rich  you probably know a lot of people like this  im a socially liberal  fiscally conservative centrist who would love to vote for a rational democrat and get trump out of the white house  a chief executive of a major bank  who wanted to remain anonymous  recently told politico  lamenting michael bloombergs poor odds in a democratic primary  listen to the argument podcast every thursday morning  with ross douthat  michelle goldberg and david leonhardt  but this frustrated executives politics arent widely shared by people who havent been to davos  in a 2017 study  the political scientist lee drutman plotted the 2016 electorate along two axes  one dealing with social issues and identity  the other with economics and trade  only 3 8 percent of voters fell into the socially liberal economically conservative quadrant indeed  trumps campaign demonstrated that the truly underserved market in american politics was voters who are socially conservative but economically liberal  the photonegative of what schultz is offering  such voters  the type who might resent both immigrants and wall street  make up 28 9 percent of the electorate  according to drutmans study schultz makes much of the fact that around 40 percent of americans identify as independent  but as anyone who has spent 15 minutes googling should know  independent is not the same thing as centrist  most independents lean toward one party  and as the pew research center has demonstrated  in the past two decades independents have grown more ideologically polarized  not more moderate  america has two independent senators  one of them is bernie sanders even if there were a latent constituency of modern rockefeller republicans longing for the leadership of an enlightened plutocrat  third party presidential campaigns are terrible vehicles for building political power  americas two party system  unfortunate as it is  is an inevitable result of the winner take all nature of our elections  it cannot simply be wished away there are policies that could potentially break the two party stranglehold on our politics  ranked choice voting  which maine used for the 2018 congressional elections  lets voters select candidates in order of preference  one by one  the candidates with the fewest votes are eliminated  their supporters votes are apportioned to those voters next highest choice  until someone emerges with a majority  if schultz were serious about challenging party monopolies he might invest some of his fortune in efforts to pass similar reforms elsewhere absent such changes  his candidacy would threaten to siphon away enough votes to give trump a second term  in 2015 and 2016  bloomberg  a billionaire businessman whose politics are much like schultzs  considered mounting an independent campaign for president  his team looked closely at poll data and focus groups  and found hed be potentially competitive only in blue states  all of the results were very consistent  howard wolfson  bloombergs political adviser  told me  an independent with mikes profile would have merely resulted in trumps election obviously  trump won anyway  but bloombergs research underscores the folly of schultzs trial balloon  on monday  bloomberg  who is contemplating a 2020 run as a democrat  put out a statement that seemed aimed at schultz  though it didnt mention him by name  in 2020  the great likelihood is that an independent would just split the anti trump vote and end up re electing the president  wrote bloomberg  thats a risk i refused to run in 2016 and we cant afford to run it now by flirting with such a risk  schultz is demonstrating a level of megalomaniacal recklessness that is itself disqualifying  i think all american citizens should be worried about the possibility of donald trump being re elected with 40 percent of the vote  said wolfson then again  on 60 minutes  schultz likened democratic proposals for universal health care to trumps border wall  perhaps from his vantage point  re electing this president doesnt seem uniquely catastrophic when set against the danger of european style social democracy  he recently set out on a nationwide tour  so hopefully hell hear from americans who disagree  meanwhile  among the challenges were called upon to meet in this moment of profound democratic crisis  finding another place to get a latte is an easy one .
washington  as president donald trump rails against an influx of migrants at the border  two of his most influential white house power players are at odds over the future of his immigration policy fresh off orchestrating a shake up at the department of homeland security  an ascendant stephen miller is making a renewed push to impose tougher policies at the border  that s setting up a face off with senior adviser and presidential son in law jared kushner  who has been quietly working on his own immigration reform package for months their divergent approaches to the president s signature campaign issue speak to more than the ideological gulf between the two men  they echo a long standing philosophical divide within the west wing over how to best position the president ahead of his re election campaign miller  the mastermind of the president s muslim travel ban and other hard line immigration policies  has long been the combative ideologue  urging trump to take ever more drastic action to stanch the border flow  kushner  whose faith in his own careful dealmaking power rivals miller s zeal  has spent months meeting with lawmakers and interest groups  trying to put together a package of legal immigration and border security changes that republicans can rally around heading into the 2020 presidential election the resulting parallel tracks  one bent on implementing ever stricter policies and another meant to forge a more palatable and unifying legislative package  have created uncertainty and confusion both inside the administration and on capitol hill about where trump is headed the conflict came into focus during a recent white house meeting when trump effectively knighted miller  saying the aide would oversee immigration going forward  but kushner had already been tasked by the president with coming up with a legal immigration plan  which trump was briefed on this week  we ll talk to you about it soon   trump said wednesday of kushner s plan  labeling it  very exciting  very important for the country  despite the aides  differing approaches  administration officials insist there is no ill will between kushner and miller  who have worked together over the years at the white house and on trump s campaign  the two are among the last remaining members of trump s tightknit 2016 team to still work at the white house and have been longtime collaborators  co writing speeches  including the president s convention address but for all that  the two hold fundamentally different views on immigration and notions on how trump ought to govern miller  the unrelenting hard liner  sees illegal and legal immigration as existential threats to national security and the american worker  and views trump as a generational voice willing to make dramatic changes  kushner  a former democratic leaning real estate developer  sees a broken immigration system as another intractable washington problem that could be solved with the right deal that leaves them working at cross purposes at times after trump threatened to shut down the southern border two weeks ago  kushner was among those whom homeland security officials worked with to get the president to back off  indeed  kushner is seen within the department as someone who accepts the realities of legal limitations and can be trusted to calm trump down  not spin him up  as they feel miller tends to do on immigration  according to three administration officials with knowledge of the dynamic  they spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss internal deliberations senior administration officials have tried to paint miller and kushner s efforts as complementary  miller addressing the day to day crisis at the border while kushner looking at longer term solutions  president trump alone sets immigration policy that s designed to solve the humanitarian crisis at our border  prevent illegal entry into our country and protect the american people   there s no daylight between the president s team as they work to implement that agenda   spokesman hogan gidley said in a statement trump on wednesday also challenged the notion that anyone was running his immigration policy other than him asked by reporters whether he had considered tapping miller to lead homeland security  trump said   stephen is an excellent guy  he s wonderful person   but  he added   frankly  there s only one person that s running it  you know who that is  it s me  but former officials said the absence of clear lines of authority and the recent purge of senior leadership at homeland security could create confusion  leaving the agency to implement whichever viewpoint wins the day  to whom are we listening  who s setting the priorities   said david lapan  the department s former press secretary thad bingel a former senior homeland security official  who helped shepherd outgoing homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen through her confirmation process  echoed those concerns  saying that when it s not clear who s in charge at the white house  departments and subagencies  spin their wheels a lot trying to satisfy multiple masters  raising the stakes further is that kushner is no mere white house aide  he s the president s son in law and has proven capable of forcing staff turnover at the highest level  he was instrumental in the departure of two chiefs of staff and the president s former chief strategist kushner s latest efforts on immigration date to early january  when trump asked him to pursue a deal with lawmakers that would win the president more money for his border wall during the government shutdown while white house officials caution that the plan has yet to be finalized  aides said it would include  merit based  changes to the legal immigration system as well as proposals on border security that could include modernizing ports of entry and changing the way the country detains and removes people who enter the country illegally as part of that effort  kushner has convened a series of informal listening sessions with almost 50 groups  including anti immigration advocates  business and conservative groups coming together to talk through ideas  it was the same playbook he used last year on criminal justice reform  which culminated in the only major piece of bipartisan legislation the president has signed during those meetings  kushner was been careful not to tip his hat on his personal views  but participants say they expect the plan to include significant changes  including increases in employment based green cards  while protections for the hundreds of thousands of so called dreamers brought to the country illegally as children were a major point of discussion  a senior administration official said dreamers are not currently part of the plan jessica vaughn  director of policy studies at the center for immigration studies  which advocates for lower immigration levels  cautioned that unveiling a major plan now would be a distraction from the immediate border crisis  the timing couldn t be worse   she said   it s just the wrong time to be getting into a battle over this when the priority should be on fixing the border crisis and getting our enforcement on track     associated press writer colleen long contributed to this report    .
president trump came away empty handed for now after the longest federal government shutdown in american history failed to pressure congress into funding his long promised border wall  purportedly to stop an inflow of drugs and crime from mexico but he is not done making his case on immigration on sunday he rattled off several figures on twitter about how many undocumented immigrants there are in the united states  how much they cost the country financially and how many had illegally voted in texas there were already many problems with mr  trumps assertion that undocumented immigrants disproportionately bring with them more drugs and crime  and several experts said they had concerns with the figures he disseminated on sunday the white house did not respond to a request for comment in one tweet on sunday  mr  trump said that 58 000 non citizens voted in texas  with 95 000 non citizens registered to vote  he was citing an investigation that texas officials had publicized days earlier but that democrats in the state immediately questioned the investigation  by the texas secretary of states office  said that 95 000 people who were registered to vote in the state had at some point told a law enforcement agency that they were not citizens  out of that number  58 000 had voted at some point since 1996 politicians and voters advocates are asking officials to investigate both figures because we have consistently seen texas politicians conjure the specter of voter fraud as pretext to suppress legitimate votes  we are naturally skeptical  representative rafael anchia  a democrat in the state house  told the new york times even if the numbers are deemed accurate  those 58 000 voters could have become citizens before casting ballots  more than 50 000 people were naturalized in texas in 2017  according to the department of homeland security we have a reason to distrust these numbers  said andre segura  the legal director for the a c l u  of texas  theres a long history of these numbers being inaccurate  voter fraud is extremely rare in florida  the administration of the former governor  rick scott  had tried to purge noncitizens from voter rolls in 2012  it started with a list of 180 000 voters based on drivers license data  according to the tampa bay times  ultimately  85 people were removed from the rolls  according to the newspaper in another tweet  mr  trump said that the cost of illegal immigration so far this year is  18 959 495 168  cost friday was  603 331 392 it is not clear where mr  trump arrived at those figures  they track with a tweet from last month in which he declared that the country loses 250 billion dollars a year on illegal immigration but several experts said those figures were far too high there is little research on how much undocumented immigrants cost the united states  the highest costs would generally be related to education and health care  but many undocumented immigrants pay taxes and are typically barred from receiving many of the costliest benefits  like medicaid no study seems to comprehensively address a net cost  instead focusing on either the costs or the benefits they tend to talk past each other  unfortunately  said randy capps  the director of research for american programs at the migration policy institute the national academy of sciences concluded in 2016 that immigration  both legal and illegal  benefited the economy  it said that the average immigrant cost state and local governments about  1 600 a year from 2011 to 2013  but that their children and grandchildren paid far more in taxes than they consumed in public services alex nowrasteh  a senior immigration policy analyst at the cato institute  said the highest figure he had seen came from the federation for american immigration reform  which favors restricting immigration  it has said undocumented immigrants cost the country at least  116 billion per year the cato institute disputes that figure  which mr  nowrasteh said did not take into account the economic benefits of undocumented immigrants  he and others have questioned the groups methodology theres no basis to any of those numbers about the fiscal cost  he said  the presidents numbers are even twice as bad mr  trump also claimed that in the united states there are at least 25 772 342 illegal aliens  not the 11 000 000 that have been reported for years again  several experts said mr  trumps numbers were too high it appears that mr  trump is making his claim based on a study conducted by researchers affiliated with yale university and the massachusetts institute of technology  which estimated the number at 22 million starting with an estimate in 1990  the researchers modeled how the population would change in future years based on immigration rates  demographic change and deportations  among other factors  eventually arriving at the 22 million estimate the conclusions of that study  published in the journal plos one in september  have been challenged  with some questioning whether it underestimated the number of immigrants who had left the country the researchers have also acknowledged that their results diverge from existing estimates  most other studies say the number is around 11 million or 12 million  the pew research center estimated that it was about 10 7 million in 2016  in 2015  the department of homeland security estimated the number to be 12 million theres been no evidence of a new  rapid increase of the population  mr  capps said william frey  a demographer at the brookings institution  said the methodology used by pew had been vetted over decades they have a general sense that what they are doing is reasonably o k   he said of the pew researchers  i trust them  they have been doing this for a long time .

washington  president donald trump had had it the flow of migrants at the southern border was surging  another caravan appeared to be forming  and his government had run out of holding space  forcing the release of tens of thousands of families apprehended at the border during a meeting with senior aides on the last thursday in march  trump demanded drastic action to make good on the threat he d tweeted that morning  shut the southern border  curbing illegal immigration was his signature issue  he railed  why couldn t he deliver homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen urged the president to reconsider  her agency had already diverted hundreds of border agents away from certain crossings to process migrant families elsewhere  creating what would soon become considerable bottlenecks  closing ports completely  she reasoned  would only encourage migrants to cross elsewhere  illegally trump wasn t having it  shut the ports at el paso  texas  at noon tomorrow  he ordered  end of meeting the directive set off a frantic behind the scenes push to get trump to change his mind  and he ultimately relented  but the episode launched a turbulent 12 day stretch that would lead to the eventual resignation of nielsen  the potential dismissal of much of her agency s top leadership and the beginning of a new phase in which immigration hard liners at the white house are determined to wield considerably more influence over homeland security this account is based on interviews with 20 administration officials  congressional aides and people familiar with the events  many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal deliberations    on borrowed timetrump and nielsen s relationship was never especially close  nielsen had been picked for the top homeland security job at the urging of her predecessor  john kelly  who left to become trump s white house chief of staff  trump had always been suspicious of her  in part because she d worked for former president george w  bush  she had been widely expected to leave the department last fall after kelly s departure from the white house  but she appeared to get back on trump s good side during the government shutdown  when she served as one of the top defenders of his push to build a southern border wall but nielsen took the brunt of trump s fury over rising border crossing numbers  and the situation was only getting worse  aides spent months desperately trying to come up with new solutions  and some tried to steer trump away from more drastic measures  including his talk of reinstating the family separation policy that prompted international outrage while nielsen had doubts at times  she had dutifully carried out trump s orders  taking ownership of his most divisive policies  including the family separations  and spending months trying to broker arrangements with central american countries  including mexico  but it also fell to nielsen to explain to trump the legal limits of things he wanted to do  and he didn t like it it didn t help that kelly had been critical of trump in appearances since he left the white house  something trump held against nielsen  or that john bolton  trump s national security adviser  had been pushing for nielsen s ouster since last fall  telling trump he didn t think her leadership or policies were effective    a trip cut shortnielsen had just landed in europe last week for her first time as secretary when she decided to rush back to washington  landing early tuesday morning though aides had succeeded in talking trump down from his border closure threat the week before  he had continued to crank up his rhetoric  warning by tweet that if mexico didn t  immediately stop all illegal immigration coming into the united states through our southern border   he would be  closing  the border  or large sections of it within a week by wednesday  nielsen was at the border  overseeing efforts to keep asylum seekers in mexico and preparing for the president s friday visit to calexico  california but the night before trump s visit  a puzzling notice arrived on capitol hill  trump was withdrawing his nomination of ron vitiello to permanently lead the u s  immigration and customs enforcement agency  it had to be a mistake  staffers reasoned  why would trump be spiking his own nominee  a well respected and longtime border official who appeared to be cruising to confirmation vitiello got a call that night from senior trump aide stephen miller informing him that he wouldn t be joining the president on his trip to the border the next morning  there was no explanation nielsen had received no heads up but word began to spread that his nomination was being yanked  we want to go in a tougher direction  was all trump told reporters as he left the white house on friday morning it was step one of the plot to purge dhs leadership nielsen joined trump at the border  echoing his words at a roundtable with border officers and local law enforcement and standing by trump s side as they toured a section of newly rebuilt border fencing  introducing him to local officials but inside she was fuming    dusting off a letternielsen returned to washington on a coast guard gulfstream as trump continued onto california and nevada to do some fundraising  by that night  murmurs were swirling that vitiello s removal wasn t a one off and that miller was orchestrating a wholesale leadership overhaul of her department already frustrated by what she saw as insufficient help from departments like justice and health and human services  with clear signs that white house hard liners were on the ascent  nielsen pulled up the resignation letter she d written months before  just in case she went into a sunday white house meeting with trump that she d requested not sure if she d be fired  resign or stay to fight another day it was  by all accounts  a cordial conversation in the yellow oval room of the white house residence  with acting chief of staff mick mulvaney in attendance  nielsen had come prepared with a list of ideas to share with the president  but the two quickly agreed the arrangement was no longer working  trump wanted to go in a different direction nielsen resigned on the spot  trump tweeted the news before she could get her letter out    the purgestanding outside her home in alexandria  virginia  on monday  nielsen sounded just as loyal to trump as she had at the border  i will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis   she said  thanking the president  for the tremendous opportunity to serve this country  by the end of the day  the department she had led appeared to be on the cusp of being dismantled  with the head of u s  citizenship and immigration services and the department s general counsel among those expected to be pushed out  it s time to do things a little differently   white house spokesman hogan gidley said on fox news channel   and so the president s looking around to reshape his team so he can have the people in place to carry out his agenda     associated press writer zeke miller

tax preparers  bracing for a tricky filing season  are advising taxpayers to file returns as they usually do  but to be prepared for possible delays if they are due refunds the internal revenue service is scheduled to begin processing 2018 federal tax returns on monday  but is facing two major challenges that threaten to make this tax time chaotic  even with the government reopening  it will take a while for the i r s  to return to normal  the shutdown started as i r s  employees were in the midst of being trained about the sweeping changes that congress made to the tax code in 2017  the head of the union representing the agencys workers said  so i r s  employees may not initially be fully up to speed and able to answer questions and tackle the inevitable snafus nearly three fourths of all returns result in refunds  and the average refund last year was nearly  3 000  the i r s  reports  many families rely on their refunds to make purchases or pay bills the i r s  has said it expects refunds to be issued on schedule  typically  that means nine of 10 refunds are issued within 21 days  if the return was filed electronically and the refund is sent using direct deposit the i r s  expects business as usual with refunds  said lisa greene lewis  a certified public accountant with the popular tax preparation software turbotax cindy hockenberry  director of tax research and government relations at the national association of tax professionals  said it remained to be seen how quickly the i r s  could get operations running  since the end of the impasse came just days before the opening of tax filing season i still think it will take a bit of time to get everything rolling 100 percent at the i r s   she said  adding that if there is another shutdown in three weeks  well be back to square one much of the federal government has been shut down for more than a month as a result of the political stalemate between president trump and democrats in congress over funding for a border wall tony reardon  national president of the national treasury employees union  said on thursday that the i r s  staff and agency funding had already been diminished before the shutdown and that it would probably take time for the agency to get back up to speed when it does reopened while the government is reopening for at least three weeks  its unclear whether all i r s  employees will return to work immediately  mr  reardon said on friday evening  the agency is hopeful of getting normal operations going on monday  he said  since tax filing season is officially starting  but workers  he said  were awaiting specific instructions from their supervisors  the union is urging the government to be flexible and pay workers as quickly as possible  he said  since many are facing financial hardship from missing two paychecks during the shutdown as to the i r s  help line  taxpayers and tax preparers will probably have longer waiting times this year even in a good season  theres a backup  said edward karl  vice president for taxation with the american institute of certified public accountants despite the uncertain environment  mr  karl said  taxpayers who typically file early should do so  as soon as they have the necessary documents  like w 2 income statements the critical thing for taxpayers is to presume its business as usual  he said meanwhile  the i r s  has announced a bit of relief for some taxpayers  if you underpaid your taxes in 2018  youre less likely to pay a penalty this year  the agency said this month that because of tax changes passed by congress in the tax cuts and jobs act  it would waive the penalty for many filers who underpaid the change  just for the 2018 tax year  is aimed at helping taxpayers who were unable to properly adjust their withholding and estimated tax payments because of the array of changes under the tax law  and may have inadvertently underpaid  the i r s  said the federal tax system is pay as you go  so taxes must be paid periodically  rather than all at once  typically  taxpayers pay a penalty if their payments  from paycheck withholding or extra estimated tax payments  total less than 90 percent of the amount owed   other criteria also apply  for instance  if you underpaid but owe less than  1 000  youre not subject to any penalty   for 2018 returns  the i r s  said  the threshold will be lowered to 85 percent here are some questions and answers about this years tax filing season when is the deadline for most taxpayers  the federal filing deadline is april 15  but because of the timing of local holidays on april 15 in maine and massachusetts  and another on april 16 in washington  d c   taxpayers who live in maine or massachusetts have until april 17 to file do i have to wait until monday to file my taxes no  consumers using professional preparers  or do it yourself tax software  can prepare their returns ahead of time  and have them filed electronically when the i r s  starts accepting them on monday  the i r s  encourages electronic filing for faster refunds i completed my return using turbotax but got a notice to redo it  what should i do some turbotax users were notified ahead of the filing season that they should redo their returns because of a software glitch  the potential problem occurred when turbotax  which millions of people use to file their returns  transferred the prior years data into the current years return  in some cases  the notice to users said  a few pieces of information may be inaccurate or left out turbotax advised users to clear their current return and start over  intuit  the programs parent  offered free tax filing for those affected turbotax said the glitch had affected a small number of filers but declined to be specific .
this is jamelle bouies debut column the wall of donald trumps campaign and presidency has always operated both as a discrete proposal  an actual structure to be built under his leadership  and as a symbol with a clear meaning  whether praised by its supporters or condemned by its opponents  the wall is a stand in for the larger promise of broad racial  and religious  exclusion and domination  its no surprise  then  that some americans use build the wall as a racist chant  much like the way they invoke the presidents name  and its also why  despite the pain and distress of the extended government shutdown  democrats are right to resist any deal with the white house that includes funding for its construction thats not to say there arent practical reasons for democrats to resist the proposals on hand  the president calls his most recent bid a major compromise  but its headline provision  protections for immigrants covered by either deferred action for childhood arrivals or temporary protected status  are short term and limited  it also puts a cap on the number of central american migrant children and teenagers who can receive asylum  requiring them to apply in their home countries  while also eliminating automatic court hearings for minors who arrive at the border in order to streamline the deportation process  together with its  5 7 billion for the wall  its less a compromise than a near capitulation to the presidents vision for immigration policy  a vision he could not get through congress when he had republican majorities in both chambers  a border wall also just wont work  erecting a barrier does nothing to solve the political conflicts and economic pressures that drive migration to the united states agreeing to this deal  or any deal beyond a straightforward bill to end the shutdown  would only validate the presidents extortion tactics  adopted after conservatives pressured him at the end of last year to reject a so called clean bipartisan bill to fund the government  to agree to wall funding in these circumstances would guarantee a repeat performance the next time president trump wants to secure a legislative win without the difficult work of negotiating with congress  much less his opposition but the paramount reason for resisting this deal  and any other  is what it would mean symbolically to erect the wall or any portion of it  like trump himself  it would represent a repudiation of the pluralism and inclusivity that characterizes america at its best  it would stand as a lasting reminder of the white racial hostility surging through this moment in american history  a monument to this particular drive to preserve the united states as a white mans country in fact  you can almost think of the wall as a modern day confederate monument  akin to those erected during a similar but far more virulent period of racist aggression in the first decades of the 20th century  built as shrines to white racial dominance as much as memorials for any particular soldier  they were part of a larger  national drive to uphold white supremacy against what one nativist thinker termed a rising tide of color this manifested itself across american society  at the grass roots  there was the reconstituted ku klux klan  inspired by d w  griffiths heroic 1915 depiction of reconstruction era night riders in the birth of a nation  the klan strove to secure the power of the white petite bourgeoisie against perceived threats from capital and labor as well as uphold a stridently anti immigrant  anti catholic  anti semitic and anti black vision of white patriarchal authority  at the elite level  likewise  lawmakers and intellectuals fretted about the impact of an influx of immigrants from southern and eastern europe  as well as china and japan  their answer was something of a legislative wall  the 1924 johnson reed act  which sharply limited european immigration and all but banned it from much of asia   a former influential member of the trump administration praised that law for its severe restrictions on who could enter the united states  the wall of trumps rhetoric and imagination channels all of this  up to and including the nativist tropes that associate nonwhite immigrants with crime and disorder  build a wall   crime will fall  the president said in a wednesday morning tweet it is true that democrats have backed both barriers and harsh border policies in the past  president barack obama repeatedly offered strict immigration enforcement in return for republican buy in to comprehensive reforms  now democratic leaders have committed to new funding for additional border security  and the house majority whip  jim clyburn  has floated the possibility that democrats could be moved on funding for the wall  provided its a smart wall  if  beyond trump  the larger concern is policies that militarize the border and dehumanize migrants  then democrats have had a significant part in creating the status quo but the presidents wall still looms as a racist provocation  a total repudiation of what the historian john higham called americas cosmopolitan faith  a concept of nationality that stresses the diversity of the nations origins  the egalitarian dimension of its self image  and the universality of its founding principles  for trump the wall signals his commitment to upholding existing hierarchies and strengthening their material foundations  for his supporters it validates their fears of cultural conquest  for the targets of their anxiety and aggression  it is a threat early into the government shutdown  speaker nancy pelosi called the wall immoral  she used the right word  the wall is a symbol of exclusion  if even a portion were built  that segment would serve as a modern monument to the worst of our nations heritage  no deal or compromise could justify that moral cost .
 sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race  beto orourke  the former texas congressman who just joined the democratic presidential race  gained an instant following last year when he came within three points of unseating senator ted cruz but while he was able to stand out in his senate campaign with a broadly liberal message and no signature policy issue  that broad message is not likely to be enough in a ballooning democratic field this time  the specifics are going to be crucial  heres a look at where mr  orourke stands on some major issues as president trumps proposed border wall has become one of the biggest issues in american politics  mr  orourke has made immigration the centerpiece of his speeches in addition to supporting the dream act and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants  he has called for the closing of private immigrant detention centers  denounced the militarization of immigration enforcement and spoken out against the wall  beto orourke announces candidacy  joins field filled with committed progressives we are not safe because of walls but in spite of walls  he said at a rally in el paso last month  held at the same time mr  trump was holding his own rally nearby  far from extending a barrier across the entire border  he has said  he would like to remove the existing fencing in el paso  one of the countrys largest border cities  and mr  orourkes hometown in his state of the union address  mr  trump held up el paso as an example of the need for a wall  claiming that the city had been one of the most dangerous in the united states until a border fence was built there but the crime rate in el paso actually fell long before the fence was built and rose afterward  and mr  orourke is holding up the city as an example of the lack of need for a wall mr  orourke arguably first made his name when  after the shooting at the pulse nightclub in orlando in 2016  he live streamed the sit in he and other democratic representatives were holding on the house floor in support of stricter gun laws the republican controlled congress did not pass any gun control legislation then  but mr  orourke continues to support similar policies  including universal background checks  magazine size limits and restrictions on some semiautomatic weapons he also opposes concealed carry reciprocity  which would make concealed carry permits granted in any state valid nationwide  forcing states with strict licensing requirements to recognize permits from states with looser standards  it is one of the national rifle associations legislative priorities while mr  orourke supports universal health care  increasingly a litmus test position for democratic candidates  he hasnt committed to a specific way to get there  during his senate campaign  he suggested that universal health care could take the form of a single payer system or a dual system  in which a government run program would coexist with private insurance he has given conflicting messages on the most prominent proposal  medicare for all in 2017  during his time in the house  he said unequivocally  a single payer medicare for all program is the best way to ensure all americans get the health care they need  but during his senate campaign  he carefully avoided those words  calling instead for universal  guaranteed  high quality health care for all he does support expanding medicaid under the affordable care act and has urged texas to do so  other points in his 2018 platform included allowing the government to negotiate prescription drug prices with manufacturers and creating incentives for insurers to participate in the affordable care acts exchanges when it comes to proposals for mitigating climate change  opponents frequently cite the potential costs of those plans  but mr  orourke has emphasized the financial impact of climate change itself  billions of dollars that are spent on steps like sea walls  which would be critical if climate change continues unchecked  is money not spent on other priorities  he noted at a town hall event with columbia university students last month at that event  mr  orourke spoke positively about the green new deal  calling it technically and logistically doable  as for its political prospects  i dont know  he said  thats up to all of us  right he supports the paris climate accords  and has also made a point of emphasizing effects that climate change is having  more storms like hurricane harvey  for instance  which devastated texas mr  orourke emphasized criminal justice in his 2018 campaign  focusing in particular on racial and economic inequities  in an op ed in the houston chronicle  he described his own criminal record  he was arrested once for attempted forcible entry and once for drunken driving when he was in his 20s  both charges were dismissed  and argued that his success since then had been possible because of his race and economic status the chance that i had  and which i have made the most of  is denied to too many of our fellow texans  particularly those who dont look like me or have access to the same opportunities that i did  he wrote he called for closing private and for profit prisons  decriminalizing marijuana and expunging the records of people previously convicted of possessing it  eliminating mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent crimes  and reforming the bail system so people charged with misdemeanors would not be incarcerated because of their inability to pay he also emphasized rehabilitation for offenders released from prison  including the restoration of voting rights  currently  those rights vary drastically by state like many of the democratic candidates  mr  orourke has criticized mr  trumps trade policies  including the imposition of tariffs  which have hurt some farmers and blue collar workers  in his senate campaign  he emphasized the needs of farmers  calling for a stronger crop insurance program and federal investments in rural infrastructure  including high speed internet  roads and schools he has also drawn connections between agricultural policy and immigration policy  noting that immigrants  many of them undocumented  make up a large share of farm laborers  on that basis  he has cast immigration reform as an economic issue as well as a social one we should treat these individuals with dignity and respect  he wrote on his website last year  because they are a critical component of our agriculture communities .
washington  the senate is poised as early as tuesday to act on a trump backed measure to end the partial government shutdown  but a bill promoted as a compromise to pair the presidents wall with legal protections for some immigrants would also severely restrict migrants ability to claim asylum  drawing fierce opposition from immigrant rights groups senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  is planning on tuesday to put the measure on the senates agenda  setting up a likely vote on thursday  absent any agreement from democrats to act on it sooner  but its prospects in the senate are dim  and with the shutdown now in its fifth week  800 000 federal workers are almost certain to miss their second paycheck on friday the 1 031 page bill  made public on monday evening by the senate appropriations committee  would fund shuttered federal agencies through the end of the fiscal year  it includes  5 7 billion for the border wall that mr  trump has proposed and large increases for detention of and removal of immigrants  as well as three year provisional protections for 700 000 of the young undocumented immigrants known as dreamers  and 300 000 immigrants mostly from latin american countries who have been living in the united states under temporary protected status but while republicans say the protections are drawn from the bridge act  a bipartisan measure  that bill would in fact protect hundreds of thousands more dreamers  who were brought to the united states illegally as children  the republican proposal would shield only those who applied for and received work permits under deferred action for childhood arrivals  or daca  created by president barack obama  which mr  trump rescinded in 2017  senate leaders have reached a deal that can end the government shutdown by the weekend  federal court decisions have kept daca in place  and on tuesday  the supreme court again declined the trump administrations request to review the legality of the program  almost certainly keeping it in place for the rest of the year  that decision by the court significantly devalued mr  trumps overture to democrats resisting wall funding the new senate measure also includes several provisions that are meant to make it more difficult for migrants to claim asylum in the united states  a legal process that allows people fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries to seek refuge  the changes have been top priorities of stephen miller  the conservative white house aide who crafted much of mr  trumps immigration agenda it would bar central american children from seeking asylum in the united states  instead requiring them to apply in their own countries  in what the legislation describes as a program that reduces the incentive for such persons to make the dangerous journey to the united states southern border to request asylum but democrats and immigrants rights advocates denounce the plan as cruel  while the obama administration created a similar program to expedite the claims of central american children seeking asylum  it never moved to block such minors from applying inside the united states these are children who are often desperately fleeing terrible violence back home  said representative diana degette  democrat of colorado  they are literally running for their lives and asking for our country to help  instead of offering them help  this proposal would require border officials to turn a deaf ear to their desperate pleas and send these kids back to the very places they just risked their lives to escape a separate provision would allow immigration authorities to quickly remove central american minors seeking asylum in the united states  a change to an anti child trafficking statute that some scholars said would violate international law in effect  we are looking at the rapid expulsion of these children  said greg chen of the american immigration lawyers association  the effect of the law will be to send people back into harms way  which would be a violation of international law the measure also adds a high bar for asylum claims across the board  mandating that they be deemed in the national interest  it would introduce a host of new grounds for deeming an asylum claim frivolous  including if the migrant seeking protection was also trying to obtain work authorization  had used a fraudulent document  knowingly or unknowingly  or did not file in a timely way republicans are arguing that the bill would do precisely what democrats have been demanding  reopen the federal government immediately  as an added sweetener to democrats  the measure also includes  12 7 billion for disaster relief  and would renew the violence against women act  which authorizes and funds services for victims of domestic violence  and expired at the end of last year but the senate math does not work in mr  mcconnells favor  he would need seven democrats to join with all 53 republicans for the measure to pass  but there are no more than a handful of democrats in republican leaning states  senators kyrsten sinema of arizona  doug jones of alabama and joe manchin iii of west virginia  who might vote in favor a spokesman for mr  manchin said the senator would remain undecided until he saw the text of the measure  ms  sinema and mr  jones have not announced their intentions house democrats are also planning this week to bring up a package of legislation to reopen the government and provide some funding for border related operations  including infrastructure improvements at ports of entry and immigration judges  they are still weighing whether to bring up their own border security proposal as part of a measure to fund the department of homeland security  but given that none of their plans include money for a wall  mr  mcconnell has said he will not bring them up in the senate .
updated jan  25president trump signed a bill on friday night to reopen the federal government for three weeks while negotiations proceed over how to secure the nations southern border  his action was a surprise retreat after a monthlong standoff with democrats over billions of dollars for his proposed border wall  and prominent conservative voices criticized the president  using words like weak  wimp and beta mr  trump said in a tweet that the deal was in no way a concession  even so  the next three weeks are expected to show whether mr  trump can rebound  read more here  the bills signing restores normal operations at a series of federal agencies until feb  15  and enables the 800 000 federal workers who have been furloughed or forced to work without paychecks to get paid  though it was not clear exactly when  the office of management and budget said in a letter to affected agencies and departments friday that management should prepare for an orderly reopening and prioritize workers pay and benefits many feared lingering financial difficulties  especially if  in february  congress and mr  trump still fail to agree on a deal the news of the reopening came after flights were delayed in the northeast  with the federal aviation administration blaming it on a shortage of air traffic controllers as a result of the government shutdown  additionally  federal employees missed another paycheck friday  see how the effects of the government shutdown have piled up  over the next three weeks  a house senate conference committee representing both parties will try to reach a consensus on a border security plan if republicans and democrats cannot reach an agreement by feb  15  mr  trump indicated that he was ready to shut down the government once again  or declare a national emergency  which the white house argues would allow him to build the wall without lawmakers approval   that approach would almost certainly face legal challenges  we could hear more about mr  trumps position in the state of the union address  which was originally scheduled for tuesday and was postponed at the urging of speaker nancy pelosi  it was not immediately clear when the speech might proceed  sign up for the morning briefing newsletter for a look at what you need to know to begin your day  when the shutdown began  just over half of the roughly 800 000 federal workers who were left without pay continued to work  including members of the coast guard and food safety inspectors  the number of people working grew as the trump administration reinterpreted longstanding rules  often to the benefit of the presidents base federal workers who have in the past turned down opportunities to enter the lucrative private sector are now feeling less certain about that decision  some have already left the government or are talking about leaving aviation professionals issued a warning that threats to the safety of the nations air travel system were compounding by the day  the airline industry reported that it was losing revenue  the funding freeze also hindered the f b i s efforts to crack down on child trafficking  violent crime and terrorism furloughed federal employees started part time jobs with delivery and ride hailing apps and have applied for other opportunities  such as yoga instructor positions  to try to make ends meet  some turned to pawn shops many federal workers have filed for unemployment benefits  in washington  local programs have sprouted up to support the citys large  struggling federal work force  nationally  an informal network of businesses mobilized to ease the pain commerce secretary wilbur ross said thursday that federal workers who had not been paid during the shutdown should take out loans to stay afloat  furloughed employees balked some of the employees who had to report to work during the shutdown spoke with the new york times about their experiences  a typical federal worker missed  5 000 in pay from the shutdown  federal courts  which remained open despite the shutdown  were expected to run out of money by the end of the month  some courts delayed civil cases  and court appointed lawyers were not paid at all and the shutdown was also felt by cultural institutions  it caused museums in washington to close and put exhibitions  like the national gallery of arts tintoretto show  at risk  it even endangered a sculpture that was recently launched into orbit the white house acknowledged recently that the shutdown had a far greater toll on the united states economy than previously thought americans remain relatively upbeat about their personal finances  but became increasingly worried about the economy during the shutdown  according to a recent poll conducted for the times by the online research firm surveymonkey low income americans whose leases are subsidized by the government worried about their rent because the department of housing and urban development  which is closed  could not make payments to landlords some of the most vulnerable americans  including the homeless  older people and those one crisis away from the streets  felt the burden most keenly  without payments from the department of housing and urban development  nonprofit groups that support low income renters were also struggling  many other social safety net programs were facing similar crises legions of contractors were put out of work and  unlike federal employees working without pay  they have no expectation of recovering the missed wages .
walls protect  walls divide  both these statements are true  yet perhaps no issue represents the deep political chasm separating this country as a wall  a big  beautiful wall in the words of president trump in this lesson plan  students move past the political rhetoric to analyze the function and symbolism of a border wall  they learn about whats in place already along the united states mexico border  they find out what life in the borderlands is like  they learn more about border security and they consider walls as symbols  then  if you would like to go further  we invite your students to compare president trumps proposed wall to other historic walls  from china to berlin  and we offer a related student opinion question about the shutdown and the wall that students can answer          ask students to respond to the following prompt both of the following statements are true walls protect walls divide which statement do you think is more true  explain why then have students share their answers as a class if you are feeling a little more adventurous  you can have students stand up and respond to this same prompt using a barometer activity  tape two signs  walls protect and walls divide  on opposite ends of the classroom  ask students to stand along a continuum between the two signs based on how strongly they feel about their answer to the prompt  give them a minute to find their spot along the continuum  then have students share what they think and why          for the main part of this lesson  we propose a stations activity  depending on your goals  however  you

arent just tangible objects we can touch  they can also have real psychological power costica bradatan  a professor in the honors college at texas tech university  wrote about the power of walls back in 2011  in advance of the 2012 presidential election  read the following excerpts from his essay  and decide if they feel relevant today he continues then answer these questions 1  costica bradatan asserts that a good deal of the power of walls and fences come from their psychological power  what does he mean  to what extent do you agree 2  he argues that walls are not built for security  but instead for a sense of security  why does he make this distinction  do you agree 3  do you think walls have a different psychological effect from fences  or are they really just the same thing with a different name station 5  a political symbolhours before a partial government shutdown kicked in at midnight on dec  22  president trump released a video reiterating his demand for additional funding for a wall or a slat fence or whatever you want to call it  he said  we need a great barrier  in the video  he claimed  its very dangerous out there  drugs are pouring in  human trafficking  so many different problems  including gangs like m s  13  we dont want them in the united states  the white house previously declared there is a crisis at the border the times editorial board counters mr  trumps claim that border security is a crisis in this editorial  writing writing in national review  a conservative magazine and website  jonah goldberg agrees that the wall is in fact a big symbol  trumps wall is now an entirely symbolic affair  he continues  the symbolism is more important than the reality  indeed  the president has offered to compromise  saying that we dont have to call it a wall and it doesnt even have to really look like one  but that doesnt matter either  because for democrats  any structure that the president could claim victory over would be a defeat answer these questions 1  do you agree that the border wall has become a political symbol for both the presidents supporters and opponents  why 2  as of jan  3  parts of the united states government were closed because the president and congress could not agree on the presidents demand for  5 billion in funding to begin construction of a border wall  do you think the two branches of government will be able to get past this impasse  should either side compromise  and if yes  what should a compromise look like  3  in its editorial  the times editorial board suggests the need for sensible border security investments and immigration reform  in his essay  mr  goldberg writes that the symbolism of the wall fight has made immigration policy itself something of an afterthought  first  do you agree with either or both of these positions  second  do you think the president and congress will be able to move past the shutdown standoff to address larger issues related to immigration  why or why not 4  walls also can have great symbolic power  the department of homeland security unveiled eight wall prototypes in october 2017  which president trump visited six months later  none of these prototypes have been selected  and no wall has been built  but these eight prototypes have symbolic power choose one of these eight prototypes and explain what you think it symbolizes from two points of view  first  for the president and his supporters  and second  for the presidents political opponents now  look at some proposals that werent selected  including a 2 000 mile pink wall  a shopping mall and

as donald trump was fighting with congress over the shutdown and funding for a border wall  his administration implemented a new rule that could be a game changer for health care  starting this month  hospitals must publicly reveal the contents of their master price lists  called chargemasters  online  these are the prices that most patients never notice because their insurers negotiate them down or they appear buried as line items on hospital bills  what has long been shrouded in darkness is now being thrown into the light for the moment  these lists wont seem very useful to the average patient  and they have been criticized for that reason  they are often hundreds of pages long  filled with medical codes and abbreviations  each document is an overwhelming compendium listing a rack rate for every little item a hospital dispenses and every service it performs  a blood test for anemia  the price of lying in the operating suite and recovery room  billed in 15 minute intervals   the scalpel  the drill bit  the bag of iv salt water  the tylenol pill  no item is too small to be bar coded and charged but dont dismiss the lists as useless  think of them as raw material to be mined for billing transparency and patient rights  for years  these prices have been a tightly guarded industrial secret  when advocates have tried to wrest them free  hospitals have argued that they are proprietary information  and  hospitals claim  these rates are irrelevant  since  after insurers whittle them down  no one actually pays them of course  the argument is false  and our wallets know it first of all  hospitals routinely go after patients without insurance or whose insurer is not in their network  when wanda wickizer had a brain hemorrhage in 2013  a virginia hospital billed her  286 000 after a 20 percent uninsured discount on a hospital bill of  357 000  the list price  according to chargemaster charges  medicare would have paid less than  100 000 for her treatment second  those list prices form the starting point for negotiations  allowing hospitals and insurers to take credit for beneficence  when there is none i recently received an insurance statement for blood tests that were priced at  788 04  my insurer negotiated a discount of  725 35  for an agreed upon price of  62 69 to help save you money  my insurers price was around 8 percent of the charge  since my 10 percent co payment amounted to  6 27  my insurer happily informed me  you saved 99 percent not if a supposedly  1 000 tv is on sale for  80  its not really a discount  its an absurd list price just as airlines have been shown to exaggerate flight times so they can boast about on time arrivals  hospitals set prices crazy high so they can tout their generous discounts  while insurers tout their negotiating prowess  another rationale for those prices is just plain greed  dr  warren browner  the chief executive of california pacific medicine  describes this as the saudi sheikh problem  you dont really want to change your charges if you have a saudi sheikh come in with a suitcase full of cash whos going to pay full charges  he said but in an era when american patients are expected to be good consumers and are paying more of their bills in the form of co pays and deductibles  they have a right to the information on list prices  they have a right to make sure they are reasonable although making chargemaster pricing public will not  by itself  reform our high priced medical system  it is an important first step  maybe  just maybe  a hospital will think twice before charging a  6 000 operating room fee for a routine colonoscopy if its competitor down the street is listing its price at  1 000  making this information public should bring list prices more in line with what is actually paid by an insurer  a far better measure of value and while the lists are far from user friendly  researchers and entrepreneurs can now create apps to make it easier for patients to match procedures to their codes and crunch the numbers  with access to list prices on your phone  you could reject the  300 sling in the emergency room and instead order one for one tenth of the price on amazon  you could see in advance the  399 rate your hospital charges for each allergen it applies in a skin test and avoid the  48 000 allergy test  with an  8 000 deductible  as a next step  regulators should insist that these prices be easily accessible on hospitals home pages  perhaps in the place of pay your bill now  and translated into plain english  seema verma  the head of the centers for medicare and medicaid services  has suggested that she may well do so patients can help  too  check out your hospitals price list  if its not detailed or complete enough  demand more  for discrete items  like an m r i  of the brain or a vitamin d blood test  take the trouble to scan the chargemaster for the item  reject an overpriced procedure  even if your insurer is paying the bulk of the bill  and take your business elsewhere justice louis brandeis famously said  sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants  electric light the most efficient policeman  but  in this case  the reform will work only if people take the trouble to look  and to act  now that the lights are turned on .
the president proposes and congress disposes so goes the standard description of the constitutional process by which our republic is governed  judging from the news headlines  you might think this process has not been friendly lately to the scientific community  again and again  the trump administration has proposed drastic cuts to the research budgets of the department of energy  the national science foundation  nasa and other agencies quietly  however  congress often has gone the other way and handed out increases  in february  the congress passed  and president trump finally signed  a spending bill for 2019  averting another government shutdown  lost amid the collective sigh of relief and the hoopla about president trumps wall was the news that astronomers had won a key victory  a pair of cosmically ambitious telescopes were rescued from possible oblivion one of them  the james webb space telescope  nasas long promised successor to the hubble space telescope  was designed to peer deeper into space and time than any optical eyes before it  to study the earliest stars and galaxies of the cosmos  but as of last year  it was deep in the red in the 1990s  the webb telescope was expected to cost about  800 million  but the price kept growing  threatening to suck money from nasas other science programs  in 2011  congress put a hard cap of  8 billion on its cost  then an accident in 2018 at northrop grumman  the telescopes main contractor  added another billion to the projected cost  putting the telescope or other nasa missions in danger of being trimmed or canceled the other telescope  the wide field infrared survey telescope  or wfirst  was designed to search for exoplanets  investigate the mysterious dark energy apparently speeding up the expansion of the cosmos and  perhaps  elucidate the fate of the universe  but wfirst has always lived in the webb telescopes political and budgetary shadow each time webb was delayed or over budget  the dark energy mission was pushed further into the uncertain future  many astronomers feared that the webbs most recent cost overrun would come at the expense of wfirst  indeed  last year in its 2019 budget proposal  the trump administration recommended that wfirst be canceled outright but in the new spending bill  congress raised the cap on webb by  800 million  making the project whole again  for now  and congress endorsed the wfirst mission  with a cap of  3 2 billion on its cost  that will make things tight  since the estimated cost of the telescope recently rose to  3 6 billion  but it beats cancellation the bipartisan support in congress has kept the mission alive  said david spergel  an astrophysicist at princeton and the flatiron institute in manhattan  and co chairman of the wfirst science team  said in an email a similar theme runs through the last couple of years  over the past two budget cycles  congress has indeed rejected the trump administrations proposed topline budget cuts to federal agencies that fund science  said mitch ambrose of the american institute of physics  which tracks federal spending on research consider the final 2019 budget  mr  trump proposed a 5 percent cut in nasas space science  but congress made it an 11 percent increase  to  6 9 billion  the president wanted to cut the national science foundation budget by 4 percent  but congress raised it by the same amount  to  8 1 billion the geological survey saw an even more sizable transformation  the administration proposed cutting its budget by  250 million  or about 21 percent  that would have slashed support for climate science centers  which study the regional effects of climate change  and for research on carbon sequestration  congress rejected those cuts  allotting the climate centers  25 million  only a shade less than in recent years  the geological survey as a whole received a one percent raise  to  1 2 billion even the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  with its politically sensitive mission to study climate and weather  received a 3 percent increase  worth  16 million  to its  566 million budget for science for 2019  the trump administration had proposed a 41 percent cut  a potentially devastating blow to the agency  by comparison  the presidents border wall would cost about  5 7 billion though this administration has regrettably chosen to ignore the findings of its own scientists in regards to climate change  we as lawmakers have a responsibility to protect the publics interest  representative eddie bernice johnson  a democrat from texas  said in a recent meeting of the house science committee  which she now heads lamar alexander  the republican chairman of the senates appropriations subcommittee on energy and water development and related agencies  expressed the same sentiment last spring in a statement to his committee over the last three years  congress has developed quite a consensus on science and research  he said  noting in particular its agreement on medical research and supercomputing  i would tell president trump and the office of management and budget that science  research and innovation is what made america first  and i recommend that he add science research and innovation to his america first agenda not all is rosy in the realms of science policy  since 1997  the centers for disease control and prevention has been discouraged from studying guns and violence by the so called dickey amendment  which prohibits the c d c  from promoting gun control  last year congress affirmed that the c d c  could study the causes of gun violence  but provided no money for such research in an email  julie eschelbach  spokeswoman for the agency said  although c d c  does not receive direct funding for firearm related research  c d c  has and continues to support data collection activities and analyses to document the public health burden of firearm injuries in the u s and 86 percent of americans  a majority of both democrats and republicans  favor spending more money on science  according to a recent poll by hart research and echelon insights once upon a time  in einsteins day  for example  it might have been considered unseemly for scientists to step outside their laboratories and make their case to the public  today  organizations such as the american astronomical society and the american association for the advancement of science have programs that teach young scientists how to do just that that work is unlikely ever to be finished  mr  trump on monday began unveiling his 2020 budget  and the cycle of cuts  cancellation and rescue may repeat itself again  indeed  his new budget proposes to cancel wfirst as well as a pair of missions devoted to studying earths climate  atmosphere and oceans scientists are going to have to work hard to make new friends in congress  wrote matt mountain  former director of the space telescope science institute  which runs the hubble and will run the webb telescope  and president of the association of universities for research in astronomy  in an email more practice in the art of the possible  dr  mountain said  more stuff they never taught us at graduate school .
 the 116th congress  with the house in democratic control  has come to order  the house approved legislation to reopen the government  representative nancy pelosi  democrat of california  was elected speaker  the house has begun changing its rules to reflect the democrats new priorities the house  with its new democratic majority  passed two bills on thursday night to reopen the government  one major spending bill to fund most shuttered departments and agencies through sept  30 and a stop gap measure to restart the department of homeland security for a few weeks  without funding for a border wall the measures are likely to go nowhere for now  but they will raise pressure on republicans to come to the negotiating table  senators cory gardner of colorado and susan collins of maine  two of the most endangered republicans up for re election in 2020  said they want a vote but the white house formally notified congress of the presidents intent to veto the legislation  and senator mitch mcconnell  the majority leader  has said he will not put them to a vote without mr  trumps support the bills both have bipartisan stamps on them  the measure that would fund most of the government was assembled from six spending bills that passed the senate appropriations committee with broad support  it passed easily  241 190  with seven republicans voting yes  the stopgap measure  which passed 239 192 with a handful of republicans crossing party lines  is similar to one that passed the senate in december without dissent  emily cochranethe house on thursday night approved the first part of a package of rules changes designed to improve order in the house chamber  ease introduction of bipartisan legislation and recognize the growing diversity among lawmakers  the other two parts are expected to be considered friday and next week the measure faced some opposition from the houses most liberal members  particularly representatives ro khanna of california and alexandria ocasio cortez of new york  who objected to the inclusion of so called pay as you go provision  which requires all new spending to be offset by equal cuts or tax increases  representative tim ryan  democrat of ohio and a prominent critic of ms  pelosi  argued that republicans had not abided by such strictures of fiscal discipline  so democrats shouldnt impose a straitjacket on their ambitions  in the end  mr  ryan voted yes i just dont think this is the time for us to tie our hands behind our back  mr  ryan said in an interview on wednesday  its a big issue for me after watching the republicans erode a lot of these essential investments that we need to make but the inclusion of other provisions  including a rule that would force house lawmakers to be financially liable for discrimination settlements as well as sexual harassment settlements  made it difficult to vote no  the rules changes will also make it easier to raise the governments statutory borrowing limit by making a boost to the debt ceiling automatic with the passage of an annual budget the package includes of priorities for democratic lawmakers and members of the bipartisan problem solvers caucus that helped ms  pelosi secure the votes for speaker it gives lawmakers 72 hours to read any bill before a vote  and it creates a select committee on climate change  a priority for several newly elected representatives  the package also

profile of ms  pelosi  i do not think that that is conclusive  she said  no  i do not  i think that that is an open discussion  i think that is an open discussion in terms of the law for good measure  she warned her left flank that the house would not move quickly to impeach mr  trump  but she did not take impeachment off the table we have to wait and see what happens with the mueller report  she said  we shouldnt be impeaching for a political reason  and we shouldnt avoid impeachment for a political reason  so well just have to see how it comes  maggie habermanmr  trump claimed on thursday that the government shutdown  now in its 13th day with 800 000 federal workers furloughed or working without pay  was only because of the 2020 presidential election the house will vote this evening on two bills to reopen the government  one to fund the department of homeland security into february  but without funding for a border wall  which mr  trump demands  and another to fund the rest of the

food and making rent  trash and human feces  seriously   are piling up in national parks  even the secret service is feeling stressed and yet  19 days into whats become the countrys second longest government shutdown  theres no compromise in sight  and no additional negotiations scheduled the problem  of course  is politics  the shutdown hinges on a border wall battle thats become about so much more than a wall  in many ways  president trumps fight for his big  beautiful wall is a metaphor for the current politics of washington you have a broadly unpopular republican president  already operating under a cloud of investigations  obsessed with keeping his promises to his supporters ahead of whats expected to be a tough re election race  and you have a democratic opposition equally driven by their voters to oppose him at every turn those politics are the undercurrent for all the talks about the shutdown  and theyre fundamentally at odds with each other  and each sides sees political benefit to holding out and resisting any sort of compromise heres what democrats see  midterm wins  democrats won control of the house despite efforts by the president to turn the final weeks of the campaign into a referendum on undocumented immigrants  mr  trump couldnt get his wall funded when he controlled both houses of congress  why should they give now  democrats argue  if his own party wouldnt  the base  yes  some democrats have backed border fencing in the past  but mr  trumps hard line policies  which democrats see as racist and xenophobic  have pushed the party to the left  and its harder to cut deals when the debate becomes about morality  the dealmaker has no clothes  storming out a meeting after saying bye bye isnt a good look for any president  democrats believe  but particularly one who ran on his ability to negotiate  the broader impact of the shutdown cuts through the theatrics the president typically uses to get out of tricky situations  jumpy republicans  on wednesday night  eight house republicans broke with the president and voted for a democratic bill that would reopen the treasury department  at least four g o p  senators have expressed some support for reopening the government  the most jittery of all  republicans up for re election in purple states what the white house sees  the other base  mr  trump measures his political success by whether he keeps his supporters happy  thats part of why he rejected a deal on the shutdown negotiated by his own aides and g o p  leaders after conservatives voiced opposition  and his base wants that wall  mueller  mueller  the constant focus on the shutdown provides mr  trump and the white house with a break from the story line that really makes them nervous  the special counsel investigation what republicans see   opposition to mr  trump never pays  there are 19 senate republicans up for re election next year in red states  a lesson many took away from the presidents support of primary challengers during 2018 midterms was that republican establishment doesnt win by contradicting mr  trump  a longer timeline  the decisions by the white house to pay out food stamps through february and process tax refunds means republicans have a bit more breathing room  particularly in poorer districts  extending these programs provides essential cash infusions to large parts of their voting base  the elusive deal  senate republicans have grown increasingly aggravated with the lack of clarity from the white house  leaving them unsure about whether mr  trump would even sign a deal they managed to cut with democrats  thats part of why the senate majority leader  mitch mcconnell  has kept his distance from the talks  its always difficult  senator john cornyn told the washington post  when the person youre negotiating with is someone who changes his mind but dont forget this elections are not won or lost on shutdowns in 1995 and 1996  americans blamed the republican congress for shutdowns  the party held onto its majorities in the 1996 election  in 2013  americans once again blamed republicans for the shutdown  in the midterms that followed the next year  the party gained seats in the house and won back the senate have you been personally affected by the shutdown  tell us about it  onpolitics nytimes com  our inbox is always open                     after a day of fruitless negotiations over the wall  president trump traveled to a border town in texas today to make his case  we decided to check in with linda qiu  the timess fact checker  and test the veracity of some of the presidents recent talk about the border lisa  in his prime time address on tuesday  the president said the southern border was at a crisis point  what do you make of that  have things gotten considerably worse down there  linda  mr  trump said the word crisis six times in that nine minute address  but theres not really a good case for a border crisis  illegal border crossings have been declining for about two decades  ill bore you with some numbers now  from the 1980s to mid 2000s  apprehensions at the southwest border were between 1 million and 1 6 million annually  last year  the number was just under 400 000  now  there has been an uptick in monthly crossings in october and november  to about 50 000 apprehensions each month  but compare that to 2000  when the monthly number was between 70 000 and 220 000 its also interesting to me that mr  trump has sort of stopped trying to use data to support his arguments  instead  hes talking more about angel families  people whose loved ones were killed by undocumented immigrants  as he did in the speech on tuesday night and during a round table today   and some of these families really appreciate the president advocating on their behalf   but certainly  its more beneficial for him to highlight these specific tragedies than talk about the body of research that shows that immigration does not lead to more crime  and that immigrants are actually less like to commit crimes than native born americans so at the end of the day  its an emotional appeal  rather than a statistical or empirical argument about any crisis lisa  the appeal to emotions reminds me of the migrant caravan  which the president helped turn into a national story ahead of the midterm elections  what happened to the caravan  did the migrants ever come to the u s  linda  some migrants certainly did try  remember that televised clash in late november  hundreds of migrants attempted to run toward a border crossing in san diego  and customs and border protection closed the border and fired tear gas into the crowd  our colleagues who have been traveling with the caravan also reported in december that about 2 000 have made appointments with immigration officials to petition for asylum  which is perfectly legal  and theyre facing long waiting times  a lot of migrants have also decided to just stay in mexico for the time being  and some have attempted to cross the border illegally now that washington is at an impasse over the presidents border wall  mr  trump has been talking caravans again  this time hes warning of a new caravan forming in honduras  and i imagine this wont be the last time we hear him talking ominously about groups of migrants coming to the southern border for more

thursday of attempting to extort and blackmail him by using racy photos that mr  bezos had texted with his girlfriend  the former television host lauren sanchez  in a candid blog post  mr  bezos pasted emails from the tabloids representatives who threatened to release the images if he did not stop investigating how they had obtained his texts  of course i dont want personal photos published  but i also wont participate in their well known practice of blackmail  political favors  political attacks and corruption  mr  bezos wrote  if youve ever considered going into crippling debt  the government just made it easier to do so  the consumer financial protection bureau said on wednesday that it planned to eliminate obama era rules that protect consumers from taking on bigger loans than they can handle  under the proposal  lenders would be able to grant high interest payday loans  short term loans intended to tide people over until their next paycheck  without making sure consumers can actually pay them off  and those lenders would be allowed to do so repeatedly  contributing to a cycle where borrowers spin into ballooning debt  the agency said its policy would give people more access to credit  but critics say it will help predatory lenders take advantage of people who already cant make ends meet  its not just your imagination  the past five years have been the hottest on

other american officials to continue talks that started in washington in january  if the two sides cant hammer out a resolution before march 2  the trump administration will raise punishing tariffs on chinese goods  hurting businesses and consumers in both countries  and others   for his own part  mr  trump said it was unlikely that he would sit down with president xi jinping of china before the deadline  the monetary repercussions of britains chaotic withdrawal from the european union keep piling up  last year  the country experienced its slowest economic growth in a decade  according to a

with senator rand pauls decision to support a resolution to block president trumps emergency declaration  congress appears ready to deliver a stern rebuke to the president over his border wall and a clear statement that it will defend its ability to control federal spending senator paul  a libertarian minded kentuckian  said he will join fellow republican senators susan collins of maine  lisa murkowski of alaska and thom tillis of north carolina  giving proponents of the resolution of disapproval the 51 votes they need  if democrats remain united in their support on monday  senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  confirmed that the measure has the votes to pass the senate  senate leadership  he said  has been conferring with the senate parliamentarian to see if the house passed resolution could be amended before the vote  its an interesting question  mr  mcconnell said at a news conference in kentucky  its never been done before the measure  outlined in the national emergencies act  is the simplest way for congress to end a presidents national emergency declaration  mr  trump has said he will veto it  and neither chamber is likely to muster the two thirds majority needed to overturn the veto  but the plaintiffs in multiple lawsuits will most likely seize upon a congressional repudiation as support for their argument that  in declaring a national emergency to take money for his wall that was not appropriated by congress  mr  trump is subverting the constitution  which grants congress clear control over federal spending  the remaining question  how stern a rebuke will the senate deliver heres what to watch for as more republican senators prepare to announce how they will vote on the resolution mr  trump is hoping to divert  3 6 billion from military construction projects to his cherished wall at the southwestern border  effectively subverting lawmakers and the budget they set  members of the senate appropriations committee  who pride themselves on bipartisanship  have raised concern that mr  trump is taking funds that were carefully doled out after months of negotiation in the bill that he signed last month to fund the government through sept  30  his declaration marks the first time the national emergency act has been invoked because congress has denied the president funds  senator lamar alexander  republican of tennessee  said the president should use funds already approved by congress  for instance from defense department accounts to support interdiction of illegal drugs it avoids taking money for military construction projects specifically approved by congress such as military barracks and hospitals  mr  alexander said in a speech on the senate floor thursday  and it also avoids months or years of litigation  which could make it unlikely the full 234 miles are ever built others like senator martha mcsally  republican of arizona  have said that they are seeking assurances that key military construction projects will not be affected  in a private lunch with vice president mike pence last week  lawmakers asked for details about what projects would be affected  the defense department has not released that information  senator roy blunt  republican of missouri and another member of the appropriations committee  has also expressed misgivings about mr  trump upsetting the panels handiwork  sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  multiple republican senators have expressed unease about the precedent set by the declaration and the potential that a future democratic president could use a national emergency declaration for liberal purposes  once congress forfeits its exclusive  constitutionally granted power of the purse senators marco rubio of florida  ted cruz of texas  and mike lee of utah have all voiced concern on the constitutional question  though none of them has explicitly promised to overturn the emergency declaration  mr  tillis  in an opinion piece published in the washington post outlining his argument  warned that conservatives needed to consider what some of the current democratic presidential candidates would do with a national emergency  implement parts of the green new deal to address climate change  or limit access to guns to address gun violence  among other possibilities  even mr  mcconnell acknowledged monday that the precedent was a concern and was part of the reason he had previously argued  obviously without success  that the president not take this route supporters of the declaration say that the president is within his rights to use powers that congress gave him through the national emergencies act in the 1970s  using this authority is not and was not my preferred choice  said senator john kennedy  republican of louisiana  speaking sunday on cnns state of the union but senator rand paul  republican of kentucky  in an opinion piece on fox news published late sunday  was clear  in september of 2014  i had these words to say  the president acts like he s a king  he ignores the constitution  he arrogantly says   if congress will not act  then i must  mr  paul wrote  adding  i would literally lose my political soul if i decided to treat president trump different than president obama even mr  mcconnell  the first to endorse mr  trumps declaration  declined earlier this week to weigh in on the legality of the measure were in the process of weighing that  mr  mcconnell said when asked at a news conference on tuesday  i havent reached a total conclusion republican senators facing a difficult re election campaign next year are confronting a dilemma  stick with mr  trumps core voters or side with swing voters who largely oppose the wall and the emergency declaration to fund it  senator cory gardner  republican of colorado  hailing from a state that voted for hillary clinton in 2016 and barack obama in 2008 and 2012  may be the most vulnerable republican up for re election next year  and he has not declared where he stands on the resolution of disapproval nor has ms  mcsally  another targeted republican up for election next year for the seat she was appointed to fill after john mccains death  two other republicans targeted by democrats  ms  collins and mr  tillis  have come down on the side of opposing the emergency declaration a vote supporting the resolution  framed as a defense of congresss constitutional power of the purse or conversely  a vote in support of mr  trumps policies and use of executive power could sway voters  .
julin castro  the former housing secretary and former mayor of san antonio  announced on saturday that he would run for president  one of the most high profile latino democrats ever to seek the partys nomination his first campaign stop will be in puerto rico  where he will speak on monday at the latino victory funds annual summit and meet with residents still struggling to recover from hurricane maria  later in the week  his campaign said  he will go to new hampshire when my grandmother got here almost a hundred years ago  mr  castro said at the plaza guadalupe amphitheater in san antonio  in the neighborhood where he was raised  im sure that she never could have imagined that just two generations later  one of her grandsons would be serving as a member of the united states congress and the other would be standing with you here today to say these words  i am a candidate for president of the united states of america mr  castros announcement had been expected for several weeks  he established an exploratory committee in december  two months after publishing a memoir  an unlikely journey  a familiar path for presidential candidates who want to play up their life stories and qualifications and  perhaps  get ahead of their biggest vulnerabilities  this month he also visited two of the early caucus and primary states  iowa and nevada he joins senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts  representative tulsi gabbard of hawaii  former state senator richard ojeda of west virginia and former representative john delaney of maryland on the list of democrats who have said definitively that they will seek for the partys 2020 nomination  that list is expected to grow considerably in the coming weeks and months in his speech on saturday  mr  castro emphasized education  calling for a national version of the prekindergarten program he established in san antonio when he was mayor  to fund the program there  he increased the citys sales tax  a politically risky proposition  especially in texas  but san antonio voters approved it his message was firmly progressive  he called for a higher minimum wage  denounced police killings of african americans  which he described as state violence  and embraced the black lives matter movement  he also condemned president trumps immigration policy  including the practice of family separation and the proposed border wall  and declared that his first executive order if elected would be to rejoin the paris climate accords  which mr  trump left george rodriguez  a conservative blogger  talk show host and fox news contributor whom texas republican leaders designated as their spokesman on the announcement  said after the speech that the discussion of immigration had stood out to him  mr  castro  he said  did not seem to be able to distinguish between legal and illegal immigration mr  rodriguez also argued that the san antonio pre k program  which was one of mr  castros chief accomplishments as mayor  had duplicated existing programs like head start  how much of an accomplishment that is is rather dubious  he said  read about what mr  castro and the other early entrants will be doing in the early days of the 2020 campaign  mr  castro  44  was raised in san antonio in a politically active family  his mother  rosie castro  was an activist with the mexican american political party la raza unida and frequently took julin and his twin brother  joaquin  now a congressman  to rallies and meetings  joaquin castro will be the chairman of julins campaign at the age of 26  mr  castro became san antonios youngest city council member  and after one unsuccessful campaign for mayor in 2005  he was elected to the citys top job in 2009  in 2012  he delivered the keynote address at the democratic national convention  the same platform that catapulted barack obama  then a little known state senator  to national prominence in 2004  mr  obama  as president  later chose him to lead the department of housing and urban development in a statement on saturday  the republican national committee previewed one of the main arguments it is likely to use against mr  castro  calling him a lightweight without the experience needed to be president mr  castro has brushed off concerns that he is not as experienced or as well known as many of the other likely candidates in my whole life  i dont think ive ever started out as the front runner  he told the new york times last month  i grew up in a neighborhood where nobody growing up there was the front runner at anything  so im not going to concern myself with who people think of as the front runner and who they dont among the democrats frequently mentioned as 2020 contenders  he is one of the youngest  if elected  he would be the third youngest person ever to become president  after theodore roosevelt  42  and john f  kennedy  43  the full field of candidates could include former vice president joseph r  biden jr   senators cory booker of new jersey  kirsten gillibrand of new york  kamala harris of california  amy klobuchar of minnesota and bernie sanders of vermont  and former representative beto orourke of texas  who ran a high profile but unsuccessful campaign against senator ted cruz last year surrounded by his supporters after the speech  mr  castro was asked whether he expected to face a fellow texan  mr  orourke  in the race  there will probably be 15 or 20 people in the race  so its going to be crowded  he said .
washington  the state of the union address is usually the presidents moment to make his case with soaring words  but newly empowered democrats on tuesday delivered their own pointed message to president trump and the nation  were back and we wont be pushed around from the partys restored madam speaker presiding over the proceedings to the sea of white worn by the scores of democratic women crowding the partys side of the chamber  the resurrection of the democrats as a force in congress was on full display  at his first speech before a divided congress  mr  trump himself recognized their ascension with his plea for democrats not to pursue investigations of his administration  there was zero chance of them complying with that request we are not here to play  representative mary gay scanlon  a freshman democrat from pennsylvania  said as she joined other democratic women earlier tuesday to celebrate their growing clout  we are here to be serious their invited guests  undocumented immigrants  sexual assault and gun violence victims  transgender americans  federal employees who suffered in the shutdown  served as the personification of rebukes to the president and his policies  also scattered through mr  trumps audience on the house floor were multiple eager democratic presidential aspirants whose goal is to take mr  trumps job away from him in two years the event had a different vibe from previous presidential visits to the capitol for the annual ritual  that was not unexpected since plans for the speech had already been upended once by speaker nancy pelosi  who returned to her old job in january  because of the record long shutdown of the government caused by the conflict between democrats and the president over his demand for a border wall  which democrats consider unworkable and wasteful the fight over wall funding persists  but the gulf between the democrats and mr  trump goes much deeper than the border dispute  the disdain democrats hold for this president was palpable in the chamber as they looked sternly on in mostly silent disapproval  across the aisle  republicans were left to provide the enthusiastic applause on which mr  trump thrives the presidents call for compromise and comity struck many as particularly hollow after two years of angry tweets  recriminations and personal attacks that continued almost up until the speech  democrats just werent buying it he is so disingenuous that when he starts talking about unity it is almost laughable  said representative jim mcgovern  democrat of massachusetts its hard to listen to a man with such a demonstrated inability to tell the truth  or even keep his word with members of either party  try to sell us on the idea that hes now ready for bipartisanship and unity  that hes poised to bring us together  said senator sheldon whitehouse  democrat of rhode island mr  whitehouse and other democrats did commend the president for the military and law enforcement personnel he brought to capitol hill for recognition  but said there was a big difference between them and the president they rose to the occasion in their own time  said senator amy klobuchar  the minnesota democrat who could soon be joining the ranks of democrats seeking the presidency  hes not doing a thing representative lloyd doggett  a veteran democratic lawmaker from texas  spoke for many of his colleagues when he called it totally outrageous for the president to use his nationally televised speech to try to undermine the special counsels investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election and multiple inquiries that democrats are now beginning into the trump administration the president essentially offered the democrats a choice between reaching legislative deals or pursuing ridiculous partisan investigations  suggesting the country could not have both  to democrats  if that choice exists  it is an easy one given that most dont agree with the president on his legislative ideas  many of them consider restoring congressional oversight  after two years of what mr  doggett termed republican overlook  their prime responsibility after winning back the house in november perhaps the best illustration of democratic sentiment toward the president was in how willing most of them were to sit during the speech and not yield to the impulse to join republicans in their frequent applause of the president in the past  lawmakers were uneasy about skipping the ovations for fear of being caught on camera not applauding some patriotic or uplifting moment and seeming disrespectful or churlish  but democrats on tuesday had no qualms at all about failing to applaud donald trump  they avoided any outbursts or walkouts that could have presented a bad image  but their silence as republicans clapped repeatedly spoke volumes the one big democratic applause line of the night came at republican expense  as the president was extolling the economy and the new jobs it had created for women in particular  democratic applause became a crescendo as they realized that some of those new jobs were in the house of representatives  where democratic women had taken the place of ousted republicans  they cheered and cheered mr  trump then urged them to remain standing as he noted we have more women serving in the congress than ever before  he was right  but the increased numbers were on the democratic side  where women were outfitted in white in tribute to the suffragists of a century ago  house republicans saw a decline in their women membership in the election unified democrats are feeling confident in their approach after mr  trump relented in the shutdown fight and agreed to reopen the government without winning the wall funding  despite his determined push tuesday for the wall money  democrats are very unlikely to give him what he wants in the ongoing negotiations to keep the government open past feb  15  though leaders of the talks say a chance for some compromise still exists democrats were careful not to completely dismiss the presidents call for bipartisanship  despite their reservations  though they sincerely doubted his sincerity president trump must now take concrete steps to work with democrats to strengthen the health and economic security of families across america  ms  pelosi said  after two years of the presidents empty words  the american people deserve real results in his speech  mr  trump lauded his accomplishments and said  we are just getting started  for democrats  the trump era cannot end soon enough .
this editorial has been updated to reflect news developments you know the system has broken down when the clearest way out of a government shutdown may be for the president to declare a fake national emergency this was the direction president trump appeared to be leaning on thursday  as he flew to mcallen  tex   to promote his border wall  a p r  stunt that he didnt want to perform and that he said in advance was unlikely to bear fruit   it s not going to change a damn thing  he was reported to have said  but i m still doing it  hes probably right  negotiations to end the shutdown prompted by mr  trumps wall fixation have gone nowhere  despite the presidents storming out of his wednesday huddle with lawmakers  and his show at the border wont change that  the growing sense is that to break the impasse mr  trump will need to find a way to at least claim to be building his wall without congress  possibly by attempting the norm shattering and constitutionally suspect tactic of declaring the border situation a national emergency requiring military intervention as the president stews over his wall  more and more americans are feeling the squeeze from what has become the governments longest stoppage ever  millions of lives already have been upended  well beyond the 800 000 federal workers not getting paid  and millions more could be if the dysfunction continues  disrupting everything from air travel to the federal courts to basic services throughout indian country like health care and law enforcement how did we get into this sorry situation  a meltdown of this magnitude typically has many causes  in this case  the presidents inability to reach some sort of deal rests heavily on several basic failures of understanding by him and his team  these include 1  a failure to grasp how divided government works  the president somehow came to believe that hed have more leverage once the democrats took control of the house  maybe someone convinced him that  after the transfer of power  he could shift blame for the impasse onto speaker nancy pelosi  a favorite villain of republicans  or maybe he assumed that pelosi   company would fold in the face of the dysfunction and public outcry a shutdown would bring  whatever the logic  team trump assumed democrats would become more pliable  and a deal would emerge unfortunately  mr  trump has been spoiled by two years of congress being led by weak kneed members of his party who  even when troubled by his excesses  largely let him run amok  lest he call down upon them the wrath of the republican base but for their part  ms  pelosi and her new majority are concerned about presenting a united front against mr  trumps challenges to constitutional authority  with the presidents wall having become a flash point  the political costs to democrats for cutting a deal seen as advantageous to mr  trump would be steep 2  a failure to understand the costs of playing only to the base  while republican lawmakers may be awed by mr  trumps command of their partys troops  democrats are more motivated by the fact that the bulk of the electorate is tired of the presidents divisive demagogy  time and again  mr  trump has chosen partisanship over leadership  doing nothing to expand his appeal  this puts him at a disadvantage in wooing the public to his side of the wall debate 3  a failure to understand nancy pelosi  apparently  mr  trump never got around to reading the art of war  or at least not sun tzus admonition to know your enemy  if he had  the president would have tried to develop at least a basic working relationship with ms  pelosi  the white house clearly assumed that  at some point  maybe after she secured the speakers gavel  ms  pelosi would bend to mr  trumps will  but the speaker is not impressed with bluster  she is seldom cowed by political pressure from her own team  much less the opposing one  she plays the long game  and her will is as formidable as mr  trumps  possibly more so  one key difference  ms  pelosi knows how the legislative process works 4  a failure to understand shutdown politics  if you dont want to be blamed for one  dont say youre going to own it  mr  trump sacrificed that option when he boasted how proud hed be to grind the government to a halt 5  a failure to understand how the government works  neither mr  trump nor anyone on his team had a clue how disruptive even a partial shutdown could be  and how theyd need to scurry to prevent millions of people from losing food stamps  housing or tax refunds 6  a failure to understand how members of congress operate  standing by the president when hes tweeting out empty threats and insults is one thing  but when a shutdown starts causing pain and outrage back home  republican lawmakers  especially those in vulnerable districts or states  start asking themselves which they value more  their president or their political hides  even casual students of congress know that this is not a tough call bottom line  mr  trump loves to boast that he leads with his gut  he really cant be bothered with all the humdrum details of governing  remaining proudly ignorant of how anything works in washington  the presidency  the congress  the constitution  thats left him in a standoff for which he was wholly unprepared for the sake of the millions being hurt  lets hope he manages to blunder himself back out of this mess soon .
tijuana  mexico  with the bullhorn of a nationally televised address and the prestige of the white house around him  president trump delivered a dark  if familiar  message to the american people on tuesday night  the united states needs a border wall to stanch the flow of drugs and criminals  and it has no more room for migrants in mexico  the supposed origin and pipeline of these menaces  leaders and citizens reacted with a weary shrug in the mexican border city of tijuana  where thousands of migrants have gathered seeking entry to the united states  most of the televisions in a downtown restaurant showed soccer matches and basketball games  mr  trumps voice  nearly drowned out by music  emerged faintly from a screen in the back almost no one seemed to care  or even listen to what the american president had to say luis arce  a 32 year old lawyer  was among the few who took a moment to reflect on mr  trumps speech  he said he was not surprised by mr  trumps insistence on building a wall  nor by anything else in the remarks its a tantrum  mr  arce said  we all know he is temperamental and will never back down on this whim of his  especially since he promised it since his campaign and seems like he cant take it back a wall will clearly not solve drug addiction  the drug trade  weapons smuggling or illegal immigration  he added  those are problems that have to be addressed and solved by policymaking the situation at mexicos northern border would seem to demand urgent policymaking  as the migrants gathering at cities like tijuana have become a humanitarian and political crisis for mexico the demands of trying to shelter migrants and improve squalid  crowded conditions have overwhelmed local officials  and the arrival of the migrants has strained relations with the united states  last week  mexico called for an investigation into american officers repeated use of tear gas across the border yet the reaction to mr  trumps speech on tuesday night was muted although only several weeks into his term  president andrs manuel lpez obrador has gone out of his way not to antagonize his american counterpart  after mr  trumps address  he appeared to weigh his words carefully in a long interview with a mexican news program  mr  lpez obrador said mexico would always pursue a relationship of cooperation  of friendship  his government  he said  will confront migration with development  with employment after the interview  reporters asked mr  lpez obrador about mr  trumps speech and his insistence on the wall i dont even want to mention the word  mr  lopez obrador said  its an issue thats not even on our agenda  i dont think about it instead  the president said  he would try to bring mr  trump around to his way of thinking we will persuade him  convince him that we need cooperation for development  he said  this is the best way to face the phenomenon of migration vicente fox  the vocal former president of mexico  has berated mr  trump in the past  and on tuesday he appeared to see no reason to let up  dismissing the american leader on twitter  lenfant terrible  the enemy of all  even himself mr  fox urged mr  trump  dont be so stubborn  saying that mexico would never pay for the wall and that as far as i understand the american people will not either from the day he announced his candidacy for office in 2015  mr  trump has made the reduction of immigration  and the construction of a wall  a central issue of his campaign and presidency  sometimes promising that mexico would pay for the wall  he has since claimed a revised trade agreement with mexico and canada would pay for the wall  an idea rejected on tuesday by kenneth smith ramos  the chief mexican negotiator for the deal thats a chapter you will not find in the new agreement  simply because it does not exist  he wrote on twitter in a series of fact checking tweets about the speech  arturo sarukhan  mexicos former ambassador to the united states  rejected many of mr  trumps claims  saying there is a national security crisis on the border does a huge disservice to how the us and mexico have worked together since 9 11 to ensure our border is not used by terrorists to undermine our common security  he wrote on monday  mexicos interior minister  olga snchez cordero  staked out a position that was in implicit contrast to mr  trumps migrants are not criminals  much less do they constitute a threat to the security of mexico or the united states  she said  they are human beings who seek to escape the reality of insecurity and poverty in their countries of origin  who seek the most elemental thing  the possibility of remaining alive and finding a job that will allow them to advance with dignity but although she said mexico was open and willing to work with the united states  the two sides are still far apart on the nature of the problem itself mexicans in tijuana noted as much on tuesday  when mr  trump spoke daniel gmez  the manager of the bar airing the speech  called it bad news that would discourage tourism and hurt the mexican economy it is so frustrating to listen to him say the same things  which are nothing more than excuses to justify the massive problems that exists in the u s  and blame it all on the foreigner  the mexican  the other  he said its infuriating because we cant do absolutely anything about it  he said  all we can do is what we are doing right now  which is to sit down and watch it from afar .

it was never like this before the migrants come now in the middle of the night or in the bright light of day  men and women arrive by the hundreds  caked with dirt  with teens and toddlers in tow  they jump the small fences in remote parts of texas  and they gather on the hot pavement at the main border crossing in california  tired and fearful  they look for the one thing that they pray will allow them to stay in the united states  at least for a while  a border patrol agent gone are the days when young  strong men waited on the tijuana river levees for their chance to wade across the water  evade capture and find work for the summer  these days  thousands of people a day simply walk up to the border and surrender  most of them are from central america  seeking to escape from gang violence  sexual abuse  death threats and persistent poverty  the smugglers have told them they will be quickly released  as long as they bring a child  and that they will be allowed to remain in the united states for years while they pursue their asylum cases the very nature of immigration to america changed after 2014  when families first began showing up in large numbers  the resulting crisis has overwhelmed a system unable to detain  care for and quickly decide the fate of tens of thousands of people who claim to be fleeing for their lives  for years  both political parties have tried  and failed  to overhaul the nations immigration laws  mindful that someday the government would reach a breaking point that moment has arrived  the country is now unable to provide either the necessary humanitarian relief for desperate migrants or even basic controls on the number and nature of who is entering the united states the immigration courts now have more than 800 000 pending cases  each one takes an average of 700 days to process  and because laws and court rulings aimed at protecting children prohibit jailing young people for more than 20 days  families are often simply released  they are dropped off at downtown bus stations in places like brownsville  tex   where dozens last week sat on gray metal benches  most without money or even laces on their shoes  heading for destinations across the united states at the current pace of nearly 100 000 migrants each month  officials say more than a million people will have tried to cross the border in a 12 month period  some of those arriving today will have a strong legal case to stay under international refugee treaties and federal asylum laws  but most wont have a formal asylum hearing until 2021 the flow of migrant families has reached record levels  with february totals 560 percent above those for the same period last year  as many as 27 000 children are expected to cross the border and enter the immigration enforcement system in april alone  so crowded are border facilities that some of the nearly 3 500 migrants in custody in el paso were herded earlier this month under a bridge  behind razor wire in recent days  officials have grasped for ever more dire ways to describe the situation  operational emergency  unsustainable  systemwide meltdown one top official said simply  the system is on fire for president trump  the situation at the border has generated red hot fury  it erupted again on sunday as he abruptly forced out kirstjen nielsen  his long embattled homeland security secretary  for what he considered her failure to put an end to the surge of migrants in recent days  the president has landed on a dark new message that  if taken literally  could mean an end to all immigration  legal and illegal  across the mexican border  the system is full  the president said in california on friday  standing in front of the rusting iron slats of the border wall that he wants to expand for hundreds of miles across the countrys southern border  whether its asylum  whether its anything you want  its illegal immigration  we cant take you anymore yet  perversely  the presidents own anti immigrant rhetoric has helped supercharge the pipeline of migrants from honduras  guatemala and el salvador  smugglers lately have been buying radio ads in central america  warning that mr  trump is about to shut down all immigration  if you ever want to go to the united states  they say  go now  they said they would take us by bus  we would be safe  said jeremias pascoal  16  who crossed into texas earlier this month after paying  3 200 for a guide who showed his group to a road where he said they could surrender to the border patrol  experts say the president is not wrong when he says that legal loopholes in americas immigration system are partly responsible for encouraging migrants to bring children like jeremias on a dangerous journey that in some cases ends in tragedy  in december  two migrant children died in customs and border protection custody after becoming gravely ill during their trip  officials warn that more deaths are likely christopher cabrera  a vice president of the local union of border patrol agents in the rio grande valley in south texas  pulled out his phone last week and scrolled through dozens of pictures he has taken out in the field  groups of more than 100 people turning themselves in at night  seriously ill children huddled on the ground  being given medical aid the majority of our agents get sick  infectious disease is everywhere  mr  cabrera said  including in the border patrols migrant processing center  theres always scabies in there  usually we have chickenpox  we have tuberculosis in there  you name it  its probably been through that building  so its dangerous  its dangerous for our agents  its dangerous for the detainees that dont have anything but the president has not chosen to prioritize a surge of new resources to the border  which could help ease the overcrowding and suffering that have gripped the migrants and the border communities where they arrive  instead  mr  trump has insisted on simply trying to stop people from getting into the country in the first place  a policy of deterrence that not only has failed but has made the problem worse in an effort to send a youre not welcome message  the administration has tried a series of strategies  prosecuting everyone who crosses illegally  taking their children from them  tightening asylum standards  slowing down the number of people allowed to apply for asylum each day  forcing asylum applicants to remain in mexico while they wait for court dates  in some cases  this approach has proved too cruel for the american public to tolerate and has run up against the protections enshrined in the constitution  which the courts have decided protect migrants as well as citizens  some of the presidents agenda has been blocked by congress or the courts  none of it has fixed the problem to the contrary  these policies have forced migrants to divert from well staffed border stations like the one in san ysidro  calif   where agents deliberately slowed down the number of migrants they would allow to cross each day  toward remote areas of west texas and new mexico  where the two migrant children died in december and the administration has done little to speed up the immigration courts  though that could be just the deterrent the president has sought the backlog has been allowed to build to the point of a crisis  said doris meissner  the immigration commissioner in the clinton administration and now a fellow at the migration policy institute  they do not accept the basic proposition that this is a population where there are people qualified for protection and that enabling the systems we have is an answer in a series of international human rights agreements  beginning with the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees  nations agreed to allow anyone to seek asylum  even if they entered a country illegally  the agreements defined a refugee as someone with a well founded fear of persecution based on race  religion  nationality  membership in a particular social group  or political opinion  determining whether an applicant receives asylum was left up to individual nations  but in the united states  the international obligations and the standards for asylum were largely incorporated into american immigration law beginning with the refugee act of 1980 only about 20 percent of asylum seekers ultimately win the right to live and work in the united states by proving that they would face persecution in their home countries  just wanting a better job doesnt qualify  applicants have the burden to show evidence of past persecution or compelling testimony that establishes the well founded fear that they would face danger if they return home some have won asylum  for example  by proving that their membership in a religious minority singles them out for harassment or threats  in the past  women suffering domestic abuse have qualified  as have some victims targeted by gangs  generalized fear of violence does not qualify  neither does poverty the asylum process begins with a credible fear screening to see if an applicant is likely to succeed in the first place out of nearly 100 000 credible fear interviews during the year that ended in september of 2018  an asylum officer confirmed a credible fear 74 677 times  a nearly 75 percent approval rate  a senior trump administration official vowed on tuesday to dramatically reduce that rate by making the standards tougher  but it is what happens after the credible fear interview that is at the heart of americas bitter immigration debate in 2017  11 292 immigrants who had been released on bond or on their own recognizance were ordered deported because they failed to show up for their immigration proceedings  a 26 percent increase over the previous year  according to justice department data  blanca vasquez  who fled honduras after gangs killed her husband and torched their home  passed a credible fear interview at the border in 2013  she was released and settled in northern texas  where she got a janitorial job and waited for her day in court  about a year later  she said  she unintentionally missed her first hearing and was most likely ordered deported for failing to appear shes not sure  because she stopped going to court at all  i got confused  she said  i ask god to look after me  there are too many problems in my country  i want to stay here maria perez  a honduran who joined a caravan with her 8 year old son  yunior  in november  waited two months in tijuana for the chance to apply for asylum after her sons father was killed by a man who continued to threaten her family  when her number  1 506  was finally called  she and her son were soon released to await their court hearings under the juvenile protection laws  she lives now with a friend in northern california  but she does not have a lawyer and isnt sure how to proceed with her case i am very worried  i dont know what to do  she said families like ms  perez and her son are the biggest targets of mr  trumps fury  the president and his aides blame the nations immigration laws  the president derisively calls them democrat laws  for creating an incentive for migrants to bring a child with them to improve their chances of getting into the united states  one of them is the trafficking victims protection reauthorization act  a 2008 bill signed into law by president george w  bush that requires immigration authorities to treat migrant children differently than they do adults  the other is a 1997 legal settlement in a case known as flores  which prevents the government from holding children or families in secure detention facilities for longer than 20 days it was trying to get around those legal limits that prompted the administration last spring to begin forcibly separating migrant children from their parents  detaining parents indefinitely while sending children to shelters and foster care  the fierce political backlash forced mr  trump to abandon that approach the presidents most recent initiative was the one calling for many migrants to remain in mexico for the months or years it could take for an american judge to hear their case  that policy  too  ran afoul of the courts when a federal judge in california blocked its implementation  for some migrants  the policy effectively meant no asylum case at all miguel aquino  29  who fled el salvador in a caravan in october after being shot in the leg and hand by ms 13 gang members  waited for weeks in tijuana to apply for asylum at the sprawling san ysidro port  the biggest on the border  he was interviewed and sent back to mexico to wait for a court date in march  when he arrived for a preliminary hearing without an attorney  the judge gave him more time to find one  and sent him back to mexico to wait  mr  aquino said he has called eight lawyers  and they all said they couldnt represent him because he is in tijuana  at this point  he is tired of waiting the next time  if i dont go with a lawyer and they dont give a clear answer  he said  im going to look for another way to get in  mr  trump often says he plans to build a wall on the border with mexico to halt illegal immigration  but when the standoff over funding for the wall led to a 35 day government shutdown in december and january  it actually made things worse  many immigration judges were furloughed  and tens of thousands of deportation and asylum cases were delayed  in some cases for years  there is another problem with the wall  slowing the exodus of migrants from central america would need to start in those countries first central americas economies are still weak  and residents face drug and gang violence at levels largely unseen in other countries  many are subject to deep poverty  a situation that recently reached a crisis with the collapse of coffee  corn and maize crops  m c   a 23 year old guatemalan woman who asked to be identified by her initials for safety reasons  received an anonymous letter recently in her hometown  san marcos  warning her that she would be killed if she did not give the letter writers 65 000 guatemalan quetzals  nearly  8 500 m c   who is three and a half months pregnant  went to the police in san marcos  then she got a second letter  warning her to never go to the police again  after she received a third letter  she made the decision to leave for the united states i didnt want to come here at first  but then i think its the best thing for the baby  m c  said as she sat in a migrant shelter in the south texas border city of brownsville  here  hes going to grow without crime  he can go to school american diplomats say the best way to confront that kind of lawlessness is with the hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid that has been flowing to guatemala  el salvador and honduras for several years  designed to bolster the rule of law and improve the economy last week  mr  trump abruptly abandoned those efforts  ordering the state department to scrap about  500 million in aid to the three countries  mr  trumps decision has been criticized by members of both parties  who call it shortsighted likewise  critics say that mr  trumps repeated denigration of mexico over the years  including his insistence on building a border wall  risks undermining mexicos willingness to help to keep central american migrants from traveling to the united states this is the first mexican administration that has even been oriented toward doing that  ms  meissner  the clinton administration immigration commissioner  said  but blaming other countries and painting those coming across the border from mexico as a national security threat has never failed to animate mr  trumps core supporters  the ones who helped deliver him the white house in 2016 its an invasion  mr  trump declared in february  after congress denied him money to build a wall  we have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country in fact  the migrants are mostly victims of the broken immigration system  they are not  by and large  killers  rapists or gang members  most do not carry drugs  they have learned how to make asylum claims  just as the law allows them to do  and nearly all of them are scared  of being shipped off to mexico  separated from their children  sent to prison  scared  especially  of going home zolan

washington  democratic congressional leaders called on president trump on tuesday to reopen the federal government while they resolve differences with him over securing the southern border  in a formal response to his prime time address from the oval office that they dismissed as riddled with misinformation and fear mongering the president has chosen fear  we want to start with the facts  said speaker nancy pelosi of california  speaking from her office at the capitol beside senator chuck schumer of new york  the minority leader  as they delivered a joint response to the president she said mr  trump had rejected bipartisan legislation to reopen the government over his obsession with forcing american taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective wall  a wall he always promised mexico would pay for mr  schumer suggested that the presidents formal address to the nation  mr  trumps first from the oval office  had been a stunt  this president just used the backdrop of the oval office to manufacture a crisis  stoke fear and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration  he said the dueling speeches from opposite sides of pennsylvania avenue unfolded at the close of day 18 of a government shutdown over mr  trumps demand for  5 7 billion for a border wall that democrats have steadfastly opposed the democratic leaders decision to select themselves as the message bearers to counter the president underscores how a partisan power struggle in a new era of divided government is undergirding the discussions over resolving the shutdown  even as the paychecks of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and benefits for millions of americans hang in the balance mr  trump  who spent much of the first two weeks of the shutdown cloistered inside the white house saying little about it  is now using the powers of the presidency to focus public attention on his ominous immigration message in an effort to build support for the idea of erecting a large wall on the border with mexico  democrats  newly in control of the house  are steering clear of talk of the wall itself  and are instead working to focus attention on the damaging impacts of the shutdown we dont govern by temper tantrum  mr  schumer said  no president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down  hurting millions of americans who are treated as leverage appealing to mr  trump directly  he added  mr  president  reopen the government and we can work to resolve our differences over border security  but end this shutdown now senator bernie sanders  independent of vermont  who ran unsuccessfully for the democratic presidential nomination in 2016  used a response to the president he streamed live on youtube to brand mr  trump a liar  and ticked down a list of misstatements the president uttered during his address it gives me no pleasure to tell you what most of you already know  and that is that president trump lies all of the time  and in remarks tonight and in recent weeks regarding immigration and the wall  he continues to lie  mr  sanders said he went on to discuss the plight of millions of americans who lack health insurance  elderly people who have no retirement savings  millions more with crippling student debt and the specter of global climate change  arguing that those challenges were far more pressing than the one posed by illegal immigration we dont need to create artificial crises  mr  sanders said  we have enough real crises mr  trump is planning a trip to the border in mcallen  tex   on thursday  while democrats plan to bring up a succession of bills this week to reopen shuttered parts of the government  including the internal revenue service  to allow tax refunds to be paid  and the agriculture department  to ensure that food assistance and farmer support payments can be made the treasury department and the i r s  will come first  then agriculture and interior department programs  including the national parks  on thursday  followed by transportation and housing programs on friday we are going to  daily  urge and take efforts to open up the government  said representative steny h  hoyer of maryland  the majority leader  whatever problems confront us  they are exacerbated  not relieved  by shutting down government a group of senate democrats spent tuesday evening taking turns on the senate floor calling on senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  to bring up the house passed legislation to reopen the government  the dozen democrats  led by senator tim kaine of virginia and senator jeanne shaheen of new hampshire  plan to spotlight the harm from the shutdown on federal workers and those who benefit from government programs rather than donald trump putting on a political show tonight on tv and a political trip to the border tomorrow  i invite the president to come anywhere in virginia  maryland or the district and sit down with federal employees and explain this crisis and why they are not getting paid  said senator mark warner  democrat of virginia  we need to negotiate additional border security  i am all for it  but not holding hostage  literally  our federal employees and countless others in the house  the shutdown has proved a unifying issue for newly elected democrats who campaigned as fierce opponents of mr  trump  in a brief but scathing speech from the house floor  representative ayanna pressley  democrat of massachusetts  spoke directly to the president  uttering his name and earning a gentle reprimand from the presiding officer  who reminded her that lawmakers are barred from personally impugning the president or other elected officials you devalue the life of the immigrant  the worker and the survivor  ms  pressley said  this has nothing to do with border security  your shutdown  another trump generated crisis  has brought a tsunami of hurt to the american people .
chicago  on day 1 of what would become the longest government shutdown in the countrys history  mary kelly had a typically american view of the situation  she was optimistic  as an employee of the internal revenue service  she had been through shutdowns before  this one would not last long  she figured on day 24  weeks into her mandatory furlough  she applied for unemployment benefits ten days after that  she left her home in the chicago suburbs  rode a train downtown and joined demonstrators on a windswept federal plaza  her cheeks mottled pink from the cold i was never scared during shutdowns in the past  ms  kelly  a union officer  said during the protest on thursday  wearing woolen gloves and clutching a sign  but now who knows whats going to happen and then on day 35  with no resolution seemingly in sight  she had her answer in news leaked from washington  the shutdown was finally coming to an end im waiting with bated breath  she said on friday  glued to her phone for bulletins that congressional leaders and president trump had reached a deal to temporarily reopen the government  hopefully well get a paycheck out of it when the partial government shutdown began at midnight on dec  22  it left about 800 000 federal employees out of work  with many continuing to show up at their jobs even without the prospect of immediate paychecks  in the beginning  the episode was easily shrugged off as another washington dysfunction  the result of an impetuous president making an outsize demand for a border wall  a dispute fueled by partisan bickering and likely to wrap up in a few days initial nonchalance gave way to worry  worry gave way to panic  and before it ended in mr  trumps retreat from an insistence on wall funding nearly six weeks after it began  the government shutdown rapidly reordered american life it showed how far the tentacles of the federal government reach into ordinary lives around the nation  and how even the richest country on earth could be one domestic crisis away from bread lines  and it may not be final yet  government workers reminded themselves even as they celebrated  as the three week deal does not preclude another impasse although over for now  the shutdown inflicted pain that ran deep stunned middle class people were forced to moonlight  visit food pantries for groceries and apply for unemployment benefits  a stable government job suddenly felt high risk some of the federal employees who went unpaid for weeks missed mortgage payments  piled up credit card debt and worried about financial doom back pay will make most government workers whole again  but the deal cannot undo all the effects  many business owners who rely on government workers saw their profits dry up  many people saw their credit ratings nose dive  full of shutdown stress  many saw their marriages fray and noticed as their anxieties were transferred to their children the shutdown revealed unflattering truths about americans finances  even neighbors and friends with steady paychecks and the markers of comfortable lives were suddenly surviving hand to mouth  teetering on the edge of despair i have to come here and see people who are homeless and who biked here  as im pulling up in my subaru  said jenny lunsted  a mother of two and the wife of an unpaid petty officer with the united states coast guard  who browsed shelves of canned pumpkin and fresh tomatoes at a food pantry in stock island  fla   on tuesday  its heartbreaking because you feel almost unworthy and embarrassed at the same time the effects cascaded far beyond the plight of individual workers  attracting the attention of americans oblivious to the outsize role the government plays in their lives federal agencies stalled projects  plane crashes went uninvestigated  research studies were deferred  a shortage of air traffic controllers caused flight delays across the northeast on friday  snarling air travel at some of the countrys busiest airports a lack of workers left some of the countrys most treasured sites in a state of neglect  that included yosemite national park  the place the pioneering naturalist john muir described as a temple of canyons  rushing waterfalls and sun streaked granite cliffs because of the shutdown  the park was hanging by a thread  said ken yager  59  a professional climber who came to yosemite more than four decades ago and never left the area all but a skeleton crew of rangers at the park were furloughed  the visitor center was closed and no one answered the phone at the park headquarters  nearby  the towns that rely on yosemite tourism for their livelihoods were hurting  mr  yager  who runs a cleaning service  laid off most of his employees every day the shutdown stretched on  mr  yager said  people were more and more desperate it has been more than six weeks since the blustery oval office confrontation on dec  11 between mr  trump and representative nancy pelosi  the house speaker  and senator chuck schumer  the minority leader mr  trump  reiterating his campaign pledge to build a border wall  had said he would take the blame for shutting down the government if democrats rebuffed his effort  i will take the mantle  he said in a vow that was replayed on cable news countless times  i will be the one to shut it down and it did shut down  in the early morning of dec  22  the shuttered departments included treasury  agriculture  homeland security  interior  state  housing and urban development  transportation  commerce and justice  more than 420 000 federal employees began to work without pay  another 380 000 were furloughed to wait for a resolution from home yet the notion of a government shutdown still felt to many like a familiar political ritual rather than a fear

member of an elite federal firefighting crew that uses chain saws and hand tools to attack the nations wildfires  he would normally spend this time of year clearing away brush to help diminish future fire danger but during the shutdown  he was not permitted to do that  instead  he was confined to his office  waiting to be called to an emergency  were ultimately missing those windows of opportunity  mr  darling said this past week  he could not say that the shutdown would cause a fire to break out  but he could not rule out the possibility that the risk of fire had risen because of the bureaucratic standoff on jan  11  three weeks into the shutdown  the consequences became very real to federal employees as many missed their first paycheck johnny zuagar  39  of upper marlboro  md

san pedro sula  honduras  a new caravan of migrants is forming in honduras  and even ahead of its scheduled departure at dawn on tuesday  battle lines were being drawn to the north  with some vowing to help them on their journey north  and others to block them for president trump  the timing of the caravan offered fresh ammunition in his fight with congress over the  5 7 billion he wants for an enhanced border wall between mexico and the united states  the dispute has led to a partial shutdown of the federal government as he did last fall  when another caravan made the same trek  mr  trump portrayed the migrants  who say they are trying to escape poverty and violence  and who in seeking asylum are exercising a legal right  in an ominous light there is another major caravan forming right now in honduras  and so far were trying to break it up  but so far its bigger than anything weve seen  mr  trump said on thursday  and a drone isnt going to stop it and a sensor isnt going to stop it  but you know whats going to stop it in its tracks  a nice  powerful wall despite mr  trumps assertions  nobody knows how many people will leave on tuesday and how many more may join the walkers as they cross guatemala  reach southern mexico and make their way to the united states border it was also unclear on sunday who put the plan in motion for this caravan hctor romero  37  has decided he is going to join the caravan on tuesday  i have had only two days work a week for the past three months and that barely covers expenses  said mr  romero  who collects bus fares in a small town about 40 miles west of san pedro sula  the city from which the caravan intends to start  i didnt have the courage to go last time  but this time i do the divorced father of four is taking his 12 year old daughter with him  believing that it may improve his chances with united states immigration authorities the first challenge to the migrants may come from their own governments  the deeply unpopular presidents of honduras and guatemala  both tarnished by scandal  are eager to maintain the support of the trump administration  halting the caravan could help them do that on thursday  the charg daffaires in the american embassy  heide b  fulton  traveled to the border with guatemala to tape a plea to migrants  dont let yourself be fooled  she said  dont invest your time and money in a journey that is destined to fail in mexico  the new government  led by the leftist president andrs manuel lpez obrador  which took office on dec  1  says it will deal with the migrants more humanely than the preceding administration officials say they want to avoid a repetition of the horror earlier migrants endured as they tried to avoid detection  and deportation  on the perilous trek across mexico our vision is that migrants are not criminals  much less do they constitute a threat to the security of mexico or the united states  mexicos interior minister  olga snchez cordero  said last week in a speech to mexican diplomats  promising an end to massive deportations more than 300 000 central americans entered mexico last year  most of them illegally  and an estimated 80 percent of them were bound for the united states border  ms  snchez cordero said she said migrants in a new caravan who enter the country at official crossing points and register would be granted visas to stay and work in mexico or permits to travel under the supervision of migration authorities toward the united states border  but those who cross into mexico illegally  she said  will be deported we wont allow any entry that isnt orderly  safe and regulated by mexican law  ms  snchez cordero said the governments new policies will be put to the test when the caravan arrives  said gustavo mohar  a former migration official in mexicos interior ministry  you cannot resolve the problem  he said  you manage it intelligently  cautiously  realistically he said success  particularly with so much international attention focused on the central american migrants  would give mexico moral authority with the united states traveling in caravans offers safety in numbers from the criminal groups and corrupt officials who prey on migrants  activists say  but the size of recent caravans has become uncontrollable  said irineo mujica  a member of pueblo sin fronteras  a transnational group that accompanied earlier caravans in mexico  it is not organizing this new one as the new caravan prepares to leave  the experience of the last one seems to be guiding the response of governments and people along the way that previous exodus was a tale told through images  migrants wading across the suchiate river  which marks the border between guatemala and mexico  masses of people filling country roads and cramming into pickup trucks  and the central squares of provincial mexican cities transformed into cluttered campsites when the caravan  almost 6 000 strong  reached tijuana  the migrants found that a high fence and a very long wait to ask for asylum still separated them from the united states  migrant shelters overflowed and conditions in them quickly worsened  some migrants gave up but back home in honduras  the trials of previous caravans have not been a deterrent for those considering joining the new one  the danger and frustrations pale beside the overwhelming fear of being sent back home  said sister lidia de suazo  the coordinator of pastoral care for migrants at the roman catholic archdiocese in the honduran capital  tegucigalpa the majority of those who went with the october caravan were not deported  she said  so that sends the message back to the countries of origin  and people say  lets go too because they wont deport us  miroslava cerpas  the migration coordinator at the center for research and promotion of human rights in tegucigalpa  said  we explain the dangers to them  it doesnt matter what might happen to them  they are going to leave  many dont know where they are going but they know what they are leaving behind some of the migrants in tijuana were considering going south to join the new caravan and accompany those making the trip for the first time  omar rivera  39  a construction worker from el salvador  was one of them a lot of people are coming  he said as he prepared to board a bus heading south  and they need our help .
washington  president trumps purge of the nations top homeland security officials is a sign that he is preparing to unleash an even fiercer assault on immigration  including a possible return of his controversial decision last summer to separate migrant children from their parents  current and former administration officials said monday mr  trump shook up the ranks of his top immigration officials after spending months demanding that they take tougher action to stop the surge in migrant families at the border and seething about what he considers their overly legalistic refusals to do what he has said was necessary that anger was underscored on monday when a judge blocked mr  trumps efforts to force asylum seekers to wait in mexico while their cases proceed  a practice that immigration advocates called inhumane and illegal  judge richard seeborg of the united states district court for the northern district of california ruled that existing law did not give mr  trump the power to enforce the policy  known as migrant protection protocols the immediate targets of the presidents growing fury about the situation at the border were the officials who he saw as insufficiently steely minded  kirstjen nielsen  who resigned sunday as the secretary of homeland security  and ron vitiello  whose nomination to permanently lead immigration and customs enforcement was pulled after mr  trump remarked that we want to go in a tougher direction but the longer term effect of the eruption of oval office frustration is likely to be a burst of hard line policies that stand out even in an administration that has pursued an unprecedented series of executive actions and rules changes aimed at reducing legal and illegal immigration into the united states in addition to urging mr  trump to revisit the idea of family separation  several of the presidents closest immigration confidants have been pushing him to consider even harsher measures those include further limits on who can seek asylum  stronger action to close ports of entry along the mexican border  an executive order to end birthright citizenship  more aggressive construction of a border wall  and a more robust embrace of active duty troops to secure the border against illegal immigration in an administration that is famous for chaos and last minute decision making  it is unclear on which of those policies the president might choose to move forward  but by removing ms  nielsen  mr  vitiello and perhaps others  mr  trump is getting rid of voices who sometimes cautioned him against taking actions they believed to be illegal or unwise there was a perception that secretary nielsen was not as committed to the sort of full throated approach that others in the administration  including the white house  were seeking  said seth grossman  who served as deputy general counsel at the department of homeland security from 2011 to 2015 he said ms  nielsens exit and mr  vitiellos step back signals there is an intention to pursue more aggressive policies three senior administration officials with knowledge of the presidents conversations over the past several months confirmed that mr  trump has repeatedly told aides that he wants to restart the family separation policy  one of the officials said the president had made it clear to aides that he liked ms  nielsen personally  but was critical of her job performance  all three officials spoke about the internal discussions on the condition of anonymity stephen miller  the architect of mr  trumps immigration agenda and one of the presidents closest advisers in the white house  has been an advocate for a modified version of the family separation policy known as binary choice others  including kris kobach  the former kansas secretary of state and an informal immigration adviser  and stephen k  bannon  the presidents former chief strategist  have also been urging tougher actions under a binary choice policy  which is highly controversial  migrant parents would be given a choice of whether to voluntarily allow their children to be separated from them  or to waive their childs humanitarian protections so the family can be detained together  indefinitely  in jail like conditions  immigration advocates have said the idea is inhumane and would be found illegal by courts ms  nielsen was the head of the department during the trump administrations zero tolerance policy last year that led to the separation of thousands of families  more than 2 700 children were separated from their parents at the border under that policy to prosecute anyone caught crossing the border illegally  even those with families seeking asylum on humanitarian grounds mr  trump eventually relented on the family separations  and a federal judge in california halted them in june  but in january  the inspector general of the department of health and human services reported that thousands more families might have been separated than previously reported while mr  trump has been hampered by the law in his efforts to impose some new enforcement policies  there are certain things he can do without congressional approval those include shutting down ports of entries along the southwestern border and slowing down the process for both illegal and legal immigration last month  he closed american field offices abroad that had helped facilitate immigration applications  mr  trump has also limited the number of people who can request asylum each day through a process known as metering  and he has threatened to shut down traffic lanes and tariff trucks at the ports of entry jonathan meyer  a former deputy general counsel at the department of homeland security  said the trump administration will continue to pursue hard line immigration policies because they are important to the presidents political supporters  who helped fuel mr  trumps success in the 2016 presidential campaign it appears that at times its less important in this administration  whether they lose or win in court  than to just say theyve been able to have done it and have it as a talking point  mr  meyer said  and have an opportunity to criticize the courts if they lose mr  meyer said installing a new secretary at the department will further embolden mr  trump hes willing to move forward and do things even when he knows hes going to be sued for it and when the legality is in question  mr  meyer said  if thats the position you take and if you have people willing to implement that strategy  theres a lot of things you can do  but eventually youre going to be hit with a temporary restraining order mr  grossman said mr  trumps personnel moves were indeed a signal that the administration would embrace aggressive policies  but he added that mr  trump has threatened to enact such policies before  only to back off the president could also be stymied by further court rulings blocking his efforts to crack down on immigrants on monday in california  the judge said in his ruling that in addition to violating immigration laws  the protocols did not include sufficient safeguards to comply with the department of homeland securitys obligation against returning migrants to places where their life or freedom would be threatened immigration advocates hailed the decision  calling it the latest victory in the legal battles with the trump administration that began when the president imposed a travel ban on several predominantly muslim countries just days after taking office in 2017 try as it may  the trump administration cannot simply ignore our laws in order to accomplish its goal of preventing people from seeking asylum in the united states  said judy rabinovitz  the deputy director of the american civil liberties union immigrants rights project  who argued the case the trump administration had negotiated the protocols with the mexican government because of the presidents longstanding anger with so called catch and release policies in which asylum seekers are temporarily released into the united states while they wait for their court hearings the policy of forcing some asylum seekers to wait in mexico was an effort to stop that from happening  but the court ruling means that the president will have to abandon it  at least for the time being .

washington  was this the shutdown to end all shutdowns the answer could be yes  the toll exacted on government operations and federal employees by the record 35 day stalemate  not to mention the political costs to those in the white house and on capitol hill  was so punishing that it is giving momentum to a longstanding call to prohibit the government disruptions that have become a regular facet of washington hardball shutting down the government should be as off limits in budget negotiations as chemical warfare is in real warfare  senator lamar alexander  republican of tennessee  said on friday he was not alone in expressing those sentiments  members of both parties said it was past time to enact legislation that would essentially mean the government would remain open at existing spending levels when an impasse such as the fight over the border wall was reached  rather than shuttering parts or all of the government  thats an outcome that virtually everyone agrees is costly  unnecessary and even embarrassing this never should have happened  said senator lisa murkowski  republican of alaska  speaking for many veterans of past shutdowns have come to learn that there are few  if any  winners in the end and that closing the government has not proved effective as a negotiating strategy for those who use the government as a lever to press their case  it didnt work for newt gingrich in the 1990s  for senator ted cruz of texas and house conservatives in 2013 or for senator chuck schumer of new york and fellow democrats early in 2018 when they relented on a shutdown after just three days government workers are penalized through no fault of their own  constituents are inconvenienced  the nations image is hurt and those responsible for running the government look inept  irresponsible and unwilling to reach an accommodation  the tension in this shutdown was evident in the internal finger pointing that broke out among republicans as workers missed two paychecks and airports began to struggle with the absences of security workers and flight controllers ive said repeatedly throughout this process that government shutdowns are a bad idea  said senator rob portman  republican of ohio  they hurt federal employees and their families  disrupt critical government services and increase the cost to taxpayers  this shutdown confirmed what we already knew about shutdowns  lets do something about it now while the pain and inefficiency of this moment is fresh on our minds mr  portman has for years sponsored legislation to prevent shutdowns  and he introduced the measure again this month as the government limped along partly closed and federal employees lined up for food assistance and other aid under his plan  which has 18 co sponsors and rising  funding at existing levels would continue for agencies covered by an appropriations measure that was not signed into law by the beginning of the fiscal year on oct  1  preventing any lapse that incites a shutdown  to spur a resolution  funding would be reduced by 1 percent after 120 days if no agreement is reached and by 1 percent more every 90 days it is one of these moments where after many years of us trying to get something passed that ends the shutdown  i think there is support coalescing around a legislative response  mr  portman said senator mark warner  the virginia democrat whose state is home to tens of thousands of federal employees and contractors  introduced his own proposal  partly with the idea of shaming his colleagues and the trump administration into avoiding such confrontations searching for a bill title that would deliver the message  he and his staff came up with stop shutdowns transferring unnecessary pain and inflicting damage in the coming years  otherwise known as the stop stupidity act  in the event of funding showdowns  his approach would be to maintain spending for all but the legislative branch and the white house more than a little bit of common sense tells me that we wouldnt be here 35 days into this shutdown if all our staffs were experiencing the same kind of shortfall and economic distress that 800 000 of our fellow federal workers experienced  he said on the senate floor mr  warner acknowledged that his title was somewhat tongue in cheek and that he would be receptive to making changes in the interest of enacting a law that would prevent recurrences of the last weeks the final language in any deal that comes out three weeks from now should put strong provisions and strong penalties in place to prevent this tactic from being used by either party or any white house or congress in the future  he said  a view shared by senator charles e  grassley  republican of iowa the final package should also end government shutdowns once and for all  mr  grassley said in the house  speaker nancy pelosi also welcomed the idea on friday  saying in a meeting with news columnists that she wanted to explore the possibility of legislation that would serve as a shutdown prevention act despite widespread sentiment against shutdowns in congress  there could be opposition  some lawmakers might not want to surrender potential leverage in the spending wars  there could be resistance from others who dont like the concept of automatic spending authorization  arguing that it gives up a fundamental power of congress  democrats have feared that automatic spending cuts could be a backdoor way for republicans to cut money for federal programs  president trump might be reluctant to sign a bill that includes such provisions  though he has now experienced such backlash to the shutdown and might prefer another way to circumvent congress  such as declaring a national emergency to build the wall if negotiations fall through congress will still have its opportunities for brinkmanship such as the need to raise the debt limit  though house democrats have already taken steps to make that more automatic as well  in an attempt to reduce the threat to economic stability  and eliminate a politically charged vote whether they can succeed remains to be seen  but mr  portman  mr  alexander and others said they were determined over the next three weeks to press the case for permanent protection against shutdowns we accepted the idea that shutting down the government is an acceptable bargaining chip in a budget negotiation and it should never  ever be  and we should resolve that that should never  ever happen  mr  alexander said .
hi  welcome to on politics  your guide to the day in national politics  im lisa lerer  your host  get on politics delivered to your inbox  o k   brace yourself  we might just be having a moment in politics this week no  im not talking about beto orourke  the telegenic former texas congressman whose newly launched presidential campaign prompted wall to wall media coverage today im talking about whats been happening in congress a quick catch up  today  a dozen republicans in the senate voted with democrats to reject president trumps declaration of a national emergency to secure funding for his border wall  their rebuke comes just hours after the house  in an overwhelming  bipartisan  420 0 vote  backed a resolution urging the justice department to publicly release the special counsels report on russian interference in the 2016 election  and it comes a day after the senate voted to end support for the saudi led war in yemen  an effort seen as a reproach of the presidents defense of the kingdom after the killing of the journalist jamal khashoggi practically  this all means very little  the house resolution cannot force the justice department to release more of the report  and mr  trump has made it clear that he will veto the other two measures  a step his opponents dont have the numbers to override in the senate but politically  the trifecta of rejections tells us that mr  trumps grip on congressional republicans may be loosening  the political ground may be ever so slightly shifting  and with it  the control mr  trump has over his party as weve written before  the president remains overwhelmingly popular with his base  there is no groundswell of anti trump sentiment in the republican party  two of the most vulnerable republican senators  thom tillis of north carolina and cory gardner of colorado  stuck with the president   mr  tillis flipped his position after talks with the white house and rumblings of a primary challenge  republican defectors stress that their opposition is not personal but institutional  spending money and declaring war are foundational powers assigned in the constitution to congress  by ceding to the president the right to declare a national emergency  theyd essentially be weakening their own power  and their leverage for the next negotiation with the white house i believe the use of emergency powers in this circumstance violates the constitution  said senator jerry moran  republican of kansas  in a statement written on lined paper and published on twitter but its also important to look at these votes in context of this political moment  the white house is under siege from congressional investigations  and the special counsel report is looming  mr  trumps approval ratings hover around 40 percent with the 2020 campaign well underway  some republicans may be calibrating their views for their own re election races in purple states  others  like senators ted cruz and marco rubio  may be imagining a post trump political world we dont know exactly how mr  trump  a man who deeply values loyalty  will handle this type of rebuke from his own party  its awfully hard not to picture him taking it personally in the past  mr  trump has gleefully taken credit for retiring critics like former senator jeff flake and republican house members who rejected the embrace of the white house  losses that cost his party control of the house but he may find that theres some power in numbers  targeting a pack of a dozen republicans is harder than picking off a few strays  sign up here to get on politics

hope he sinks slowly in the west who cares why beto orourke spent the last several months on the road  any effect on his family is between him and his family  wrote anne  she said her concern was with

campaigning and dont hold against him being male and running for office in that way  wrote karen  who described herself as a veteran political activist  the one thing which beto has that no other

good morning  heres the sign up  if you dont already get california today by email  xavier becerra  californias attorney general  has already sued the trump administration more than 40 times  positioning himself on the front lines of the golden states resistance to the presidents policies yesterday  he added another big lawsuit to the tally mr  becerra  along with his counterparts in 15 other states  challenged president trumps plan to declare a national emergency in order to access billions more dollars for a border wall than congress had granted him president trump treats the rule of law with utter contempt  mr  becerra said in a statement announcing that the suit had been filed in federal district court in san francisco  he knows there is no border crisis  he knows his emergency declaration is unwarranted  and he admits that he will likely lose this case in court its a fight that could have major constitutional ramifications  and california is playing a central role heres what else you need to know about the suit its not clear whether any of the fencing president trump seeks to build would be in california  and it definitely wont be built in some of the other states that have joined the lawsuit  like new york or hawaii  so what specific harm gives california the right to sue over it mr  becerra told my colleagues that california and the other states have standing because residents of those states could lose funding that they paid for with their tax dollars  money that was destined for drug interdiction or for the department of defense for military men and women and military installations  if mr  trump gets his way in his statement  mr  becerra described president trumps move as unilaterally robbing taxpayer funds lawfully set aside by congress still  its a really complicated situation  experts say the success of the lawsuit will most likely come down to legal questions like which entities have the standing to sue in the first place  rather than questions about whats actually happening on the border is this lawsuit the only challenge to president trumps action not even close  the trump administration is facing a wave of lawsuits that have rolled in since the president announced his plans last week  and congress is on a separate track to challenge the emergency declaration  which could include another lawsuit where is gov  gavin newsom in all this hes enthusiastically onboard with the lawsuit  in a statement sent out by mr  becerras office yesterday  mr  newsom echoed the language he used in his state of the state address last week rather than focusing on fighting the real vulnerabilities facing americans  the president is using the powers of americas highest office to fan the flames of nativism and xenophobia  mr  newsom said in the statement  our message to the white house is clear  california will not be part of this political theater  read the full story about the lawsuit here   we often link to content on

among the casualties of president trumps declaration of a national emergency to build his border wall is the reputation of the majority leader mitch mcconnell as a senate institutionalist  the evidence of the last few days has confirmed  if there were still any doubt  that he is no such thing  first  he helped prolong the longest government shutdown in american history by insisting that the senate would act only with explicit approval from the president  now mr  mcconnell has fully acquiesced in president trumps power grab by supporting an emergency declaration  which he opposed just weeks before  aimed at addressing a crisis that senate republicans know does not exist  this display of obedience from the leader of a supposedly coequal branch of government is shocking only if you ever believed mr  mcconnell was an institutionalist  but his defining characteristic has always been his willingness to do anything and sacrifice any principle to amass power for himself  what separates him from the garden variety politicians  what makes him a radical  are the lengths he is willing to go  seeing this with clarity should help us grasp the danger to which he is subjecting the senate  and  more important  our democracy the signs of mr  mcconnells malign influence were always there  before he became a senate leader  he dedicated himself to opening the floodgates for corporate money to flow into our political system  mr  mcconnell chased the mccain feingold campaign finance reform law all the way to the supreme court  the 2003 challenge to the law bears his name  mr  mcconnell lost that one  but his cause prevailed six years later when the supreme court overturned restrictions on corporate contributions in citizens united  in 2010  as minority leader  mr  mcconnell stated that his main goal was not to help our country recover from the great recession but to make president obama a one term president  a self declared proud guardian of gridlock  he presided over an enormous escalation in the use of the filibuster  his innovation was to transform it from a procedural tool used to block bills into a weapon of nullification  deploying it against even routine senate business to gridlock the legislative process the two forces that characterized mr  mcconnells career  obstruction and increasing the power of corporate money in our democracy  have worked hand in hand to diminish the senate and paralyze american politics  the flood of outside money incentivized obstruction over cooperation  and a new generation of republicans embraced mr  mcconnells obstructionist tactics  senator ted cruz of texas  for example  owes his standing to a few filibusters and a super pac  as a freshman senator  he used mr  mcconnells tactics to shut down the government in 2013 and parlayed the resulting attention  and fund raising  to run for president  and lose to mr  trump  republicans actually took the senate majority in 2014 in large part on claims to restore the senate  unsurprisingly  they broke their promises  under president trump  mr  mcconnell continued to run roughshod over senate traditions  jamming the  1 5 trillion tax bill through without so much as a proper hearing  the one place the senate has functioned efficiently is in judicial confirmations  but even here mr  mcconnell has cast aside bipartisan norms and reduced the senate to a rubber stamp for some unqualified  extremist judges  including those rated unqualified by the american bar association mr  mcconnell is not playing three dimensional chess  there is no grand strategy or long game  there is only what best serves his narrow interest  and since 2010  mr  mcconnell has been convinced that his interests are best served through strict obedience to the republican base  that year  his handpicked candidate  trey grayson  lost a senate republican primary in kentucky to an insurgent named rand paul  it was a humiliating defeat and called into question mr  mcconnells power in his own backyard  it also invited a tea party challenge against his re election in 2014 since that scare  mr  mcconnell has rigidly adhered to whatever the base wants  institutions be damned  when the base wanted judge merrick garland blocked  he obeyed  when the base wanted mr  trump embraced  he obeyed  while paul ryan was playing hamlet in the summer of 2016  mr  mcconnell quickly endorsed mr  trump  providing institutional cover and repeatedly assuring republicans that mr  trump would be fine  mr  mcconnell didnt think mr  trump was going to win  he has said so himself but he probably figured that the damage could be contained the crass self interest at so many turns now poses a danger to our democracy  with mr  trump increasingly erratic and robert muellers investigation advancing  there is simply no reason to believe he will stand up for american institutions when it counts  he has already demonstrated a willingness to put his self interest above americas national security  in a classified briefing in 2016  mr  mcconnell reportedly cast doubt on c i a  intelligence about russias interference in our election and threatened that if president obama publicly challenged russia  hed twist it into a partisan issue  and when the four congressional leaders drafted a bipartisan letter to the states urging them to take action to protect our election infrastructure against russian interference  mr  mcconnell categorically rejected all efforts to strengthen the letter last week  mr  mcconnell had a choice  he didnt have to acquiesce to the emergency declaration  he could have asserted the senates independence at a critical time by passing the spending bill without validating mr  trumps emergency declaration  if that prompted a veto  mr  mcconnell could have overridden it  that would be real leadership  and a clear assertion of the senates independence  instead  he meekly acquiesced in another presidential power grab in the months ahead  our institutions are likely to be tested as rarely before  under a strong leader  the senate could provide a critical counterweight to an out of control executive  instead  we have a man who will put his self interest first  every single time  we should enter this chapter with clarity and finally see mr  mcconnell for what he is  hes not an institutionalist  he is the man who surrendered the senate to donald trump .
on thursday morning  commerce secretary wilbur ross  a man whose extraordinarily shady financial history doesnt get the attention it deserves  appeared on cnbcs squawk box to talk about the government shutdown  he expressed bafflement at the idea of unpaid federal workers suffering financial hardship  wondering why they dont just take out loans  there really is not a good excuse why there really should be a liquidity crisis  he said  true  the people might have to pay a little bit of interest  but the idea that its paycheck or zero is not a really valid idea  told that some workers have been relying on food banks  he said  i know they are  and i dont really quite understand why a few hours later  larry kudlow  director of donald trumps national economic council  told reporters that federal employees forced to work without pay were volunteering  he added  as he stumbled to clarify  that theyre doing it out of their love of country and presumably their allegiance to president trump   if they dont work they can be fired  these officials comments were just the latest examples of the blithe let them eat steel slats attitude that people connected to this administration are showing toward victims of the shutdown  on monday  lara trump  the presidents daughter in law and the host of an online pseudo newscast funded by his re election campaign  said that the sacrifices of unpaid federal workers are a small price to pay for a border wall  its not fair to you and we all get that  she said in an interview  but this is so much bigger than any one person  listen to the argument podcast every thursday morning  with ross douthat  michelle goldberg and david leonhardt  in an interview that aired two weeks ago on pbs  kevin hassett  the chairman of the council of economic advisers  suggested that furloughed workers were fortunate not to have to use vacation days over the christmas holidays  and then they come back  and then they get their back pay  then theyre  in some sense  theyre better off  he said trump himself has been unable to feign empathy for the 800 000 federal employees who havent been paid in more than a month  or the hundreds of thousands of government contractors who likely wont be paid at all  earlier this month he retweeted a daily caller piece  ostensibly by an anonymous member of his own administration  arguing that the work of most federal employees is worthless  we do not want most employees to return  because we are working better without them  it said  on thursday afternoon  trump told reporters that grocery stores will work along with people who cant pay for food one effect of this government shutdown  now in its second month and without immediate end in sight  is to reveal the sham of trumps purported populism  its true  hes able to connect culturally with some economically precarious parts of america  despite being expensively educated  his worldview is basically that of archie bunker  he eats fast food  likes pro wrestling and has the terrible taste in interior design common to arriviste dictators  his vulgarity creates a kinship with people who purport to hate elites yet in purely financial terms  trump is as elitist as they come  though he campaigned as a candidate of  white  workers  he has governed as a shameless oligarch  he has proudly surrounded himself with millionaires and billionaires  seeing their wealth as evidence of their worth  at a rally in 2017  speaking of his economic advisers  he said  but in those particular positions  i just dont want a poor person  he has gone out of his way not to hire anyone who would actually understand the plight of the workers hes holding hostage contrary to rosss assumptions  its not easy for working people without significant collateral to walk into a bank and get a personal loan  i dont think a bank is going to lend to them  or it would be very difficult  mark zandi  chief economist of moodys analytics  told me  to think that credit is the way out for these government workers is at best a real stretch some workers are members of credit unions  some of which are offering low interest loans  those who own homes might be able to borrow against them  others  however  will be forced to rely on credit cards  which can charge double digit interest rates  and then  worst of all  some will resort to payday loans  which can trap people in an asphyxiating cycle of debt gary rivlin  author of broke  usa  from pawnshops to poverty  inc   how the working poor became big business  explained to me how payday loans usually work  if you take  for example  a  400 loan  two weeks later youll owe  460  if the government is still shut down  you take out a  500 loan to pay back the  460  and now you owe  575  he said  some online outfits charge even higher interest as people miss payments on their bills  the financial aftershocks could stay with them long after the government reopens  assuming it eventually does  diane standaert of the nonprofit center for responsible lending says theres a risk of long term devastation to peoples financial security  a missed rent payment or bill can damage someones credit report for years  which in turn can make it harder to get a mortgage or rent an apartment  some employers even check applicants credit history when making hiring decisions ordinarily  one might expect a presidential administrations leading economic figures to understand something of these financial realities  but if they cared about people who arent rich  they wouldnt be working for trump in the first place  the shocking thing isnt their indifference to the misery theyre causing  its that they can barely be bothered to hide it .

noted  one in five people surveyed admitted to buying from an unlicensed source in the last three months  i think theres a lot of focus on getting consumers into the legal market  he said part of that will certainly involve tailoring products especially to new consumers  who may not have been willing to try out cannabis when it wasnt legal  so who are those new customers  here are some of the stats from eazes report  which was based on data from 450 000 buyers and about 4 000 survey respondents thats how much the number of baby boomer  or age 50 or older  consumers grew last year  making them one of the fastest growing demographics for cannabis use thats how much baby boomers spent each month  on average  the most of any age demographic   by comparison  generation x ers spent  89 24  millennials spent  72 94 and members of generation z spent  62 35   millennials are still the biggest group of eaze customers  though thats the percentage of cannabis consumers who are women  mr

the right side of historyhow reason and moral purpose made the west greatby ben shapiroclear and present safety the world has never been better and why that matters to americans by michael a  cohen and micah zenkowhy  exactly  are so many americans so angry and unhappy  almost any other country today  and any prior version of the united states  would give its eyeteeth to enjoy our manifold blessings  the country is prosperous and at peace  it faces rivals and nuisances but no major threat  the government acted decisively and capably to crush jihadist terrorism and avert a global depression  innovation is galloping  crime is down  kids are behaving  and  the ultimate gift  americans live almost a decade longer than as recently as 1960  president obama was just plain right when he wrote  in 2016  if you had to choose any time in the course of human history to be alive  youd choose this one  right here in america  right now yet  right here in america  populist rage and illiberal backlash are seizing the day  why  two new books approach the question  one of them constructively  the other not so much  the right side of history looks to the politics of meaning  clear and present safety  the politics of fear remember the politics of meaning  that was the theme of a speech given by hillary clinton in april 1993  when she was the first lady  all of us face a crisis of meaning  she said  we need a new definition of civil society which answers the unanswerable questions posed by both the market forces and the governmental ones  conservatives  and some liberals  made merciless sport of that speech  no one in those end of history days was in the mood to listen well  they are listening now  competition  consumerism and globalization worked out much better for some people than others  and the others  who saw their incomes stagnate  their dignified livelihoods evaporate and their communities wither  decided not to go quietly into that good night  in response  some of the best minds on the right are rethinking reaganism and grappling with the need to humanize neoliberalism into this conversation steps ben shapiro with the right side of history  a conservative writer and speaker whose previous books include bullies  how the lefts culture of fear and intimidation silences americans and brainwashed  how universities indoctrinate americas youth  shapiro begins by saying that we live in the best world that has ever existed  yet americans are losing faith in their democracy and institutions  what changed  in a few introductory paragraphs  he dismisses economics  racial tensions and tribalism as inadequate answers  instead  weve spent the last two centuries carving ourselves off from the roots of our civilization  beginning with the jewish bible and ancient greece  he argues that western civilization succeeded because it balanced the anchoring moral foundations of its judeo christian heritage with the revolutionary dynamism of enlightenment liberalism  in the past couple of centuries  however  secularism has gone all in on individualism and materialism  material human progress in the absence of spiritual fulfillment isnt enough  he writes  people need meaning  mrs  clinton  call your office shapiros spiritual challenge to secularism is not new  in fact  it is venerable  as the liberal traditions most astute contemporary defender  peter berkowitz  often points out  the charge that liberal individualism is self destructively materialistic is itself an important strand of the liberal tradition  today and in the recent past  its many facets have been explored and debated by some of the rights leading minds  david brooks  arthur c  brooks  patrick j  deneen  yuval levin  alasdair macintyre  richard john neuhaus  michael novak and the three most recent popes  to name just a few  shapiros argument claims a distinguished pedigree why  then  did i find his book so dispiriting  partly because  instead of contending with great ideas  it deploys them as if they were toy soldiers or characters in a video game  the head spins as he trots past thinkers from plato to steven pinker  frequently rendering tendentious judgments along the way  in one typical four page passage  we carom past marx  clausewitz  fichte and hegel  most of the name checked play either the role of tradition upholding good guys or relativistic  secular bad guys  hume leads briskly to darwin  then nietzsche  then eugenics and fascism and existentialism and postmodernism and intersectionality  and here we are  kowtowing to the knowing falsehood of transgenderism although i am sympathetic with elements of the authors case  his galloping reductionism left me enervated and wishing his short book were even shorter  but one section is too short  if western civilization hangs in the balance  how do we save it  in a concluding chapter of only eight pages  shapiro urges that children be taught that life has purpose  that they have agency  that our civilization is unique and that we are all brothers and sisters  in this way  with boldness and sacrifice  parents will make warriors of our own children  training them as defenders of the only civilization worth fighting for pondering shapiros call for fresh recruits in a never ending culture war  i found myself wondering what sort of book he might have written had he sought out and contended with the real world puzzles and contradictions and trade offs that would complicate his story line  as david brooks and timothy p  carney and oren cass and james and deborah fallows and george packer and j  d  vance  among others  have done  may we hope that someday shapiro will leaven his combativeness with curiosity clear and present safety is less ambitious and more constructive  michael a  cohen and micah zenko  who are columnists for the boston globe and foreign policy magazine  respectively  write that americans live in a world that is safer and freer than ever before in human history  and it is not even close  yet most americans are simply unaware of the extraordinary and unprecedented political  economic and social progress that has taken place in virtually every corner of the globe over the past three decades the closest thing america has to a national ideology today may be neurotic safetyism  the doctrine that the countrys children and college students and homeland are fragile and besieged by danger  leaving helicopter parenting and campus safe spaces to others  the authors focus on the exaggerated fear of foreign threats and terrorism  the american public is being fed  by politicians and pundits alike  a steady diet of threat inflation that has made them deeply fearful of the world outside their borders  they write  fearmongering builds power for politicians and pundits  profits for media companies and defense contractors and publicity for social activists and reformers  the harms include swollen defense budgets  counterproductive military interventions  wasted resources  think  border wall  and demagoguerys toll on democracy itself this argument  too  is not new  in his book overblown  how politicians and the terrorism industry inflate national security threats  and why we believe them  john mueller  of ohio state university  has written indispensably about threat inflation  and so have others  but cohen and zenko march through the evidence commandingly and comprehensively  and their case has never been more apt and important than it is right now  when a professional fearmonger leads the country  recall president trumps inaugural address  with its theme of american carnage  or his first speech to a joint session of congress  when he lied point blank about immigrant terrorism  or any of a thousand other examples next time you hear the words existential threat from a politician  hide the silver  the greater threat to american safety is demagogic safetyism  or  as another american president said in much harder times  fear itself .
washington  the white houses announcement thursday that president trump would claim emergency powers to build his border wall without congressional approval was a way out of the political crisis he created over shutting down the government  but while the move means the country will avoid another protracted shutdown  legal specialists warned that the long term costs to american democracy could be steep as a matter of political reality  such a declaration permits mr  trump to keep the government open without losing face with his core supporters by surrendering to congressional democrats on his signature issue  as a matter of legal reality  the proposal is likely to be bogged down in a court challenge  leaving any actual construction work based on emergency powers spending an uncertain and  at best  distant prospect but no matter what else happens  mr  trumps willingness to invoke emergency powers to circumvent congress is likely to go down as an extraordinary violation of constitutional norms  setting a precedent that future presidents of both parties may emulate to unilaterally achieve their own policy goals this is a real institutional threat to the separation of powers to use emergency powers to enable the president to bypass congress to build a wall on his own initiative that our elected representatives have chosen not to fund  said william c  banks  a syracuse university law professor who is the co author of a 1994 book about tensions between the executive and legislative branches over security and spending  national security law and the power of the purse it sets a precedent that a president can  without regard to an actual existence of an emergency  use this tool to evade the normal democratic process and fund projects on his own  he added emergency powers statutes are laws enacted by congress that permit the president  upon declaring the existence of a national crisis  to take steps that would normally be forbidden by law  the idea is to allow the executive branch to move quickly in exigent circumstances while presidents in the modern era have declared dozens of emergencies to address various problems  none has been remotely as disputed as the one mr  trump is contemplating  mr  banks said he had found no examples of a lawsuit in which someone tried to challenge the factual basis for a presidents determination that an emergency existed  leaving scant guideposts for what courts might do with any legal challenge legal specialists have pointed to several statutes that permit the executive branch to redirect military construction funds in a declared emergency that the trump administration may invoke  one such law  for example  permits the secretary of defense  in an emergency  to begin military construction projects not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces another permits the army to halt civil works projects during a declared emergency  using the freed up resources to help construct authorized civil works  military construction and civil defense projects that are essential to the national defense the administration may seek to couple that statute with separate laws to claim congress has already authorized various border barriers still  none of those laws are a perfect fit  specialists say  raising technical disputes that will give litigants plenty to argue about in court  but a more fundamental question for what kind of historical precedent mr  trumps move establishes is whether courts will even allow themselves to address whether it is true  as a matter of fact  that a national emergency exists on the border that a wall would resolve critics note that the number of people crossing the border illegally is far lower than it was a generation ago  the relatively new phenomenon of caravans of migrants consists largely of families who present themselves to border officials and request asylum  rather than trying to go deeper into the interior on their own  most illegal drugs are smuggled in through ports of entry  and there has been no instance in the modern era of a terrorist attack on domestic soil that was committed by someone who sneaked in across the southern border with mexico still  the justice department would surely argue that courts should not even consider the facts  but instead should defer to the presidents determination that an emergency exists  there is a long history of courts being reluctant to substitute their own thinking for the presidents in security matters  or declaring that it is a political question for the two politically elected branches to work out between themselves congress enacted the main umbrella law that has governed how and when presidents may invoke emergency power statutes  the national emergencies act of 1976  during the era of post watergate overhaul at the time  while bestowing broad discretion on presidents to decide whether an emergency existed  lawmakers also created a powerful check and balance against abuse  congress could end the declared emergency if majorities in both chambers voted for a resolution to do so  to keep a presidents partisan allies from bottling up such a measure  the law says that if one chamber passed such a resolution  the other one must bring it up for a vote within 18 days house democrats have made clear they will pass such a resolution if mr  trump declares a border emergency  forcing senate republicans to take a stand on whether his move is legitimate  while senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  said on thursday that he would support mr  trump  it would take only a handful of republican senators to break ranks for the resolution to pass anyway but that check and balance mechanism was severely eroded by a 1983 supreme court ruling  it held that to have legal effect  a congressional resolution must be presented to the president for signature or veto  like bills are  the next year  lawmakers revised the emergencies act to replace its call for the type of resolution that takes effect immediately with the kind that a president can veto because it takes the votes of two thirds of each chamber to override a presidential veto  that change has made it far harder  as a matter of political math  for lawmakers to block a dubious emergency declaration  as a result  even if the senate does initially approve such a resolution  congress is unlikely to override mr  trumps certain veto of it if most republican members stick with him against that backdrop  elizabeth goitein  who oversaw a recent study of presidential emergency powers for the brennan center for justice at new york university school of law  said that mr  trumps move  if he indeed followed through  would be an abuse of power and set a precedent that risked making it open season for presidents to cynically claim that a national emergency existed to evade democratic constraints every time this president does something that would have been unthinkable under a previous administration  and every time he acts in a way were used to seeing in an authoritarian regime  a little piece of our democracy dies  and this is a pretty big piece  she said  i know what the potential is for these laws to be abused once that seal is broken .
washington  immigrant advocates denounced it as cruel  the conservative right howled that it was amnesty what president trump billed on saturday as a compromise to end the countrys longest government shutdown pleased neither the democratic congressional leaders whose buy in he needs to strike a deal nor the core supporters whose backing has always been at the heart of his insistence on a border wall instead  in offering temporary protections for about one million immigrants at risk of deportation in exchange for funding for a wall  mr  trump did something rarely seen during his presidency  he tried to reach beyond his base of supporters  which polls have begun to show is losing patience with him as the partial shutdown drags into its fifth week  and speak to a broader swath of americans the saturday afternoon speech from the west wing was an attempt by mr  trump to  at the very least  shift the narrative of the past several weeks and show that rather than spoiling for a longer shutdown fight or making unreasonable demands  he was looking for a broadly acceptable way out of a morass he once boasted he was proud to wade into i think you could tell by the presidents remarks today  vice president mike pence said  that were reaching out yet in seeking to inch toward the center  mr  trump alienated portions of his hard right base  the core supporters he most depends on and the group he and his closest aides have most feared losing  that raised the possibility that  in his zeal to get out of an intractable situation  he may have landed himself in the worst of all worlds  without a clear solution or the support of his most ardent followers  read  trumps deal meets with skepticism among immigrants in texas the tensions and anger over the policy have been quietly playing out in the west wing as well  as jared kushner  the presidents son in law and senior adviser  fended off stephen miller  the architect of much of mr  trumps immigration agenda  mr  kushner has long been a proponent of protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the united states as children  while mr  miller has pressed for aggressive measures to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration in recent days  as white house officials had been working out the details of the compromise  mr  miller intervened to narrow the universe of immigrants who would receive protection  according to people familiar with the internal discussions who described them on the condition of anonymity while the original idea had been to include protections for as many as 1 8 million undocumented immigrants eligible for deferred action for childhood arrivals  the obama era program known as daca that protected those illegally brought to the united states as children  mr  trump ultimately proposed shielding only the 700 000 who are enrolled mr  kushner conceded in a briefing after the presidents speech that he did not see the proposal as a solution for the daca program  which mr  trump moved to rescind in 2017 at this moment in time  mr  kushner said  this is a good path forward many conservatives did not share that view trump proposes amnesty  the conservative commentator ann coulter said on twitter  we voted for trump and got jeb  she added  referring to jeb bush  who challenged mr  trump for the republican nomination in 2016 and supported a broad immigration overhaul that would have given undocumented immigrants a path to legal status still  in the eyes of many white house officials  the prospect that mr  trump could use the proposal to shift blame for the shutdown and pressure democrats to end the impasse was worth trying  mr  pence argued on saturday that the speech was a sincere effort by mr  trump to break the logjam  and he and other white house officials suggested that the measure could attract enough support to succeed from centrist democrats fed up with the shutdown and willing to side with republicans but such a coalition did not appear to be forming  and courting one bears considerable risk for a president who is most comfortable when he is defying convention  eschewing compromise and being hailed as a hero by supporters who often equate bipartisan deal making with weak kneed capitulation the vast majority of democrats knocked the approach  while many of them have pressed for measures to protect daca recipients and immigrants living in the united states under temporary protected status enacted when their countries were destabilized by war or catastrophe  most regard the proposal he put forth on saturday as woefully inadequate  it offers only three years of protections for the daca recipients and those who hold t p s   which the trump administration has also moved to end for several countries this is not an amnesty bill  mr  pence said  there is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal that was high on speaker nancy pelosis list of reasons to call the plan unacceptable that is unlikely to matter to the president  despite saying publicly last month that he would be proud to own a shutdown over the wall  and privately displaying confidence that his base would stick with him through the fight  mr  trump has been dismayed to find otherwise in recent days an npr poll released last week showed mr  trumps approval ratings down and the first cracks in backing among critical supporters  including whites without a college education and white evangelicals such pressure from what he has called the forgotten men and women who elected him and chant build  the  wall  at his arena rallies has swayed mr  trump before  including last year  when the conservative news site breitbart branded him amnesty don for considering a similar deal that would have provided  25 billion in wall funding for a path to legal status for those the daca program was created to help  the president ultimately abandoned that agreement  concerned about angering his base and after mr  miller and others advised him he should insist on additional immigration restrictions on saturday night  breitbart panned mr  trumps latest idea with the headline three year amnesty  most of border remains open .

washington  president trump has latched on to the idea of using steel to build his wall along the southern border  praising himself for fulfilling two campaign promises at once  keeping out illegal immigrants and resuscitating a struggling industry they were doing very poorly when i took office  and now theyre doing very well  mr  trump said of american steel makers before boarding marine one this month  our steel industry was dying  and now its very vibrant but in the 10 months since the trump administration imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel imports  prices in the united states have now fallen back to levels last seen before the tariffs were announced on march 1 hiring in the steel sector remains stagnant  in part because new mills have become more reliant on automation  even with the opening and restarting of several mills last year  direct steel industry employment was 146 300 as of november  4 percent lower than it was four years ago  according to the american iron and steel institute  industry analysts estimate that steel companies made 50 announcements of plans for new mills and investments last year and that three dozen plants were built or restarted investors are increasingly wary about the industrys long term strength  stock prices for some of the nations biggest steel manufacturers dropped by as much as 47 percent in 2018 amid fears of slowing global economic growth and the potential for mr  trump to reach trade deals that remove the tariffs we fully expect the players in the steel supply chain to have weaker years in 2019  said philip gibbs  a metals analyst at keybanc in ohio the trump administration imposed sweeping steel and aluminum tariffs on trading partners like europe  canada  japan and mexico  saying it was trying to protect american security by preventing a flood of cheap metals into the united states  the tariffs  which went fully into effect in june  initially goosed steel prices in the united states  which jumped more than 50 percent after it became clear that the tariffs would really be put in place mr  trump has routinely pointed to the rising prices as a boon to american steel companies  but the price spike ultimately hurt demand as industries that rely on the metal  like automakers and homebuilders  struggled to absorb the rising costs or passed them on to customers caterpillar  the farm equipment manufacturer  said last year that it would face  200 million in additional costs because of the steel tariffs  general motors slashed its profits forecast for 2018 because of higher steel costs  many businesses chose alternative materials or delayed investments  putting pressure on steel prices  which have since fallen according to s p global platts  prices for american made hot rolled coil steel  the industry benchmark  jumped 41 percent in the first half of 2018 and then fell about 21 percent from that peak in the second half of the year  that trend is likely to continue this year steel prices remain under pressure to begin 2019  said michael fitzgerald  a metals pricing specialist at s p global platts  typical seasonal improvements following the slower holiday period are yet to take hold as domestic steel buyers no longer fear a supply crunch american businesses and trade groups have repeatedly urged the trump administration to remove the tariffs  arguing they hurt domestic companies  not competitors  and will ultimately undercut economic growth tariffs are taxes paid for by american families and american businesses  not foreigners  said thomas j  donohue  the president of the u s  chamber of commerce american steel makers are feeling the pressure  despite strong earnings in 2018  the stock prices of steel companies have been in a deep slump as investors fret that they are being propped up by government support that will be temporary  in the last year  shares of ak steel are down 56 percent  us steel is down 46 percent  steel dynamics is down 29 percent and nucors stock is down 18 percent john j  ferriola  the chief executive of nucor  said that the falling stock price is head scratching because he believes that the industry is on solid footing  while mr  trumps tariffs have provided a tailwind  a strong economy  tax cuts and anti dumping measures put in place by the obama administration have revived the steel industry  mr  ferriola said theres a lot of doomsday talk about the tariffs and a lot of misinformation  mr  ferriola said in an interview  i keep hearing about how it is driving down demand and putting our customers out of business  we had a record year last year  and many of our customers also had a record year nucor announced last week that it plans to build a  1 35 billion steel plant in the midwest  however  trade experts and steel analysts worry the additional capacity could drive down steel prices even further and question whether such projects will eventually be scrapped if the economy cools a key for the industry will be improving efficiency while the insulation from the tariffs remains historically the u s  steel industry has received a tremendous amount of trade protection over the last 40 years in different forms  said chad bown  a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics  the issue is that during the periods that they do receive protection  they dont historically tend to invest in becoming more efficient and more competitive in the near term  the steel industrys best hopes for a meaningful lift would be mr  trump and congress joining forces on major infrastructure legislation that would keep americas steel mills churning with such movement unlikely amid partisan gridlock in washington  some are hanging their hopes on the possibility of a border wall built with steel slats or  as mr  trump recently suggested  steel that has concrete inside  according to an analysis conducted by the american iron and steel institute  the industrys lobbying group  an all steel barrier along the border could consume as much as three million tons of steel if they decide to build a barrier and decide to make it out of steel  the industry stands ready and capable and more than able to provide the steel and assist in the construction  mr  ferriola said .

minneapolis  the artists at theater 55 believe that  in its way  their staging of hair is just as subversive as the original production that thrilled and shocked audiences a half century ago its not that the anti establishment rock musical is newly resonant in a deeply polarized country  or that this rendition adds an improvised divertimento about border walls midway through the first act  its the casting  claude  the restive leader of a tribe of free love hippies  is 53  the irreverent berger is 59  woof  who sings the praises of all things carnal  is 71 this joyful staging is the first by theater 55  a new twin cities company that celebrates elders as artists  and it requires more than an average suspension of disbelief  the 26 member cast singing about the age of aquarius is distinct for its abundance of unapologetic wrinkles  dad bods and artificial joints  when the men wax ecstatic about their shining  gleaming  streaming locks  its hard not to notice the receding hairlines and hair thats more salt and pepper than flaxen and waxen and that  they might tell you  is the point were not trying to pretend that were twentysomethings  said brent berheim  who works for a minneapolis financial services company by day but will complete the last of 11 performances this weekend as claude  yes  the show is about youth  but its also about an environment and a time  were trying to see if the audience is willing to let go of superficialities richard hitchler  theater 55s founder  spent 20 years running a company producing plays by and for children in st  paul  when his research told him that baby boomers are a significant proportion of theater audiences but a fraction of those working on the stage  he mulled starting a new company to fill the void bicycling past the minnesota history center one day and noticing a banner promoting the 1968 exhibit cemented both the idea for the theater and its inaugural production  tams witmark  which licenses the show  had no problems with the nontraditional approach  so the 53 year old director and his collaborators scraped together a modest  46 000 budget  rented a theater and crossed their fingers  whats new onstage and off  sign up for our theater update newsletter  like his youthful performers  the hair cast has varying levels of stage experience  some have plied the community theater circuit for years or have music or dance credits  some had never before been onstage  one wasnt certain how an audition worked whether theyre youth or older  mr  hitchler observed  theres still the same insecurities  the same questions and the same sense that if you open your mind and your being to new adventure  youre going to learn something  and were never done learning one thing the company has learned since rehearsals started the monday after thanksgiving is that the show still has the ability to touch a nerve  mr  berheim tells of some cast members choking up rehearsing a scene in which his character agonizes over burning his draft card  angela walbergs father  who served in vietnam  cant bring himself to watch his daughter perform the lead female role of sheila  which would remind him of returning home after the war and being called a baby killer for rod kleiss  the septuagenarian who plays woof  hair has resurrected long forgotten memories  in 1968  he was in the navy  stationed near san francisco  he credits experiences in the haight ashbury neighborhood  the epicenter of the hippie movement  for his eventual decision to seek conscientious objector status i almost didnt audition  mr  kleiss said  i watched some youtube videos and i saw so much strutting around by these cocksure young guys  but were old  we dont have that focus  for us  this show is about something else in the argot of hair  the company has become a tribe  one with a purpose  at 73  melba hensel is the oldest member of the cast  after taking a 38 year break from performing  following high school theater and a career as an engineer  she returned to the stage in 2004 and is a regular in her suburbs community theater productions but  she said  unless my husband is involved  im 20 to 30 years older than anyone else in those shows  here  im only a couple years older brenda starr  70  shook off a heart attack a month before opening night to appear in the show  ms  starr lived through the civil rights movement and sees theater 55s work as another front in the battle for social justice were making a statement  she said  were not willing to accept the status quo and the social constructs about aging  were not people to be put away or dismissed hair infatuated critics when it opened on broadway in 1968  and cover versions of songs from its score  like aquarius and good morning starshine  became staples on the radio away from new york  some audiences were taken aback by the musicals language and frank depiction of sexuality  but over time  the show became a modern classic  the 2009 broadway revival was a tony winner  and the public theater  where hair had its first performances  gave a party for the shows 50th anniversary  nbc announced a 2019 live telecast of the musical  but those plans were scrapped this week at theater 55  hair has sold out many performances in the 140 seat space in the cedar riverside neighborhood  which  abutting the west bank campus of the university of minnesota  was a counterculture hub in the 1960s  mr  hitchler tells stories of veterans groups tearing up and crowds rising to their feet  joining the company to sing let the sunshine in at the shows end that gives him hope that theater 55 could grow beyond its initial production  toward a future that would involve more stage performances  classes and residencies for older theater artists when it comes to hair  however  one question has followed mr  hitchler since he announced the nontraditional cast  what about that nude scene that sends the show into intermission he staged the first act finale two ways  one for cast members at ease doffing their costumes  one for those less comfortable  individual performers make decisions performance by performance and a sign in the lobby scrupulously advises that the show contains adult material  language and possible nudity mr  hitchler maintains that  for his more seasoned actors  its not always simply a matter of modesty to be honest  he said  not everyone can get undressed that quickly .
washington  president trump has proved himself adroit at creating villains to serve as his political foils  in his state of the union address on tuesday  he introduced a new one  socialists right after his calls to support the overthrow of venezuelas president  nicols maduro  and condemning the socialist policies that have reduced the country into a state of abject poverty and despair  he made a quick segue to the home front here in the united states  we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country  the president said  adding  tonight  we resolve that america will never be a socialist country tuesday nights speech contained more than a few suggestions of what mr  trumps 2020 campaign could look like  the president dwelled on the economy  pointing to the low unemployment rate  continuing growth and the tax cut passed by the last republican congress  he spoke of trying to reduce prescription drug costs and battling h i v   perhaps with an eye to the kinds of suburban female voters who deserted republicans in the midterm elections  and for his hard core followers  he argued for the border wall the threat of socialism was something new  but it could become the kind of rhetorical touchstone of his re election campaign that sounding the alarm about criminal illegal aliens was in 2016 if it does  it could provide mr  trump with a potentially effective weapon in confronting an increasingly aggressive and more liberal democratic party  defining it through attacks on senator bernie sanders of vermont and representative alexandria ocasio cortez of new york  who describe themselves as democratic socialists  and other members of the party pushing progressive policies like a 70 percent tax rate and medicare for all the presidents economic advisers began sounding the socialist alarm in the fall in a 72 page report criticizing what it described as the socialist ideas of leading democrats  linking them with the failed economic policies of communist governments in china  the former soviet union and other countries  the word socialism appeared 144 times  on average  twice a page the report by the white house council of economic advisers  the opportunity costs of socialism  did not prescribe any action but was meant to serve as a warning about the destructive economic policies that mr  trump believes democrats would inflict on the united states policies like tuition free college were mentioned in the same ominous tone as the atrocities committed by vladimir lenin and mao zedong  the report suggested that democratic policies emulating venezuela would cause the american economy to shrink by 40 percent  just as mr  trump did on tuesday night yet there is no evidence of any growing public angst about socialism sweeping the united states  as a political philosophy and organizing tool  it took modest root in the country in the late 19th and early 20th centuries  but never gained widespread appeal  eugene v  debs  a labor leader from terre haute  ind   was a five time candidate for president  never to great effect  peaking at 6 percent of the vote in 1912 you really have not had a self consciously socialist movement of any size and influence since the 1930s  said michael kazin  a professor of history at georgetown university and the author of a history of the american left  clearly this is an attempt to portray democrats as too radical for americans and to connect them to venezuela  which is of course a clever thing do since venezuela is falling apart under an ostensibly socialist government but the supposed threat of creeping socialism  and the dangers posed by someone like ms  ocasio cortez  have become favorite talking points for conservatives like the tv personality sean hannity of fox news  who tells his viewers that far left socialism had taken over the democratic party  mr  trump is now firmly aligned with that view most americans are obviously not up on the distinctions between democratic socialists and communists  mr  kazin said  he  like other conservatives who had talked about the so called red menace over the years  is trying to confuse the two things in peoples minds but that is not how conservatives look at the way mr  trump seems ready to portray democrats from a political standpoint  he is defending free enterprise  free markets and freedom  said greg mueller  a conservative strategist  they want to take the country toward socialism and their party is divided on that and there is a major fight in their party over whether to be a socialist party this is a great debate for trump to define in 2019 and the 2020 campaign  he added republicans  with limited success  tried at times to label president barack obama a socialist  particularly for his call for higher taxes on the wealthy  mr  kazin said  noting that this effort coincided with a shift in public opinion where americans viewed socialism more favorably but a gallup poll in august showed that democrats had a more positive view of socialism than they do of capitalism  57 percent to 47 percent  their view has been relatively stable since 2010  but attitudes toward capitalism have become more negative  coinciding with the financial crisis that fueled animus toward the large banks and investment firms blamed for the economic devastation among americans ages 18 to 29  the gallup poll found  51 percent were positive about socialism while 45 percent viewed capitalism favorably  gallup noted there was a marked  12 point decline in younger adults views on capitalism is just two years every single policy proposal that we have adopted and presented to the american people has been overwhelmingly popular  ms  ocasio cortez told msnbc late tuesday  and she dismissed mr  trumps criticism  he feels himself losing on the issues  she said  and now must engage in ad hominem attacks but it was no accident that mr  trump chose to introduce the socialist menace in perhaps the highest profile setting available to a president as the first step in trying to paint democrats as too far left  just as they start to engage in a presidential nominating process that will shape the partys image and even some of the presidents harshest critics say he may be on to something the idea of throwing the socialist thing out there politically is pretty crafty because  truly  there is just enough truth in there to make it sticky and interesting  said mike murphy  a republican strategist and longtime trump critic  they are lurching left  for once  somehow  a little honesty crept into one of trumps proclamations  its code for the loony left .
washington  a defiant president trump declared on thursday that he has all but given up on negotiating with congress over his border wall and will build it on his own even as he dismissed any suggestions of wrongdoing in the investigations that have ensnared his associates in an interview in the oval office  mr  trump called the talks a waste of time and indicated he will most likely take action on his own when they officially end in two weeks  at the same time  he expressed optimism about reaching a trade deal with china and denied being at odds with his intelligence chiefs i think nancy pelosi is hurting our country very badly by doing what shes doing and  ultimately  i think ive set the table very nicely  mr  trump said  he made no mention of closing the government again  a move that backfired on him  but instead suggested he plans to declare a national emergency to build the wall  ive set the table  he said  ive set the stage for doing what im going to do addressing a wide range of subjects  mr  trump brushed off the investigations that have consumed so much of his presidency  saying that his lawyers have been reassured by the departing deputy attorney general  rod j  rosenstein  that the president himself was not a target  he told the attorneys that im not a subject  im not a target  mr  trump said  but even if that is the case  it remains unknown whether the matter would be referred to the house for possible impeachment hearings  read excerpts from the interview with the president  mr  trump added that he never spoke with roger j  stone jr   his longtime associate who was indicted last week  about wikileaks and the stolen democratic emails it posted during the 2016 election  nor did he direct anyone to do so no  i didnt  i never did  he said of speaking with mr  stone on the subject  did he ever instruct anyone to get in touch with mr  stone about wikileaks  never did  he repeated the president dismissed the importance of the proposed trump tower his team was seeking to build in moscow at the height of the 2016 campaign  and he denied his own current lawyers account of how late in the campaign he was still discussing the project  he also denied that his twitter messages about former associates who are cooperating with prosecutors amount to witness tampering mr  trump said he played no role in directing white house officials to arrange for jared kushner  his son in law and senior adviser  to receive a top secret clearance  mr  kushners application was rejected at least once after concerns were raised by the f b i  about his foreign contacts  the c i a   which also raised concerns  has continued to deny him access to sensitive compartmentalized information the interview with mr  trump came on a busy day at the white house as the president seeks to rebound from the 35 day partial government shutdown that failed to force democrats to finance his wall and took a toll on his poll numbers  with most americans blaming him for the standoff  mr  trump expressed frustration that he has not gotten credit for what he sees as his accomplishments  including deregulation  increased military spending and nuclear talks with north korea fresh from a meeting on trade with chinas vice premier  mr  trump seemed relaxed and confident as he sought to make his case  distributing handouts including  at one point  printed copies of two tweets sent out in his name even as he was speaking with his visitors the interview was arranged after mr  trump reached out to a  g  sulzberger  the publisher of the new york times  and invited him for an off the record dinner  mr  sulzberger declined  saying he would prefer an on the record interview that included two of his reporters  the president agreed mr  trump sat behind the resolute desk  sipping periodically from a glass of diet coke with ice cubes floating in it and resting on a gold coaster  his acting chief of staff  mick mulvaney  his senior communications adviser  bill shine  and his press secretary  sarah huckabee sanders  sat in on the session with mr  sulzberger and the two reporters mr  trump spoke with a low voice  his arms folded tightly during questions about the russia inquiry as his aides grew fidgety  but he was more good humored at other points  he grew most animated when condemning media coverage he considers unfair  read the presidents comments about the news media  which  in lengthy and at times contradictory remarks  he deemed important and beautiful  but also so bad and unfair  he disputed persistent reports of dysfunction in the white house  noting that members of his staff write up summaries of kiss and tell books that have been published for him to peruse  i have somebody  boom boom  they give me the quotes at one point  he scoffed at the notion that he was making money from the presidency  calling the job a loser financially i lost massive amounts of money doing this job  he said  this is not the money  this is one of the great losers of all time  you know  fortunately  i dont need money  this is one of the great losers of all time  but theyll say that somebody from some country stayed at a hotel  and ill say  yeah  but i lose  i mean  the numbers are incredible still  he rejected speculation that he might not run for re election next year  i love this job  he said  and he said he did not think he would face a challenger for the his partys presidential nomination  even though several republicans are considering running  i dont see it  he said  i have great support in the party watching the emerging democratic field  mr  trump said the opposition party has really drifted far left  and he derided senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts as damaged while expressing admiration for the campaign kickoff of senator kamala harris of california  who drew thousands of supporters i would say the best opening so far would be kamala harris  he said  pronouncing it kameela  i would say in terms of the opening act  i would say  would be her  he added  a better crowd  better crowd  better enthusiasm some of the others were very flat  he added  i do think elizabeth warrens been hurt very badly with the pocahontas trap  he added  using a favorite slur to refer to the senators effort to prove she has native american heritage  i think shes been hurt badly  i may be wrong  but i think that was a big part of her credibility  and now all of a sudden its gone the president had tough words as well for ms  pelosi  who has adamantly refused to approve even a dollar of the  5 7 billion he has sought for his border wall  which she has denounced as immoral  mr  trump had gambled that he could force her to back down through the government shutdown and was vexed when he could not ive actually always gotten along with her  but now i dont think i will anymore  mr  trump said  i think shes doing a tremendous disservice to the country  if she doesnt approve a wall  the rest of its just a waste of money and time and energy because its desperately needed mr  trump has been considering an emergency declaration to spend money on a wall even without congressional approval  an action that even some republicans have objected to and that would certainly draw a court challenge  ill continue to build the wall and well get the wall finished  he said  now whether or not i declare a national emergency  that youll see the president defended his decisions to pull troops out of syria and draw down forces in afghanistan on the same day that the senate advanced a republican sponsored measure condemning a precipitous withdrawal from those two countries  i got elected on saying were getting out of these endless wars  he said given that  however  mr  trump did not explain why he has taken such an assertive stance in trying to force out president nicols maduro of venezuela  even leaving open a military option  while not criticizing other autocratic countries like saudi arabia  im just saying this  terrible things are going on  he said  terrible things are going on in venezuela now in saudi arabia  a lot of improvement has been made in saudi arabia  he said  while adding that the assassination of the saudi journalist jamal khashoggi was a terrible crime on another point of contention  the president noted that he summoned his intelligence chiefs  including dan coats  the national intelligence director  to the white house on thursday because he had heard they had contradicted his foreign policy during testimony this week to congress  mr  coats and the others told lawmakers that north korea was unlikely to give up its nuclear arsenal  that iran has not restarted work to build one and that the islamic state was not defeated  all assessments that clash with the presidents worldview but mr  trump said the intelligence chiefs told him their presentation was misinterpreted  they said  sir  our testimony was totally mischaracterized  mr  trump said  i said  what are you talking about  and when you read their testimony and you read their statements  it was mischaracterized by the media  even though he had assailed the chiefs earlier in the week  he said  im happy with dan coats mr  trump said he has likewise received reassurances from mr  rosenstein  who until attorney general jeff sessions was fired in november was overseeing the russia investigation by the special counsel  robert s  mueller iii rod told me im not a target of the investigation  he said at one point  but then later suggested he had not talked with him directly  the lawyers ask him  they say  hes not a target of the investigation  asked if that also covered the separate investigation by federal prosecutors in new york  he said  i dont know about that neither mr  rosenstein nor mr  mueller has said whether mr  trump is a target  and the president could not recall when mr  rosenstein would have assured him  mr  mueller has been known to explore whether the presidents actions amounted to obstruction of justice  but since justice department policy bars indicting a sitting president  it is unclear whether the term target would apply mr  trump denied having anything to do with mr  stones involvement with wikileaks  which during the 2016 campaign posted democratic emails online that were stolen by russian intelligence services  he expressed sympathy for mr  stone for his arrest at the hands of heavily armed f b i  agents ive always liked  i like roger  hes a character  mr  trump said  insisting that the f b i  agents charging a house like they did at six oclock in the morning  i think that was a very sad thing for this country mr  trump offered a vague account of his involvement in the proposed moscow project  michael d  cohen  his former personal lawyer  has pleaded guilty to lying to congress about the project and told the authorities that talks continued into the summer of 2016  even as mr  trump was securing the republican nomination rudolph w  giuliani  the presidents current lawyer  said recently that talks went all the way through the november election  only to later claim that he was mistaken and speaking only hypothetically he was wrong  mr  trump said on thursday  rudy has been wrong a little bit  but what has happened is this  i didnt care  that deal was not important  it was essentially a letter of intent or an option asked when in 2016 the last conversation he had about the project was  he said  i would say it was early to middle of the year  now  i dont know that cohen didnt go a little bit longer than that  i dont think it would be much longer  he added  i was running for president  i was doing really well  the last thing i cared about was building a building mr  cohen has been the focus of mr  trumps ire lately  including hostile tweets that his former lawyer and others interpreted as threats  among other things  the president has written that the authorities should be looking into mr  cohens father in law its not witness tampering  mr  trump said  its not witness tampering at all asked what the point was then  he said  i think people have the right to speak their mind  you know  speaking your mind  ive heard that for a period of time  but other people have said it  too  i mean  many people have said it mr  trump denied that he was upset to see william p  barr  his nominee for attorney general  attest to his long relationship with mr  mueller during his confirmation hearing and commit to letting the special counsel finish his investigation  i did hear the statement and it was totally acceptable to me  the president said he said he was not initially aware that mr  barr  as a private lawyer  had drafted a memo criticizing mr  muellers possible approach to obstruction of justice  i mean  i read it afterwards  he said  but i did not know  he added  i never read the memo .
last month  when speaker nancy pelosi and senator chuck schumer  the democratic leader  first met with president trump about funding for a border wall  i wrote an article about the burnt orange maxmara coat ms  pelosi wore when she exited the white house  which had set social media aflame the story reached a huge audience  but not everyone was happy  one irritated reader tweeted  would a mans suit get this much ink given that i have written about president trumps suits  jeb bushs shirtsleeves and marco rubios shoes  my answer is yes another reader  suzanne mintz of kensington  md   wrote in a letter to the editor  shame on you for feeling the need to remind us that although ms  pelosi is a highly accomplished politician and fearless leader  what she is wearing is equally important  you owe her and all women an apology the issue came up again recently  when the new congress was sworn in  and ms  pelosi officially became speaker of the house the times wrote about ms  pelosis history making ascendancy and in the course of doing so mentioned the color of her dress  hot pink   the detail also made it into a tweet from a times account  readers once more took issue i look forward to your headline about trump having worn a navy suit and red tie at his next press conference  and about mcconnell wearing a black suit and blue tie when announcing that he wont let the dems bill be voted on in the senate  read one tweet i understand where these readers are coming from  there is no question fashion has been used as a tool to dismiss women in the past  but there are reasons my colleagues and i consider what a politician  male or female  wears  well  worthy of consideration for starters  dress is  without question  an important part of a politicians tool kit   it is part of everyones tool kit  but for the sake of this discussion lets just focus on politicians  in an increasingly visual age  how you look is part of the message you are communicating  that photo of ms  pelosi in an orange coat and dark glasses is more effective than any logo at communicating womens relish at being on the front lines   the director barry jenkins even put it on a sweatshirt  which he is giving away  i dont think theres any question ms  pelosi picked a hot pink dress for her swearing in both because she knew it would make her stand out in what was still a room full of dark suits  and because of the symbolic nature of the occasion  a color traditionally associated with delicate femininity had become a color associated with a seat of power  thats a strategic and savvy choice  and to take notice of it is to acknowledge the multidimensional chess game ms  pelosi is playing  not to demean her we make instant judgments about each other based on image all the time  its human instinct  and part of how we decide if someone is likable or believable or a leader  and its part of the way our leaders try to influence our feelings about them this is true for both men and women  a good friend of mine  a man who is a political crisis consultant  like olivia pope on scandal   once told me i would not believe the amount of time he has devoted to discussing tie colors with clients  at their request  when they could have been talking about  say  a peace process to ignore how public figures use what they wear is to ignore one of the ways our own understanding is being manipulated  i consider it part of my job as the timess chief fashion critic to help readers understand how fashion is being used to communicate  in the same way andrew ross sorkin helps us understand economic policy admittedly  if this context is missing  thats our mistake  if we are going to use clothes as a signpost of related substance  that connection should be clear   that is why we deleted our tweet that referred to ms  pelosis dress  the context was missing  to include fashion analysis as a part of a political article would be sexist only if we ignored the policy proposals of female politicians and wrote solely about their clothes  or never wrote about the clothes of male politicians  neither is the case with our coverage that being said  in my experience our readers pay much less attention when we write about men and dress  when i wrote about tim kaine and his dad look  for example  during the 2016 campaign  it elicited a pretty low response  i have long written about tie color  especially during debates  as well as about the casual friday ization of the white house under president barack obama granted  there is more opportunity to write about female clothing than male clothing  because there is more variety  but that is part of what makes it interesting  and in many ways  their broader fashion options are a boon for women  not a problem after years of complaining about people focusing on her clothes  for example  hillary clinton turned the attention on her wardrobe into an enormous asset by making it a running joke   remember her very first hard choices instagram post about her suits   this defanged its pejorative power  humanized her and gave supporters a uniform to wear as a badge of solidarity  can you imagine a man trying to make  pantsuitnation a thing  no one would even know they were looking at anything special the more we recognize the role clothes play in life and politics  the more we are all willing to talk about it  the more we normalize it  the less potential it has as a weapon in any situation id be interested in hearing your thoughts on this  and would welcome comments  ill try to respond to a selection correction  an earlier version of this article misstated what the director barry jenkins is doing with sweatshirts he made of nancy pelosi in an orange coat  he is giving them away  not selling them .
kodiak  alaska  the morning after more than 40 000 coast guard members missed their first paycheck  and the federal governments shutdown stretched into its fourth week  eleanor king placed an empty jar next to her diners cash register in scribbled black marker  a sign on the jar  written in all capital letters  read  donation coast guard  by 9 a m  on wednesday  nearly an hour before a rainy winter sunrise  the jar held  120  money with which patrons were effectively buying meals for members of the maritime force while the shutdown has affected hundreds of thousands of federal workers across the united states  halting paychecks and furloughing those who have been deemed nonessential personnel  it has brought a particular chill to kodiak  a small town of 6 300 on an isolated island in the gulf of alaska roughly a quarter of the islands population is either an employee or dependent family member of the coast guard  which has now had to scale back some of its operations in one of the worlds most dangerous waterways a high cost of living is common to communities in the alaskan wilderness  but the coast guard contingent in kodiak makes the town especially vulnerable to the drought in federal cash  local businesses like ms  kings diner are losing money daily even while trying to help kodiaks predicament is a result of president trumps political fight with congress over  5 7 billion in funding for a border wall  forcing the government to shut down and leaving a series of agency budget bills unfinished  that included funding for the department of homeland security  the parent agency of the coast guard this impacts everyone  ms  king said  like some of the other businesses in kodiak  her diner is giving a 10 percent discount to coast guard members  the donations from her jar help pay for meals the coast guard is the only branch of the military that is part of an otherwise completely civilian agency  it was created to enforce maritime laws and conduct rescue operations at sea  but it can be ordered to protect the united states from foreign threats during war or conflicts that the coast guard is going without pay during the shutdown is the first time in our nations history that service members in a u s  armed force have not been paid during a lapse in government appropriations  adm  karl l  schultz  the coast guard commandant  said in a statement on tuesday  if the shutdown continues  coast guard retirees will also not be paid at the end of the month jed a  bergstrom  who runs a food bank at a baptist mission community center in kodiak  said a coast guard family showed up at his door the day after service members were supposed to be paid residents are donating fish and game from their freezers to their neighbors  big als take and bake  another restaurant in the area  sent more than 30 pizzas to a food bank on the coast guard base  they quickly disappeared alexandras salon  a hair styling shop  is giving i o u s to clients instead of making them pay  and the alutiiq museum  focused on the communitys native heritage  has waived its  7 entry free but eventually  said mayor patricia b  branson  if the government does not reopen soon  the business owners and landlords will have to find a way to get paid i think its important that the people in the faraway land d c  understand whats going on in a small town  she said  and how people are affected by all this nonsense legislation that was introduced earlier this month by a bipartisan group of lawmakers  known as the pay our coast guard act  has gained support in congress in recent days  but its fate  at least in the short term  remains unclear other organizations have raised funds to help coast guard families  including a  15 million donation from the usaa financial services company flush with greenery and emerald water in the summer  while cold and wet in the winter  kodiak is economically supported by the coast guard base  one of the largest in the united states  the town is also dependent on its fishing port  which often oscillates between being the second  and third most prosperous in the country the fishing industry off alaskas coast rakes in more than  4 billion annually  according to the national marine fisheries service  but with most of that service also closed  kodiaks primary economic driver might soon be in jeopardy for now  though  little has changed  the fishing season for pollock opened this week in the northern pacific  and the coast guard moved a mh 60 jayhawk helicopter and its kodiak based crew hundreds of miles to a small base in the aleutian islands to help  if need be  with search and rescue missions still  the coast guard has had to stop some of its law enforcement missions in the bering sea and gulf of alaska  some routine patrols have been halted  as has the practice  in at least some cases  of boarding fishing boats to ensure that crews are following maritime laws generally  activities have been scaled back if it doesnt support life and property or the protection of national security  said lt  brian dykens  a coast guard spokesman besides search and rescue  and unlike air stations in the mainland united states  the coast guard missions in alaska often include medically evacuating people from remote areas  as aircrews have done at least seven times since the shutdown began in the winter  the bering sea is known for its hurricanelike weather and 50 foot waves  it has claimed the lives of dozens of fishermen in recent years salt water  battering winds and constant strain ensure that coast guard aircraft need constant maintenance  the flights that are based in kodiak are responsible for covering four million square miles of coastline and ocean but with hundreds of civilians on furlough  a backlog of repair requests are quickly accruing at the coast guards primary maintenance hub in north carolina  already  active duty coast guard mechanics are filling in for their furloughed civilian colleagues at the kodiak air station if it drags on  the ability of the force to initiate the most rudimentary search and rescue missions are at risk of being hampered  said one coast guard official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the effects of the shutdown  some of the smaller coast guard air stations across the country could close lt  cmdr  zachary koehler is among the coast guard helicopter pilots in kodiak who are currently not being paid as they undertake missions over the volatile bering sea  he and his wife  beth  have a son and daughter  both 11  and run grand slam  a toy store the family opened in 2017  the store has lost 30 percent in sales this month compared to last january in the first couple days  i think everyone thought this wasnt going to continue  ms  koehler said  so they kept spending like they usually do  and after that first weekend  it was amazing  it just stopped it hurts  said aimee williams  who spent 12 years in the coast guard and is married to a c 130 pilot who is still in the service  and its just going to keep getting worse here until its fixed .
washington  republican leaders scrambled to keep rank and file members in line ahead of a house vote on tuesday to kill president trumps declaration of a national emergency on the mexican border  as democrats appealed to republicans to protect congresss constitutional power to control federal spending the houses vote on a declaration of disapproval will force republicans to choose between the congressional prerogative over federal spending established in the constitution and a president determined to go around the legislative branch to secure funds for a border wall that congress has refused to grant many republicans were clearly uneasy with the presidents action  but few were ready to declare their support for legislation overturning it on monday  senator thom tillis  republican of north carolina  became the second republican senator to say he would support the democratic resolution there is no intellectual honesty in now turning around and arguing that theres an imaginary asterisk attached to executive overreach  that its acceptable for my party but not thy party  mr  tillis wrote in an opinion article published monday in the washington post last week  senator susan collins  republican of maine  said she would support a resolution  barring any extraneous additions  other republicans were holding their fire i wish it wasnt necessary for mr  trump to have declared a national emergency  said senator john cornyn  republican of texas  arguing that the issue could have been avoided if democrats had agreed to more funding for physical border barriers i think its a shame that what should be a nonpartisan issue has turned into obviously a very partisan issue  he added  im still considering my alternatives the resolution is expected to sail through the house on democratic votes  but significant republican defections would give it momentum in the senate and could raise the specter  however remote  that congress could override mr  trumps promised veto  should the resolution reach his desk democrats framed tuesdays vote as a referendum on protecting the separation of powers and congresss constitutional right to determine federal spending levels  an argument that appealed to several conservatives in both chambers representative joaquin castro  democrat of texas and the author of the resolution  warned monday at a news conference that without congressional interference  mr  trump would try this again on other issues  while speaker nancy pelosi of california expressed confidence that her republican colleagues belief in the separation of powers would push them to support the one page resolution this isnt about the border  she said  this is about the constitution of the united states but democrats were also making a less lofty case to wavering republicans  they circulated a list of all of the possible military construction projects in each district that could lose money shifted instead to mr  trumps wall several lawsuits have already been filed to challenge the merits of the declaration  but the easiest way for congress to counter it is through the resolution of disapproval  authorized by the national emergencies act of 1976  once it passes the house  the senate is required under the law to take it up within 18 days on monday  mr  trump trained his attention on the senate  where only four republican votes are needed to pass the measure  should democrats remain united  as expected  the president warned republicans  via twitter  not to fall into the democrats trap of open borders and crime several conservative senators have expressed concern that mr  trumps declaration is setting a precedent that could be used by a democratic president determined to secure funds that congress will not give others have balked at the prospect of siphoning money away from military projects  senator charles e  grassley  republican of iowa  who said he was leaning no on voting for the resolution  suggested that congress review the power to declare national emergencies granted to the president under the national emergencies act senator lamar alexander  republican of tennessee  called mr  trumps declaration unnecessary  unwise and inconsistent with the constitution  yet he declined to say how he would vote on a resolution ending it  telling reporters  im going to wait and see what the resolution says in the house  top republicans were urging their members to focus on what they say is a legitimate need for border security money and the precedent set by other presidents who have declared their own national emergencies  according to one republican aide only one house republican  representative justin amash of michigan  has signed on to the resolution to block the declaration  scorning the idea that congressional republicans who attacked president barack obamas use of executive powers now cry out for a king to usurp legislative powers top republicans  including representative kevin mccarthy of california  the minority leader  said they were confident that there will be enough support to prevent the two thirds majority needed to override the veto  but representative steve scalise of louisiana  the republican whip  and other members of his vote counting team were set to lobby for votes against the resolution during a session on monday night democrats argument was buoyed by two letters from more than 25 former republican lawmakers and nearly 60 former senior national security officials  who appealed to congress to end the national emergency declaration it has always been a republican fundamental principle that no matter how strong our policy preferences  no matter how deep our loyalties to presidents or party leaders  in order to remain a constitutional republic  we must act within the borders of the constitution  wrote the former members of congress  including senators john c  danforth  chuck hagel  olympia j  snowe and richard g  lugar  who implored republicans to protect congresss constitutionally mandated power of the purse the security officials said there is neither a documented terrorist or national security emergency at the southern border nor an emergency related to violent crime mr  trumps assertions are rebutted not just by the public record  but by his agencies own official data  documents and statements  the officials  including madeleine albright  the former secretary of state  and john o  brennan  the former c i a  director  said in their declaration under no plausible assessment of the evidence is there a national emergency today  they wrote this isnt about trump or the wall  this is beyond that  said former representative mickey edwards  republican of oklahoma and the author of the letter to conservative lawmakers  this is about the constitutional obligations of congress and how much congress is going to surrender those duties if congress gives up the power of deciding what money you can spend and where  he added  it has basically surrendered its entire constitutional obligation members of the house appropriations committee will hold a hearing on wednesday to examine the effect of the declaration on military construction and readiness  and members of the house judiciary committee will hold a hearing on thursday in part to examine mr  trumps use of powers under the national emergencies act if were going to let the president  any president  on a whim declare emergencies simply because he or she cant get their way in congress  we have fundamentally changed the building blocks  the strong  proud building blocks that the founding fathers put in place  said senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  in a speech on the senate floor .
to the editor re trump appeals directly to u s  for border wall  front page  jan  9  in his brief address from the oval office of the white house on tuesday night  president trump relied on tired stories of immigrant violence that he has often repeated  backed by statistics of dubious validity and delivered in his typically nonemotive style  mr  trumps advisers thought this speech would move the nation and cause a dramatic shift in public sentiment to support the wall or take the onus of the government shutdown off him  they were wrong arguably  the speech is simply a sign of his desperation  the man is consumed by an obsessive need to fulfill a campaign pledge punch line  he seems to believe that to abandon the wall might risk losing some of his core base  the same group whose good will he may need to help him overcome a future impeachment challenge mr  president  as you have done so many times in your two years as president  your speech further debased the dignity of the office  in the past  oval office speeches have been reserved for true national crises  not those manufactured to serve a presidents own political self interest  as if we really need any more evidence  mr  trump once again underscored that he is unfit to occupy the white house ken derowswarthmore  pa to the editor much of president trumps oval office address focused on the crimes committed by illegal immigrants  we need to remember that wherever you have people  you have sin  even our outstanding military has a small percentage of personnel who commit crimes while serving overseas  i hope that no one would argue that because of this minuscule minority the military should be forbidden from serving overseas  therefore  we should be equally sensitive when talking about illegal

washington  there was no golf  there were no meetings  there were no activities  other than a rare visit to church  so president trump did what he could do  he tweeted since his election  mr  trump has averaged about 16 tweets per weekend  according to a new york times analysis of his tweets as collected by the trump twitter archive website  but last weekend proved to be an unusually active 48 hours online for mr  trump  from friday morning to sunday evening  mr  trump tweeted over 50 times  counting the retweets that amplified supporters who have limited public reach on their own ensconced in the white house  mr  trump saw enemies everywhere  and his tweets reflected that  stoking new tensions and nursing past grievances he took on saturday night live  which on march 16 aired a rerun from christmas  and suggested that the federal communications commission look into late night shows and examine them for anti trump bias  he accused senator john mccain  who died of brain cancer last year  of collaborating with democrats and claimed that mr  mccain  a former prisoner of war  was last in his class at the naval academy   mr  mccain actually graduated fifth from the bottom   and he defended tucker carlson and jeanine pirro  the fox news opinion hosts who have been under fire for making bigoted statements  encouraging fox executives to stay strong in the face of criticism mr  trumps advisers have shared with him data showing that even his supporters do not like the tweet storms  and have advised him to act more presidential as his re election campaign draws nearer  at rallies  even die hard trump fans who arrive early dressed in maga gear admit that while they are willing to overlook the presidents online musings  they would prefer seeing fewer of them mr  trump often likes to buck the advice he gets  and it was clear over the weekend that he was trusting his gut again  and going his own way stop working soooo hard on being politically correct  which will only bring you down  and continue to fight for our country  he said in a tweet on sunday that appeared to be directed at fox executives who had temporarily removed ms  pirro from her saturday night slot after she suggested that representative ilhan omar  democrat of minnesota and one of the first two muslim women elected to congress  may practice shariah law the losers all want what you have  dont give it to them  be strong   prosper  be weak   die  mr  trump wrote on twitter  he also singled out two weekend fox news anchors  arthel neville and leland vittert  who are less opinionated than the late night hosts who double as the presidents personal friends and informal advisers  asking rhetorically whether they were trained by cnn prior to their ratings collapse later on sunday  he shared a homemade meme from a little known twitter user  who goes by the handle  lonewolfnduke  which depicted him as an american president having to fight an american government to protect american citizens but it was unclear what had provoked the presidents flurry of activity  and even advisers were searching for the normal cues that set him off  white house officials performing poorly on the sunday show circuit  or the presidents delayed distillation of negative coverage from the week before mr  trump on friday was rebuked by senate republicans  12 of whom voted with democrats against a national emergency to build a border wall  but the border barely figured into mr  trumps weekend tweets  which appeared to be driven more by idle hands and an empty weekend schedule people who spoke with mr  trump on the phone over the weekend said he seemed to be in good spirits  others who communicated with him said he had spent some time railing privately against andrew g  mccabe  the former deputy f b i  director  but they also said he appeared to be a little aimless  and the outpouring seemed to be more driven by a lack of structure  mr  trump had skipped his regular weekend trip to mar a lago  his florida estate  because of a family commitment that kept him grounded in washington there was a four hour lull in mr  trumps online activity on sunday  when he left the white house to visit st  johns church for st  patricks day  but for the most part  the president  bored  agitated or both  appeared to spend the weekend online mr  trump shared with his 59 1 million followers a report circulating on right wing sites that minnesota democrats had grown unhappy with ms  omar  and accused a democrat union leader in ohio of standing in the way of putting an idling general motors plant in the state back into operation jack posobiec  a trump supporter known for advancing conspiracy theories on twitter  including pizzagate  marveled that his messages were being retweeted by the leader of the free world  the president shared two tweets initially sent by mr  posobiec  one a local news article about an ms 13 gang stabbing  and another criticizing cnn over a segment examining the links between mr  trump and white nationalism i realize the presidents just reading my twitter account going through the tweets  mr  posobiec said in a 13 minute video he posted analyzing the experience  lets see what else hes up to today as is often the case  there was a correlation between what appeared on mr  trumps twitter feed and the programming on fox news  the weekend tour into conspiracy theories kicked off on friday  when mr  trump elevated a nascent movement that calls itself jexodus  the brainchild of a conservative jewish activist that describes itself as a group of proud jewish millennials tired of living in bondage to leftist politics the jexodus movement encourages jewish people to leave the democrat party  mr  trump wrote on twitter  although there is no evidence to suggest that jewish voters have been deserting the party  but mr  trump appeared to be reacting to an appearance on fox   friends by the groups spokeswoman  elizabeth pipko  a former model and trump 2016 campaign staff member brian ott  who studies the effects of rhetoric at texas tech university and is the author of a book studying mr  trumps tweets  said the president appeared to have become less concerned with the consequences of his messaging not only is it already getting worse  dr  ott said  i dont think weve even seen the tip of the iceberg yet  as these investigations begin to close in on him  really his only play is to stoke vitriol and violence tweeting has also become a normal part of how the president circumvents the news media and his own advisers to communicate to the public what is on his mind  but the weekend whirlwind was so unusual that it created its own mini news cycle  with targets using their own platforms to respond and aides fielding questions from reporters about the presidents mental state kellyanne conway  counselor to the president  defended him on monday morning after her husband  george conway  spent the weekend raising concerns about narcissistic personality disorder and said on twitter that mr  trumps condition is getting worse no  i dont share those concerns  ms  conway told reporters outside the white house meghan mccain  a host of the view and the daughter of mr  mccain  said the attacks  which included a presidential retweet of a woman who claimed that millions of americans truly love president trump  not mccain  only made her feel bad for mr  trumps family i cant imagine having a father that does this on the weekends  ms  mccain said .
they keep coming  armed with replica automatic weapons firing blanks  gallons of stage blood and mangled mexican accents  the cartels are streaming across our undefended border  and into our multiplexes and our video streams these onscreen villains torture their enemies  they kill good americans and they might turn up anywhere  last year  in sicario  day of the soldado  which is just one of at least six films in which the great benicio del toro wrestles with latin american drug lords  or plays one himself  they were linked to the bombing of a supermarket in kansas city the cartel operative  be he a kingpin or a hit man or a small time drug dealer  has become the dominant image of latino people in american television and cinema  hes of course also the dominant image of latino people in the discourse of the president of the united states by the next network upfronts  or summer movie blockbuster season  latino drug operatives may outpace their chief rivals  jihadist terrorists and russians mobsters  and become the countrys leading screen bad guys you two understand that were dealing with a virus  a mexican cop asks his american counterparts  referring to the drug fueled corruption overwhelming a fictitious mexican town in the cbs television drama seal team  here  everyone is born infected the dialogue and imagery of cartel movies associates latino identity with inherent  pure evil again and again  its time for hollywood to ask  what message are we sending to the american public by asking this countrys latino actors to act out one execution style killing after another  and isnt this all becoming a bit tired and predictable the quality of these dramas  speaking in purely artistic terms  varies widely  from the emmy winning tv series breaking bad and the not so celebrated 2013 comedy film were the millers to this years widely panned peppermint and clint eastwoods largely well received the mule  but they repeat the same tropes  latino gang members grimacing as they mad dog confused white people  a secret meeting on a mexican hacienda  with tequila served and latinas in bikinis as poolside eye candy its become a genre  you can see it  mr  del toro told the guardian in june  regarding films about drugs  he said  theyre becoming the new westerns unfortunately  this new genre doesnt purport to depict events from americas past  but rather a supposedly real menace in the here and now  in late december  president trump shut down parts of the government over the border wall he wants to build to keep out immigrants he says are drug dealing criminals  hes never stopped making up false and distorted statements about the dangers posed by latino immigrants  all the while  hollywood has been inventing screen stories that sell the image of lawbreaking latinos as a threat to american peace and security in the odious 2018 film peppermint  jennifer garner acts out a trumpian fantasy  as a suburban mom whose husband and daughter were killed by latino drug dealers  she becomes a one woman vigilante army  killing a series of latino assassins and destroying a piata warehouse that doubles as a drug lords secret headquarters  the new yorker called it a racist film that reflects the current strain of anti immigrant politics and its paranoid focus on ms 13 like the drug dealers in peppermint  the bad guys in latino drug war films are often a mishmash of tropes and stereotypes  the cartel operatives in seal team resemble an islamic state army as they launch a benghazi style attack on the shows heroes  the americans take refuge in a mexican church and summon other navy seals to rescue them  the show aired not long after mr  trump sent troops to the mexican border to stop a caravan of central americans hollywood has become addicted to the narco narrative because it offers a tried and true tale of good and evil on an epic scale the new netflix series narcos  mexico features an excellent  nuanced performance by diego luna as a smart  enterprising and deeply flawed man  but watching mr  luna build his empire  i longed to see a latino actor play a big hollywood role without seeing him leave the usual trail of cocaine and severed heads in his wake in the mule  mr  eastwood plays an older man filled with regrets after a lifetime of alienating his wife and daughter  the drug dealers are really just stand ins for forces that are eating away at many american families  rampant gun violence and the cruel logic of capitalism  the bad guys in narco films are always ruthless hyper entrepreneurs  and in the mule they tell mr  eastwoods character  we own your ass  in the mule  as in countless films of lesser quality  latino stereotypes become symbols of a white mans powerlessness and his unchecked desires  for his role in ozark  jason bateman earned a golden globe nomination as yet another ordinary gringo caught up in the machinations of a mexican cartel meanwhile  in real life  latinos are acting out their own human foibles  and trying to build their own private empires  in fields that dont involve criminal activity  they manage your local walmart  study law  get divorced  attend cosplay conventions  and do all sorts of things you rarely see them do in mainstream american television and film the dominant story among the more than 57 million latino people in the united states is not the drug war  its inequality  immigrant ambition and the wounds caused by the separation of extended families  these themes await a treatment as virtuosic as there will be blood  or as smart and cutting as get out mr  or ms  studio executive  instead of another film with fake tattoos and stilted accents  consider investing in new talent and greenlighting a big  smart latino project  and think of the narcos as chili powder  as a spice  they should be used sparingly insist on quality and complexity in the screen stories you tell about latino people  and you might even look like a genius as you tap into a true and untold american epic more compelling than any cartel conspiracy .
washington  richard m  nixon once said  people react to fear  not love  they dont teach that in sunday school  but its true no president since has deployed fear quite like donald j  trump  whether it is the prospect of a crime wave at the border with mexico or nuclear war with north korea  president trump has persuaded his supporters that there is plenty to fear beyond fear itself in an interview as a presidential candidate in 2016 with bob woodward and robert costa of the washington post  mr  trump said  real power is  i dont even want to use the word  fear as president  he initially tried to intimidate some of the nations strongest allies  including canada  mexico  britain  france and germany  in trade talks  he demanded political loyalty from republicans in congress and drove several who bucked him from office  notably senators bob corker and jeff flake  but as his presidency enters its third year  a less convenient truth is emerging  few outside the republican party are afraid of him  and they may be less intimidated after the disastrous government shutdown but mr  trump has shown little inclination to modulate his style  and that carries risks  he could well face a challenge for the republican nomination in 2020  and congressional republicans from swing states could begin to distance themselves from him one of the clearest signals came last week when republicans  backing an amendment offered by senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  opposed the presidents call for withdrawal of united states military forces from syria and afghanistan as part of a middle east policy bill  only three republicans voted against it i believe the threats remain  mr  mcconnell said in a speech last week  isis and al qaeda have yet to be defeated  and american national security interests require continued commitment to our mission there mr  mcconnell also counseled the president last week against declaring a national emergency to get a wall built on the southwestern border  even as mr  trump emphasized that he was reserving that option even his supporters say the president  who uses the word tough as a favored expression of admiration  has not made a measurably effective transition from the world of private business to public office it is a common trait among those who ran privately held corporations  said ari fleischer  who served as white house press secretary for george w  bush and frequently defends mr  trump  their way is the only way  their will gets it done  theyve been successful against all odds  built something huge  and when they declare it so they expect everybody around them to make it so  thats donald trumps behavior  and that doesnt always work in politics or in government politicians dont operate the way he does  mr  fleischer said  frankly  its put him at risk and put the republican party at risk  but it also allows him to take on china and do something of tremendous consequences that no politician would ever do  if trump is successful  this will be a better country and a better world for it yet there is little evidence that president xi jinping of china  or any other foreign leader  is cowed and certainly not speaker nancy pelosi  the president initially said he felt comfortable negotiating with ms  pelosi  but in interviews aired on sunday  he sharpened his attacks on her and said her obstinacy on the border wall was damaging the country mr  trump has found that his lack of experience in politics and diplomacy  which require policy knowledge  team building and nuanced negotiating ability  has left him at a decided disadvantage despite his boasts about his deal making prowess hes surrounded in these standoffs by people who have all those boxes checked  said timothy obrien  the author of trumpnation  the art of being the donald  nancy pelosi has been doing this for quite a while  putin has been doing this for a quite a while  xi has been doing this quite a while  theyve all been running circles around him the next question is when does he really realize that for what it is  and i think the answer for that is he never will  mr  obrien said  because it would admit either defeat or acknowledgment of his inadequacies  and he will just never do that the government shutdown is just the latest and highest profile example of mr  trump sounding assertive but gaining little  at least so far  american allies  diplomats said  have more a sense of resignation than fear in dealing with him  the list of threats from mr  trump is long  but the number of times he has followed through is exceedingly short he is playing a role  and the role  much like on the apprentice  was of the strong  able character  but its a role  said david axelrod  a senior adviser to president barack obama  every foreign leader and every practicing politician has taken a measure of him and understands the basics  that he responds to strength and theres not a lot behind the facade in recent months  mr  trump has had tense conversations with  among others  prime minister theresa may of britain and president emmanuel macron of france  who has felt trolled by mr  trump over the state of the french economy  people familiar with the conversations said the german chancellor  angela merkel  has indicated to people that she does not consider mr  trump a serious person to talk with  his get tough  tariff driven approach to bringing china to heel has had mixed results at best  hurting some american industries and sending markets plunging  even on one of the most prominent issues that has provoked his threats  the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement with canada and mexico  mr  trump did not walk away with anything close to a windfall instead  most trade experts said the revised trade accord included modest substantive changes that will benefit the united states  and others said the biggest difference may be symbolic  a change in the name  to the united states mexico canada agreement  congress has yet to vote on that pact but there is one place where mr  trumps fear tactics have been an unqualified success  among republicans  mr  trump has held an iron grip on the republican base  making it difficult for fellow party members  who also rely on those core voters  to oppose him there is no constituency within a party that is so dominated by one individual that is charting a course with the opposition unless you want to be a former lawmaker  said josh holmes  a republican strategist who is close to mr  mcconnell other presidents have held out the fear of recrimination from the oval office to get their way  but they did not use mr  trumps blunt instruments alone lyndon b  johnson was known for his lean in  hardball persuasion  but unlike mr  trump  johnson entered a negotiation with an idea of what his opponents wanted and found a way to get it for them  in exchange for getting what he wanted  even nixon later acknowledged that he did not really believe fear was a successful prime motivator nixon said that  but he didnt believe it and he didnt practice it  said michael beschloss  a presidential historian and author of the recent best seller presidents of war  he actually spent decades building relationships in washington  with his party leaders  with democrats  and around the world  so yes  there were certainly elements of fear in all those relationships  but he knew you needed both the carrot and the stick mr  trump  given his background as a deal making real estate developer with close relationships with politicians  might have been expected to do the same in washington  but among democrats  he has done the opposite its almost as if he only has one tool in his toolbox  mr  beschloss said .
there are more than 48 000 people being held in immigrant detention in more than 200 facilities in the united states  more than two thirds of them  according to the national immigrant justice center  are confined by private companies  working on contracts with the federal government  those numbers have ballooned in the last two years under the trump administration  drawing new attention to the terrible conditions detainees are living in one feature of privately run centers  the voluntary work program  is the subject of six separate lawsuits  which say that privately run immigrant detention centers are coercing detainees into working for a dollar a day and punishing those who dont  the lawsuits demand  among other things  that the practice stop and that detained workers be paid minimum wage congress should not wait for these lawsuits to be decided  democrats have won the house  so even if they cant stop the presidents anti immigrant push  they can push to raise the obsolete and exploitative  1 a day wage  and  just as they have rejected mr  trumps request for  5 7 billion for the border wall  they should reject the request for  2 8 billion to expand detentions to 52 000 beds prison labor is nearly as old as the american prison system itself  and it is protected by the 13th amendment  which abolished slavery and indentured servitude except as punishment for a crime  this exception means that prisons can require their prisoners to work  even without compensation  but immigrant detention is civil confinement  not criminal  people held in these facilities are not charged with any crime  they are being detained while awaiting asylum or deportation hearings  under immigration and customs enforcements voluntary work program  however   immigrant detention centers need not pay workers more than one dollar a day  a rate set by congress in 1950 and codified in the 1978 appropriations act  it has never been increased or adjusted for inflation detainees say that the voluntary work program is not really voluntary  if they attempt to take a day off or refuse to work  staff members punish them by withholding essential items  threatening to move them to more dangerous housing units or locking them in their cells  wilhen hill barrientos  a guatemalan asylum seeker and a plaintiff in the lawsuit against corecivics stewart detention center in georgia  said that he had to either work for a few cents an hour or go without basic things like soap  which he could get only through the commissary according to mr  barrientoss lawsuit  one night a guard awakened him for the 2 a m  shift in the kitchen rather than his scheduled 10 a m  shift  when he refused  the guard threatened to move him to a violence plagued dormitory  so mr  barrientos acquiesced martha gonzalez  from mexico  was detained in three different corecivic prisons in texas from may 2016 to august 2017 as she awaited a t 1 visa  which is granted to victims of human trafficking  she worked in the kitchen and sorted clothing  when she once tried to take a day off  she told me  the prison staff then punished her by refusing to give her basic hygiene supplies such as sanitary pads and toothpaste  corecivic did not respond to ms  gonzalezs allegation but said that its work programs are completely voluntary and that detainees are subject to no disciplinary action whatsoever if they choose not to participate in the work program a representative for geo group called the lawsuits allegations baseless  saying that this is a strictly voluntary program and that geo group provides hygiene products free of charge upon request  private corporations hold less than 10 percent of the nations prison population  but more than 70 percent of people in immigration detention  the government pays them a fixed daily price per person  so they have an economic incentive to run their facilities as cheaply as possible  relying on detainees to cook meals  mop hallways  scrub toilets  mow lawns and even cut hair in 2016  corecivics revenue from stewart  where mr  barrientos and other detainees worked in the kitchen  was about  38 million  in 2017  contracts with ice comprised 25 percent of its  1 76 billion in revenue  for geo group  ice contracts comprised 19 percent of its  2 26 billion revenue in 2017  at the same time  the detention centers provide the barest minimum to detainees  while charging them exorbitant rates for necessities  in immigrant detention  a phone call can cost as much as  12 75 for 15 minutes  four ounces of toothpaste sells for  11 these two corporations have become the giants of the private prison industry  between 2016 and 2018  corecivic spent  2 8 million in lobbying and over  700 000 on campaign contributions while geo group spent  4 4 million in lobbying and  2 5 million on campaign contributions  each company also donated  250 000 to mr  trumps inauguration they blame the 1978 appropriations act for the low wages  as geo group puts it  the wage rates associated with this federal government program are stipulated under long established guidelines set by the united states congress  that is true  if congress instead forced these companies to pay the federal minimum wage  their profit margins would drop dramatically but the dollar a day rule has stalwart defenders in congress  in response to a class action lawsuit in which formerly detained immigrants said they were forced to work  18 republican congressmen sent a letter on march 7  2018  to the attorney general at the time  jeff sessions  the head of ice and the secretary of the department of labor  exhorting those agencies to help geo group defend itself  unless your agencies act to intervene in these lawsuits  immigration enforcement efforts will be thwarted  and the end result will be millions of dollars of unnecessary loss to the federal government in terms of additional expenses for immigration detention  they said  in other words  they worried that if the private prisons were forced to pay reasonable wages  the companies would pass on those costs to the federal government the lawsuits are not pushing to end the voluntary work program altogether  they understand that it allows people who are in detention to buy things they need and keep in touch with their families by phone  which becomes even more urgent as the number of families torn apart by detention increases  instead  the lawsuits are pushing for an end to exploitation and a fair wage for their work yes  paying detainees a minimum wage would make these facilities much more expensive to operate  but if privately run detention centers rely on a business model based on forced labor  perhaps they should not exist at all .

president  congress and  most importantly  the american people  that this matter be resolved by allowing the special counsel to complete his work  mr  barr said  he added  i will follow the special counsel regulations scrupulously and in good faith  and on my watch  bob will be allowed to finish mr  mueller is believed to be in the final stages of his inquiry  which he took over from the f b i  in may 2017 after agents opened it nearly two and a half years ago the country needs a credible resolution of these issues  mr  barr said the fate of mr  muellers findings  an expected report  was a recurring topic  mr  barr said that mr  muellers report to the attorney general will be confidential  but the attorney general will then produce his own report to congress based on that material  he said that he intended to be as transparent as possible given grand jury secrecy rules  but that he would not let the white house edit or change it  as the presidents lawyer  rudy giuliani  has suggested may happen that will not happen  mr  barr said  nicholas fandosthroughout the hearing  mr  barr espoused surprisingly more moderate views than he has previously  and not only about presidential power and law enforcement independence  he also found himself backpedaling a bit when pressed about his defense of mr  trump s push for an investigation into hillary clinton  mr  barr had said in 2017 that he saw far more basis to investigate the obama administrations approval of the sale of a canadian mining company to a russian state owned corporation than to investigate possible trump campaign coordination with russias election interference the sale  which was approved while hillary clinton was secretary of state  has been the subject of a conspiracy theory about mrs  clinton and her familys foundation that circulates in some conservative circles despite being debunked mr  barr initially suggested his comment  which appeared in a new york times article  had been mischaracterized  the reporter who wrote the article  peter baker  tweeted mr  barrs 2017 email containing the comment in full  putting to rest the possibility of misinterpretation  senator richard blumenthal  democrat of connecticut  later read aloud from the tweeted email during the hearing  noting that mr  barr had testified earlier about the seriousness of russias election meddling and pressing him about why he would assert that the uranium one sale deserved more scrutiny  mr  barr hemmed and hawed  acknowledging that he had no specific information about uranium one that would say that it had not been handled appropriately and that he did not mean the clinton foundation merited a criminal investigation he suggested that he been using it really as an example of the kinds of things that were floating around and some people felt had to be looked at too  to make the point that calling for investigations into political opponents was bad  i dont subscribe to this lock her up stuff  he said  referring to a popular chant at mr  trumps political rallies about jailing mrs  clinton  charlie savagethe justice department has held for decades time that indicting or criminally prosecuting a president while in office would violate the constitution by undermining his ability to do his job  despite a spirited legal debate about the validity of those opinions  mr  barr said he saw no reason to revisit them i actually havent read those opinions in a long time  but i see no reason to change them  he said  in response to prompt by senator richard blumenthal  democrat of connecticut  who said he believed the president could be indicted while in office and a trial postponed until his time there ended  nicholas fandosdemocrats tried repeatedly to get mr  barr to chastise mr  trump for his attacks on federal law enforcement and condemn his fanciful use of facts  mr  barr did not take the bait  and his response may offer an early glimpse of how he might navigate one of the most uncomfortable positions in the government  overseeing and defending an investigation loathed by the president who nominated him even as he offered a consistent defense of mr  mueller  i have the utmost respect for bob  and pledged to defend his investigation  mr  barr pointedly declined to criticize the president directing unrelenting attacks on investigators and elements of the justice department itself  and he said he was not concerned by what senator mazie hirono  democrat of hawaii  called the way donald trump undermines the institutions in our society that help us to maintain a moral consensus with false information instead  mr  barr suggested that the presidents position was a reasonable one  at least as it pertained to the mueller inquiry its understandable that if someone felt they were falsely accused they would view an investigation as something like a witch hunt where someone like you or me who doesnt know the facts  you know  might not use that term  mr  barr said  nicholas fandossenators of both parties extended career guidance  praise and even snacks to liam daly  mr  barrs young grandson who sat through the hourslong hearing liams parents are both justice department leaders  and he was deeply engaged in the confirmation process you are doing great so far  he wrote in a note to mr  barr that was captured by a reuters photographer  i am having so much fun after mr  barr said that russia posed a threat to the united states  liam offered a subtle adjustment  i think russias people are fine  he wrote to his grandfather  the government is the problem liam  8  is also an avid reader of the childrens edition of the new york times  a justice department official confirmed  mr  barrs wife bought him a subscription  liam found a recent article on the supreme court interesting  the official said  katie bennersenators have asked mr  barr about the last attorney general  they have called out former top f b i  officials by name  and they have spent an inordinate amount of time playfully counseling his grandson by name  but they have hardly mentioned the acting attorney general  matthew g  whitaker mr  whitaker had proven to be a lightning rod for scrutiny since he took over the justice department when former attorney general jeff sessions was fired late last year  he ignored the advice of ethics experts at the department and decided to take a direct role overseeing the mueller investigation  an inquiry of which he has been highly critical  and democrats argue that his temporary appointment was legally dubious in the first place democrats on the house judiciary committee announced on tuesday that they had reached an agreement for mr  whitaker to testify in public on feb  8  the committees chairman  representative jerrold nadler of new york  said he expected mr  whitaker to appear whether or not the current lapse in appropriations has been resolved  and whether or not the senate has confirmed a new attorney general  nicholas fandosmr  barr took a hawkish stance on china that comports with the trump administrations view  calling it the primary rival of the united states and praising former attorney general jeff sessions for cracking down on chinese intellectual property theft and espionage while he was general counsel of verizon  mr  barr said  he was well aware of the potential national security threat posed by the chinese telecommunications and tech equipment companies huawei and zte  the intelligence community has long warned that firms were too close to the chinese government and that they could use their products to monitor communications on behalf of beijing  katie bennerunder questioning by senator dianne feinstein  democrat of california  mr  barr pledged to obey and uphold a 2015 law that restricts interrogators to the techniques listed in the army field manual that was an important change because i think it gave clarity to the law and i will support that  mr  barr said ms  feinstein  who chaired the senate intelligence committee when it produced a lengthy investigative report about the c i a s torture program under the bush administration  noted that it had relied upon secret memos by the justice departments office of legal counsel blessing techniques like extended sleep deprivation and the suffocation tactic known as waterboarding despite anti torture laws she also noted that in 2005  mr  barr had defended president bushs purported legal right to withhold geneva convention protections from terrorism detainees and to submit them to coercive interrogation  including inflicting pain  discomfort and other things to make people talk so long as it does not involve the gratuitous barbarity involved in torture pressed by ms  feinstein about whether waterboarding counted as torture  mr  barr said he did not know if it counted as such under the law in 2005  but that because of the newer law  right now its prohibited  so  you know  the law has definitively dealt with that  charlie savagetheir tones were starkly different  but a coalition of liberal and conservative senators who teamed up last year to push into law major revisions to federal sentencing and prison laws pressed to make sure mr  barr understood that times had changed since he was last in office during your previous tenure as attorney general  you literally wrote the book on mass incarceration or wrote this report  said senator cory booker  democrat of new jersey  referencing a 1992 justice department memorandum  the case for more incarceration  mr  booker urged mr  barr to say that the spike in incarceration caused by those policies had disproportionately affected black americans senator charles e  grassley  republican of iowa  sought assurances that mr  barr that he would implement the new bill  which lowers mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders  promotes anti recidivism programs  and expands early release the short answer was yes  but mr  barr bristled at the suggestion he was hostile to the bill  he said he viewed tough on crime policies of the 1980s and 1990s  when he was last in office  as responsible for the ensuing drop in violent crime i dont think comparing the policies that were in effect in 1992 to the situation now is really fair  he told mr  grassley  he added  i think the time was right to take stock and make changes to our penal system based on our current experience  nicholas fandosdemocratic senators wanted other assurances of noninterference  too  particularly for regular federal prosecutors who be separately investigating mr  trump or building cases that could be damaging to his interests  here  mr  barr drew a distinction between the special counsels investigation  which is governed by special rules  and matters considered through the departments normal channels i have the responsibility to use my judgment and discretion that are inherent in the office of attorney general to supervise  he said  referring to cases brought through the usual order  to let individual u s  attorneys work without supervision or make assurances about individual investigations would be an abdication of that responsibility  he said mr  barr said that he would not stand for efforts to interfere or scuttle investigations within the department for political reasons  but offered a caveat about presidential power i would not stand by and allow  you know  an investigation to be stopped if i thought it was a lawful investigation  he said  i wouldnt stand by for that  but the president is free to fire his  you know  officials that hes appointed democrats had at least one high profile case in mind  prosecutors in the southern district of new york have built a case that has implicated mr  trump in a scheme to pay hush money to two women during the 2016 campaign to stop them from speaking publicly about affairs they said they had with him the point is  mr  barr said  if someone tried to stop a bona fide  lawful investigation to cover up wrongdoing  i would resign  nicholas fandosasked whether he would consider jailing journalists for doing their jobs  mr  barr paused before explaining that he could conceive of situations as a last resort where a news organization or journalist needs to be held accountable for putting out stuff that they know will harm the country the justice department has cracked down in recent years on government employees who share classified information with reporters  under former president barack obama  the justice department prosecuted more leaks than all previous administrations combined  reporters are loathe to reveal sources  and some have been jailed for refusing a judges orders to do so mr  barrs hesitation may have been because of the justice departments long pursuit of the wikileaks founder julian assange over the sites publication of troves of secret government papers  obama era lawyers debated whether to charge him but held off because they could never decide on a clear answer to the question of how his work differed from that of traditional news organizations but prosecutors have secretly charged him  they mistakenly revealed last year  raising questions of whether they set aside concerns about setting a precedent that would chill press freedoms because of wikileaks release of stolen democratic emails that russian intelligence operatives hacked during the 2016 election   katie bennermr  barr said he agrees with the president about the need to change the nations immigration laws  including his demand for a border wall that has prompted the nations longest government shutdown we need money right now for border security  including barriers and walls and slats and other things  mr  barr said  anything that makes sense in different areas of the border tuesday marked the 25th day of the partial government shutdown with little indication that mr  trump and congressional democrats were any closer to a compromise on funding for a border wall mr  barr said he would like to see an agreement between lawmakers and the president that recognizes the need for border security  and part of that common sense matter needs barriers  eileen sullivanasked what he would do if confronted with a situation where he might have to resign  mr  barr cited his age and his previous stint as attorney general to say he will be unshackled from politics to make the right decision  regardless of whether it is politically prudent for his career or for the president it might give me pause if i was 45 or 50 years old  but it doesnt give me pause right now  said mr  barr  68 he added  i will not be bullied into doing anything i think is wrong by anybody whether it be editorial boards or congress or the president  im going to do what i think is right  michael s  schmidtmr  barr has long advanced an unusually expansive view of executive authority  he has portrayed the president  not the attorney general  as the nations top law enforcement official  and suggested that congress cannot bar a president from using his executive powers  like to pardon someone or start or stop a law enforcement proceeding  in a corrupt way this has raised the question of whether his permissive theories would unleash mr  trump  who is not known for his self restraint  but in several ways on tuesday  mr  barr appeared to walk back or qualify some of his earlier writings  putting greater emphasis on the justice departments independence and legal limits on the presidency for example  mr  barr said that if a president directed the justice department to close an investigation to protect himself or his family  that would violate the constitution  and asked by senator patrick leahy  democrat of vermont  whether a president could pardon someone in exchange for a promise not to incriminate him  mr  barr said that would be a crime  charlie savagemr  barr defended as entirely proper his decision to write an unsolicited  lengthy memo to the trump administration legal team in june arguing that mr  mueller should not be permitted to investigate the president for violating criminal obstruction of justice laws based on how he chose to exercise his constitutional powers  like to fire a subordinate or order an investigation closed mr  barr stressed that he was in the dark about what mr  muellers obstruction theory was  and said that he was merely speculating  he emphasized that his concern was the ramifications down the road of establishing such a rule one theory in particular that appeared to be under consideration under a specific statute concerned me because i thought it would involve stretching the statute beyond what was intended and would do it in a way that would have serious adverse consequences for all agencies that are involved in the administration of justice  especially the department of justice  he said  and i thought it would have a chilling effect going forward over time  charlie savagems  feinstein read excerpts from mr  barrs writings on a presidents purported power to control all law enforcement activity and said she intended to press him on whether he would resist political interference from mr  trump  noting his calls for new criminal inquiries into democrats like hillary clinton its important that the next attorney general be able to strongly resist pressure  whether from the administration or congress to conduct investigations for political purposes  she said  you must have the integrity  the strength and the fortitude to tell the president no  regardless of the consequences in his opening statement  mr  barr appeared to embrace that principle the attorney general must ensure that the administration of justice  the enforcement of the law  is above and away from politics  he said  nothing could be more destructive of our system of government  of the rule of law  or the department of justice as an institution than any toleration of political interference with the enforcement of the law  charlie savagemr  barr briefly spoke of his commitment to public service and the justice department  he noted that most of his children are government lawyers  including one in a top position at the justice department  one of his three daughters coordinates the departments response to the opioid crisis  and a son in law also works in the departments national security division somebody needs to make money in the family  joked mr  graham  katie bennerwhen mr  barr was nominated to serve as attorney general the first time in 1991  the democratic senate unanimously confirmed him by voice vote  he should not expect such a smooth ride this time around  but with republicans in control of the chamber by a 53 to 47 majority  his confirmation appears to be on track two wild cards could scramble the usual partisan divide  a handful of moderate republicans facing re election fights in 2020 or simply skeptical of mr  trumps intentions could theoretically swing against mr  barr if he fails to convince them that he would stand up for the special counsel  if these senators  cory gardner of colorado  susan collins of maine  thom tillis of north carolina  mitt romney of utah and others  banded together with a united democratic caucus  they could kill the confirmation but democrats may also be motivated to quickly move mr  barr through confirmation  they have been highly critical of the acting attorney general  matthew g  whitaker  a trump loyalist whom they view as a direct threat to mr  mueller  and want him out of office as quickly as possible  if they view mr  barr as sincere in his public assurances about the investigation  it is a swap many democrats might eagerly make  nicholas fandos.

raleigh  n c   when republicans took control of virtually every lever of north carolinas state government for the first time since reconstruction  they set out to transform the historically moderate southern state into a more conservative stronghold that was less than seven years ago these days  the question is how much republicans may have set their project back with a recent string of remarkable self inflicted wounds its never a dull moment with the republicans here  said morgan jackson  a democratic strategist and an ally of gov  roy cooper  the democrat whose november 2016 election was helped along by the protracted fight over a republican backed bill limiting the bathroom choices of transgender people  every time we think it cant get worse  they figure out a way to dig deeper this week  federal prosecutors announced that the chairman of the states republican party  robin hayes  had been indicted on charges of bribery and other crimes related to a scheme they said was designed to aid a major donor  who was also charged  the revelation came almost six weeks after republicans faced the rare embarrassment of watching their seeming victory in a congressional race unravel after it became clear that their nominee had financed an illicit voter turnout effort  read  inside a fly by night operation to harvest ballots in north carolina for the states republicans  who rose to power by railing against cases of democratic corruption and promising to be a positive disrupting force  the fresh scandals amount to a staggering record of self disruption for the states liberals  it has been a moment to bask in schadenfreude  over the last several years  they watched and warred with north carolina republicans amid aggressive conservative efforts to deregulate industry  play down climate change  curtail access to the ballot box  strip a democratic governor of some executive powers  launch their so called bathroom bill and gerrymander districts in ways that made the courts recoil republicans won some of those fights and lost others  but the hard right turn plunged the state into years of intense partisan warfare rife with high profile boycotts and large scale public demonstrations it is this record  and the recent bouts with scandal  that could also affect state and national elections next year mr  cooper will be up for re election  as will senator thom tillis  a republican whose delicate political situation was recently underscored by his opposition to  then eventual support of  president trumps controversial executive action to fund a border wall and once again  this battleground state will be up for grabs in a presidential race  one that will unfold as charlotte  the states largest city  hosts the republican national convention  where mr  trump is likely to make his case for re election but there is also a chance that democrats might end up ensnared in the most recent federal probe the donor who was charged  greg e  lindberg  the chairman of an investment firm in durham  gave money to both parties  in the indictment unsealed tuesday  federal prosecutors said mr  lindberg worked with mr  hayes to bribe the state insurance commissioner  mike causey  with campaign donations in the hopes that mr  causey would replace a state regulator who oversaw a company that mr  lindberg owned mr  hayes  who is a former congressman  mr  lindberg and two other men who were charged pleaded not guilty on tuesday in appearances before a federal magistrate in charlotte mr  causey  a republican  tipped off federal investigators about possible corruption and later worked closely with them during their protracted inquiry  in an interview on wednesday  mr  causey said he did not expect republicans to be alone in facing the fallout this is certainly not a party thing  mr  causey said  adding  i think when the facts come out  youre going to see both parties in the same boat mr  causey would not elaborate  and a spokeswoman for the f b i  declined to comment although the indictment focused on mr  lindbergs dealings with republicans  his ties to democrats have also been under scrutiny in recent months wayne goodwin  a former insurance commissioner who is now chairman of the north carolina democratic party  accepted donations from mr  lindberg and later consulted for him  mr  goodwin told the wall street journal this year that he was not a target of the federal inquiry  with which he said he cooperated the speculation around mr  goodwin  who has not been charged  did not keep his state party operation from taking a gleeful swing at its opponent  in a statement  democrats mashed the scandals together and also nodded to the turmoil surrounding representative mark walker  a north carolina republican whose ties to mr  lindberg were referenced in the indictment that became public this week   mr  walker was not charged with a crime and was not identified by name in the indictment  bribery  election fraud  witness tampering  lying to the f b i   wednesdays democratic party statement declared  adding that 2019 would be the year when north carolina republicans corruption finally became public and the partys leading figures became fully engulfed in chaos carter wrenn  a longtime republican consultant in north carolina  said the allegations of chicanery created a smell in the air and around the republican party  the party  he said  would do well to try to quickly isolate the scandals indeed  the republican party played down the idea of chaos  even as it moved to put a limited distance between itself and the accused  in a statement on wednesday  it said mr  hayes had relinquished most of his day to day duties and that another republican leader  aubrey woodard  had been named acting chairman  on monday  the day before his indictment became public  mr  hayes said he planned to step down later this year as party chairman  citing his health the indictment is a dramatic turn of events for mr  hayes  73  a former state house majority whip whose family founded the cannon mills textiles company  and who has long been an advocate of integrating biblical principles into state government  he opposes abortion and was criticized  in an unsuccessful 1996 run for governor  for supporting a sex education curriculum that promoted abstinence and recommended cleaning genitals with lysol disinfectant after sex to critics  the new instability is a consequence of the partys years of dominance  when they controlled the executive mansion and had a supermajority in the general assembly until this year theres been literally no check on these folks  except for the courts  said allison riggs  a senior lawyer at the southern coalition for social justice who has been involved in fighting republican redistricting efforts in north carolina pat mccrory  a business minded former charlotte mayor  was elected governor in 2012 and helped cement republican power in north carolina  but the partys state legislative leaders often set the aggressive tone  in march 2016  republicans led the charge on the law that became known as h b  2  which curbed legal protections for lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender people and set new restrictions on transgender bathroom use the resulting national backlash  with boycotts and threats of boycotts  allowed mr  cooper  who was then challenging mr  mccrory  to argue that republicans were harming the business climate  in november 2016  on a night when mr  trump won the state  mr  cooper did  too  by a slim margin  a few months later  he and the legislature arrived at a compromise to repeal the law last year  the republicans power was further weakened when they lost their veto proof majorities in the legislature but they are majorities still  proof of the continued power of conservative ideas in north carolina in an interview in his office on wednesday  senator phil berger  the president pro tempore of the north carolina senate and long one of the most influential republicans in the state  cautioned against drawing immediate conclusions about how the scandals would influence voters still  he acknowledged that it was frustrating that scandals were so often overshadowing republican policy achievements stepping on a rake  mr  berger said with a light chuckle  i see it as some republicans doing something that creates problems for the vast majority of republicans who havent done anything wrong .

look at the numbers  and something of a mystery emerges regarding the trump administrations claims of a surge of uncontrolled arrivals net migration across the southern border is at historic lows  border apprehensions of unauthorized arrivals were at the lowest in modern record in 2017 and 2018  apprehensions are up this spring  but still far below the highs of the 1980s  1990s or early 2000s yet processing centers and detention centers are filling  some to near capacity  straining to meet even basic medical needs of migrant families  images from the border show women and children huddling in overcrowded facilities the answer  immigration experts say  is that the crisis isnt primarily caused by the number of arrivals  but by trump administration policies that disperse them to a handful of centers and that treat families who voluntarily surrender as invaders  creating the appearance of an invasion far from being unique to the trump administration  it is merely the latest in a pattern across western democracies  where anti immigration sentiment is driving demand for harsh policies that may not only fail to reduce arrivals  but to also make the problem look even more uncontrolled and overwhelming the causes of that self reinforcing cycle may run far deeper than policy mismatch or even matters of immigration economic dislocation and demographic change have provoked feelings of lost control and lost status among some whites  however real or imagined  it is a combination of forces  research suggests  that taps into deep seated instincts to seek safety in a familiar group identity  and to try to reimpose control those feelings tend to focus on borders  even if undocumented immigration is not actually up  and policies that deliver on desires for a strict response can make the problem appear worse  deepening fears of chaos and of being overwhelmed this feedback loop  building in the united states and europe since long before the latest upticks in arrivals  may be a major driver of the populist revolt  and it is playing into the growing global conflict between old style national identities  imagined as homogeneous and fixed  and a world that no longer aligns with them migration is really tough because  as catherine dauvergne said  its the last bastion of sovereignty  said jaya ramji nogales  an immigration scholar at temple universitys law school  at points in history where the demographic shift is changing  thats an easy thing for people to be scared of some 30 years ago  the united states constructed a wall on its southern border between the san ysidro crossing  which links san diego with tijuana  and the pacific ocean this had an unintended effect  it funneled some migrants onto interstate 5  which cut through the barriers  when a handful were hit by cars  transit authorities posted now infamous yellow signs showing a silhouette of a dashing family  widely known as immigrant crossing signs that gave the impression of utter chaos at the border  said douglas s  massey  a princeton university immigration scholar  but nothing had really changed  we were just hardening the border and pushing people into different places the signs fed into a nationwide backlash against unauthorized immigration  mr  massey said  leading the clinton administration to fund more border walls and nearly double border patrol agents but rather than reducing arrivals  this pushed them into desolate routes across the arizona deserts  crossing sparse ranch lands rather than dense cities  the migrant flows came to look far more numerous  mr  massey said  which made a big impression and fed the narrative that there was this new invasion now  that cycle may be playing out again policies meant to deter arrivals are putting them into a handful of centers  concentrating numbers in a way that makes them appear overwhelming  the policies have also put asylum claimants and families  who take some time to process  into facilities designed to house unauthorized migrant workers who can be deported quickly at the same time  the increase may appear larger than it actually is because a greater share of arrivals are voluntarily surrendering  hoping to apply for asylum  this is a right guaranteed under international law  but administration policy functionally treats them like undocumented immigrants  and even criminals  that feeds perceptions of a surge and creates the overcrowded conditions at detention centers the numbers arent that big  but if youre treating families as criminals and arresting them  holding them  the system cant handle that  said mr  massey  the princeton scholar  it makes it look like theres absolute chaos at the border  but the chaos is because we dont have policies that fit the problem a similar cycle has played out in europe and australia  tightened european union land borders  for example  led more refugees to travel by boats  when they sank  as many did  the horrifying episodes deepened europeans sense of chaos the surge of arrivals to europe in 2015 and 2016 was an undeniable crisis  but it also hit on much deeper issues  that may help explain why it also fed into fears around immigration in the united states psychological research suggests that fears about uncontrolled borders may be tied to deeper fears about loss of identity or loss of control human beings desire the sense of safety they get from a strong  familiar group identity  though white people in western countries remain politically and culturally dominant  rising diversity has left some feeling that their status is under threat this is perhaps why heavily white areas where children are likely to be less well off than their parents had been are especially likely to support mr  trump  according to a gallup study fear that ones in group will decline in relative power  whatever the cause  can make people feel a sense of loss of control  leading them to cling more firmly to their ethnicity and to see outsiders as a threat  it also tends to make people more nationalistic and more skeptical of immigration  according to a recent study of voters in the united states  britain and poland  which found that this fear predicted support for brexit and for mr  trump the border  as perhaps the most obvious symbol of national identity and territorial protection  is a natural focal point for those fears  and so to many people  it feels true that there is a wave of uncontrolled immigrants and chaos at the border  even if arrivals are low in historic terms and many of the migrants are simply families seeking asylum it may also feel urgently necessary to reimpose order but stricter border policies tend to attract more attention and controversy  and can end up making immigration fears seem even more salient  as the news shows desperate people huddled in makeshift camps  creating the impression of a swamped border  the cycle repeats these sentiments align near perfectly with the drivers of right wing populism  a sense of lost control  a desire to reassert order and a narrowing national identity  and that populist sentiment can feed back into itself global immigration flows are expected to increase over the long term due to climate change  deepening economic disparities and technology assisted ease of travel  demographic trends  though easily overstated  are already making western countries more diverse a populist sentiment that calls for resisting this long underway change is likely to only heighten awareness of it  much like the strict border policies that tend to worsen the appearance of disorder the resulting policies can have the opposite of their intended effect when the clinton administration stepped up deportations  it relocated american born gangs like ms 13 to central america  where they flourished in an environment of poverty and state weakness  today  many central american families are fleeing that gang violence for the united states  in response  mr  trump has cut aid to three countries most threatened by gang violence these policies can bring significant harm to the migrants and refugees that they target when you have women and children behind fences under a bridge  thats bad optics  mr  massey said  referring to makeshift migrant detention practices in texas that left children sleeping on gravel and under mylar blankets  its causing a lot of human damage .
albuquerque  almost immediately after president trump declared a national emergency on friday so he could proceed with his ambition to build a wall along the border with mexico  some of his opponents announced their next move  well see you in court citing a dearth of evidence for a border crisis and fears over what is shaping into a colossal seizure of private property by the federal government  the texas county of el paso  together with human rights and pro democracy groups  said on friday that they planned to file a lawsuit almost immediately seeking to block the declaration the groups argue that communities along the border would be harmed  not saved  by the construction of the wall  and that mr  trump had no legal basis for declaring an emergency  theirs would be the first in an array of legal challenges already coalescing in an effort to thwart mr  trumps plan there is zero factual support for the existence of a national emergency at the border  said thomas a  saenz  president and general counsel of the mexican american legal defense and educational fund  one of the groups preparing to challenge mr  trump in court  the declaration  mr  saenz added  would be a laughable object of ridicule were it not so dangerous  read the first edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up for it here  the brewing legal battles are likely to focus on such issues as the rights of private property owners  tribal sovereignty of native americans living along the border  and how far presidential powers extend mr  trump predicted during his declaration of the emergency that he would face legal obstacles  sadly well be sued  and sadly it will go through a process  and happily well win  he said courts have been grappling for at least a decade with lawsuits involving the secure fence act of 2006  legislation passed under former president george w  bush that authorized the construction of about 700 miles of barriers and fencing along the border with mexico  dozens of lawsuits filed by property owners challenging that project are still unresolved the emergency declaration stands in contrast to that previous construction initiative because congress this week refused in its bipartisan budget deal to allocate the funds needed to build the kind of wall the president wants  with mr  trump determined to go forward  these are just some of the legal battles that are expected if the festering tension in south texas over the last decade is any indication  some of the most strident opposition to mr  trumps wall is expected to come from owners of land along the border who face seizure of their property by the federal government to build it landowners in texas  largely in the rio grande valley  filed hundreds of lawsuits aiming to block the bush administration from building fencing along the border  some property owners opposed the governments seizure of their land  while others said the compensation offered by federal authorities was too low attention may now shift farther west to el paso  broad criticism of mr  trump in that city  a democratic bastion in a state otherwise largely dominated by republicans  emerged in recent days over the presidents widely discredited claim that border fencing had reduced crime there el paso county  which encompasses the city of el paso and is home to about 800 000 people  joined the border network for human rights  protect democracy  a group aiming to curb authoritarian style politics  and the niskanen center  a nonpartisan think tank  in preparing a lawsuit over mr  trumps declaration ricardo samaniego  who heads the governing county court of commissioners  said that mr  trumps emergency declaration will further damage el paso countys reputation and economy  and we are determined to stop this from happening precedent suggests that those living in the path of the planned wall may have a difficult time challenging it in court  landowners have lost nearly all of the earlier cases aimed at preventing the federal government from seizing their property  though some ended up securing more compensation than initially offered democratic leaders in congress have vowed to overturn the emergency declaration  this is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president  who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process  speaker nancy pelosi of california and senator chuck schumer of new york  the minority leader  said in a joint statement california officials announced on friday that they planned to sue and said they hoped other states would join  the president is exploiting a serious law  the states attorney general  xavier becerra  said at a news conference with gov  gavin newsom  there is no emergency here for the nation mr  newsom said that california would be affected by construction of a wall more than any other state  fortunately donald trump is not the last word  he said  the courts will be the last word another legal battle already underway involves the sovereignty of native americans living along the border leaders of the tohono oodham nation  whose land in arizona runs along 75 miles of the border  have already announced opposition to the border wall by taking their fight to the inter american commission on human rights  a part of the organization of american states aimed at preventing rights abuses tohono leaders say that a wall infringes on the right to freedom of movement among the tribes members  who live on both sides of the border  verlon m  jose  vice chairman of the tohono nation  has said that the trump administration would have to build the wall over my dead body the tohono oodhams petition at the human rights commission seeks to impede more wall construction  other tribes along the border  including the kickapoo in texas  the kumeyaay in california and the cocopah in arizona  are examining how to proceed after mr  trumps declaration still  the trump administration has been loath to respond to claims of rights abuses  and it has stopped cooperating with united nations human rights investigators that could mean that tribes need to rely on the legal system in the united states to resolve differences over the wall environmental groups are also mobilizing to fight the wall in court  but recent legal decisions raise doubts about their ability to successfully argue that federal authorities are circumventing environmental laws the supreme court declined in december to hear a challenge by conservation groups to the proposed wall construction in california  leaving in place a ruling by a federal judge in san diego that allowed construction to proceed the plaintiffs in that case argued that the wall would violate environmental laws and imperil habitats for some animals  they unsuccessfully challenged a 1996 law that allows the department of homeland security to waive other laws in order to build walls or barriers on the border even if an environmental challenge might have an uphill climb in the courts  it could have the effect of delaying wall construction in parts of the border  potentially for months or years i expect legal challenges to tie this up for a long time  said cristina rodriguez  a professor at yale law school  the president and his people are aware of this  but they may care more about the optics of the wall than what actually happens on the border .
washington  the supreme court agreed on friday to decide whether the trump administration may add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census questionnaire that will be sent to every household in the nation the courts move added a highly charged and consequential blockbuster to what had been a fairly sleepy term  the justices have mostly avoided controversy while they adjusted to the new conservative majority created by the arrival in the fall of justice brett m  kavanaugh the federal government has long gathered information about citizenship  but since 1950  it has not included a question on it in the forms sent once a decade to each household  last month  a federal trial judge blocked the commerce department from adding the question  saying that the process that led to the decision was deeply flawed the supreme court stepped in before any appeals court had ruled on the matter  and it put the case on an unusually fast track  the supreme courts speed was almost certainly a result of a looming deadline  the census forms are set to be printed in june without immediate action from the court  the solicitor general  noel j  francisco  told the justices  the government will be disabled for a decade from obtaining citizenship data through an enumeration of the entire population the supreme court scheduled arguments for late april  and it is expected to rule before the end of june the case  united states department of commerce v  new york  no  18 966  is the latest test of the scope of executive power in the trump era  last year  the justices upheld president trumps authority to restrict travel from several predominantly muslim countries  more recently  the court rejected the administrations request to reinstate a ban on asylum claims by immigrants who cross the southern border illegally on friday  mr  trump said he expected his declaration of a national emergency to build a border wall to be challenged in court  he predicted that the administration would lose in the lower courts but prevail in the supreme court the census case has its roots in the text of the constitution  which requires an actual enumeration every 10 years  with the house of representatives to be apportioned based on the whole number of persons in each state by its terms  therefore  the constitution mandates that every 10 years the federal government endeavor to count every single person residing in the united states  whether citizen or noncitizen  whether living here with legal status or without  judge jesse m  furman of the federal district court in manhattan wrote last month in his decision  setting out the consensus view critics say that adding the question on citizenship would undermine the accuracy of the census because both legal and unauthorized immigrants might refuse to fill out the forms  by one government estimate  about 6 5 million people might decide not to participate that could reduce democratic representation when congressional districts are drawn in 2021 and affect the distribution of hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending  judge furman found that were the question added  arizona  california  florida  illinois  new york and texas would risk losing seats in the house and that several states could lose federal money dale ho  a lawyer with the american civil liberties union  which challenged the addition of the citizenship question  said that it would cause incalculable damage to our democracy the evidence presented at trial exposed this was the trump administrations plan from the get go  mr  ho said wilbur ross  the commerce secretary  has said that he ordered the question to be added in response to a december 2017 request from the justice department  which said that data about citizenship would help it enforce the voting rights act of 1965 in a detailed decision after an eight day trial  judge furman concluded that mr  ross had dissembled  saying that the evidence is clear that secretary rosss rationale was pretextual while the court is unable to determine  based on the existing record  at least  what secretary rosss real reasons for adding the citizenship question were  it does find  by a preponderance of the evidence  that promoting enforcement of the voting rights act  or v r a   was not his real reason for the decision  judge furman wrote  instead  the court finds that the v r a  was a post hoc rationale for a decision that the secretary had already made for other reasons judge furman had called for mr  ross to be questioned under oath  but the supreme court blocked that order in october  justice neil m  gorsuch  joined by justice clarence thomas  said the court should have gone further  shutting down all pretrial fact gathering in the census case  justice gorsuch added that there was no indication of bad faith in mr  rosss conduct theres nothing unusual about a new cabinet secretary coming to office inclined to favor a different policy direction  soliciting support from other agencies to bolster his views  disagreeing with staff or cutting through red tape  justice gorsuch wrote at the time  of course  some people may disagree with the policy and process  but until now  at least  this much has never been thought enough to justify a claim of bad faith and launch an inquisition into a cabinet secretarys motives in november  the supreme court rejected a request from the trump administration to halt the trial  over the dissents of justices thomas  gorsuch and samuel a  alito jr in his ruling last month  judge furman relied on evidence in the so called administrative record  meaning the materials the government said mr  ross had considered before making his decision evidence presented at the trial showed that mr  ross had wanted to add the question long before the request from the justice department  the letter from the justice department  judge furman wrote  was an attempt to launder their request through another agency  that is  to obtain cover for a decision that they had already made documents disclosed in the case showed that mr  ross had discussed the citizenship issue early in his tenure with stephen k  bannon  the former white house chief strategist and an architect of the trump administrations tough policies against immigrants  and that mr  ross had met at mr  bannons direction with kris kobach  the former kansas secretary of state and a vehement opponent of unlawful immigration in a startling number of ways  judge furman wrote  secretary rosss explanations for his decision were unsupported by  or even counter to  the evidence before the agency judge furman ruled that the administration had violated federal statutes  but he rejected a constitutional challenge based on equal protection principles  saying that there was not enough evidence in the record to conclude that mr  ross had intended to discriminate against minorities and unauthorized immigrants the lawsuit challenging the addition of the question was filed by new york  other states  localities and advocacy groups  they said that asking the question was a calculated effort by the administration to discriminate against immigrants adding a question about citizenship to the census would incite widespread fear in immigrant communities and greatly impair the accuracy of population counts  letitia james  new yorks attorney general  said on friday after the supreme court agreed to hear the case in urging the supreme court to review judge furmans decision  mr  francisco  representing the trump administration  wrote that mr  ross had wide discretion over the census that could not be second guessed by courts  he added that questions about citizenship have often been asked of at least a sample of the population in many earlier censuses and are commonplace in ones conducted by other developed democracies .
good morning  want to get california today by email  heres the sign up  this week  my colleague tim arango wrote about the rocky  contentious rollout of a new law that requires police departments to make public more records about officers conduct the law suddenly made california  which has one of the nations highest rates of police shootings  among the most open states when it comes to police records  for decades  it has been one of the most secretive  the change has caused friction between law enforcement agencies and those pushing for transparency  including journalists and family members of people who have been killed by the police  thats where tim picks up the issue today  more than a quarter of a million dollars to provide public police records the san diego sheriffs department this week told kpbs that it would cost  354 524 22 to provide records on police shootings that the television channel had requested under a new state law that response  kpbs said  is the latest development in a battle between law enforcement agencies and media organizations across the state with lawsuits pending  how much departments can charge to provide records is a new front in what will most likely be a long  multifaceted fight several stories were published this week about departments charging thousands of dollars to meet requests  something the american civil liberties union argues undercuts the intent of the law  in anaheim  a woman was asked to put down a  3 000 deposit when she asked for records from her sons killing by the anaheim police in 2009  according to fox 11  the voice of san diego was told by the sheriffs department it would have to pay  246 759 32 to obtain the records it wants  sara libby  the outlets managing editor  wrote on twitter some departments are citing the precedent of a case in which the national lawyers guild sued the california city of hayward to obtain body camera footage  an appellate judge in that case ruled that those seeking records can be forced to pay the labor costs for officers to review records and make redactions but the california supreme court agreed to review the case  which means its no longer a binding precedent  said alan schlosser  senior counsel at the a c l u  in northern california  who is representing the lawyers guild in the case right now the issue is undecided  said mr  schlosser  whose brief for the supreme court is due today at stake  he said  is the validity of the new law  depending on its interpretation  the records could remain secret unless you pay for families who have lost loved ones in police shootings  the new law promised a measure of healing  but the debate means many of those families will have to keep waiting its been 10 years now  said donna hernandez  whose son

everyone is lining up to endorse the green new deal  or to mock it  kamala harris  cory booker  bernie sanders  elizabeth warren and kirsten gillibrand have all endorsed the resolution sponsored by representative alexandria ocasio cortez of new york and senator edward markey of massachusetts conservative critics predictably call it a shocking document and a call for enviro socialism in america  but liberal condescension has cut deeper  the house speaker  nancy pelosi  essentially dismissed it as branding  saying  the green dream  or whatever they call it  nobody knows what it is  but theyre for it  right  others have criticized it for leaving out any mention of a carbon tax  a cornerstone of mainstream climate policy proposals  while embracing a left populist agenda that includes universal health care  stronger labor rights and a jobs guarantee  what do these goals have to do with stabilizing atmospheric carbon levels before climate change makes large parts of the world uninhabitable  what has taken liberal critics aback is that the green new deal strays so far from the traditional environmental emphasis on controlling pollution  which the carbon tax aims to do  and tries to solve the problems of economic inequality  poverty and even corporate concentration  theres an antimonopoly clause  but this everything and the carbon sink strategy is actually a feature of the approach  not a bug  and not only for reasons of ideological branding  in the 21st century  environmental policy is economic policy  keeping the two separate isnt a feat of intellectual discipline  its an anachronism our carbon emissions are not mainly about the price of gasoline or electricity  theyre about infrastructure  for every human being  there are over 1 000 tons of built environment  roads  office buildings  power plants  cars and trains and long haul trucks  it is a technological exoskeleton for the species  everything most of us do  we do through it  calling our parents  getting to work  moving for a job  taking the family on vacation  finding food for the evening or staying warm in a polar vortex  just being human in this artificial world implies a definite carbon footprint  and for that matter  a trail of footprints in water use  soil compaction  habitat degradation and pesticide use  you cannot change the climate impact of americans without changing the built american landscape so the proposals to retrofit buildings  retool transportation and build a clean energy system are simply ways of tackling the problem where it starts  they are public works projects because large capital projects  especially ones that  like highways  involve widespread public benefit  have always required public money  they are jobs programs  unless robots do the work  so the jobs might as well be good  the deeper point is that any economic policy is a jobs policy  the oil and gas sector provides at least 1 4 million american jobs  more if you believe industry estimates  and depends on public subsidies and infrastructure  you might say that producing the disaster of global climate change has taken a lot of economic policy and produced a lot of jobs programs  reversing direction will take the same  since environmental policy can happen only through economic policy  there is no avoiding decisions about what sorts of work there will be  and in which industries  its unsettling  but maybe a little less so when you consider that weve been doing it all along  usually without owning up to it take the green new deals proposal to work with family farmers and ranchers to reduce the carbon footprint of agriculture  it might sound like a sop to rural representatives  the locavore caucus of the democratic socialists of america  or both   and that wouldnt make it wrong   but food is our everyday metabolism with the natural world  which is why agriculture emits 9 percent of united states carbon  according to the environmental protection agency   other estimates are considerably higher  forty percent of our land is farmed or ranched  which is to say  the soil is basically conscripted as a food factory  the food system is already pervasively shaped by the farm bill  which spends nearly  15 billion per year on subsidies and  10 billion on conservation measures  deeply shaping what farmers grow and where  and tending to benefit large  industrially oriented operations  food production can be much less carbon intensive with changed practices in cropping  fertilizing  irrigation and waste management  many of them well suited to small farming  moving in that direction  though  would require rattling the cage of big american agriculture as with energy  getting lawmaking involved wouldnt be new  it has taken years of agricultural policy to get us into this mess  getting out of it is a question not of whether lawmaking also produces economic policy and jobs  but of what kind the green new deal isnt the only approach  of course  but its broad ambitions mark out the ground where future climate fights will happen  because reshaping our environmental impact means reworking our economy  there will inevitably be competing visions about who deserves to benefit and what kind of economy we should build  centrist proposals will concentrate on promoting investment in new technologies  with profits going  pharma style  to private researchers and manufacturers if trumpist nationalism outgrows its climate denialism but survives to fight again  it will double down on supporting national energy industries and denying the ethical responsibilities of global interdependence by building border walls against climate refugees  to the left of the green new deal  there will be louder calls to nationalize fossil fuels in order to leave them in the ground   a carbon tax would be compatible with any of these visions  depending on who paid it and how the revenues were spent  curiously  the idea that environmental policy could ever be separated from the larger economic order  or from fights over fairness  is recent  a product of an unusually technocratic period in american politics  arguing for the clean air act on earth day 1970  senator edmund muskie  democrat of maine and the laws lead drafter  insisted that mans environment included the shape of the communities in which he lives and that the only kind of society that has a chance was a society that will not tolerate slums for some and decent houses for others  rats for some and playgrounds for others  clean air for some and filth for others for senator muskie  environmentalism meant that no neighborhood or job should be toxic  in the three years that followed  the country adopted the most ambitious and effective environmental legislation in its history  including mr  muskies clean air act  the clean water act and the endangered species act  mr  muskies approach remains a model of visionary environmental lawmaking  like much new radicalism  the green new deal is good sense rediscovered .
washington  the democratic takeover of the house of representatives was a blessing in disguise for a president who needed a foil  republicans predicted last november  president trump  who had only the press and the special counsel to battle with  they said  would find a useful antagonist in speaker nancy pelosi it hasnt exactly turned out that way after a series of misadventures  mr  trump has conspicuously laid off personal attacks aimed at ms  pelosi  even as the standoff over funding a border wall appears to be finally ending with a deal seen as a defeat for the president  he has blamed unnamed democrats but not their most prominent leader  and there has been no undermining trumpian nickname  the president has said his moniker for ms  pelosi is  simply  nancy mr  trump  who once stalked hillary clinton  the former democratic nominee  around the presidential debate stage and continues to encourage lock her up chants at his rallies more than two years later  simply gazed up at ms  pelosi during his state of the union address  and then found himself the target of ridicule for the picture of her giving him what appeared to be a dismissive clap of the hands she has a unified democratic caucus behind her  and shes not intimidated  said representative katherine m  clark  democrat of massachusetts  i dont think that donald trump has run into that too often in his life  and he doesnt know quite what to make of it all without his anticipated punching bag  mr  trump has been left searching for an alternative  delivering haphazard attacks on democrats as they announce their presidential campaigns  trial and error hits on an inchoate field of 2020 contenders the question is whether a strategy of personal attacks that helped lift mr  trump to victory in 2016 will work when theres no clear political opponent who rises above the rest amy klobuchar announced that she is running for president  talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow  ice and freezing temperatures  mr  trump wrote on twitter on sunday  bad timing  by the end of her speech she looked like a snowman woman  giving it right back  ms  klobuchar responded  i wonder how your hair would fare in a blizzard on saturday  mr  trump officially welcomed senator elizabeth warren to the presidential field  writing on twitter  today elizabeth warren  sometimes referred to by me as pocahontas  joined the race for president  will she run as our first native american presidential candidate  or has she decided that after 32 years  this is not playing so well anymore  see you on the campaign trail  liz at a rally in el paso on monday night  mr  trump attacked beto orourke  the former texas congressman who is considering a presidential bid  we were challenged by a young man who lost an election to ted cruz  mr  trump said  they said  hey  youre supposed to win in order to run  by the way we  i  im one for one democratic operatives predicted mr  trumps attempts to personally demonize his political opponents wont work when its not one on one hes better with a foil  but unless he can hone in on one or two people  it ends up being less than the sum of its parts  said brian fallon  a former press secretary for mrs  clintons 2016 presidential campaign  if hes scattershot weighing in on everyone who announces a presidential campaign  its not going to have the intended effect mr  trumps allies disagree  the democratic field is both undefined and starting out with positions on the far left  said raj shah  a former white house spokesman who is now advising mr  trumps 2020 campaign  raising the profile of these out of touch positions and their controversies plays to the presidents advantage some of mr  trumps attacks appear to be doing just that  ms  warren  whom mr  trump has long viewed as an easy target  has apologized for identifying herself as native american for two decades  essentially admitting that she did what mr  trump has accused her of  misrepresenting her race republican national committee officials said they credited mr  trump with forcing the native american issue back to the forefront  the president reignited the conversation about her false native american heritage claims last year  and she still cant move past it  said ronna mcdaniel  the committees chairwoman but in general  his denigration of democratic presidential candidates is not being guided by any field data from his campaign about who his most viable opponent is  and what the candidates biggest weaknesses are  according to a campaign operative trump officials said they viewed senator cory booker  senator kamala harris and ms  warren as the three most viable candidates  so far  to enter the race  but mr  trump has not landed on a strategy for diminishing ms  harris  and has praised her instead  i would say  the best opening so far would be kamala harris  mr  trump said in an interview with the new york times last month  better crowd  better enthusiasm  some of the others were very flat meanwhile  he has weighed in on candidates considered second tier  as well as those who have yet to enter the race ms  klobuchars snow blanketed kickoff rally turned into a briefly viral moment that mr  trump simply couldnt pass up  the operative said  his strikes against former vice president joseph r  biden jr   who has yet to decide whether he will run  appear to be in the workshop phase when i say something that you might think is a gaffe  its on purpose  its not a gaffe  mr  trump said at a recent off the record lunch with network anchors  when biden says something dumb  its because hes dumb rather than individuals  mr  trumps campaign operatives  meanwhile  are hoping to elevate democratic positions that seem out of step with the mainstream  like a 70 percent top tax rate  abolishing immigration and customs enforcement and questioning american support for israel the only presidential tweet backed by political advice  they said  was mr  trumps broadside against the green new deal  an ambitious democratic proposal that seeks to combat climate change by calling for the united states to eliminate additional carbon emissions by 2030 brad parscale  mr  trumps campaign manager  discussed the green new deal with mr  trump  an aide said  citing it as an example of a vulnerability for democrats  and a way to brand them as socialists i think it is very important for the democrats to press forward with their green new deal  mr  trump wrote on twitter on saturday  it would be great for the so called carbon footprint to permanently eliminate all planes  cars  cows  oil  gas   the military  even if no other country would do the same  brilliant .
the last government shutdown ended because democrats stood firm against president trumps border wall  but funding will soon run out again  talks between democrats and republicans are in crisis  and mr  trump remains committed  the wall will get built one way or the other  he tweeted on saturday the senates minority leader  chuck schumer  has made it clear that mr  trump wont get his way  democrats are against the wall  house speaker nancy pelosi  who has admirably enforced party discipline  has called the wall immoral yet at the same time  ms  pelosi has emphasized that democrats are committed to border security  she has critiqued the wall on the narrow grounds that government should instead employ evidence based knowledge about how we best secure our border  james clyburn  the majority whip  fleshed out what that might look like  a smart wall  including more border patrol agents  this  too  is immoral its also bad politics  democrats should follow their voters  who increasingly want more open borders  and reframe the immigration debate by rejecting the very notion that the border needs more security and making it clear that the real problem is the denial of migrants rights  the time has come for the democratic party to push for concrete policies to make the border more open there is plainly no need for more security on the border  illegal entries to the united states  as measured by border patrol apprehensions  which the government has long used as a proxy  began to fall at the turn of the century  and have plummeted since 2006  they remain at historic lows today  those who are coming to the country are often central americans fleeing violence that united states policy in the region helped foment and when it comes to drugs  a favorite justification of mr  trumps for his wall  evidence shows that more border security does not stop trafficking  from the 1970s on  every crackdown on a drug smuggling route  whether it was heroin via the french connection or cocaine through the caribbean  has only led to new innovations in the trade that have empowered murderous mexican cartels  some scholars even argue that the rise of fentanyl can be traced to drug interdiction then why  if there isnt truly a crisis on the border  do the democrats continue to invoke the need for more border security  largely because the conversation about the border and immigration has moved so far to the right over the past 30 years  as the linguist george lakoff and sam ferguson  his student at the time  wrote more than a decade ago  the narrow framing of the immigration debate has shaped its politics  defining what count as problems and  as a result  constrains the solutions needed to address that problem  when the problem is defined as illegal immigration  it becomes about the illegal act of crossing the border without papers  and so the logical response to the wave of illegal immigration becomes border security since bill clintons presidency  the border patrol has grown from 4 100 agents in fiscal year 1992 to more than 19 000 today  the united states has built hundreds of miles of border fencing since the 2006 secure fence act  which barack obama  joe biden and hillary clinton voted for  well  i voted for border security  and some of it was a fence  mrs  clinton feebly said in 2016 when pressed about the 2006 vote that within a decade had become controversial democrats have for far too long let their political opponents define the terms of debate  now theyre doing it again  house democrats proposal heading into the negotiations with republicans didnt include funding for new physical barriers or additional border patrol agents  but it did offer significantly increased funding for border security technology thats not only bad for immigrants who  as a result of militarized borders are more likely to be kidnapped  violently assaulted and driven to cross via the lethal desert  its also bad for democrats  who are handing ammunition to the nativist right at a time when republicans are on the back foot and polls show that democratic voters are moving decidedly leftward on immigration and the border  sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  voters used to overwhelmingly favor less immigration  but opinions have changed fast amid an immigrant rights movement that took off in 2006 and partisan polarization driven by aggressive enforcement  in 1994  just 32 percent of democrats and democratic leaning americans and 30 percent of republicans agreed that immigrants strengthened the country  according to the pew research center  but by 2016  the share of democrats who said so had skyrocketed to 78 percent  in 2006  37 percent of democrats said that immigration levels should be decreased  while only 20 percent said that it should be increased  in 2018  40 percent said that it should be increased  with just 16 percent calling for restriction  the same trend has held on border politics  in 2010  47 percent of democrats said that they equally prioritized legalizing undocumented immigrants and better border security and stronger enforcement of immigration laws  while just 29 percent prioritized legalization alone  by 2018  the number prioritizing legalization alone skyrocketed to 51 percent under president trump  polarization has accelerated  and thats a good thing  the vanishing bipartisan consensus orchestrated mammoth deportations and militarized the border in the quixotic hope of placating the nativist right and winning it over to supporting immigration reform  this strategy only inflamed the rights paranoiac ravings and helped move the goal posts to new extremes  which is why we find ourselves  in 2019  with the possibility of beginning a second government shutdown over the wall so  what should the democrats pursue instead  a break with a failed bipartisan consensus representatives alexandria ocasio cortez  ilhan omar  ayanna pressley and rashida tlaib  all democrats who are new to the house  have drafted a letter urging opposition to any deal that increases department of homeland security funding in any form  thats a good start the border must be demilitarized  which would include demolishing the already existing wall and dramatically downsizing the border patrol  criminal sanctions on illegal entry and re entry must be repealed  opportunities for legal immigration  particularly from mexico and central america  must be expanded  the right to asylum must be honored  and citizenship for those who reside here must be a stand alone cause  unencumbered by compromises that are not only distasteful but also politically ineffectual  and that today would provoke opposition from the nativist right and the grass roots left  if democrats stick to the center on immigration  they will find themselves fighting on two fronts  a fight against republicans  with the left at their back  will be far easier to win  and a more noble victory simple realism dictates that no legislation to grant citizenship to the millions of undocumented americans who deserve it will be passed until the republicans are defeated  theres no use trying to appease them  the bipartisan consensus supporting harsh immigration and border enforcement has fractured  democratic elected officials need to catch up .

iowas two republican senators on saturday condemned representative steve kings remark questioning why white supremacy is considered offensive  the latest blowback from party leaders who remained largely silent over the years as the g o p  congressman made racist remarks and demeaning insults about immigrants mr  king  a longtime iowa lawmaker who narrowly won re election in november  drew rebukes from democrats as well and sparked talk of a house censure resolution this week after the new york times published an article about mr  kings influence on president trump  the border wall

carolina  a fellow republican and the senates lone black g o p  member  who called out his party for staying silent on racist comments iowas senior senator  charles e  grassley  also criticized mr  king in remarks to axios published saturday  mr  grassley had endorsed mr  king in november for re election  even after another republican leader had denounced mr  king as a white supremacist iowa

appeared with him at a rally in his district the monday before election day  after he had endorsed a toronto mayoral candidate with neo nazi ties  gov  kim reynolds named mr  king a co chair of her 2018 campaign and declined to distance herself when pressed before the election  saying  i cant be held responsible for everyones comments mr  king has made racist comments for more than a decade that party leaders have mostly ignored  but his statements published thursday in the times went further than ever  triggering a barrage of public criticism from top house republicans as well as a former g o p  presidential candidate and conservatives in the media mr  king took to the house floor on friday to try to explain his remarks  saying he was simply an american nationalist  he did not apologize for his remarks to the times in a statement on saturday  the congressional black caucus called for mr  king to be stripped of his committee assignments  the chairwoman of the committee  karen bass  a democrat of california  said in the statement  like donald trump  steve king has sought again and again to give comfort to white supremacists  something that should never be allowed in the halls of congress or the oval office house minority leader kevin mccarthy  a california republican  was among the party leaders who denounced him  steves language is reckless  wrong and has no place in our society  mr  mccarthy said representative liz cheney of wyoming  the third highest ranking republican in the house  wrote in a tweet that mr  kings remarks are abhorrent and racist and should have no place in our national discourse mr  scotts opinion column in the washington post focused on criticizing his party for frequently failing to condemn people like mr  king some in our party wonder why republicans are constantly accused of racism  it is because of our silence when things like this are said  mr  scott said in a statement after the times article was published online  and in a six minute speech in the house on friday  mr  king strenuously denied that he was a white nationalist or white supremacist i reject those labels and the evil ideology they define  he said  he did not dispute making the original remarks  but argued that he was raising a historical question about how and when the phrases came to be used to criticize people mr  king  a 69 year old former bulldozer operator who is in his ninth term  began his speech by saying he had made a freshman mistake by speaking to the times i regret the heartburn that has poured forth upon this congress and this country and especially in my state and in my congressional district  he said there were rumblings in the house on friday about trying to formally reprimand mr  king  representative tim ryan  democrat of ohio  said that he was considering drafting a house resolution censuring him  and at least one top democratic leader  representative james clyburn of south carolina  the highest ranking african american in congress  told cnn he would support mr  ryans move still  it was far from clear that democrats would actually follow through  house speaker nancy pelosi condemned the comments and acknowledged democratic interest in taking some action  but said late friday she was not prepared to make any announcements democrats are focused on the shutdown fight with the president and may be inclined to let republicans sort out their own dirty laundry and strategists in both parties said the reaction  to some degree  reflects the degree to which mr  king has become a millstone for his party  if mr  king is on the ballot in 2020  they say  it could benefit democrats by depressing support for the senate re election effort of ms  ernst in iowa what i dont like is hes a drag on all our candidates and an in kind contribution to pelosi  said david kochel  a republican strategist in iowa two iowa republicans announced this week they would challenge mr  king in a primary in 2020 for his fourth district seat  he will likely face severe difficulties in raising money if he seeks re election jeb bush  the former 2016 presidential candidate  wrote on twitter  republican leaders must actively support a worthy primary opponent to defeat king  because he wont have the decency to resign the conservative national review published an editorial on friday  dump steve king .
washington  president trump has insisted that he is not going to compromise with democrats to end the government shutdown  and that he is comfortable in his unbendable position  but privately  its sometimes a different story we are getting crushed  mr  trump told his acting chief of staff  mick mulvaney  after watching some recent coverage of the shutdown  according to one person familiar with the conversation  why cant we get a deal the president is confronted by a divided and partially shuttered government with an untested staff that has undergone yet another shake up  polls show that most americans blame him for the government shutdown  and his advisers are warning him of its negative effects on the economy  and as the shutdown enters its 27th day on thursday with no end in sight  most of his top aides would like him to find a way out mr  trump has told them he believes over time the country will not remember the shutdown  but it will remember that he staged a fight over his insistence that the southern border be protected  he wants democrats to come back to the table agreeing with his position on a wall  and he does not understand why they have not but despite his public bravado  and the tweets about radical democrats  mr  trump has had recurring moments of frustration as he takes in negative news coverage of the shutdown  pointing his finger at aides for not delivering the deal he wants  yet the aides say that the president believes he is still playing a strong hand and that any moments of frustration have been fleeting some of his fellow republicans are wondering if there is actually a plan on how to achieve that deal  the white house and its allies have to have a sense of clarity and a sense of achievement on this  and in order to get there you really do have to have a much broader strategy from the beginning  said kevin madden  a republican strategist  this has largely been driven by a reaction to the latest 30 minutes of a cable news cycle to the extent there has been a strategy  aides have encouraged mr  trump to use his state of the union address  scheduled for jan  29  to move public opinion to his side  an opportunity now threatened by speaker nancy pelosis request on wednesday to delay the speech or scrap it all together  but the president shrugged off his democratic antagonists bold move  and did not even mention it at a lunch with a bipartisan group of house members on wednesday  according to an attendee the president remained silent on twitter for much of wednesday  and democrats who met with mr  trump said they found him to be in a congenial mood  it was productive and constructive  said representative josh gottheimer of new jersey  one of seven democrats who attended the meeting the meeting  aides said  had been intended to show moderate democrats just that  that the caricature of mr  trump throwing a temper tantrum and storming out of a meeting  painted last week by ms  pelosi and senator chuck schumer of new york  the minority leader  does not capture the whole picture behind the scenes  meanwhile  the white house is in a moment of transition as west wing staff members become acclimated to the leadership style of a new chief of staff  mr  mulvaney  a former congressman from south carolina  has told aides he has no plans to duplicate the type of chain of command structure preferred by john f  kelly  the retired marine general he replaced  nor did he want to limit anyones access to mr  trump youre all adults  mr  mulvaney told the white house staff members in attendance  according to an administration official in the room  you all have relationships with him  mr  mulvaney said he was not interested in managing those relationships himself mr  mulvaney  who started in an acting capacity on jan  3  after the shutdown was underway  has more experience as a principal than as a staff member  while serving as director of the office of budget and management  he was not particularly close with mr  trump  who aides said came to admire his skills on television under mr  mulvaney  some of the rules of the kelly era have been undone  access to the oval office  for one thing  is easier  where mr  kellys instinct was often to keep extra bodies out of meetings  now aides who want to attend meetings are welcome to grab a chair in the back and sit in in his meeting with his staff  mr  mulvaney brandished a copy of the gatekeepers  how the white house chiefs of staff define every presidency  by the author chris whipple  sharing passages about successful management models from past administrations mr  mulvaney stressed that he didnt need to always be in the room with the president or to sign off on everything  but  he said  he wanted to be kept in the loop unlike his predecessors  according to white house officials  mr  mulvaney is not interested in challenging what has revealed itself to be the one constant in the trump white house  the special status reserved for jared kushner and ivanka trump  the presidents family members and senior advisers  in the west wing mr  mulvaneys more hands off approach to the family members has allowed mr  kushner to position himself among lawmakers on capitol hill as the person who can deliver to mr  trump what he wants  the dynamic  according to multiple white house officials  is similar to the opening days of the administration  when the staff to the new president was just beginning to meet with washington officials and mr  kushner often told people that everything runs through me this time  however  mr  mulvaney is doing nothing to curb his influence  in fact  he is treating mr  kushner and ms  trump as assets  rather than rivals  and they are seeing a new ally  on sunday night they hosted mr  mulvaney and his wife at their kalorama mansion for a social dinner his appearance in b roll shots on cable news channels  traipsing the halls of congress shoulder to shoulder with vice president mike pence  have left current and former trump aides frustrated with the appearance that mr  kushner is serving as a de facto chief of staff  multiple white house officials said he is ascendant in the west wing after his successful role in helping to pass a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill but people close to mr  kushner insist that he is simply trying to provide assistance during a difficult period and is not looking to undermine mr  mulvaneys role  while mr  kushner has insisted he is planning to return to his longer term projects when the shutdown is over under mr  kelly  any conversations with elected officials were required to be coordinated through the former legislative affairs director  marc short  but during mr  mulvaneys tenure  mr  kushner has reached out to democratic lawmakers and then briefed shahira knight  the legislative director  on his calls after the fact  the new system has been greenlighted by mr  mulvaney  who has also shrugged off any issue with mr  kushner taking a lead role but it is not clear that mr  kushners outreach  or any relationships he has forged over the past two years with democratic lawmakers  has resulted in any movement in getting mr  trump the success he is seeking in funding the border wall a senior white house aide said on wednesday night that the view from inside the white house was that neither side was willing to take the leap and compromise  and mr  trumps ability to make a national emergency declaration  the aide said  was still an option that was on the table .
washington  president trump has long claimed that he puts america first overseas  but in two remarkable statements on thursday  mr  trump and his secretary of state  mike pompeo  explicitly favored foreign autocrats over elected american leaders mr  pompeo chose cairo  the site of president barack obamas 2009 address to the islamic world  to deliver a caustic  point by point repudiation of mr  obamas message  he paid tribute to egypts repressive president  abdel fattah el sisi  for his courage in supporting mr  trumps alternative approach about an hour later  on the south lawn of the white house  mr  trump said that chinas communist party bosses negotiated in better faith than the democratic leaders in congress  with whom the president is in a bitter standoff over his border wall that has shut down much of the federal government i find china  frankly  in many ways to be far more honorable than cryin chuck and nancy  i really do  mr  trump said  referring to the senate minority leader  chuck schumer  and speaker nancy pelosi  china is actually much easier to deal with than the opposition party this is the same china that mr  trumps national security strategy designated as one of the greatest threats to american interests  a revisionist power determined to erode american security and prosperity with predatory trade practices  military aggression  and a regime that represses its people while trying to undermine americas democracy mr  trumps affinity for strongmen is well established  as is his contempt for his predecessor and his habit of gleefully ridiculing opponents  regardless of their party affiliation  but rarely has the trump administration offered such a striking display of embracing autocrats as friends and painting those at home with whom it disagrees as enemies its such a break with the tradition that you unify the country against opposition abroad  and you act with a certain decorum in dealing with opponents at home  said the presidential historian robert dallek  there seems to be none of that in this administration mr  trumps comments about mr  schumer and ms  pelosi came in an off the cuff exchange with reporters as he left the white house for a trip to the border in texas  it suggested that the president was still basking in the afterglow of his steak dinner with president xi jinping in buenos aires last month  when he agreed to call a truce in his trade war with china mr  pompeos address  by contrast  was carefully choreographed in both its language and setting  a highly symbolic effort to discredit what mr  obama heralded as americas new beginning with the muslim world mr  obama  the secretary of state said  underestimated the scourge of radical islam  declined to stand up to the mullahs in iran  even as they brutally cracked down on protesters  turned the other way while the militants of hezbollah massed rockets against israel  and did nothing after president bashar al assad of syria used sarin gas against his own people the age of self inflicted american shame is over  and so are the policies that produced so much needless suffering  mr  pompeo said at the american university in cairo  now comes the real new beginning mr  pompeo lauded saudi arabia for working with the united states to curb irans malign influence in the region  he said nothing about human rights and did not mention the killing of the saudi journalist jamal khashoggi  which the c i a   an agency he once led  concluded was ordered by the saudi crown prince  mohammed bin salman  a close ally of mr  trump to those who watched mr  pompeo harshly question secretary of state hillary clinton in 2015 when he was a house member investigating the benghazi attacks  the fact that he would attack a democratic president was hardly surprising  but that he did it on foreign soil angered some diplomats  who subscribe to the adage that partisan politics should stop at the waters edge even those who were deeply critical of mr  obamas middle east policy said they found mr  pompeos speech off key  more a stunt aimed at his boss back in washington than a serious attempt to set out a new blueprint for american involvement in the region theres something a little cheap about going to cairo  said william kristol  the neoconservative political analyst  who has been equally critical of mr  trump  if he doesnt approve of obamas cairo speech  the way you do that is not to give another cairo speech mr  kristol noted that mr  obamas speech was also a rebuke of his predecessor  george w  bush  especially for the iraq war and his use of torture on suspects after the terrorist attacks of september 2001  but by comparison with mr  pompeo  mr  obamas language was delicate 9 11 was an enormous trauma to our country  mr  obama said at cairo university  the fear and anger it provoked was understandable  but in some cases  it led us to act contrary to our own ideals in his dissection  mr  pompeo did not mention a line that would seem more likely than any other to provoke a trump official  mr  obamas admission that the united states played a role in overthrowing the democratically elected government of iran in 1953  a coup  he said  that had left a residue of suspicion toward america  mr  pompeos focus was on making the iran of today start behaving like a normal country for all his contempt toward mr  obama  mr  pompeo fell back on some positions that sounded a lot like those of the last administration  in syria  he said  the united states would work through the u n  led process to bring peace and stability to the long suffering syrian people nor is it clear that mr  trumps praise of autocrats is encouraging them to act in ways that benefit the united states  it may actually do the opposite  as the case of prince mohammed demonstrates the trade talks between the united states and china  which ended this week in beijing  were less rancorous than the shutdown negotiations between mr  trump and the democrats  but they have yet to produce a breakthrough  and mr  trumps decision to skip the world economic forum in davos  switzerland  later this month because of the shutdown could put off a trade deal even longer strongman envy helps explain both the presidents comments and a muddled view of the middle east  said william j  burns  a former deputy secretary of state who is now president of the carnegie endowment for international peace the irony  mr  burns said  is that trashing his predecessor or congressional opponents on the global stage is seen by those same strongmen as evidence of his weakness and manipulability .
mcallen  tex   president trump was briefed near a county park on the rio grande on thursday on the perils of drugs and violence seeping across the mexican border  but the river he visited has seen its share of both treachery and normalcy just a few months earlier  a short walk from the spot where mr  trump stood  two retired border patrol agents had set off from the park in their boat  they were testing a new engine in anticipation of a fishing trip  they cracked open some bud lights  but the engine died while they were on the water  and on duty border patrol agents  old friends of the guys in the boat  sped out on the river to give them a tow there were no migrants apprehended  no heroin seizures  it was just one ordinary  leisurely moment on a border that hums with a continuing stream of migrants  and the easy rhythms of day to day life  amid a swirling national controversy over proposals to extend a massive wall along its banks the border depicted by the president and the one lived by most mcallen area residents are two very different places  the collision between the borders reality and how it is being portrayed for those thousands of miles away came sharply into focus on thursday during mr  trumps trip to mcallen  where he met with local  state and federal officials amid protests and counterprotests mr  trump carried his message of border security to a majority hispanic city of 142 000 that has been on the front lines of the surge in central american families coming into the united states preliminary plans are underway to expand some border fencing in parts of the rio grande valley  but mcallen has a well honed infrastructure to handle migrants  both legal and illegal  many here have been frustrated that the city has become the symbol of a faraway political debate so entrenched it has shut down parts of the federal government on the one hand  i dont like my city being portrayed as if theres a crisis and unrest  when the reality is were one of the safest cities in the u s   said monica stewart  a longtime resident and small business owner who has advised lawmakers on border security and international trade issues ms  stewart does not believe the border wall mr  trump wants to build is necessary  and said there were better ways to improve border security using technology mcallen  which was named for the family that settled in the area in the early 1900s  is a largely blue city  with scores of hispanic democrats who help run its municipal agencies  courts  schools and businesses  many of them were critical thursday of the presidents visit and said they believed he had manufactured a border crisis to sell his plan for a wall but mcallen and the larger rio grande valley region are also home to small but vocal numbers of hispanic conservatives  many are from middle class mexican american families who have lived in the area for generations and do not identify with the central american migrants fleeing poverty and violence like much else about life on the border  mcallen is never quite what people imagine it to be one of the most frequent places to run into border patrol agents in mcallen is not on the border itself but at wingstop or buffalo wings   rings  mcallen has synagogues and country clubs  its biggest employer is the local school district and community college  its tallest building is the 17 story chase tower  home to real estate developers and senator ted cruzs district office and its politics are far from predictable as the president traveled through town  all he had to do was look out the motorcades windows to see a mix of opposition and support for his visit  parts of the route were lined with protesters who waved signs  our home is not a crisis and no al muro  spanish for no to the wall   and with trump supporters who had their own signs at one moment on the protester side  police officers wrestled at least one person to the ground as tempers flared the mcallen police said two people were arrested following a confrontation between trump supporters and protesters joe cantu  a 75 year old trump backer who wore a red make america great again hat and matching t shirt  parked at a mall near the airport and was preparing to join a crowd of fellow supporters who gathered to cheer the presidents visit  some held flags and signs reading build the wall and latinos for trump hell yeah  we need a wall  said mr  cantu  a south texas native who is the former police chief of the nearby town of san juan mr  trump at one point walked over to dozens of supporters gathered at the airport oh  i like that  mr  trump said when a supporter handed him a military baseball cap with trump emblazoned on the front joaquin zamora  a city commissioner who was part of a contingent of officials and supporters who greeted mr  trump at the airport  said he was proud to have the president of the united states visit the city where he was born and raised  but he did not completely support mr  trumps plan to build a wall in a region that thrives on binational commerce and trade i think over all its not the neighborly thing to do with our neighbors to the south  said mr  zamora  47  who is also a hidalgo county prosecutor  you shouldnt be using immigration to shut down the government to get what you want  certainly i think theres other ways to go about it mr  zamora said he hoped the presidents visit would help dispel  not fuel  misconceptions about the city were a wholesome community  he said  were an american city thats on the border  what we dont want is the perception that were a dusty border town with burros and carts  ak 47s being fired every 30 minutes and molotov cocktails being thrown  because thats not whats happening in mcallen the county park adjacent to where mr  trump got his briefing  known as anzalduas park  lies directly along the rio grande  and on thursday  for the presidential visit  it was closed to the public city residents said the last time that happened for a presidential visit was in 2006  when president george w  bush held a news conference there  it is  they said  a place where families go on weekends for barbecues and gatherings  and one of its defining features is that just across the river  on the mexican side  families fill the banks for their own barbecues and gatherings they are so close  united by a river  that they could wave at one another  sometimes  they do just that .

mcallen  tex   president trump arrived in this border town thursday on a trip that he did not want to take to discuss a crisis that democrats say does not exist  repeating his request for a long promised border wall that has led to a bitter political impasse and a 20 day government shutdown flanked by border patrol officers  as well as kirstjen nielsen  the secretary of homeland security  and a cache of drugs  cash and weapons seized by the authorities at the border  mr  trump again blamed the protracted shutdown affecting vast swaths of the federal government on democrats  he reiterated an untrue claim that mexico would indirectly pay for the wall through a revamped trade agreement  and heard from people who had loved ones killed by immigrants if we had a barrier of any kind  whether its steel or concrete  mr  trump said of tragic stories involving violence and human trafficking  they wouldnt even bother trying  we could stop that cold but as the government shutdown neared the end of its third week  the president left washington with no additional negotiations scheduled with congressional leaders over a possible compromise that could both provide border security and open the government  in remarks to reporters on thursday  mr  trump did not rule out declaring a state of national emergency that could allow him to bypass congress to fund the wall asked if he would make such a declaration  an action that would likely face legal challenges  mr  trump said  if this doesnt work out  probably i will do it  i would almost say definitely in the meeting with border patrol officials  mr  trump did not emphasize the need for an emergency  but invited locals to help him make his case a local pastor declared the problem a humanitarian crisis  border patrol officers used visual aids showing stash houses  road checkpoints and drug caches to emphasize the demand for border security and a wall  and at one point  senator ted cruz  the texas republican who waged a brutal political battle with the president as an opponent during the 2016 primaries  praised mr  trump for infusing more backbone in the capital when we see politicians go on tv and say the borders secure and there is no crisis  mr  cruz said  they are ignoring reality mr  trump repeated his demand for the money from congress while telling the group that mexico would somehow provide funds indirectly for the wall  a contradiction of what he said in december when he wrote in a twitter post  i often stated  one way or the other  mexico is going to pay for the wall i didnt say theyre going to write me a check for  10 billion or  20 billion  mr  trump said on thursday  if congress approves this trade bill  theyll pay for the wall many times over  when i say mexicos going to pay for the wall  thats what i mean the new trade deal  the united states mexico canada agreement  does not stipulate that mexico provide funds for the wall  and has not been approved by congress back in washington  the presidents ability to procure funds from other sources has not been successful mr  trump held a brief and contentious negotiation with democrats and republican leaders on wednesday in the situation room that ended abruptly when he stormed out of the room after speaker nancy pelosi rebuffed his overture to reopen the government in exchange for wall funding  ms  pelosi and democrats have consistently said they would be willing to negotiate border security issues with him if he would reopen the government  even as ms  pelosi has held firm to the position that she does not support funding for a wall before his departure  mr  trump denied democrats reports that he slammed his hand on the table and had what senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  called a temper tantrum i didnt smash the table  mr  trump said later thursday morning  i should have in a meeting with network anchors this week before his address to the nation  the president dismissed his trip to mcallen  a border community where crime is near a 30 year low  as a photo op that he was doing because his top communications advisers counseled him to in texas  he listened to tearful stories from people who described violent deaths of siblings and sons  including one woman whose son  a border patrol agent  had been killed by an unauthorized immigrant thank you  mr  trump said as he walked over to hug her  im very proud of you right now  a shut down government actually costs more than an open one  before air force one landed in texas on thursday  a crowd of supporters with flags and build the wall signs gathered near the rio grande the president maintains he has the option of declaring a national emergency to fund construction for the wall  perhaps the central promise that he made to his political base during his campaign  and bypassing a legislative solution  the head of the army corps of engineers traveled with mr  trump to texas on thursday  redirecting funds from the armys construction agency to build the wall is one option mr  trump could use in a national emergency mr  trump said he had the legal authority to make the declaration  this is a thing that the lawyers tell me is 100 percent  mr  trump said if the president were to declare a national emergency  which some legal experts say is within his authority  it is sure to stoke debate in congress to bolster his campaign for the wall  the president has also scheduled an interview with the fox host sean hannity  who will broadcast his show thursday night from mcallen  mr  hannity is one of the presidents highest profile supporters and is highly influential among his political base the presidents trip came a month before some bollard wall construction in the area  based on a previous congressional appropriation  is set to begin at least seven senior aides were aboard the flight  including jared kushner  his son in law and senior adviser  sarah huckabee sanders  his press secretary  bill shine  his deputy chief of staff for communications  mick mulvaney  his acting chief of staff  and stephen miller  a senior white house adviser and architect of the administrations zero tolerance immigration policies .
washington  when speaker nancy pelosi of california stepped to a microphone last week and pronounced president trumps border wall an immorality  most democrats cheered and nodded their heads but a few privately grimaced  worried that such stark terminology could make it more difficult for democrats and republicans to find their way out of an impasse over border security that has partially shuttered the government for three weeks  deprived about 800 000 federal workers of their pay and increasingly threatens beneficiaries of federal programs democrats  said one democratic lawmaker from a republican leaning district who insisted on anonymity to offer a candid assessment  cannot be seen by the public as calling border security immoral the divide illustrates why democrats are working to focus public attention on the painful costs of the partial government shutdown  vulnerable families going without food assistance  farmers forgoing crop payments  national parks trashed  and mr  trumps recklessness in courting it  rather than delving into the specific details of erecting a barrier on the southwestern border while mr  trump has launched an elaborate public relations effort to draw democrats into a debate over the wall itself  even the material to be used to construct it  democrats are just as determined to talk instead about a more universally resonant theme  the need to get the government open and functioning while negotiations continue it is at the heart of ms  pelosis plan this week to push through the house a series of bills to reopen shuttered federal agencies  including one that passed wednesday for the treasury department and the internal revenue service  among others  like the others poised to be approved this week in the democrat controlled chamber  it is expected to die in the republican controlled senate the goal  to win over more republicans in the house and raise pressure in the senate  where on tuesday  lisa murkowski of alaska became the latest republican to call for a vote to reopen the government as talks on border security continue for democrats  newly in control of the house  the shutdown fight has proved unifying  crystallizing a near universal belief in their ranks that congress should act as a check on the power of a president who has shown little regard for the law and has used his office to sow fear and misinformation on issues like immigration but while they are almost all opposed to the idea of a wall between the united states and mexico  which is unpopular among a majority of americans and strongly opposed by democratic voters  and which has been dismissed as ineffective by border security experts  democrats are less united about what form of border security they do support some of them  including senator chuck schumer of new york  the minority leader  voted in 2006 for 700 miles of fencing along the border  a position the white house has repeatedly sought to spotlight on tuesday  on the morning of mr  trumps address to the nation on the topic  representative steny h  hoyer of maryland  the majority leader  did not mention the word wall once in 11 minutes of opening remarks with reporters  he then sidestepped a question about the difference between fencing and other border security measures that democrats have backed in the past and the wall that the president is demanding i didnt answer it  maybe because i dont have an answer that i think is a really good answer  he finally conceded  fencing and walls have the same effect  one is supported by a large number of experts  but a large number of experts think neither are that effective the reality is that making a nuanced argument about border security  a highly technical and politically charged issue  is difficult and divisive  some democrats have learned that the hard way in recent days representative adam smith of washington  chairman of the armed services committee  seemed to break from ms  pelosis immorality remark during an interview sunday on abcs this week when he tried to explain his past votes for border barriers the wall is not in itself a bad idea  its just  its been done  mr  smith said  and what the president has not done is  he has not made the case that on the portions of the border where a wall has not been built  how is a wall going to actually enhance border security representative liz cheney of wyoming  chairwoman of the house republican conference  jumped on mr  smiths remarks  saying  thats a very different point than the one that speaker pelosi continues to make  which is that a wall is immoral when senator chris coons  democrat of delaware  said this week that mr  trumps recent talk of a wall made of steel slats rather than concrete was progress  he quickly clarified that he was not  in fact  buying into the presidents idea i said that it was a minor step  he told cnn on tuesday  i was accepting that steel slats are preferred by the department of homeland security over a concrete wall  i was not saying that i think that we should be pouring billions of dollars into a border barrier and ms  pelosi has also sought to press the more practical argument  on a card of talking points distributed wednesday by her office  democrats were instructed to emphasize that they favor smart  effective border security solutions  and to focus on mr  trumps tactics  there is no reason for president trump to keep government shut down over his demands for an ineffective  wasteful wall  the card said democratic strategists argue that mr  trumps failure to build broad public support for a wall that he has been demanding since the early days of his presidential candidacy has made it easier for democrats to stake out a unified message obviously  there are some democrats who talk about the wall being immoral or inconsistent with american values  but across the spectrum of democrats  there is an emphasis on the degree to which the wall is waste of taxpayers money and irrelevant to addressing the most important challenges we face with regard to immigration in the country  said geoff garin  a democratic pollster  democrats are being helped a little bit by trumps specificity in what hes looking for  he keeps talking about something that is very specific  and is something that more than half of all americans oppose nick gourevitch  a pollster and communications strategist who advised democrats during the midterm campaign on mr  trumps fear soaked immigration message  said democrats are sticking to the simplest and freshest argument they have to appeal to a public that does not focus on the finer points of border security policy the wall is unpopular  and the wall combined with the shutdown is even more unpopular  mr  gourevitch said most presidents dont lose in a wave election and then double down on the strategy that got them there  he added  but thats what this president seems to be doing .
countries rise and fall over borders  and how they are guarded  wars are fought  lives upended  then again  sometimes its more a matter of trash not being collected in national parks  and politicians issuing dueling news releases the federal government shutdown sparked by president trumps demand for funding a wall on the mexican border is nearing the three week mark  and offers a reminder that borders are not just lines of demarcation  often  they are potent symbols of the politics playing out around them a look at some of the most guarded borders in the world  and some that are notably less so many know it simply by its latitude  the 38th parallel the border between north korea and south korea has been one of the most contentious in the world for decades  the korean war halted in 1953 with an armistice  but a formal peace treaty was never signed  as part of the armistice  the american led united nations command and the communist generals of north korea and china agreed to create a two and a half mile wide buffer zone that divides the korean peninsula to keep the warring armies apart  known as the dmz  the buffer zone was supposed to be demilitarized  but soon became a heavily fortified frontier riddled with land mines and surrounded by fences and guard posts then last year  south koreas president  moon jae in  and north koreas leader  kim jong un  took a symbolic step  hand in hand  they crossed over the demarcation line  signifying what many hoped was the start of a new era the two leaders summit meeting itself offered little in the way of a concrete plan for peace  but the theater of the crossing resonated globally  still  while a formal peace agreement may finally be in sight  the border remains heavily fortified israels boundary with the occupied west bank was once a largely invisible one but israel began building a physical barrier in 2002  at the height of a palestinian suicide bombing campaign  mostly departing from the pre 1967 armistice line  the barrier became increasingly political as its architects looped it around settlements and areas that israel wished to keep under any future peace deal   palestinians want the territory  along with gaza  for a future independent state   in 2004  a nonbinding ruling from the international court of justice said construction of israels wall across the line should be dismantled  palestinians have dismissed israels security arguments  saying the barrier is a racist separation or apartheid wall thousands of palestinian workers apply for permits and enter israel every day  thousands more sneak across without authorization  but they are generally accepted as part of the local economy in 2015  europe grappled with enormous migration flows from the middle east and northern africa  on a scale unprecedented in modern history many of the people arriving at its doorstep were seeking asylum  and they received an uneven welcome on the continent  some nations offered a haven  others sealed their borders in some places  like hungary  the call for a border wall became a rally cry of a rising populist movement hungary fortified a border fence along its southern border with serbia to keep out migrants and asylum seekers  the flow of people into the country came to a near halt  and the far right reaped political rewards many migrants never had any intention of settling in hungary  it was simply a way station  their real goal was reaching more prosperous european nations  and so some simply found different routes  the border between the republic of ireland and northern ireland was heavily militarized for decades as a partisan conflict over british control over the north  but in the years since the 1998 good friday peace agreement was signed  the border virtually disappeared  for decades  both britain and ireland have been members of the european union and its common marketplace  allowing for the free movement of people and goods between the two nations  in many places  towns straddle the border and country roads weave back and forth from the republic to the north  with the only indication of an international border crossing being speed limit signs changing from kilometers to miles  but with britains decision to withdraw from the european union  the border that stretches across the island of ireland is set to become the only land border between europe and britain no one wants a return to the old days  but the largely invisible boundary has once again become a point of contention  with the ability to maintain a soft border a sticking point in british negotiations to withdraw from the bloc  a small stretch of europes southern border actually touches morocco  making the tiny territory accessible by land rather than by sea  increasingly  it has become a place where migrants attempt to enter europe  as other routes have become more perilous the spanish enclave is known as ceuta  and visitors there cant fail to note a 20 foot high barbed wire fence that stretches for four miles  the area is also patrolled by some 1 100 spanish federal police officers and the guardia civil  a paramilitary police force but despite all the security measures  young men can often be seen trying to scale the fence  either alone or in groups one migration expert has compared attempts to stop migration from africa into europe with a fence to the little dutch boy who saves his country by putting his finger in a leaking dike a brutal war over their border left ethiopia and eritrea in a two decade long standoff  often described as a state of war  the two nations cut economic  trade and diplomatic ties  and sealed the border  heavily militarizing it  but in september  the leaders of ethiopia and eritrea reopened crossing points on the border  the move cleared the way for trade to resume between the nations  and the countries leaders signed a formal declaration of peace the reopening coincided with the ethiopian new year  adding to the festive atmosphere as families that had been separated for years flooded across the number of illegal border crossings into the united states are on the rise  from canada you might not know it from the rhetoric focused on americas southern border  but border protection agents at the north are plenty busy  much of the 5 525 mile border is open  and in some places towns  or even individual buildings  straddle both sides  on the border between stanstead  quebec  and derby line  vt   there is a paucity of tire spikes and imposing fences there is  however  a row of flower pots marking the dividing line between the nations outside the haskell free library  which serves both countries  in recent months  the library has even become a place for iranian families separated by president trumps travel ban to have brief reunions isabel kershner contributed reporting  .

washington  the five week federal government shutdown took a significant economic toll  costing the united states economy  11 billion  with nearly a quarter of that total permanently lost  the congressional budget office said on monday the figures are the first official projection of the economic effects of the longest federal shutdown in history  and they show that its cost was nearly double the  5 7 billion request by president trump for a border wall that fueled the impasse  that is enough to reduce first quarter growth by about 0 4 percentage points much of that spending was simply delayed  and will flow back into the economy as workers get back pay  but the report makes clear that not all the economic damage will be undone and that the effects of the shutdown will linger  with the federal government funded for just three weeks and mr  trump threatening to shutter the government again if his demands for a wall are not met  many workers say they are planning to spend less of their income and increase rainy day savings kelly spencer  a federal contractor at the justice department  was planning to buy her first home this spring  but as she returned to work on monday  she said she was shelving those plans ms  spencer was not paid during the five week shutdown of the federal government  and as a contractor  she is among the thousands of workers who will not receive back pay  but she said the problem is not just the lost money  she is no longer confident she could make a mortgage payment every month this job was supposed to be stable and secure  she said  while she had worked hard to pay off her debt and clean up her credit to qualify for a mortgage  she was forced to run up credit card debt again during the shutdown buying a home  she said  is no longer in the foreseeable future even those who are getting back pay say they will not return to their previous spending habits  given that another shutdown could happen in a few weeks i dont feel comfortable going back to the spending levels i had before  said tamara brown  a state department employee  she received half of her missing pay on monday  and said she expected the rest later this week  still  she said  im going to be very conservative until im sure this is all over on the chopping block  restaurant lunches and trips to target the report by the nonpartisan budget office said the shutdown  which started in late december and ended friday  reduced gross domestic product by  3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018  and by  8 billion in the first quarter of 2019 the damage caused by the shutdown comes against a gloomy fiscal backdrop  economic growth already was expected to slow this year  the budget office projected on monday that real gross domestic product would slow to 2 3 percent in 2019  down from 3 1 percent last year  and that the federal budget deficit would hit  900 billion over the next decade  federal debt held by the public is expected to climb from  16 6 trillion to  28 7 trillion  by 2029 it is expected to reach its highest level as a percentage of gross domestic product since the end of world war ii the federal reserve  which meets this week  has indicated that it plans to pause and take the measure of the economy before considering any additional increases in its benchmark interest rate the budget office said growth in subsequent quarters would increase as delayed spending filtered through the economy  however  it estimates that  3 billion will never be recovered  the figure is basically an estimate of the value of the government work that was not performed during the shutdown the budget office also said the economy suffered more indirect negative effects  which are harder to quantify but stemmed from businesses being unable to obtain permits and certifications and reduced access to federal backed loans  such factors were probably beginning to lead firms to postpone investment and hiring decisions  the office said morgan stanley estimated friday that the shutdown would reduce first quarter output by 0 5 percentage points  a slightly larger reduction than the budget office projection  although it also predicted most of the loss would be recouped larry kudlow  the director of mr  trumps national economic council  dismissed the c b o  report  noting that the budget office regularly has a more pessimistic view of the economy than the white house i wont acknowledge any of that right now  mr  kudlow said on monday  lets see how it rolls out mr  kudlow argued that it was difficult to make precise projections when analyzing a  20 trillion economy  he said that the stories of individual hardship were problematic  but that the macroeconomic effects of the shutdown would be minimal democrats seized on the report  saying the economic damage should persuade mr  trump not to shut down the government again as the dust settles from the trump shutdown  it is clear as day that the presidents temper tantrum caused serious and lasting damage to our nations economy  said senator chuck schumer of new york  the minority leader senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  said on monday that he did not want to go through another shutdown i think a shutdown is a bad idea  remains a bad idea  and im optimistic we will not be in that position yet again  mr  mcconnell said laura dodson  an agricultural economist at the agriculture department  said the shutdown was particularly stressful because she had just  1 000 in her bank accounts when her paychecks stopped coming  her rent was coming due  and she needed money to pay for her ovarian cancer treatments the big concern i have is speaking from the standpoint of a millennial  someone in their 20s  is the fear and insecurity  said ms  dodson  26  i thought i had a good job with good health insurance and was in a stable spot  but i guess not ms  dodson said she planned to more aggressively pay off her credit card debt and loans and make sure that she had a larger cash reserve in case another shutdown came i am pretty worried that if it goes to a second shutdown  it could go on for months  ms  dodson said even with the government open for business on monday  federal workers who had yet to be paid lined up patiently along pennsylvania avenue for free lunches at world central kitchen  a nonprofit run by the restaurateur jos andrs that usually serves free meals in communities struck by natural disasters mark stevens  37  works at the superior court of the district of columbia  which is funded by the federal government  he said he was furloughed and then called back to work  but he hasnt been paid in more than a month he said he was grateful for the free meal because i still dont have any money mr  stevens said he had about two months of salary in savings when the government shut down  and his landlord helped out by postponing a rent payment  even so  he said he had a pile of bills to tackle as soon as he got paid going forward  mr  stevens said he intended to sock away six months of salary no more fast food  said mr  stevens  who lives in suburban maryland  less entertainment  no more taking the kids out everywhere .

a 61 year old man from the dominican republic has been waiting for his day in federal immigration court since the 1980s  unable to visit his dying mother back home or  in recent years  legally hold a job  his trial was finally to come next week but because of the federal government shutdown  he stands to lose his precious court date in the backlogged immigration courts  that is likely to mean not just a few more weeks of waiting  but a few more years  migrants like this man  who asked to be identified only by his first name  jose  for fear of repercussions in court  are being sent to the back of the line  with their new court dates coming as late as 2022 from furloughs at the justice department to confusion in the courts  to prison officers working without a paycheck  the shutdown has challenged the nations courts and criminal justice system and those whose livelihoods depend on them  slowing some cases while throwing others into disarray  read more  on friday  president trump threatened to keep the government shut down for months or even years   federal district courts are still operating because they have revenue from court fees and other sources aside from congressional appropriations  but those funds may run out as soon as next friday  leaving it up to judges to decide which cases are critical and must be heard and which will be delayed  criminal cases are likely to be prioritized at federal prisons  which employ roughly 36 000 people  corrections officers who struggle during normal times to cover their bills are now expecting that next weeks paycheck will not arrive  guards who normally take home  1 000 to  1 400 per biweekly check are scrambling to figure out how to pay for child care  rent and medications  read more  with no end in sight to the shutdown  800 000 federal workers have been sent home or are working without pay  eric young  the national president of prison locals for the american federation of government employees  said he had heard from one prison worker in florida who needs  200 for his supply of insulin injections  people are having to decide whether to keep the lights on or pay for their insulin  mr  young said  its depressing  and its just unconscionable to know that the federal work force is being penalized because of politics between the parties about four out of every five justice department employees are expected to keep working  because so many are employed in law enforcement or national security jobs  including at the f b i   the d e a   and the bureau of prisons  but none are expected to be paid during the shutdown  unless their offices have a funding source separate from congressional appropriations the shutdown has already led to a slowdown in civil lawsuits  and some confusion  as federal judges across the country have issued a hodgepodge of conflicting orders  in the federal district court for the southern district of west virginia  a federal judge ordered that all cases in which the federal government is a party be delayed another judge issued an order exempting his own cases from the first judges order the second judge  joseph r  goodwin  wrote  it is my view that the government should not be given special influence or accommodation in cases where such special considerations are unavailable to other litigants justice department lawyers whose civil cases are not granted delays can keep working to meet court deadlines and requirements for filings and appearances  most federal prosecutors and support staff for criminal cases are continuing to work  read more  what is and is not affected by the shutdown  elsewhere  justice department lawyers have begged to delay civil cases in which the government  or even president trump  is being sued  saying they are now prohibited from working on these cases except in emergencies and other very limited circumstances  they have met with mixed success in a lawsuit alleging that mr  trump used his washington hotel to illegally profit from business with foreign countries  a delay has been granted but in a case that seeks to block the trump administration from questioning people about their citizenship in the 2020 census  a measure that critics say is devised to suppress responses from migrants  the judge  richard seeborg of federal district court in san francisco  denied a request to delay and ordered the trial to begin monday  the justice department says it will comply judges will have significant latitude to determine which cases go forward and which are delayed  once the court fees and other revenue are depleted judges are in the best position to determine what cases have an urgency  said david sellers  the spokesman for the administrative office of the united states courts mr  sellers said judges will continue to appoint defense lawyers to represent criminal defendants too poor to pay for one  and jurors will continue to be empaneled  they will get paid  he said  once money is appropriated advocates for prisoners and their families fear that the shutdown could delay the implementation of a new criminal justice bill that promised to shorten sentences for some federal inmates by recalculating the amount of good time credit they have earned  because the justice department must create new tools and protocols first the deadlines for those were already pretty ambitious  even when the department was fully staffed and appropriated  said kevin ring  president of famm  a nonprofit group that was founded to oppose mandatory minimum sentences  were watching that closely but probably no system is feeling the shutdown as much as the already overburdened immigration courts  where there are more than 800 000 cases pending  most of these courts  except those that hear the cases of those currently in detention  are now closed because of the shutdown as a result  the impasse over the trump administrations demand for a border wall to halt illegal immigration will result in long delays in deportations for those who are already here but ultimately lose their cases that is the irony of this shutdown  said judge amiena khan  the executive vice president of the national association of immigration judges  the judges union  the impact is most acutely felt in immigration courts and proceedings where cases will not be going forward because of the volume of trials from the past two weeks that now must be rescheduled  the affected cases are likely to be pushed to the end of the judges dockets rather than squeezed into their schedules once the shutdown ends in new york  home to one of the busiest immigration courts in the country  those whose trials have been postponed will have to wait until the end of 2022 and 2023 at the earliest before their cases are heard because of the backlog  judge khan said i was very nervous because we were so close  and this is just making me even more nervous  jose said  every day i hope the government reopens .
laredo  tex   priscilla villarreal roams the streets of laredo in an old dodge pickup  scrambling to drug busts and murder scenes to bring her tales from the dark side of the southwest border to her many viewers rappers celebrate her scoops  proclaiming that she gets more love than our own citys mayor i guess this makes me famous  huh  said ms  villarreal  34  a 10th grade dropout with a shaved head  an abundance of tattoos and an impassioned 119 000 strong following on facebook  she is arguably the most influential journalist in laredo  a border city of 260 000 reporting in profanity laced spanglish and calling herself la gordiloca  which roughly translates as the crazy fat lady  ms  villarreals swift rise to prominence reflects how many people on the border now prefer to get their news  and just maybe  provides a glimpse at the future of journalism all the notoriety amounts to a big shift for ms  villarreal  just a few years ago she was working part time for a wrecking crew removing scrap from tractor trailer crash sites  she was struggling with depression and post traumatic stress after losing a baby born prematurely  read the latest edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  but ms  villarreal embarked on a second career in muckraking in 2015  she has held local officials accountable  emerging victorious from a caustic legal battle with the laredo police department over press freedom  and unearthed stories that were not being told news on the move  she calls it fans stop her on the street now to ask for autographs or selfies  laredo eateries hire her to advertise their cuisine shes already something of a folk hero down there  said daxton stewart  a journalism professor specializing in media law at texas christian university in fort worth  whats fascinating is that shes doing it the old fashioned way  but with new technologies  by breaking news the authorities just dont want out there her recent reports include a horrific case of child abuse  teenagers having babies   she opined   the arrest of a school superintendent in waco for possession of marijuana  lets all do a petition for him in laredo so he wont lose his job     drug raids and messy tractor trailer accidents ms  villarreal reports entirely on facebook  often by live streaming video on her page on her iphone  some follow her because of her fire breathing reporting style  blending facts with chisme  gossip   but many in laredo welcome her exposs on public corruption in a city whose abundant reports of graft are the target of an f b i  investigation in february  for instance  she scooped the competition with a report about a former laredo police investigator who was accused of taking gambling proceeds from raids on slot machine casinos  then was allowed to resign when confronted with the findings it took days for competitors to finally catch up and get the story about anthony carrillo jr   47  a 26 year veteran of the police force  when he was charged with tampering with evidence and abuse of his official capacity laredo police officers arrested ms  villarreal in december 2017 and charged her with two counts of misuse of official information  a third degree felony  they said the charges were in connection with her reporting on the 2017 suicide of a customs and border protection supervisor  whose name ms  villarreal published for months before her arrest  the police department had also been hunting down the source of other leaks to ms  villarreal  they identified a police officer suspected of supplying the information  a woman who had worked on the force for 19 years  after searching the officers phone and finding hundreds of calls exchanged with ms  villarreal the department placed the officer on suspension for 20 days and said in a statement that the case against ms  villarreal involved an obligation to the protection of a persons right to privacy as it relates to sensitive information the district judge who examined the case promptly dismissed the charges against ms  villarreal  but the legal battle left her with mixed feelings about her work the case made me even more well known in laredo  and more sources talk to me now  she said  but i remain scared  and who im most scared of here arent the criminals or smugglers  its the laredo police department without editors to review her work  ms  villarreal reports almost entirely on her own  the only person who occasionally helps her monitor developments in laredo is her mother  maricela rodrguez  55  a former migrant worker who used to harvest sugar beets in minnesota to support her family i m still learning how to say things like allegedly or its being said when im describing breaking news  ms  villarreal said  its a challenge  because i speak the language of the streets  and thats why people follow me as newspapers in this part of texas cut staff and resources for reporting  ms  villarreal is pressing ahead  she makes a small amount of money by promoting restaurants she frequents  though it is not enough to replace her 1998 dodge ram truck  which she bought used for  700 and affectionately calls her blue demon for some reason  i find reporting therapeutic  said ms  villarreal  describing her severe depression after losing her baby a decade ago  she said she gained about 100 pounds after the loss  and tried to commit suicide by slitting her wrist one part of the job that she dislikes  ms  villarreal said  is what she calls my haters  some go on her facebook page and mock her appearance or her demeanor  others express disgust at all her swearing  indeed  many of her reports would have trouble finding their way into the pages of a family newspaper every other word out of her mouth is obscene  said abundio rene cant  a lawyer for a laredo day care center that sued ms  villarreal for defamation after she reported that children at the site were being mistreated  ms  villarreal is appealing an initial ruling against her this is a woman who has no respect for the rule of law  or due process  mr  cant said  i feel she is a danger to this community because she interferes with law enforcement when ms  villarreal recently declared opposition to president trump and his plans for a border wall  some conservatives in laredo questioned whether she was an undocumented immigrant   ms  villarreals grandparents are from mexico and she was born in the united states  most days  she pays her detractors little heed  on a recent day  she prowled the city in the blue demon  cranking up the volume as she sang along with tejano bands like siggno stopping for lunch a short stroll from the border  at the la posada hotel  ms  villareal was quickly recognized  some diners stopped to give her a hug and express best wishes about a new revelation  ms  villarreal is pregnant  others lined up to take selfies with her im one of your top fans  hilda pea  72  told ms  villarreal after wandering over to take a photograph with her  ms  pea  a retired financial services administrator  said that ms  villarreal won her over last year with her reporting on juan david ortiz  the border patrol agent accused of killing several women in laredo   according to investigators  he has confessed to four killings  he has pleaded not guilty  with that serial killer on the loose  i wondered if i should get my gun  ms  pea said  but la gordiloca made it clear when the situation was under control .
good morning  heres the sign up  if you dont already get california today by email   theres been so much california news this week  kamala harris  the l a  teachers strike  that the los angeles rams making the super bowl seems as if it slipped under the radar part of the reason may be that while the rams do have a history in los angeles  the teams presence is still new and novel to anyone college age or younger we are the shiny new toy  but we need to be the favorite toy  kevin demoff  the rams chief operating officer  told my colleague ken belson when the rams returned to los angeles in 2016  no matter how successful we are  there are going to be challenges they werent very good at first  but the rams sure are successful now  so i asked mr  belson  our n f l  expert  to outline the challenges that remain matt stevens  for those who arent close followers of the team  how did the rams go from 4 12 in 2016 to 13 3 this season  ken belson  the turnaround started when the rams hired sean mcvay  in his four plus seasons as rams coach  jeff fisher never had a winning record  mcvay  by contrast  is considered an offensive genius  and an unconventional coach  it didnt hurt that the team chose jared goff with the first pick in the draft  and has aaron donald  the best pass rusher in the game best you can tell though  when the rams take the field on super bowl sunday  will angelenos care winning cures all  and the rams timing couldnt be better  some fans who never dropped the team remain  younger fans who are just now getting turned on to football in l a  are likely to join the rams bandwagon too  and l a   the theory goes  is filled with front runners  which means many others are starting to root for the team but the city has not had a team for more than 20 years  and the raiders  who left southern california with the rams after the 1994 season  remain more popular than the rams or the chargers  who moved north from san diego   i wrote about this phenomenon a couple of years ago  its worth remembering  too  that the rams moved out of los angeles in 1980 and played in anaheim until 1994  orange county  of course  is very different from los angeles o k   so this is all part of a process  but both the rams and chargers will have to fill a giant new stadium by 2020   yes  right now  both teams are selling seat licenses  which enable fans to buy season tickets  so far  the rams say theyve sold all their most expensive seat licenses  while the chargers say their cheapest seat licenses are selling well  that should tell you something theres so much television and merchandise revenue shared among all 32 teams  that its very hard to lose money in the n f l  the issue is really how quickly the rams owner  stan kroenke  can recoup the costs of building the stadium  he needs his team to do well so he can get top dollar for tickets  sponsorships and naming rights  plus he gets a healthy contribution from the chargers  a note  we often link to

the border representative raul ruiz  a democrat from california who is also a physician  helped secure funding for additional measures to improve migrant health after visiting border facilities where he said he saw children coughing and sneezing and infants without diapers  all packed tightly into cells with little in the way of food  soap and other basics  the border patrol stations and those working there were unprepared  untrained and underequipped in dealing with the humanitarian needs of families  he said the moves come after years of warnings from both inside and outside government that were largely ignored by an agency that saw its primary mission as law enforcement  catching and deporting illegal border crossers  not nursing them back to health border patrol is a law enforcement agency  its not a humanitarian agency  said dr  alexander l  eastman  a senior medical officer with the homeland security department who is trying to put into place  for the first time  a comprehensive approach to the care of migrants across the department some health care workers said they have seen border patrol agents in the field prioritize enforcement of immigration laws over migrants urgent medical needs  ambulance crews near the border say they sometimes face delays at border patrol checkpoints in one case around five years ago  described to the times by two people who worked for an emergency medical response team in starr county  tex   a critically ill woman was driven across the bridge from mexico into rio grande city and loaded into an ambulance from a nearby hospital  a paramedic  sergio garza jr   began to help her with her breathing  but a c b p  employee  he said  opened the back doors of the vehicle and ordered the patient sent back  because she did not have papers to enter the united states mr  garza and the director of his ambulance company protested  to no avail  mr  garza grudgingly transferred the patient back to a mexican ambulance  which did not have trained personnel aboard  both he and the director recalled  mr  garza said he showed the patients husband how to squeeze an oxygen bag to try to keep his wife alive as she was driven toward a distant mexican hospital  she died on the way there  the emergency workers said for at least a decade  families and advocacy organizations have reported lapses in medical care for people in the custody of c b p  complaints filed over the past few years included a mother who gave birth prematurely and was later forced to stay with the baby in a dirty hold room  a detainee who was refused access to prescribed heart medication  and a woman who had heavy vaginal bleeding after a sexual assault and was not provided any medical attention the number of deaths remains unknown and is perhaps unknowable  the agency until december was not required to independently review or publicly report health related deaths in its custody  and the consequences of failing to address urgent medical needs often emerge after detainees are quickly passed on to another agency  or released in 2015  c b p  addressed some of the criticisms by establishing its first nationwide standards on transport and detention  however  the standards are nonbinding  the agency cannot be sued for not following them  and the subject of medical care in detention covers less than a page detention by customs and border protection is intended to be brief  72 hours or less  according to the standards  however that guideline is often broken  felipe gmez alonzo  the boy who died in december and had influenza  was in his sixth day of detention when he was taken to a hospital  according to a timeline provided by the agency at the hospital  felipe was found to have a 103 degree fever  he was discharged from the emergency room several hours later  and agents took him back to a temporary holding cell at a highway checkpoint  hours later  as the boy grew sicker  no medically trained agents were on duty there  he was returned to the hospital  but lost consciousness on the way children should not be held in c b p  holding cells longer than 24 hours  said kathryn hampton  a program officer for physicians for human rights and the author of a recent study that found that the focus on securing the border has come at the cost of migrants safety in some cases  border patrol agents take sick migrants to be seen at hospitals  but problems persist once they are brought back to c b p s crowded  ill equipped facilities sonia diaz castro  39  an asylum seeker from honduras  had fallen off the top of a 25 foot border wall as she entered the united states last year and was left barely able to move  with a broken elbow and pelvis border patrol agents in new mexico took her twice to local hospitals  and a doctor at one of them said he was promised by the agents that she would be given a wheelchair and have someone on hand to help her get around  she had neither  though she was barely able to move  she was left alone in a concrete cell  when she had to use the toilet  she was forced to drag herself across the floor using her broken arm i just felt like crying out  like the only thing i could do was cry  and when i think about it  it still makes me want to cry  ms  diaz castro said of the experience on a typical afternoon in early february  border patrol radios in south texas crackled with reports of bodies  people whose unauthorized crossing of the border had been detected by ground motion sensors and cameras on poles and tethered radar blimps agents responded as about 60 people from honduras  guatemala  ecuador and nicaragua  including mothers with children and some unaccompanied minors  clambered off rafts after crossing the rio grande  hefting bags and babies  they climbed a muddy dirt path that cut through spiny brushlands  walking toward the agents  who awaited them at a gap in the border wall ren reyes  a border patrol agent and emergency medical technician  eyeballed them for  he said  anything life threatening mr  reyes stopped briefly to ask parents about a boy with surgical scars on his head who was wearing a mask over his nose and mouth  he had a condition that causes too much fluid to build up in the brain  but he appeared stable  the kids look o k   mr  reyes concluded  his initial assessment of the entire group lasted less than five minutes the children would get a more thorough medical check at their next stop  one of two temporary detention facilities in an industrial part of mcallen  inside the agencys largest processing center for migrants  chain link fencing divides a vast warehouse with concrete floors into clusters of cells separating men from women and older children from parents  the site was opened in 2014 specifically for the temporary holding of families and unaccompanied children  when that site is full  an older facility with enclosed  jail like cells processes families several blocks away that afternoon  medical screeners sent a newly arrived 6 month old  victoria medina  to the hospital after noticing that she was sick with a fever  severe cough and diarrhea  hospital workers treated the baby and sent her back to c b p that night victorias mother  mayte medina  an 18 year old from honduras  lay on the bare floor of her chilly isolation cell under a thin mylar sheet and held on tight to her coughing baby  the fever broke  but the diarrhea continued  the bottle of medicine ms  medina had carried with her to treat it had been in her backpack  which was confiscated when she was taken into custody  i told everyone about it  everyone that saw her  ms  medina said  they never gave her anything ms  medinas relatively easy access to medical care was possible in part because she was apprehended in the heart of the rio grande valley  the most heavily trafficked way station for migrants in the united states  last year  more than 63 200 migrants traveling as families were apprehended there the border patrol facilities in mcallen are among the few in the country that have a small number of midlevel health professionals  nurse practitioners or physician assistants  on site  as government officials examine how they might expand medical services  those sites have been looked at as potential models but even in those places  providing care in a facility where the ultimate decisions are controlled by law enforcement authorities sometimes frustrates practice and strains ethics  a former contract health care worker at the mcallen sites  who was not authorized to speak on the record by her previous employer  loyal source  recalled several occasions when she had alerted agents that a patient needed to go to the emergency room  two or three hours later  she said  the patient was still there sometimes  she said  she blocked migrants with high fevers from being released to longer term detention facilities  but she also sometimes felt intimidated  as if she would be blamed for slowing down the flow she said that according to protocol  if a woman claimed that she had been raped  she had to be offered access to medical care to check for pregnancy  trauma and sexually transmitted infections  but that didnt always occur  she said in recent months  large groups of children and families have crossed into the united states  in remote desert areas lacking in medical infrastructure  including antelope wells  n m   where one of the fatally ill children  jakelin caal maquin  had arrived  a total of 15 border patrol stations or ports of entry that are within 100 miles of the southern border have no hospital within an hours drive  the times review found it is a perilous twist on a problem that has existed for years  after changes in border enforcement practices pushed furtive crossings into these areas some migrants encounter agents and turn themselves in  others spend days traversing vast ranchlands in extreme heat  hundreds die every year  agents often have to extract sick migrants from rough terrain to meet ambulance personnel  who may have to drive for hours to reach hospitals an earlier attempt to solve the problem led to the creation in 1998 of a unit trained in tactical rescues and emergency medical services that has performed thousands of medical interventions  a separate program trains regular agents as emergency medical technicians  over all  around 6 percent of border patrol agents can act as emergency medical services providers  still  the vast majority have only basic training  their protocols and equipment are limited  and they are not present everywhere their skills are needed where local emergency rooms are close at hand  border patrol agents tend to err on the side of caution  taking their charges for costly and sometimes unnecessary medical evaluations  several health providers said in other cases  the border patrol focuses on moving migrants quickly through the system  and many end up in shelters and clinics run by charities  such as the one operated by catholic charities in mcallen on a recent evening  dozens of migrants were dropped off at a shelter near the southern border of california  run by the san diego rapid response network  they stood outside  lined up near white tents under lights powered by a roaring generator  medical workers supported by the county screened them for communicable diseases and other conditions the rotating medical team diagnosed many untreated conditions that could spread  including 362 cases of lice  113 cases of scabies  22 cases of possible influenza  and four cases of chickenpox in the first two months of this year  the medical professionals referred 52 people to an emergency room one young man stood out that evening  he limped to the tent on crutches  in great pain  a metal fixator emerged from his lower left leg  swaddled in layers of bloodied gauze  the only medical record a nurse could find in his belongings was a single x ray showing a severe fracture he had sustained on his journey to the united states the man had undergone surgery on his leg at a nearby hospital and was returned to detention the previous night  now he was at the shelter  they just dropped him here  dr  kathy fischer  the doctor on duty  said with a note of incredulity in her voice  its kind of crazy .
good morning  heres the sign up  if you dont already get california today by email  after about a week on the picket lines  los angeles teachers and district officials reached a deal yesterday to end a historic strike that put the struggles of public schools front and center for a national audience and although mayor eric garcetti of los angeles has previously shied away from involving himself in the affairs of the nations second largest school system  with the brighter spotlight and a potential 2020 presidential bid on the horizon  he jumped into action over the last several days  acting as a kind of mediator my colleague jennifer medina  whos been following the strike closely  spoke to mr  garcetti about the strike  heres part of their conversation jennifer medina  before the strike  contract negotiations had stretched on for nearly two years  how and why did you step up to get involved as a mediator  eric garcetti  i have a good relationship with the school district and the union knows me and trusts me  so it seemed clear that i could do things other people werent able to do  the depth of the lack of the communication took my breath away  everybody had an excuse to say  were not going to sit down  theres plenty of blame  but i think i can help people get to know each other  in august  i started these conversations and then got more involved in december  saying you should be sitting down with each other and offered city hall or even my office  there was just a lot of mistrust at the beginning  i laid down some ground rules  no surprises  positivity  confidentiality and a commitment  nobody was going to walk away from the table you called this a new day for public schools in los angeles  do you think this will significantly change the publics attitude about public education  absolutely  for 10 or 15 years  its just been  are you pro charter or pro union  there hasnt been a culture of cooperation  i said from all along  i will only stay involved if we move beyond that the final round of negotiations stretched into dawn tuesday morning  did you ever think a deal might not happen  it almost all fell apart this morning  it had gone over the cliff  we had done all the other items  i think there were 27 other issues that had been resolved by then  but we still had a disagreement about the class size cap  the teachers have for so long seen class size as an unachievable  never enforced ideal  superintendent austin beutner really wanted to hold on to the prerogative to change it if he needed to  i said it was time for a new day on this  because i think its the right thing to do what do you see as the future of charter schools here  will we stop seeing their growth in los angeles or in the rest of the state  im very agnostic on whether our schools are charters or noncharters  i think we should focus on the schools we already have and not have more charters pull away from the district to continue their expansion  we should have more accountability on whats the costs and consequences of having these charter schools how will the district come up with the money to pay for all this  i think they realized they could stretch further than they initially thought  while the union realized they could get something in every category they wanted  i think this is a new day to say how people can come together  not just for one philosophy versus another  its about making labs of innovation  about a joint commitment to make these schools work for kids who are already there  a note  we often link to content on sites that limit access for

washington  in pursuit of a wall  president trump ran into one  a single minded drive to force congress to finance his signature campaign promise has left mr  trump right back where he started  this time seeking a way to climb over the political barrier in his way after trying to charge through it did not work as he inched closer to reluctantly accepting a bipartisan spending compromise without the money he demanded for his border wall  mr  trump offered no acknowledgment on wednesday that his pressure tactics had failed even as aides sought to minimize the damage by tamping down criticism on the right one call was made to lou dobbs  a favorite of mr  trumps whose fox business network show he often tries to catch live  another was placed to sean hannity  the fox host who regularly talks with the president  the message  mr  trump deserved support because he still forced concessions that he would never have gotten without a five week partial government shutdown even so  it was arguably the most punishing defeat mr  trump has experienced as president  and it left the white house scrounging for other ways to pay for a wall on the southwestern border and rethinking its approach to a congress now partly controlled by democrats  mr  trumps inability to reach a satisfying deal despite the negotiating experience he regularly touted on the campaign trail suggested that any aspirations of collaboration across party lines may be even more elusive than he had imagined we shut down the government for 35 days  we put america through this crisis  we jeopardized our economy  for what  said senator richard j  durbin of illinois  the second ranking democrat in the upper chamber and a member of the house senate committee that negotiated this weeks spending deal  totally unnecessary the agreement that lawmakers produced this week would allocate  1 375 billion for fencing along the border  even less than was on the table at one point last year  the senate plans to vote on the measure on thursday  followed by the house  mr  trump would not say whether he would sign it  but he seemed to be leaning toward it in the interest of avoiding another government shutdown at midnight friday with the wall  they want to be stingy  mr  trump complained about speaker nancy pelosi and other congressional democrats during an encounter with reporters on wednesday  but we have options that most people dont really understand those options involve diverting money from other programs and potentially declaring a national emergency to access further funds  in the end  aides said  mr  trump may even secure more money than congress denied him  but those options were just as available to mr  trump in december before the showdown that closed federal agencies while acknowledging disappointment in the agreement  the president and his aides characterized it as better than it seemed  citing money it will provide for overall border security  mr  trump argued that the shutdown had been useful because it educated the country about troubles at the border and  if nothing else  he has framed the national debate on his terms that did not completely assuage conservatives  representative mark meadows  republican of north carolina and the chairman of the house freedom caucus  contradicted the white house line and declared that the agreement was a bad deal for the president only in washington  d c   can we start out with needing  25 billion for border security measures and expect applause at 1 37  he said tuesday on fox news  i mean  only in d c  is that a winning deal mr  meadows and his allies were among those targeted by the white house in hopes of avoiding a more threatening conservative revolt  a meeting with members of his freedom caucus in the oval office was partly aimed at urging them to hold their fire in television interviews when talking about the bill  according to a person briefed on the effort and indeed  despite his complaints about the bill  mr  meadows made a point on wednesday of not blaming mr  trump  i think he handled it as well as anybody could handle it  given a dysfunctional congress  mr  meadows told reporters among those involved in the outreach  according to the person briefed on the discussions  was bill shine  a white house deputy chief of staff and former fox executive who in the west wing is seen as adept at getting some hosts at fox to respond to white house concerns since coming to office  mr  trump has missed several opportunities to make more progress on the wall  instead of mexico directly paying for a  25 billion  1 000 mile concrete barrier  as the president once said would happen  he has been seeking partial installments from congress  arguing that his new trade agreement with mexico will ultimately pay off enough to offset the cost  the partial installments have generally gone to replacing or repairing existing barriers  not to building the new concrete or steel walls mr  trump wants at one point last year  the president and democrats were close to a deal in which he would get all  25 billion for the wall in exchange for protections for 1 8 million young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children  but mr  trump ultimately turned away because he also wanted cuts to legal immigration that democrats would not accept in his budget request for this year  mr  trump asked for  1 6 billion  and the senate appropriations committee agreed on a bipartisan basis to give him that last summer  but the measure stalled until after the midterm elections in november by the time mr  trump met with ms  pelosi and senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  in december  they offered  1 375 billion  the president then insisted on  5 7 billion  and when he did not get it  much of the government was left without the funding to keep doors open during the shutdown  ms  pelosi took an even harder line  saying she would not spend a single dollar on mr  trumps wall  although she said she would provide money for other border security the deal reached this week returned to the same  1 375 billion available in december to pay for 55 miles of fencing along the border  although not walls based on the new steel or concrete prototypes mr  trump has promoted mr  trump and his aides claimed victory because they had gotten more than ms  pelosis zero dollars  and they noted that the agreement also included  23 billion for immigration and customs enforcement and customs and border protection  an increase from  21 billion last year  but democrats said much of the increase would go to their priorities  like more customs agents and humanitarian aid  not to mr  trumps either way  his aides are now focused on finding pots of money that  with the presidents traditional discretion  can be reprogrammed toward the wall  if that is not enough  he could still declare a national emergency to bypass congress  although such a move is opposed by many republicans and would invariably draw a court challenge as a result  some supporters of tougher border security said mr  trumps critics should not crow because the struggle is not over people say  well  the president lost  said james jay carafano  a national security analyst at the heritage foundation  the analogy here is if its a 10 round fight  trumps fighting 10 rounds  if pelosi wants to say at the end of round 1  i won that round  trumps like  yeah  maybe  but im fighting 10 rounds andy surabian  a former trump white house aide  said the details do not matter to the presidents base as much as his determination to fulfill his promise  his supporters dont care about how the rest of the wall is built  he said  they just care that the wall is ultimately built .
 want to get this briefing by email  heres the sign up   good morning  we look at president xi jinpings quest to absorb taiwan  the u s  congresss first day back and a 300 mile human chain in india  heres the latest the chinese leader called taiwans autonomy a wound to the chinese nation and demanded greater progress in beijings decades long quest to win control of the disputed island details  mr  xi gave taiwan two options  he could use military force if the self ruled territory grasped for independence  or he could offer a one country  two systems deal  similar to the framework used in hong kong  but the president didnt lay down a timetable for either path reaction  people in taiwan are unlikely to be receptive to mr  xis offer  especially as they watch beijing squeeze hong kongs political freedoms context  china and taiwan have been in conflict over the islands status since 1949  when forces defeated by mao zedong retreated to the island  tensions increased when the island moved to democratic elections in the 1990s  today  only 3 percent of taiwans population favors immediate unification with china  according to a recent survey democrats will take control of the house of representatives when it reconvenes today  representing the first taste of a split government during the trump era details  the u s  government has been partly shut down for nearly two weeks after a legislative impasse over funding for a border wall what to watch for  president trump has invited congressional leaders of both parties to a briefing on border security  representative nancy pelosi  who is likely to be elected speaker today  has said the wall cant be part of any deal to reopen the government kim jong un said on tuesday that he was willing to hold a second summit meeting with president trump  but he added that if international sanctions werent lifted  the north would have no choice but to return to nuclear confrontation we will not make nuclear weapons and we will not proliferate nuclear weapons  mr  kim said  but he added that it wont be good if the u s  didnt make corresponding measures details  progress between the u s  and north korea hinges on the definition of denuclearization  for the u s   that means the north giving up its entire arsenal  for north korea  it also includes a reciprocal pullback of americas ability to threaten the country with nuclear weapons analysis  mr  kim has essentially returned to where things stood when mr  trump took office  indicating that their meeting in singapore in june altered the optics of their relationship more than the reality  writes our national security correspondent two women in the southern indian state of kerala sneaked into a centuries old hindu shrine that has long barred women of childbearing age context  in october  indias supreme court ruled that the ban on women entering the temple was unconstitutional  since then  women trying to set foot in the shrine have been pushed back by mobs shouting in their faces and hurling stones why it matters  this recent development in kerala was part of a broader movement for equality in the country  hours before the women entered the temple  an estimated five million people formed a 300 mile long human chain protesting gender inequality reaction  the news was met with protests across the state  the police moved relatives of one of the women to a safe house  local news media reported  and a hindu priest shut down the temple for purification rituals but one officer stationed near the temple said the two women  whose names were given only as bindu and kanakadurga  were real heroines u s  china trade talks  as negotiations seeking to reach a deal by march 2 begin  we take a look at the u s  trade representative robert lighthizer  a

washington  the federal courts are running out of money as the partial government shutdown continues with no end in sight  raising concerns that the legal system will be significantly hobbled if the standoff is not resolved soon judges and court officials around the country are bracing for the likelihood that the federal judiciary will be unable to maintain its current operations within the next two weeks  once it exhausts the money it has been relying on since the shutdown began last month already  courts have been cutting down on expenses like travel and new hiring  court appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants have been working without pay since late december  according to the administrative office of the united states courts  which provides support for the court system there have been other disruptions  the justice department is among the executive branch agencies whose funding has lapsed  and at the departments request  some federal courts have issued orders postponing civil cases in which the justice department is a party while the shutdown continues  according to the administrative office if the judiciary runs out of money  courts around the country will pare down their work to mission critical operations  officials said  thousands of court employees will stop receiving paychecks  some workers are expected to be furloughed and more civil cases could grind to a halt  jurors may have to wait to be paid until the shutdown is over were already having to make what i call triage decisions as to what we can do versus what we cannot do  said chief judge rubn castillo of federal district court for the northern district of illinois  which includes chicago the trump administration has tried to blunt the effects of the shutdown on important government services by drawing up plans to recall thousands of employees in executive branch agencies like the internal revenue service and the agriculture department but the courts present an area in which the damage from the shutdown is expected to worsen considerably  a crippled judiciary  with all the consequences that would entail for businesses and citizens alike who come before its courts  would only add to the pressure on president trump and lawmakers to find a way to reopen the government with roughly 33 000 employees nationwide and annual federal funding of under  8 billion  the judiciary makes up a tiny part of the federal budget  in recent years  it has accounted for only about two tenths of 1 percent of annual federal spending but like other parts of the government  it relies on congress to provide funding as part of the annual appropriations process  and it now stands as one of the many parts of the government whose funding lapsed in december after mr  trump demanded money for a border wall and congressional democrats refused to go along unlike other parts of the government  the courts have been able to keep afloat over the past few weeks by relying on court fees as well as other funds that were available  the courts are now expected to be able to continue funded operations through at least jan  25  and possibly until feb  1  the administrative office said when the courts run out of money  they will essentially have to react much the way that executive branch agencies did in december  limiting work to certain essential activities for the courts  that includes activities to support the exercise of the courts constitutional powers under article iii  specifically the resolution of cases and related services  the administrative office said the supreme court  federal appeals courts  district courts and bankruptcy courts around the country will have to decide on a court by court basis how they will change their operations and what staff will be needed to continue that work  court employees  like executive branch employees affected by the shutdown  would work without pay or be furloughed under the constitution  supreme court justices  appeals court judges and district judges would continue to be paid  according to the congressional research service court officials are grappling with all sorts of complications that could arise  including the possible effects on court reporters and court interpreters  as well as on jurors who are supposed to be paid for their service and reimbursed for transportation expenses in brooklyn  the federal district court for the eastern district of new york is planning to furlough some court employees  and groups that use courthouse facilities for occasions like bar association meetings or continuing legal education are being told to make other plans theres a lot of angst  i can tell you that  eugene j  corcoran  the district executive for the eastern district  said of the sentiment among workers in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit  which covers much of the west  one idea being considered is to close the appellate courthouses to the public for one weekday per week and furlough employees that day my chief judge has no intention of canceling court  said molly dwyer  the clerk of court for the court of appeals for the ninth circuit  noting that oral arguments had been scheduled for weeks to come in manhattan  the federal district court for the southern district of new york has already restricted the hours when initial appearances for criminal defendants can take place  because of staffing constraints with the united states marshals service there are little things that cost money but might not normally get much thought  like providing lunch for jurors when they are deliberating  i got to find a deli in town thats going to continue to let us owe them thousands of dollars  said edward friedland  the district executive for the southern district then there is the issue of keeping the courthouse doors open mr  friedland said it was unclear if contracted building workers who handle areas like fire safety as well as heating  ventilation and air conditioning would be paid beyond february  raising the possibility that the southern districts courthouses might not be able to stay open that uncertainty has prompted the court to turn to its pandemic plan  which was prepared for a situation in which judges and other court personnel would not be able to leave their homes because of a disease outbreak  but essential work like determining bail for defendants still needed to take place thats something we never thought wed be testing for this purpose  mr  friedland said in chicago  judge castillo worried that there would be longer term ramifications  such as veteran employees deciding to call it quits  and young people being turned off from pursuing federal jobs its very self defeating  he said  adding  its like youre on the front lines and youre being shot in the back by your own forces  thats how it feels given that his court is already understaffed  he said he was not planning furloughs  but he said that civil trials would be shut down  and his court would give priority to criminal cases in which defendants are detained awaiting trial and have the presumption of innocence still  for defendants who are not detained  he predicted that defense lawyers would not want to go to trial because of another complication  there would not be any money to pay jurors until after the shutdown the dilemma that creates is then you have jurors who are making big decisions and may be unhappy about the circumstances of their jury service  judge castillo said  i was a defense attorney  i would not want to proceed to trial under those circumstances because those circumstances can lead to rushed judgments on the part of jurors that just want to get this done and over with  thats not fair .
 want to get this briefing by email  heres the sign up  the partial government shutdown is now in its fifth week  and some of the 800 000 federal workers whove been affected are turning to jobs like driving for uber or substitute teaching  its almost as if im starting over again from a teenager  said a woman who began delivering takeout dinners and groceries after being furloughed at the department of agriculture the shutdown is also hurting some of the most vulnerable  including the homeless and those who depend on federal rent subsidies catch up  over the weekend  president trump proposed restoring temporary protections for the undocumented immigrants known as dreamers in exchange for  5 7 billion for a border wall  an offer speaker nancy pelosi immediately rejected  senator mitch mcconnell  the majority leader  could propose legislation today that would wrap mr  trumps proposal into a package to reopen the government  news analysis  people who have done business with mr  trump say his current stance is consistent with negotiating tactics he used in the private sector  focusing foremost on claiming victory the trump administration announced last month that it was lifting sanctions against several companies controlled by an influential oligarch  oleg deripaska  the government characterized the move as tough on both him and russia but a confidential document signed by both sides suggests that the agreement is less punishing than advertised  freeing mr  deripaska from hundreds of millions of dollars in debt how we know  the treasury department described the agreement in a letter to congress that was released publicly  but the confidential document  which was reviewed by the times  includes greater detail background  sanctions were announced in april

 want to get this briefing by email  heres the sign up  mr  trump said on thursday that the u s  should recognize israels authority over the long disputed golan heights  overturning decades of american policy in the middle east mr  trumps announcement on twitter came after persistent pressure from the israeli prime minister  benjamin netanyahu  an ally who is fighting for his political life with an election scheduled for next month  while popular in israel and among some u s  lawmakers  mr  trumps decision is likely to be condemned almost everywhere else  catch up  the united nations has rejected israels occupation of the golan heights since 1967  when israeli troops seized the 400 square miles from syria during the arab israeli war  heres a brief history of the dispute  whats next  practically speaking  mr  trumps announcement doesnt change much  as the status of the golan heights is not under negotiation  and theres no expectation that israel will withdraw  but symbolically  the decision shakes up a debate that has changed little since the 1970s european union officials agreed on thursday to extend the deadline for britains withdrawal from the bloc until may 22  as long as prime minister theresa may can persuade parliament to accept her plan for doing so  if she cant  and lawmakers have already rejected her proposal twice  the deadline would be moved up to april 12 the agreement effectively averted a disorderly and chaotic departure at the end of next week  yet such a break remains a possibility whats next  neither side wants britain to leave without a deal  european union officials said they remained open to a longer delay but that it would require britain to participate in european parliament elections  something that mrs  may has said would be an

washington  the partial government shutdown is inflicting far greater damage on the united states economy than previously estimated  the white house acknowledged on tuesday  as president trumps economists doubled projections of how much economic growth is being lost each week the standoff with democrats continues the revised estimates from the council of economic advisers show that the shutdown  now in its fourth week  is beginning to have real economic consequences  the analysis  and other projections from outside the white house  suggests that the shutdown has already weighed significantly on growth and could ultimately push the united states economy into a contraction while vice president mike pence previously played down the shutdowns effects amid a roaring economy  white house officials are now cautioning mr  trump about the toll it could take on a sustained economic expansion  mr  trump  who has hitched his political success to the economy  also faces other economic headwinds  including slowing global growth  a trade war with china and the waning effects of a  1 5 trillion tax cut to blunt the shutdowns effects  the administration on tuesday called tens of thousands of employees back to work  without pay  to process tax returns  ensure flight safety and inspect food and drugs  but some people involved in the shutdown discussions in the white house have privately said they anticipate that mr  trump will grow anxious about the economic impact in the coming days  accelerating an end to the stalemate  others close to the president believe mr  trump has leverage and are encouraging him to stand by his demands for now  the white house shows no signs of being ready to relent  and kevin hassett  the chairman of the council of economic advisers  continued to blame democrats for the economic damage congress needs to look at the harms that were talking about  mr  hassett said  and address them mr  hassett said on tuesday that the administration now calculates that the shutdown reduces quarterly economic growth by 0 13 percentage points for every week that it lasts  the cumulative effect of lost work from contractors and furloughed federal employees who are not getting paid and who are investing and spending less as a result  that means that the economy has already lost nearly half a percentage point of growth from the four week shutdown   last year  economic growth for the first quarter totaled 2 2 percent  mr  hassett  attempting to illustrate the pain caused by the shutdown  said on tuesday that one of his furloughed staff members had begun driving for uber to make ends meet mr  trump has demanded that democrats  who control the house of representatives  include  5 7 billion for a border wall in any measure to fund the government  democrats have refused and  along with some republicans  have tried to persuade the president to reopen the government and negotiate border security afterward  the house has passed several bills to fund parts of the government  including the internal revenue service  that are not related to border security  senate republicans have declined to schedule votes on those bills on tuesday  in an effort to try to splinter the democrats opposition  the white house invited several house democrats from districts mr  trump won to discuss a path forward  none showed up the impasse has left 800 000 federal employees furloughed or working without pay  along with throwing thousands of government contractors at least temporarily off the job mr  hassett said it was possible that the damage could grow  he also said much of the damage should be repaired once the shutdown ends and workers get back pay  but he acknowledged that the shutdown could permanently reduce growth expectations if businesses and markets begin to expect that congress and the president will repeat the experience again and again some economists have begun to warn that such a situation is likely and that economic confidence could be undermined as businesses  consumers and investors lose faith in the ability of political leaders to find agreement on issues like raising the federal debt limit and approving trade deals that lack of confidence could snowball into a self inflicted economic contraction on the heels of what appears to have been the nations strongest year of growth since the 2008 financial crisis  financial markets are already highly volatile amid concerns about the trade fight with china  slowing global growth and signs of weakness in american housing and manufacturing sectors the economy could easily stall in the first quarter  and then the question is what happens in the second if the shutdown persists  said ian shepherdson  the chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics  the longer it goes on  the longer it takes to recover if the shutdown continues through the end of march  mr  shepherdson said in a research note  he would expect the economy to shrink in the first quarter  while federal workers are likely to receive back pay once the furlough ends  most government contractors will not  and the longer spending is depressed  the higher the risk that the businesses they run or patronize will fail  mr  shepherdson said the shutdown is threatening to derail this economic expansion  bernard baumohl  the chief global economist for the economic outlook group  said in a research note on tuesday  its effect on federal workers spending plans is particularly worrisome for the automotive and housing markets  which were already showing signs of trouble before the shutdown  he said on tuesday  a federal reserve bank of new york survey showed weakening manufacturing activity in the united states  the latest in a line of similar warnings  economists at jpmorgan chase called the data an early indication of additional slowing in the sector  adding that the shutdown was probably hurting business sentiment michael l  corbat  the chief executive of citigroup  told analysts on monday that right now  we see the biggest risk in the global economy as one of talking ourselves into a recession with no end in sight  federal workers appear ready to seek alternate employment before things get worse the online jobs site indeed analyzed job search behavior from mid december through mid january for workers at some affected federal agencies  including the i r s  and transportation security administration  it found clicks on job listings rose at least 17 percent for each of those worker groups over that period  a sign that employees affected by the shutdown are searching for jobs more right now than they usually do at this time of year  said martha gimbel  indeeds director of economic research with the shutdown occurring in a tight labor market  many workers have other options  and they seem to be trying to take advantage of them  ms  gimbel said  if the shutdown leads to a loss of talent for the federal government  it could be harder for it to compete for new hires in a labor market this tight that might already be happening inside the white house  mr  hassett said on tuesday that a prospective new hire had told the council that he might turn down the job he had been offered out of graduate school because the government is unable to bring him onto the payroll .
president trump has shut down the government to get money for a border wall that he says will stop illegal immigration  but the fact of the matter is that thats not all he wants to stop  during the three day shutdown last january  he demanded a 40 percent reduction in legal immigration  arguing that america has been swamped by immigrants  theres a limit to how many people a nation can responsibly absorb into their societies   he has declared he is not alone in invoking this boogeyman  that america is being overwhelmed by a flood of immigrants has become conventional wisdom across the political spectrum  presented in books from  on the right  reihan salam of national review  the son of bangladeshi immigrants  in the center  francis fukuyama of stanford  whose mother immigrated from japan  and on the left  jefferson cowie of vanderbilt university  who actually counsels his fellow progressives not to fear more immigration but by any reasonable metric  the idea that america is experiencing mass immigrationis a myth  the reality is that we desperately need to pick up the pace of immigration to maintain our work force and economic health you could argue that mass immigration  a vague term with no set definition  is happening in lebanon and jordan  primary destinations for refugees escaping syrias civil war  lebanon  which had about 4 4 million people in 2010  has admitted in just a few years around one million syrian refugees  which works out to around 23 percent increase in its population in america  by contrast  there are about 44 million foreign born people who now constitute about 13 7 percent of the population  according to the pew research foundation  this is close to the historic high of 15 percent at the turn of the 20th century  why is that considered a meaningful benchmark  because at that time the united states  responding to nativist and union pressure  embraced strict border controls  essentially ending what had until then been an open borders policy literacy tests were instituted in 1917  and the 1924 johnson reed act imposed national origins quotas limiting visas to 2 percent of the total number of people of each nationality in the united states as of the 1890 census  the purpose of this legislation was to cut back immigration overall  especially from eastern europe and asia  and it succeeded spectacularly congress finally eliminated these quotas  which had widely come to be regarded as racist  in 1965  and immigration subsequently picked up  but immigration opponents have made the 15 percent foreign born figure a tipping point  as if it were based on science instead of being an arbitrary historical event  if it were indeed a tipping point  countries would regularly experience a backlash once the immigrant population approached that level  that is far from the case americas share of the foreign born ranks 34th among 50 wealthy countries with a per capita gross domestic product of over  20 000  the united states netted five new immigrants  authorized and unauthorized  per 1 000 people from 2015 to 2017  united nations figures show  compare that to the figures in two other english speaking liberal democracies  canada let in eight  and just announced that its going to admit over a million new immigrants over three years   and australia 14  all in all  the foreign born are now over 20 percent of canadas population and 28 2 percent of australias  more than double americas figure   and yet they havent inspired the sort of public condemnation of immigration that often occurs in the united states  america has also taken in a relatively modest numbers of immigrants over the last half century  in 1965  when congress got rid of national origin quotas  americas foreign born made up around 5 percent of the population  over two decades from 1980 to 2000  this proportion rose to 11 1 percent  from 6 2 percent  not insignificant but not particularly noteworthy but then the rate of increase slowed to a crawl  rising from 11 1 percent in 2000 to 12 9 percent in 2010 and then barely inching to 13 5 percent in 2016  in other words  in six years  americas foreign born population inched up 0 6 percent  yet the more americas  modest  immigration decelerates  the more the mass immigration trope accelerates a good yardstick for whether a country is admitting too many or too few immigrants  beyond the political mood of the moment  is its economic needs  if america were admitting too many immigrants  the economy would have trouble absorbing them  in fact  the unemployment rate among immigrants  including the 11 million undocumented  in 2016  when the economy was considered to be at full employment  was almost three quarters of a point lower than that of natives  how can that be evidence of mass immigration the truth is that america is a low immigration nation  demographic trends in america point to a severe labor crunch thatll become a huge bottleneck for growth unless the country opens its doors wider it has long been clear that the dropping fertility rates of native born white americans meant that the generations coming after the millennials were on track to be much smaller  from 2015 to 2035  the number of working age americans with domestic born parents is expected to fall by eight million  furthermore  the census bureau in 2017 quietly revised downward its population forecast for 2050 by a whopping 50 million people from its 2008 estimates  as jack goldstone  a political demographer at george mason university  pointed out  why  because immigration from mexico dwindled after the great recession at the same time that hispanic fertility rates dropped by a quarter as well  at the current rate that america is admitting immigrants  this means that the total work force will grow only 0 3 percent per year  unless american birthrates pick up suddenly and expand the work force  an unrealistic assumption given that the country just set a record for low fertility  or the productivity of its dwindling work force quickly doubled  only slightly less unrealistic  says mr  goldstone  the united states will be staring at real g d p  growth of less than 1 6 percent per year in less than a decade  all else remaining equal america should be admitting a million more immigrants per year  more than double the current number from now until 2050  this still wont add up to mass immigration because it would put americas foreign born population that year at around 26 percent  less than australias is today fifteen years ago when i was writing about immigration for the conservative editorial page of the detroit news  the myth that america was being overwhelmed by immigrants had retreated mostly to nativist activist circles  just because it has spread now does not mean its true  its a myth that should be killed before it kills the american dream .
at first glance  the decision by congressional republican leaders on monday to strip representative steve king of his committee assignments for remarks last week defending white supremacy last week appears to be an example of the party stepping in to police its own extremists  but its actually the opposite the condemnations of mr  king  now in his ninth term in congress  come only after years of ignoring his white nationalist rhetoric  and address what is merely the tip of a vast iceberg people took little notice when  over the weekend  president trump approvingly cited a column from pat buchanan about the border wall that described the democratic party as hostile to white men the presidents shout out was a reminder that the republican partys dalliance with radicalism goes beyond his presidency and long predates it  for more than a half century  two characteristics have defined what we term the long new right  a politics centered on mobilizing group resentment and conflict  and a determined refusal to police boundaries by building an electoral coalition to give it power and winning factional battles to control its agenda  the long new right ultimately captured the republican party  and fatefully rendered it permeable to extremist forces it lacks either the will or ability to challenge unless party leaders draw and enforce meaningful boundaries and develop a more appealing economic agenda for the republican rank and file  the party will continue its dance with extremists after mr  trump departs the scene todays republican party  both pro  and anti trump  tells a shared origin story  a remnant of conservative thinkers toiling in the wilderness of the postwar liberal consensus developed an ideological agenda blending traditional morality and free market economics  popularized it in the pages of national review  and inspired the movement to win barry goldwater the republican presidential nomination in 1964 and  eventually  to put ronald reagan in the white house missing from this story is a key point  postwar american conservatism was forged in battles over extremists  a formative fight for many movement founders concerned senator joe mccarthys reckless crusade against communists  before founding national review  william f  buckley  then in his 20s  was a co author of a 1954 book that offered what might be called a full throated anti anti mccarthy case  it separated mccarthy the flawed man from mccarthyism the worthy program of action against those in our land who help the enemy  on civil rights  buckley would eschew even such anti anti arguments in favor of openly defending jim crow in the later 1950s and early 1960s  buckleys circle of movement ideologists regularly intermingled with harder edged actors  it was a world populated by conservative book clubs and advocacy groups  bible pounding anti communist crusaders and the secretive john birch society  with its tens of thousands of members and well earned reputation for gonzo conspiracism  contrary to movement myth  buckley did not purge the birchers from the movement in the 1960s  national review articles in 1962 singled out the birch societys founder  robert welch  for personal condemnation while sparing ordinary members of his organization   a more full throated attack on the group followed three years later  but only after goldwaters defeat  goldwater  too  criticized welch personally  but went no further  his campaign was powered by best selling tracts like phyllis schlaflys a choice  not an echo  steeped in the birchers baroquely paranoid style  a whos who of the hard right  including the anti semite gerald l k  smith  enthusiastically supported his candidacy  and the campaign did little to disavow them  even the party establishment that resisted goldwaters nomination blanched at calling out extremism  a proposed platform plank at the convention denouncing extremism and explicitly naming the birch society failed to find support even from dwight eisenhower and george romney  by the early 1980s  long into the birch societys decline  republicans would feel less reason than ever to hide or apologize for engaging birchers  the societys magazine  the review of the news  featured interviews with the likes of dick cheney and chuck grassley the next generation of conservative movement activists  including paul weyrich  a key mentor of newt gingrich   morton blackwell and richard viguerie  adopted a more pugilistic approach that brought together radical and mainstream elements on the right  in the 1970s  they avoided traditional republican small government political appeals in favor of mobilizations over busing  abortion and gay rights while courting the segregationist george wallaces followers and brokering a fateful alliance between christian evangelicals and the republican party  the new right formed think tanks  advocacy groups and political action committees to do the work they didnt trust the formal party to do  parties are no more than instruments  temporary and disposable  declared the maryland congressman bob bauman at 1975s conservative political action conference  this troublemaking activism irked party officials like ronald reagans first republican national committee chairman  richard richards  who called the outside groups loose cannonballs on the deck of a ship  but their approach eventually came to dominate  thanks to the expanding right wing media ecosystem  primary voters  and direct mail fund raising dollars  the refusal to police boundaries evolved from an ethos to a structural feature of the political world built by the long new right for decades  the long new right has depended on buy in from moneyed interests within the republican coalition  the grass roots right may have disliked the plutocrats economic agenda  but they repeatedly accepted it to gain access to power  for their part  the plutocrats may have regarded the new right as uncouth and their social agenda divisive  but they  too  preferred it to any available alternative  the trump presidency  featuring fights over a wall with mexico alongside corporate tax cuts  embodies this enduring bargain  whatever president trumps fate  as long as the core economic agenda of the partys funders remains unpopular  republicans will have to stoke group resentment to win elections while the party doesnt lack for proposals that would update its outdated  plutocrat friendly agenda  see the books and proposals from oren cass  henry olsen and figures around the niskanen center  to name a few  changing this dynamic will not come easy  certainly not as easy as various never trumpers imagine  the hard  sustained political work in the trenches will require both meaningful shifts in the republican partys program  toward policies that speak to the material welfare of its constituents  and robust party organization with the means and the will to contain the fever swamps in the long run  the danger on the right is not just republicans problem  but all of ours  american democracy depends on the grand old party learning to secure its own borders .

president trump will deliver his second state of the union address at 9 p m  eastern time tuesday night  the speech was originally scheduled for last month  but was postponed because of the partial government shutdown  prompted by mr  trumps demand that congress pay for a wall along the southern border with mexico presidents use the address  in a favorable setting and commanding national attention  to gain both political and policy advantage  this year  for example  mr  trump is expected to announce a plan to stop transmission of h i v  by 2030 white house officials said that the president will also make calls for unity in a polarized age  if that has a familiar ring  it is because he made similar exhortations last year  follow our live briefing for updates on the 2019 state of the union  but his audience in the house chamber will be markedly different  starting with speaker nancy pelosi  who will be sitting over his shoulder  and dozens of newly elected democratic women  many of whom have been deeply critical of the president  who will be seated in front of him  the democratic response will be delivered by stacey abrams  who ran unsuccessfully for governor in georgia last year but emerged as one of the partys rising stars the chamber will also be flush with declared and potential 2020 democratic presidential candidates  including senators kamala harris  elizabeth warren  cory booker and kirsten gillibrand  whether or not mr  trump mentions the 2020 campaign  it will be an important backdrop for his address it will be aired by all major broadcast and cable networks and streamed live at www nytimes com  where reporters will also be providing real time fact checking and analysis on tuesday morning  the presidents top surrogates received a memo from the white house with talking points to emphasize as they try to shape opinion even before the speech starts  the memo said a theme of the address will be choosing greatness and adds that the president will appeal to americans aspirations  the memo also said mr  trump will try to offer a policy agenda that can appeal to both parties  an approach that so far has eluded him during his time in office  immigration policy dominated the presidents agenda during his second year in office  and most likely will again during the third  mr  trump has consistently tried to make the case that there is a crisis  of crime  drugs and human trafficking  at the border with mexico  an emergency that can be dealt with only by building a border wall the president is also likely to call for a legislative solution to address the so called dreamers  younger immigrants who were brought to the united states illegally as children and have no criminal record  this is one area of possible cooperation with democrats  but there are significant disagreements about details mr  trump is not expected to veer from his demands for billions of dollars in funding for border security  including some kind of barrier  congressional negotiators from both parties are trying to hammer out a deal on border security  but democrats have been adamant that they will not agree to money for mr  trumps wall  and the president has been pessimistic about the chances of capitol hill coming up with an agreement that meets his approval still  he is not expected to use the address on tuesday to declare a national emergency  which potentially would enable him to construct additional barriers along the border using presidential authority white house officials said the president is also likely to talk about abortion and the fundamental importance and respect for human life  mr  trumps evangelical supporters  who fervently oppose abortion  have been the bulwark of his political base he might also talk about chinas program of forced abortion and sterilization  and perhaps even efforts in the united states to ease some abortion restrictions  such as a contentious amendment regarding late term abortions being considered by the legislature in virginia mr  trump has called for a substantial withdrawal of troops from the war in afghanistan  where the united states military has been fighting for more than 17 years  but he has encountered uncharacteristic pushback from republicans about taking troops out of syria  in recent days  he has talked about keeping american troops in iraq to maintain pressure on iran  despite political opposition to the idea in baghdad  he has also faced resistance from military leaders about drawing down troops too rapidly in afghanistan  so the speech offers an opportunity to lay out his thinking to the american people the president  as he did last year  will almost certainly make an appeal for an infrastructure program  and is likely to emphasize its effect in rural america  the home of his political base  programs to repair roads and bridges have strong bipartisan appeal  but so far  republicans and democrats have not found a middle ground  presidents typically use the state of the union speech to take credit for successes in the previous year  mr  trump will most likely talk about a robust economy  a low rate of unemployment  a tax cut he credits with spurring growth and his push to roll back federal regulations on business  many economists say that the tax cut provided only a temporary stimulus  but few can argue with the continued growth in jobs  now at 100 straight months  or the unemployment rate  which was 4 percent in january mr  trump is also likely to say that the new trade agreements with canada and mexico  combined with his aggressive use of tariffs against china  have made the trade environment far more favorable to the united states  congress has yet to ratify the trade pact with canada and mexico last year  mr  trump gave a speech in largely measured tones and sounded a call for common purpose  tonight  i call upon all of us to set aside our differences  to seek common ground and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people  he said  adding  so let us begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our union is strong because our people are strong  and together  we are building a safe  strong and proud america but his presidency became no less polarizing in the subsequent 12 months  and with the 2020 campaign getting underway and the special counsels investigation into russian interference in the last election still incomplete  the chances that partisanship will ebb in the next year do not seem especially promising the constitution says that the president shall from time to time give congress information on the state of the union  from the days of thomas jefferson until woodrow wilson  presidents gave the address in writing  wilson changed that tradition by delivering it in person  and it has evolved into a largely political evening  members of the presidents party cheer lustily  while members of the other party often sit stone faced  this has led some  like mitch daniels  the president of purdue university and a former two term republican governor of indiana  and steve israel  a former democratic congressman from new york  to say that the state of the union speech has outlived its usefulness and should be discontinued last years speech clocked in at 80 minutes  the longest since president bill clintons in 2000 .

australian food columnist  who travels the country looking for great food and hidden gems they are far from the only places worth recommending  im partial to south australias remote coastline  but

the winning locations were chosen by a team of editors led by amy virshup  who became the travel editor in october along the way  there were arguments  there were changes  there are still some selections that just missed the cut and may never get another shot what the editors looked for varies as amy explained in a recent times insider piece  there is always an effort to find places that have a reason to go now  in 2019 but there are other criteria  too  this year  for example  amy said she prioritized places that were being threatened by climate change  to make a point that the world is changing and you better get going before some of these wonders disappear also  she added  history matters  and there are places that earned spots on our list because they are marking major milestones in interesting ways other key factors included whats happening culturally or in nature that might make a destination particularly interesting this year  and the editors also looked for spots that might offer new alternatives to old favorites perth and the northern rivers match a few of these qualifications  perth has new attractions  northern rivers has a new  boho food scene  and both are alternatives to sydney and melbourne they are also simply beautiful and unique places that the rest of the world should know more about this years 52 places ought to help and one more thing  in case youre wondering  perth is no less beloved because it shows up at 43 while northern rivers landed at 29  i sent amy an email asking about that and she assured me that the order wasnt a ranking of quality other than  1  it is not meant to be in rank of favorite to least favorite  she said  its about getting a good mix of visuals  themes and geography  we like  5 and  50 equally now for this

tom steyer  the california billionaire who has crusaded for president trumps impeachment  said on wednesday that he would not join the pack of democrats running for president in 2020 and would instead redouble his efforts to topple mr  trump before the election mr  steyers decision came as a surprise even to some of his political confidants  he had made deliberate preparations in recent months to seek the white house  running television ads in the early primary states  recruiting potential staff members and even designating a campaign manager for a possible run but mr  steyer began informing aides early this week that he would not be a candidate after all  after concluding that he could have a greater political impact through his impeachment activism  several advisers to mr  steyer said  mr  steyer intends to spend at least  40 million on impeachment efforts in the coming year  money that might otherwise have been directed toward a campaign for the democratic presidential nomination most people come to iowa around this time to announce a campaign for president  mr  steyer said in prepared remarks  which were obtained by the new york times  but i am proud to be here to announce that i will do whatever it takes  for as long as it takes  to remove a president alluding to mr  trumps oval office address on tuesday night  in which he demanded the construction of a border wall  mr  steyer said the president had once again lied to the american people  repeatedly  for his own political skin  he described mr  trump as having already committed numerous offenses warranting his removal from office  and warned democrats that shying away from an impeachment battle would serve to enable the president mr  steyer  61  left himself some wiggle room to change his mind on 2020  saying in prepared remarks that he had decided against running at this time  but his announcement ended  at least for now  the latest of several flirtations with seeking high office  which have also included abortive candidacies for the united states senate and for governor of california  he considered running for president in 2016 before ultimately endorsing hillary clinton in some respects  the democratic primary landscape appeared inviting for a candidate like mr  steyer  with his sterling credentials as a trump antagonist and a virtually bottomless well of money to spend on advertising  he has been one of the democratic partys most prolific donors over the last few elections  eclipsed in 2018 only by michael r  bloomberg  the former new york city mayor who is considering a presidential campaign of his own anticipating a likely race  mr  steyer had settled on a close adviser  heather hargreaves  to serve as his eventual campaign manager  he had conducted research into his own political vulnerabilities  in anticipation of attacks from other democrats in a rowdy primary  and had mapped out how to reorganize his advocacy groups to comply with the fund raising regulations that apply to presidential candidates mr  steyer also recently retained a new senior adviser  doug rubin  who previously advised former gov  deval patrick of massachusetts on a possible 2020 run  mr  patrick announced last month that he had closed the door on a presidential candidacy mr  steyer and his advisers had conducted polling to test a campaign message focused on attacking corporate greed  confronting climate change  and  of course  denouncing mr  trump yet amid his preparations  there were warning signs for mr  steyer  too  as a candidate  he would have faced new levels of scrutiny of his business record  mr  steyer made his vast fortune as the founder of a hedge fund  and his portfolio of investments included considerable stakes in fossil fuel companies  as a wealthy white man  he could have been an awkward cultural match for a party increasingly defined by demands for racial and gender equality  and economic populism and mr  steyers intention to use his personal fortune in fueling a presidential campaign would most likely have been divisive in a democratic primary  his announcement in iowa that he would not run comes days after the first major democratic candidate to join the race  senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts  denounced self funding candidates on a swing through the leadoff caucus state an adviser to mr  steyer  who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations with him  said that he had been unruffled by ms  warrens attacks on billionaire candidates  but  the adviser said  mr  steyer was impressed by ms  warrens rollout as a candidate and suggested that her announcement video channeled the very themes he had been planning to campaign on mr  steyer also disclosed to vogue magazine in november that he and his wife of 32 years  kat taylor  were living separately he is the second prominent democrat to make preparations for a 2020 campaign before abandoning them  after mr  patrick in stepping back from the presidential race  mr  steyer signaled he would further ramp up his impeachment drive  which has roiled democratic politics over the last year  bringing him into direct conflict with elected party leaders and helping shove the idea of mr  trumps early removal into the mainstream of debate on the left underwritten by mr  steyers personal wealth  the impeachment campaign has bombarded television and computer screens around the country with ads demanding mr  trumps ouster  and staged pro impeachment events around the country mr  steyer indicated on wednesday that his pressure campaign would continue  one of his political committees  need to impeach  said it would aim a pressure campaign at house democrats who lead committees relevant to impeachment  including representatives adam schiff of california  who heads the house intelligence committee  and jerrold nadler of new york  who leads the house judiciary committee and mr  steyer  a longtime donor to speaker nancy pelosi  called on her by name to select a bipartisan group of lawmakers to start immediately with a process to remove mr  trump from office the longer they wait  the more they normalize mr  trumps unacceptable acts  mr  steyer said in his prepared speech  and the more they enable him democratic leaders remain wary of mr  steyers impeachment message  and the institutional obstacles to removing mr  trump from office still appear insurmountable  ejecting a president requires a two thirds majority in the senate  and republicans hold 53 seats in the chamber yet the idea of impeachment has moved steadily into the foreground of the democratic imagination  despite the obvious practical impediments  when a high profile freshman lawmaker  representative rashida tlaib of michigan  vowed last week in coarse language to impeach mr  trump  she drew little censure from party leaders and numerous influential voices on the left leapt to her defense .
washington  president trumps repeated threat to declare a national emergency so he can build his border wall without congressional approval has been denounced by democrats as extreme and an overreach  but it could be the only politically realistic way out of the shutdown crisis in the nations capital i think we might work a deal  and if we dont  i may go that route  i have the absolute right to do national emergency if i want  mr  trump told reporters on wednesday  my threshold will be if i cant make a deal with people that are unreasonable if the president does invoke emergency powers to circumvent congress  it would be an extraordinary violation of constitutional norms  and establish a precedent for presidents who fail to win approval for funding a policy goal but mr  trumps threatened move offers both sides a face saving solution in the budget standoff between the president and congressional democrats that has prompted a partial government shutdown  which  if it lasts to saturday  will be at 22 days the longest in american history both sides have taken absolutist positions that leave no room for the kind of split the difference compromise that usually ends budget impasses  mr  trump refuses to accept anything less than his demand for about  5 billion in wall spending  and house speaker nancy pelosi has said his wall along the southern border would be immoral but mr  trumps claim that he can and may attempt to build his wall another way opens the door for him to sign a spending bill with no wall funding  reopening the government without capitulation by either side while any such move by mr  trump is certain to prompt outrage from his critics and wild approval from his supporters  there is good reason to believe that it is unlikely to result in much immediate change  his push for a wall would be channeled into a lengthy court fight  keeping lawyers far busier than construction workers  at least initially  as his term ticks away were going to be in 2020 before this gets resolved  said walter e  dellinger iii  a former solicitor general in the clinton administration  adding  if they are just planning where to build slats  judges are unlikely to decide that requires expedition in the supreme court  i think they would recognize the wisdom of going slow if  in the end  the supreme court were to rule that emergency power laws give mr  trump authority to proceed  he would probably face still more litigation with property owners over whether the government may use eminent domain to force them to sell their border lands  there may be little time left in his term after all that to add more than a few miles  if any  of barriers to the 1 954 mile border  which already has 654 miles of fencing and if the court instead eventually ruled against him  mr  trump could honestly tell his supporters that he tried  and then vow to renew the push if he is re elected  indeed  he has suggested that he would relish still having the issue of wall to once again rev up supporters in the campaign  he wrote on twitter late last month that democrats may have enough votes to stop his wall  but we have the issue  border security  2020 in the meantime  the shutdown that is threatening to last for months could end  hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors could once again receive their wages and pay household bills  national parks could reopen and be cleaned  needy families could keep receiving food assistance  across the economy  farmers and businesses that depend on government actions could proceed with work they need to be handled its a way to get past an ugly fight in a way that allows the dust to settle and passions to cool while moving on  said bruce buchanan  an emeritus professor of political science at the university of texas at austin if mr  trump does invoke emergency powers  fierce criticism would follow  of the 58 times presidents have declared emergencies since congress reformed emergency powers laws in 1976  none involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval  chris edelson  an american university government professor and author of a 2013 book  emergency presidential power  from the drafting of the constitution to the war on terror  said he could recall no such instance in the first two centuries of american history  either the precedent mr  trump would establish raises the risk of longer term damage to the american constitutional system  undermining peoples confidence in the countrys democracy  said elizabeth goitein  who oversaw a recent study of presidential emergency powers for the brennan center for justice at new york university school of law it is a crisis when the president of the united states flouts the role of congress and abuses his powers in order to get around the will of congress and to undermine the democratic process for lawmaking set forth in the constitution  she said ms  goitein and other experts who have studied emergency powers laws have said there are serious  if not dispositive  arguments that mr  trumps legal team can make that at least two such statutes could be used to erect border barriers by redirecting military construction funds that can be freed up  in a presidentially declared emergency  to build something congress has not approved but she and others maintain that it would be an abuse of power for mr  trump to proclaim that there is a national emergency along the southern border that justifies a wall  the number of people illegally crossing the border is far lower than it was a generation ago  the recent phenomenon of caravans of central american migrants largely consists of people who present themselves to border officials and request asylum and despite repeated false claims by trump officials that terrorists are infiltrating the country across the border  including by the thousands  no one in the modern era who committed a terrorist attack on domestic soil has turned out to have sneaked in via mexico many legal experts nevertheless expect that in the inevitable litigation  the justice department would pressure judges not to even consider the facts  arguing that courts must defer to the presidents judgment about whether an emergency exists rather than substituting their own thinking but even though courts have traditionally given substantial deference to the presidents determinations in security matters  mr  dellinger said that should not be true within the executive branch  he said it was the obligation of senior justice department officials who review the legality of proposed government actions  the head of the office of legal counsel  steven a  engel  and the acting attorney general  matthew g  whitaker  to independently assess whether there really is a justifiable basis to declare an emergency  and if there is not  to tell mr  trump no  or resign if there is not  in fact  a persuasive basis for this being the kind of national emergency that was contemplated by congress  and it is nevertheless approved by the department of justice  what is the rule of law cost  what kind of slope does that start us down  mr  dellinger said  one question is whether there is some other way out of this current mess that doesnt involve such a cost to the rule of law .
 want to get this briefing by email  heres the sign up   good evening  heres the latest 1  president trump abruptly walked out of a meeting on the government shutdown with democratic leaders at the white house just left a meeting with chuck and nancy  a total waste of time  the president tweeted  i asked what is going to happen in 30 days if i quickly open things up  are you going to approve border security which includes a wall or steel barrier  nancy said  no  i said bye bye  nothing else works democrats said that the president had thrown a temper tantrum  above  senator chuck schumer after the meeting for now  at least  the presidents forceful response has papered over cracks in republican support that threatened to upend his negotiating position  and as a last resort  mr  trump has said he could declare a national emergency to build a border wall      2  rod rosenstein  the deputy attorney general overseeing the special counsels russia investigation  is expected to leave his

he ended up in a maze of church bureaucracy the priest he was accusing happened to be an augustinian  one of dozens of religious orders in the catholic clergy  and the chicago archdiocese told him to take his complaint to the augustinians victims and advocacy groups say their accusations are often mishandled because they are caught between separate institutions within the church  the dioceses say

alternative facts  the term manages to be tedious  ridiculous and perilous at once  a real sign of the times  for anyone who doesnt remember  kellyanne conway introduced it in early 2017 to defend the white houses falsehoods about attendance numbers at donald trumps inauguration the week before  there she was on meet the press  serenely chiding an exasperated chuck todd for being overly dramatic as he repeatedly tried to get her to concede that lying to the american public was bad her phrasing may have been new  but conway was taking part in what has apparently become a conservative tradition  performing a skepticism so extreme that it makes the ancient greek skeptics look like babes in the woods  recall a high ranking aide in the bush administration needling a journalist for belonging to the reality based community  a respect for facts  the aide suggested  was ultimately for suckers  were an empire now  and when we act  we create our own reality you might think this kind of postmodernism would appeal to the french anthropologist and philosopher bruno latour  who has spent a career studying how knowledge is socially constructed  you would be wrong  such pretensions to reality creating grandeur  latour suggests  amount to little more than a vulgar  self defeating cynicism in down to earth  politics in the new climatic regime  latour argues that climate change is forcing all of us to confront truths that seem hard to reconcile but turn out to be two sides of the same thing  1  reality exists  whether we like it or not  and 2  our attempts to apprehend it are contingent on our social context  along with cailin oconnor and james owen weatheralls the misinformation age  how false beliefs spread  latours new book offers a way to think through the seemingly insurmountable impasse carved out by political polarization and fake news of the two volumes  the misinformation age takes the more methodical and earnest approach  oconnor and weatherall are professors of logic  and they break down the mechanics of misinformation accordingly  they introduce their subject with the vegetable lamb of tartary  a tree that reportedly grew gourd like fruit filled with tiny lambs  the claim was propagated during medieval times by so many respected naturalists and scholars that it took nearly four centuries before it was satisfactorily debunked those medieval scholars kept citing one another rather than verifying  or disproving  the vegetable lamb for themselves  social factors are essential to understanding the spread of beliefs  oconnor and weatherall write  including  especially  false beliefs  similar to the network of right wing sites that nurtured elaborate conspiracy theories about a hillary clinton sponsored pedophilia ring in a washington pizzeria  a notion only slightly less outlandish than lambs growing on trees   the medieval scholars had created their own ecosystem for fake news oconnor and weatherall include contemporary examples of misinformation like pizzagate  but they focus mainly on ideas held by scientists  highlighting how even the most well intentioned beliefs can get deployed and distorted  after all  they say  most scientists  most of the time  are doing their best to learn about the world  using the best methods available and paying careful attention to the available evidence  scientists are the closest we have to ideal inquirers  even if  as the authors make clear  theres an unavoidable element of uncertainty in the scientific enterprise this uncertainty  it turns out  is central to how so much contemporary misinformation works  oconnor and weatherall make a distinction between absolute certainty and the confidence necessary to make informed decisions  the worry that we can never gain complete certainty about matters of fact is irrelevant  they write  though it comes up again and again in the misinformation age  as they show how industrial interests have repeatedly exploited any whiff of uncertainty to argue against government regulation the book contains useful summaries of the debates in the 1980s around the ozone layer and acid rain  drawing from the research of naomi oreskes and erik conway in merchants of doubt  2010   oconnor and weatherall compare industry sponsored campaigns questioning environmental damage to the strategic skepticism of tobacco companies  which disputed the link between smoking and lung cancer by insisting that the link wasnt utterly definitive  as one tobacco executive put it  doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the body of fact that exists in the mind of the public the debate  or as the authors might put it  debate  around climate change has followed a similar narrative  oconnor and weatherall point out that the scientific consensus has long coalesced around human caused climate change  even if denialists insist that the science is still unsettled the one thing you begin to notice in this book is that propagating a reflexive skepticism and sowing discord arent terribly difficult  especially when theres a vested interest willing to pay for it  merely creating the appearance of controversy is often all that needs to be done latours down to earth is a wilder  more playful book  even if  like the misinformation age  it covers big subjects like truth and the fate of the species  the election of donald trump  latour says  was a clarifying event  not only for americans but for the world  here  finally  was a political figure whose brazen repudiations of reality laid bare what latour has been saying all along  that a complacent faith in the ability of facts to speak for themselves was what rendered them vulnerable to trumpian renunciation in the first place latours talk about how facts derive their authority from trust might sound squishy and abstract  but he considers himself a realist  he says that climate change renders the old dichotomy of the global versus the local completely futile  trump and the obscurantist elites who enable him are nurturing an out of this world fantasy by unleashing an aggressive despoliation of the earth that ultimately rejects the world they claim to inhabit  at the same time  trump pacifies his base with panicky nationalism and border walls  delineating a rump territory that is no more plausible  no more livable than the globalized world they rail against it is quite useless to become outraged on the pretext that trump voters dont believe in facts  latour writes  rather than get tangled in shouting matches over fake news  latour calls for an entirely new way of understanding the world  he says he wrote down to earth with a deliberate bluntness  he vests a surprising hope in europe  whose colonial past  or crimes  as he puts it  he depicts as inextricable from the migrations it tries to keep out  europe has invaded all peoples  all peoples are coming to europe in their turn  he writes  give and take  there is no way out of this latour also describes migration as the human embodiment of our new climatic regime  under the old way of thinking  exploited peoples and places were ignored  silenced and stripped of agency  now migrants and the earth itself are both setting out to recover what belongs to them no doubt some readers will find this to be too much  too philosophical and too french  but maybe it takes a brilliantly mind bending book like latours to show that so much reality cant be denied .
 what you need to know to start the day  get new york today in your inbox  new york city will spend at least  100 million to ensure that undocumented immigrants and others who cannot qualify for insurance can receive medical treatment  mayor bill de blasio announced on tuesday  seeking to insert a city policy into two contentious national debates the mayor has styled himself  in his 2017 re election campaign and during his second term  as a progressive leader on issues like education and health care  and as a bulwark against the policies of president trump  particularly on immigration in making the announcement  first on national television  mr  de blasio appeared to be trying to heighten that contrast and thrust his efforts on behalf of undocumented new yorkers into the national debate over immigration  hours before mr  trump was to go on television tuesday night to make his case for a border wall everyone is guaranteed the right to health care  everyone  mr  de blasio said during a news conference at lincoln hospital in the bronx  we are saying the word guarantee because we can make it happen new york city already provides health care to the uninsured and the undocumented through its hospital system  a roughly  8 billion behemoth whose history of service to the poor  regardless of an ability to pay  can be traced to the founding of bellevue hospital in the 18th century  a person without medical insurance has long been able to go to a city emergency room and get care  free of charge  or to seek a primary care physician but the financially challenged system did not work well to connect patients to doctors  mr  de blasio said  he promised a streamlined approach  complete with a hotline and dedicated membership card  and one that would be focused on the primary care doctor  rather than the emergency room we were only covering them in the sense that they could go to the emergency room  the mayor said  it was not a way to live the announcement came as proponents of universal health care coverage have increasingly looked to local governments  rather than congress  to make meaningful progress in the short term  also on tuesday  gov  jay inslee of washington said he would seek to create a public option in the state a day before  gov  gavin newsom of california  on his first day in office  announced his plan to move toward a single payer system for that state  as mayor of san francisco  mr  newsom oversaw the creation of a health care system in that city in 2007 the top health official who created the san francisco program  mitchell h  katz  is now the head of new york citys hospital system and will oversee the citys effort  branded as nyc care  its a much bigger and more compassionate vision  said mr  katz  comparing new yorks proposed program to the much smaller one in san francisco the mayor was quick to say that the plan would not be a substitute for any universal health care at the state level or a national single payer plan  but  aides said  it was something the city could do immediately and on its own  without approval from the state legislature  which is weighing some form of universal health insurance for new york state indeed  the mayors proposal is a mix of insurance and direct spending  and mr  de blasio said it would take about two years to get it fully running  the city already has a kind of public option for health insurance for low income new yorkers  through an insurance plan run by city hospitals known as metroplus the new proposal would improve that coverage  which already insures some 516 000 people  and aim to reach more of those who are eligible  such as the young and uninsured  and others who qualify but have not applied it would also provide additional direct city spending  at least  100 million per year when fully implemented  officials said  for the citys hospital system to support care for those without insurance  the city estimates the uninsured population to be about 600 000 people  including as many as 300 000 undocumented residents  a major component of that effort would be improving customer service  including the phone line  to help those with questions about their care part of the goal of nyc care  aides to the mayor said  was to direct people to medical care earlier  before they seek more expensive services in an emergency room  while providing them with better health care the effort is also aimed at getting some of the so called young and invincible uninsured population into the health care system  either through the citys insurance plan or through its hospital system it appears that the mayor is ramping up outreach so that more people can avail themselves of services  regardless of ability to pay  that have been made available to them by health and hospitals for decades  said andrew rein  the president of the nonpartisan citizens budget commission  the details are critical  he added  we still need to learn more the  100 million would go to both establishing the customer service component and hiring additional doctors and nurses  but officials could not provide a breakdown of how much would be spent on each  indeed  details of how those seeking care could do so under the new plan were not immediately clear  nor was an exact start date mr  katz said that the rollout would begin in the bronx and that the city would start enrolling people in the nyc care program this summer  the borough was chosen because the health care needs were greatest  he said such endeavors can be difficult for the city to implement quickly  mr  de blasio oversaw the creation of a municipal identification card for undocumented immigrants in his first term  but last week  he said that an ambitious goal of providing metrocards to about 800 000 residents whose incomes are below the federal poverty line would fall far short of that goal initially  starting this month with cards for only about 30 000 people  or about 4 percent of the total mr  de blasio said that the nyc care system will also employ what amounted to a membership card in the city program  they will have a card that will empower them to go to that doctor whenever they need  he said the citys hospital system has been under severe financial strain and running deficits for years  the current financial plan for city hospitals anticipates budget shortfalls of more than  156 million in 2018  increasing to  1 8 billion in 2022  according to the citys independent budget office melanie hartzog  the citys budget director  took issue with those figures during the news conference  she said that the hospital system  which has received significant infusions of city money during the de blasio administration  was now in a very cash strong position  she said more details would be provided during a forthcoming budget briefing advocates for immigrants and health care analysts were encouraged by the plan  even if many were still looking to albany  where debate over health care is likely to consume the coming months we hope it is a step toward making larger changes at the state level  said rebecca telzak  director of health programs at make the road new york  an immigrant advocacy group supportive of the mayors plan  ending here is not enough .
welcome to the climate fwd  newsletter  the new york times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change  sign up here to get it in your inbox hi  everybody  if you are in the areas of the united states affected by the polar vortex  and do click that link for a dazzling visual explanation of the phenomenon   we hope youre bundling up  layers  people some of the temperatures were seeing in the midwest are the frostiest in decades  a reminder of colder times  but lets all please put one much discussed line to rest  yes  its colder in chicago or des moines than in some parts of antarctica  but its summer in the southern hemisphere  so its not that shocking   yes  the new york times used this factoid  too  if you are chilling out in the united states  you might be asking what this deep freeze could have to do with climate change   or you might want to know how to respond to an argumentative friend or relative   were here for you  kendra pierre louis has the answer in a story that explains that  while climate can affect weather extremes  climate is not weather as kendra put it  a billionaire who has forgotten his wallet one day is not poor  any more than a poor person who lands a windfall of several hundred dollars is suddenly rich  what matters is what happens over the long term not only that  but theres also evidence to suggest that climate change plays a role in the plunging of the polar vortex australia  by the way  has been dangerously hot  in an article on the front page of wednesdays print edition  our colleague somini sengupta took the global view  telling us to get used to weather in the age of extremes we also looked at a new study suggesting that plants under the stress of climate change might absorb less carbon dioxide  thats bad news  well need all the help from plants that we can get  we have this image of the planet getting very  very green as we move into the future  an author of the study told kendra  but it may be the opposite and while china has said it will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions  somini tells us about a new study showing that the country  the planets coal juggernaut  is not meeting its own regulations to reduce methane emissions from its many coal plants back in the united states  the government shutdown is over  but president trump insists that the fight for a border wall is not  if he does find a way to extend the physical barrier farther across the southern border  experts warn  the result could be disastrous for wildlife now  heres something to think about if youre staying home  bundling up and watching tv today noah horowitz never thought much about his cable boxes  if you have service and its working  you dont think about the box top  he said  but he noticed that the boxes generated heat constantly and that the lights stayed on even when he turned the boxes off  he wondered how much power that was drawing mr  horowitz is a senior scientist at the natural resources defense council  an environmental advocacy group  who specializes in energy efficiency  so  he looked into these set top boxes and found out that theyre enormous power drains that was in 2011  at the time  a single dvr unit chewed through as much as 275 kilowatt hours per year  more than half as much as some energy star refrigerators  and many homes had more than one box  in total  the defense council estimated that set top boxes in the united states were consuming about  3 billion worth of electricity each year those numbers drew attention in the news media  and tv providers promised to make their equipment more efficient  according to mr  horowitz  there has been some improvement  power consumption on newer units is about two thirds of what it used to be one of the most significant recent changes benefits homes with multiple tvs  in the past  each tv might have had its own dvr  the most power consuming set top box   today  though  you can use just one dvr with side units that require much less power the best thing people can do is  if theyve got multiple dvrs  trade them in for the new upgraded system  mr  horowitz said  youll cut the energy use from the equipment by about a half  he also suggested unplugging units that you dont use very often still  as of 2017  set top boxes in the united states were using about seven large power plants worth of electricity each year  mr  horowitz said hed like to see more app based services instead of boxes  and there has already been some movement in that direction  sling and youtube tv  for example  provide television over the internet  these apps are delivered either directly through a smart tv or via devices like apple tv  roku and amazon fire  which use under 25 kw h per year  thats an eighth of what a modern dvr box uses this is where the technology is going  and it will be good for the environment  mr  horowitz said the  10yearchallenge has shown us that some celebrities have barely aged a day over the past decade  unfortunately  one cant say the same for coral reefs  forests or arctic ice scientists  environmental activists and others have taken advantage of the trend on social media to create moments of reflection about the planet  the only 10 year challenge we should care about is perhaps the most common climate related refrain right now many posts  like the one below from the german soccer star mesut zil  have included side by side photographs of an unidentified iceberg  supposedly taken a decade apart  though the origin of those photos isnt clear  its true that near record sea ice minimums have now occurred every year for the past 12 years  according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administrations most recent arctic report card what will the arctic look like in 10 more years  leonardo dicaprio wrote on instagram alongside photos of melting ice caps from 100 years ago and today  manish bapna  executive vice president of the world resources institute  a think tank in washington  tweeted side by side global temperature maps from the 19th and 21st centuries  calling climate change the biggest  10yearchallenge and the kenya office of the environmental

deforestation and soil erosion edward maibach  director of the center for climate change communication at george mason university  said social media discussions were probably not as conducive as in person conversations to shaping opinions about the warming of the planet  but  he wrote in an email  the notion of a  10yearchallenge is a particularly interesting conversation to start  because it

global warming  mr  newsom  during the campaign  tried to at once tie himself to the popular governor  and present himself as the face of change  this will be a day for him to show how much this is

 want to get this briefing by email  heres the sign up  good morning  britains parliament is set to hash out brexit  the u s  and the taliban agree in principle to a peace framework  and france is debating the conduct of its police officers  heres the latest  the british parliament is expected to vote today on a number of amendments to prime minister theresa mays plan that could end up shaping how the country departs from the e u how it works  various lawmakers  including those in opposition parties  have proposed more than a dozen changes to the wording of mrs  mays exit plan  only the speaker of the house of commons  john bercow  can decide which will be voted on  the voting is for the most part not binding  but mrs  may will be under political pressure to adopt popular measures what are the amendments  there is a broad range  the most hyped could delay britains departure from the bloc for a few months or even until the end of the year if there is no deal  that would blunt

jobs officials from both parties agreed in principle to the outlines of a preliminary peace deal  the chief u s  negotiator  zalmay khalilzad  told our reporter in kabul  the agreement is the biggest step yet toward ending the 17 year afghan conflict terms  u s  negotiators said the deal would include a taliban guarantee that afghan territory would not be used for terrorist activity  the withdrawal of american troops would be contingent on larger concessions from the taliban  including a cease fire and direct talks with the afghan government  concessions the insurgent group has rejected in the past behind the scenes  president trump is eager to leave afghanistan  but defense department officials  convinced he does not grasp the complexities of the war  are warning that a full withdrawal could lead to a terrorist attack on the u s  within two years  and afghan officials are increasingly suspicious that mr  trump will make a deal with the taliban behind their backs

washington  standing in the rose garden on friday morning  president trump heaped praise on rush limbaugh  the right wing radio show host  who earlier in the week gave his blessing to a bipartisan spending bill that did not include the money mr  trump had demanded for a wall this guy is unbelievable  mr  trump said  try speaking for three hours without taking calls during mr  trumps 50 minutes of discursive remarks  which were ostensibly to announce a national emergency to build a wall along the southern border  the president appeared to be taking that challenge himself forced to confront arguably the biggest surrender of his presidency  mr  trump did what he often does after a loss  respond with distraction  digression and entertainment  through a fog of words there was no teleprompter  he hardly looked at his notes  there was just mr  trump  dressed in a dark overcoat and bright blue tie  free associating in tweetable sound bites  and setting off the furious clicks of cameras every time he gesticulated with his arms the presidents public schedule said nothing about an attempt to get around congresss rejection of his plan for a border wall  a white house handout was titled  president donald j  trumps border security victory  his rose garden event was billed as remarks on the national security and humanitarian crisis on our southern border  and he was about 40 minutes late when he finally emerged from the oval office  mr  trump spent another 10 minutes riffing about his administrations successes before getting to the point of the gathering  which included his new attorney general  william p  barr  and the secretary of homeland security  kirstjen nielsen  sitting shoulder to shoulder with a group of angel moms hugging photographs of their slain relatives first  mr  trump praised his trade negotiations with china  its going extremely well  he said  but then he added  who knows what that means  because it only matters if we get it done  he moved on to north korea  expressing his excitement about a second summit meeting with kim jong un  scheduled for this month in vietnam  we think that north korea and chairman kim have a tremendous potential as an economic force and economic power  mr  trump said after his burying the news preamble  mr  trump finally got to the point so  im going to be signing a national emergency  mr  trump said  almost as an afterthought  anticipating blowback to a measure that he was strongly warned against by republican lawmakers and members of his own administration  mr  trump immediately explained that his predecessors had made national emergency declarations for far less important things in some cases employing a singsong voice that seemed meant to play down the significance of the separation of powers he will be testing  mr  trump walked through what he anticipated would be the legal ramifications of his order they will sue us in the ninth circuit even though it shouldnt be there  he said  and we will possibly get a bad ruling  and then we will get another bad ruling  and then we will end up in the supreme court  and hopefully we will get a fair shake and win in the supreme court just like the ban the rose garden has become mr  trumps chosen backdrop for pitching defeats as victories  after the house voted to repeal most of the affordable care act in may 2017  mr  trump celebrated in the rose garden  with about 100 republican lawmakers  taking a victory lap  two months later  the measure failed in the senate then in january  mr  trump stepped into the rose garden after meeting with republican and democratic leadership  declaring that he was willing to let a partial government shutdown last months  or even years  if that was what it took to obtain his requested  5 7 billion for a wall  and a few weeks later  he was back in the same spot  announcing that he was reopening the government for three weeks after caving to the democrats on his previously nonnegotiable demand for wall money fridays rose garden performance followed a similar script  defense by distraction the bill mr  trump signed gave him just  1 375 billion for fencing and border security  but he claimed victory over democrats because of other funds in the measure  they didnt even fight us on most of the stuff  he said  i dont know what to do with all the money they are giving us  its crazy  but mr  trump did acknowledge that on the wall  they skimped he took not at all veiled shots at paul d  ryan  the former house speaker  for failing to pass a bill when republicans still controlled the house  people that should have stepped up did not step up  he said  when asked by a reporter if he was specifically referring to mr  ryan  the president responded  lets not talk about it  what difference does it make mr  trump waffled on whether he knew ann coulter  the conservative commentator  who has been harshly critical of what she regards as his lack of commitment to building the wall  or whether he liked her i hardly know her  he said  when asked if a cadre of right wing personalities was influencing him on policy  she is probably really nice  i just dont have the time to speak to her mr  trump did say he had spoken to her  just not this year  he then added that ms  coulter  whom he unfollowed on twitter in december  after months of criticism  is off the reservation anybody that knows her understands that  he continued  i havent spoken to her  i dont follow her mr  trumps own advisers have admitted that the white house lost the public relations war surrounding the 35 day partial government shutdown  but he insisted that he had  in fact  won the messaging battle  he cited a 52 percent approval rating in a recent rasmussen poll as an example that people get what we are doing  even though it was an outlier from other polls  in which he averages 40 8 percent  according to the realclearpolitics website they really get it and im honored by it  he added mr  trump said president barack obama told me he was so close to starting a big war with north korea  and he said that shinzo abe  the prime minister of japan  had nominated him for a nobel prize  although he admitted  ill probably never get it but thats o k he called on his favorite fake news nemesis  jim acosta  cnns white house correspondent  who pressed the president on his claim that there is a security crisis at the southern border  despite the fact that illegal border crossings have fallen in recent years  and asked him to respond to critics who said he had concocted an emergency in response  mr  trump pointed to the angel moms  as conservatives call the mothers of children who were killed by undocumented immigrants  in the front row i ask the angel moms  what do you think  do you think im creating something  ask these incredible women who lost their daughters and their sons  mr  trump said throughout  mr  trump focused on grisly  specific stories while ignoring questions about why there needed to be a national emergency now  as opposed to two years ago  that young wiseguy drove over and killed eight people  he said of a terrorist attack in manhattan in october 2017  he had many people brought in because he was in the united states  its called chain migration all in all  it was a typical trumpian performance that had too many tangents to focus on any one thing he said no notes and no net  its pure president trump  said one senior administration official describing the spectacle mr  trump ended the news conference with a personal send off to mr  barr  who was sworn in on thursday  i want to wish our new attorney general great luck and speed  mr  trump said  enjoy your life .
some cried with relief  their 35 day nightmare of missing bill payments  working without paychecks  asking strangers for money and visiting food pantries was finally ending but many of the federal workers who have been furloughed or working for free since december were leery of the three week deal reached on friday to reopen the government  new worries gnawed  how long before they got paid  would federal contractors see even a dime of back pay and most of all  after the longest shutdown in american history  would they and 800 000 other federal workers be back in the same mess in three weeks if president trump and democrats do not reach an accord on whether to fund his proposed border wall this was all for nothing  basically  said angela kelley  51  a furloughed worker for the bureau of land management in milwaukee who picked up shifts as an uber driver to earn money to buy gas and groceries as the shutdown dragged on on friday  mr  trump praised federal workers as fantastic people and incredible patriots and acknowledged the toll they had suffered  but several federal employees said they still felt angry after being treated like pawns  they said  in a five week long washington standoff  they said the shutdown had left deep scars on their families and finances and undermined their faith in elected leaders  and in the careers they had chosen the new york times talked with more than a dozen federal workers and contractors  from wildland firefighters to coast guard families to museum security guards  about how they had survived the shutdown  and the uncertainty they now face john hare  42  is one of thousands of coast guard employees and retirees worried that they may find themselves in the same precarious position a few weeks from now because the coast guard is the only branch of the military that is part of the department of homeland security  it was affected by the shutdown  about 55 000 active duty  reserve and civilian employees had already missed either one or two paychecks  while another 50 000 military retirees would have gone without a pension payment for the first time on feb  1 after 22 years of service  mr  hare was forced to retire from the coast guard last august after learning he had a rare form of cancer that spread from his appendix  his wife had to stop working to care for him  and missing mr  hares pension check of  2 698 would have put a significant dent into the family budget the faith in our leadership to be able to negotiate with each other has been broken  mr  hare  of rolesville  n c   said on friday  and they chose to break faith with the u s  military i certainly question the hostage taking of government employees paychecks  he said  and nobody that was in power who had the power to stop this  none of them were injured by the shutdown it is less a sense of relief because nothing has been solved yvette hicks  40  a security guard at the smithsonian museums  said she woke up on friday and prayed  once again  for the shutdown to end  as a single mother  she said the shutdown had taken a toll on her familys budget and her own mental health when she learned on friday she might be returning to work  ms  hicks said she had been crying  her 14 year old daughter and 8 year old son were due home from school soon  and she was trying to put up a brave face for them  she said her son  kaden  had nevertheless told his teachers that his mother was now sad all the time ms  hicks said her family had once been homeless  and that she believed her job at the smithsonian was a path to stability  she even saved up enough to book a spring break vacation for her children to an indoor water park in virginia  but as the bills piled up and her paychecks stopped  she said she canceled the trip and lost the  350 deposit she had paid for a room its just a hurting thing  she said  this has damaged my family anthony powers  35  had begun thinking about leaving his 15 year career as part of an elite team of wildland firefighters with the united states forest service in southern california  he was that frustrated with his nations leaders our country is being run by children  he said on friday  he was relieved but not elated  noting that everything could shut down again soon mr  powers and his colleagues typically spend this time of year clearing away brush to help lessen fire danger in the coming year  none of that has been happening for the last month or so  and his team needs more than three weeks to get the job done  he also has a national conference set for the end of february  and the short term opening leaves him in limbo  is it going to happen  should he plan for it  not plan for it theres been so much planning for this to go into the long term  he said  now its like  where do you reset nic trujillo  34  a single father and collections representative for the internal revenue service in ogden  utah  said the shutdown had done financial and emotional damage he had not paid rent in january because he needed to pay other expenses  on friday  he and his 6 year old son were just one week away from being evicted and having to move in with extended family staying at home had also left him depressed  before he was ordered to return to work without pay on jan  18  his natural night owl tendencies had taken over  he would stay up late  get up to get his son off to school  then sleep for much of the day i havent really done anything  i havent really gone anywhere  he said  explaining that he didnt want to waste gas  its just been a very depressive time he said he blamed both the president and congress for the shutdown  saying that none of them knew what it was like to live paycheck to paycheck they are so out of touch with the american people that its unacceptable kim howell  34  whose husband is in the coast guard in boston and has been working 12 hour night shifts throughout the shutdown  said she didnt feel much relief on friday  she said she didnt expect that her husband would get any back pay for a week or two  and then there was the possibility that the government would shut down again in three weeks ms  howell said her family had been fortunate because she works for a tech startup  but the loss of her husbands income strained them  they had to put off rent payments  utility bills  and cellphone  cable and internet bills she had visited a food pantry that had been set up in boston for coast guard families  she worried about the impact on her three children  who are 9  13 and 14  her oldest child told her he felt helpless and anxious watching his parents try to navigate the crisis  she did not blame any particular party  but said she felt betrayed  and she worried the dysfunction was far from over im staying in shutdown mode  she said  thats the only responsible thing to do right now .
ciudad hidalgo  mexico  mexicos new president has moved decisively to encourage migrants fleeing poverty and violence in central america to stay and work in mexico  making it easier for them to get visas and work permits and promoting investments and ambitious public works projects to create jobs president andrs manuel lpez obradors policies are already proving to be a magnet for migrants  who are finding it harder to enter the united states given president trumps antipathy toward immigration  a migrant caravan heading to mexico from central america  the largest ever  has already swollen to over 12 000 people  with many saying they intend to remain in mexico  at least for the time being  the new mexican presidents generosity toward immigrants  officials say  dovetails with his broader commitment to protect human rights  reduce inequality and prioritize the poor mr  lpez obradors pro immigrant stance also serves as a dramatic counterpoint to the white house  without directly challenging mr  trump  but these policies could ultimately put pressure on the mexico united states border  as most in the caravan eventually hope to cross into the united states many in the caravan said they decided to migrate after a decision by the mexican government to drastically speed up the process for securing a yearlong humanitarian visa that allows migrants to legally travel and work in mexico the humanitarian visa that theyre giving now is the reason we are here  said carlos del valle  a guatemalan teacher who was standing in line with his family this week to apply for the visa on the bridge connecting guatemala with mexico later  if possible  we can get to the united states  he said under the streamlined process  which began last week  the government is seeking to issue the humanitarian visa in an average of five days rather than a month  migration officials said the policy would be permanent the initiative  officials say  is part of the presidents strategy to make mexicos immigration policy more humane  after years of stepped up deportations under pressure from the united states  but it could also draw even more migrants to trek north to the border with the united states  inflaming tensions with a trump administration determined to build a border wall and lower immigration numbers on thursday  the trump administration said it would institute a new policy to return most asylum seekers to mexico if they had arrived at the southwest border by land  under the policy  which is intended to discourage central americans from migrating to the united states and to ease pressure on the asylum system  the petitioners would be required to remain in mexico while they await the outcome of their cases the current migrant caravan left san pedro sula in honduras on jan  14 and  in the following days  began arriving at the guatemala mexico border  mexican officials encouraged the migrants to apply for the humanitarian visa  and since then over 12 000 people  mostly hondurans  have done so in this border town in southern mexico but while some in the caravan say they intend to remain in mexico and avail themselves of government sponsored jobs programs  many plan to use the visas as safe passage permits to ease their journey to mexicos northern border  where they hope to figure out a way to cross into the united states mr  trump has excoriated the governments of central america and mexico for  he says  not doing enough to stop the caravans  he has portrayed the migrants as invaders threatening americans security and jobs mr  trumps demand that congress approve funding for a wall across the border resulted in a weekslong stalemate with democrats and a partial shutdown of the american government that ended  at least for now  on friday  to bolster his case  he has recently taken to twitter to warn about the current caravan mexico is doing nothing to stop the caravan which is now fully formed and heading to the united states  he wrote on saturday in an earlier tweet  he said  another big caravan heading our way  very hard to stop without a wall the mexican government initially said it was speeding up the application process for humanitarian visas as an exception for the current migrant caravan only  but on thursday  a spokeswoman with mexicos national migration agency said the expedited process would be permanent this is like a light in the road for migrants because they know they can enter mexico without difficulty  said karen valladares  director of the national forum for migration in honduras  an advocacy group  now were seeing a different mexico  a mexico that opens its borders  a mexico that is providing opportunities  a mexico that is giving  one way or another  hope the governments motives  however  are not just humanitarian  the mexican government has said it has a labor shortage and is trying to fill tens of thousands of low skilled jobs around the country most migrants in the current caravan have chosen to apply for the humanitarian visa  but on jan  18  a group of about 1 500 crossed at the official border checkpoint here in ciudad hidalgo  walking right by mexican border officials who did not move to stop them  hundreds of members of that group have since continued to travel north through mexico  unimpeded by mexican authorities except for that incident  the process has been orderly  in sharp contrast to an incident in october when members of another large migrant caravan clashed with mexican police officers at the same crossing  many members of that caravan  and several smaller ones that followed in quick succession  eventually made it to the northern mexican state of baja california  putting extraordinary strain on local government and the resources of civil society an increasing number of participants in the current caravan  it seems  have been drawn to the idea of staying in mexico what i want is to cross in order to work  no more than that  said yanina vargas  27  a honduran migrant who was standing in a line of more than one thousand people on the border bridge that connects guatemala with mexico to address the root causes of migration  mr  lpez obrador has vowed to promote job creation in southern mexico and central america  and has been pushing a  30 billion regional development plan  he has also ordered tax cuts in dozens of municipalities along the northern border to spur economic development and job creation  his administration joined with business sector and labor leaders in december to raise the minimum wage by about 16 percent  to boost the fortunes of the nations working class but despite these enticements  and mr  trumps unwelcoming posture toward migrants  many participants in the current caravan were still intent on making it to the united states franklin caballero  30  from honduras  said he lived in the united states as an undocumented immigrant for six years but was deported for driving without a license  traveling with the caravan  he hoped to make it back even though i have to wait five days for the pass to get into mexico  later i will see how to get to the united states  he said  standing in line to apply for the humanitarian visa  his tentative plan was to pay a smuggler in northern mexico to sneak him across the border into the united states still others were keeping their options open  prepared to live and work in mexico until they saw an opportunity to cross into the united states our aim is to find work  said anabella lpez  50  a guatemalan migrant  who was traveling with seven relatives covering three generations  the united states is difficult now ms  lpez said that she had followed the news about the caravans that arrived in northern mexico in the fall and knew they had suffered a lot but she also wondered how mexico was going to support so many new arrivals from central america what is this country going to do with so many people  she asked .
only a handful of democrats in congress  and just one democrat adjacent presidential contender  identify as socialist  but they appear to be the chief targets of president trump as he faces a confident democratic opposition in the house of representatives  we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country  he said in his state of the union address two weeks ago  declaring that america will never be a socialist country the white house actually presaged this strategy last october  just before the midterm elections  in a report from its council of economic advisers  they cite calls for single payer health care and higher tax rates as evidence that socialism is making a comeback in american political discourse  with  they argue  dire consequences for the american economy  next came the presidents address to congress  and this week at a rally in el paso  tex   trump went after the radical left  blasting a caricature of progressive climate policies  i really dont like their policy of taking away your car  of taking away your airplane flights  of lets hop a train to california  he said  bizarrely adding that under the green new deal resolution introduced by liberal democrats  youre not allowed to own cows anymore the clear expectation is that many or most americans will recoil at any hint of socialism  either on principle or because of its association with venezuela  which the administration has tried to elevate as a major adversary  that might have been true in trumps cultural and political touchstone  the 1980s  when ronald reagans hard line anti communism defined american foreign and domestic policy  but in 2019  the cold war is long over  the soviet union is a memory  and there is no comparable global ideological struggle over economic systems that might give weight to trumps rhetoric  theres not much fear to monger  instead  the presidents decision to make socialism his opponent might have the opposite effect  potentially bolstering the movement and its ideals because the cold war is well in the rearview mirror of history  the united states also has a growing cohort of voters with no experience of its political environment  thirty five percent of voters in the 2018 elections were born in november 1973 or later  according to exit polls from cnn  the oldest in that group would have been teenagers during the fall of the berlin wall  the youngest were born nearly 10 years afterward  making the ground even less fertile for the socialist charge is the fact of the 2008 recession  which produced worsening views of capitalism  especially among young americans  who showed growing receptivity to views such as basic health insurance is a right for all people and basic necessities  such as food and shelter  are a right that the government should provide to those unable to afford them  in truth  these ideas fit well into the modern history of capitalist governance  but the politics of the past 10 years have given them a left wing tinge specifically  in their vehement opposition to the obama administration  conservatives narrowed socialism down to virtually any attempt to intervene in the economy on behalf of the broad public  the effort to save the american car industry  socialist  regulated markets to purchase health insurance  socialist  market based measures for reducing carbon emissions  also socialist this aggressive labeling coincided with a rise in favorable attitudes toward socialism among democrats  in 2010  according to gallup  53 percent said they had a positive view of socialism  in 2016  it was 58 percent  some of this is the effect of bernie sanderss presidential campaign  which brought socialism back into mainstream political conversation  but conservative demonization of liberal democratic policies as socialist played a major part as well its worth comparing what conservatives call socialism to actual models for it  like this one proffered by the czech thinker radoslav selucky and quoted by the american social critic irving howe in his 1985 book socialism and america no one in or around the democratic party has proposed the radical changes that might lead to such a state  no one has called for nationalization of major industries or creation of what the american democratic socialist michael harrington called social property  worker owned firms and cooperatives governed by the direct participation of the actual producers what we actually have are ideas like the co determination plan proposed by senator elizabeth warren  which would give workers a significant say in corporate governance  a major change from the status quo of shareholder driven capitalism but a far cry from abolishing capitalist ownership itself  similarly  the medicare for all act introduced by bernie sanders would move every american onto a new government plan but would also permit supplemental private insurance and retain the present system of privately owned hospitals and other medical providers even the green new deal falls within the tradition established by its namesake  which itself was attacked as a harbinger of socialism  it provides new economic guarantees to americans while substantially altering  but not fundamentally rearranging  power relationships within the economy  reform  not revolution having said that  profound changes in american society since the 1930s may give the green new deal less transformative potential than its predecessor  the social base of the original new deal was a large and powerful labor movement with the capacity to  as the historian ira katznelson wrote in a 1989 essay  disrupt capitalism at the point of production and potentially lead a social democratic breakthrough in american politics  the egalitarian vistas of the green new deal may ultimately be compromised by the absence of such a movement  although its ambition could galvanize the constituencies that might make such a movement possible but were getting ahead of ourselves  at this moment  the proposed policies of the democratic party  from modest initiatives to incentivize savings to expansive programs for guaranteed employment  arent socialism  even if they were  americans are less afraid of the label than one might think  37 percent say they have a positive image of socialism  a two point increase from 2016  given the continued popularity of bernie sanders and the rise of politicians like representative alexandria ocasio cortez  these numbers have room to grow  and those who hope to see them grow almost certainly got an assist from trump when he elevated the term in his state of the union address the mechanism is simple  trump is unpopular and drives americans away from his positions  according to a gallup survey last summer  after almost a year and a half of anti immigration rhetoric from the president  75 percent of americans said immigration was a good thing and 29 percent said immigration levels should decrease  most wanted either stasis or an increase in the number of immigrants  just this january  in a poll taken during the partial government shutdown  58 percent of americans said they opposed substantial expansion of a border wall between the united states and mexico  a direct rebuke to the president if anything can put socialism in a more positive light  it is trump raging against it  which means conservatives and republicans may want to think a little harder before they embrace a campaign strategy that relies on him for messaging  if socialism is like every other idea trump has attacked and disdained  then the republican party should prepare for even more americans embracing the term  and the ideas that come with it .

pine ridge  s d   ella red cloud yellow horse  marooned for days by a blizzard and then a flood  needed to get out  supplies at her house were running low  she had come down with pneumonia  she had a chemotherapy appointment to keep but her long driveway was blocked by mountains of mud  impassable even for an ambulance or a tractor so ms  red cloud yellow horse  59  set off toward the road on foot  she fell repeatedly  almost got swept away in the current of a creek  and became stuck in the mud  finally  more than an hour later  she made it the half mile to the highway where she was picked up i couldnt breathe  she said  but i knew i needed to get to the hospital such stories are startlingly common these days on the pine ridge indian reservation in south dakota  a stunning stretch of land larger than delaware  as an overwhelming bout of snow and flooding has set off a humanitarian disaster that seems unlikely to abate soon with some residents approaching two weeks stranded in their homes  and with emergency rations able to reach parts of the back country only by horse  boat and helicopter  pine ridge remains in a state of shock and triage officials with the oglala sioux tribe  which administers the reservation  say they lack the training  manpower and equipment needed to deal with such a large scale crisis  and theres a pervasive sense on pine ridge  a place of long strained relations with the state and federal governments  that help has been woefully slow to arrive  and that few people beyond the reservation know or care much about its plight this is a state of emergency right now  said henry red cloud  whose familys losses in the flooding include five homes  a forklift  a truck  a van and the building where his solar energy business was based mr  red cloud now rides a flat bottomed boat each night to the one home on his familys property that is not a total loss  what we need to be doing is building sandbag walls  not a southern border wall  he said pine ridge was far from alone in being hit with damaging quantities of snow and water this month  huge portions of the midwest were swallowed by rivers in the last 10 days  with devastating consequences for farms  roads and small riverfront towns  so far  at least three people are confirmed to have died  and the affected states have estimated that they have suffered more than a billion dollars in damage and economic harm but while conversations about recovery were already underway in the hardest hit portions of nebraska and iowa  where most roads have reopened and many rivers have started to recede  pine ridge  with a population of about 20 000  remained in a state of hour to hour chaos  some of the tribes scarce heavy equipment was lost in the mud  jail inmates were enlisted to fill sandbags  new parents worried as they ran low on infant formula unlike in nebraska  where the national guard rescued 111 people  including some by helicopter and boat  outside help for pine ridge was conspicuously scarce at first  south dakotas governor  kristi noem  has been seen by many pine ridge officials and residents as slow to respond  but ms  noem  who visited the reservation on saturday  said that the tribe had only made formal requests for help in recent days  which she quickly approved  since then  ms  noem said  the state had sent atvs  a boat rescue team and a small group of national guard soldiers to distribute drinking water when we became aware is when we responded  ms  noem said in an interview after her visit the reservation  in the southwestern part of the state  is among the most scenic places in the great plains states  pine crested buttes punctuate the skyline  open prairie stretches for miles  and creeks wind through pastures and yards  but the vast distances  scattered population and relatively untamed terrain can make it difficult to reach people in blizzards or floods the tribal led relief effort on pine ridge has been mired in challenges  though employees pulled marathon shifts and slept in their work vehicles  there were simply not enough people or equipment to reach everyone needing help  residents said  julian bear runner  the oglala sioux tribes newly elected president  said many had voiced frustration with the tribal governments response people are getting angry  mr  bear runner said  and thats understandable  but he added  were doing the best we can with what little we have he said resources had been stretched so thin that he had slept on his office floor most nights since the storm  and had driven his own pickup truck to respond to calls for help because there were too few tribal workers if we would have had state of the art equipment  if we would have had adequate manpower  we could have gotten a lot done  said mr  bear runner  who said the state assistance  though late to arrive  was greatly appreciated tribal officials said the federal bureau of indian affairs had also provided equipment and manpower to help the crisis on pine ridge is a collision of nature  poverty and inadequate infrastructure  no sooner were pine ridges highways mostly cleared of snow than temperatures shot up  and the rush of newly melted water overflowed from creeks and rivers  the flooding  the worst in at least a generation  several residents said  turned the rugged dirt roads that many people live along into a liquefied mud soup adding to the urgency  late last week about 8 000 residents lost drinking water its gotten worse  mr  bear runner  the tribal president  said on friday pine ridge is a place accustomed to struggle  and its people have had well publicized battles with alcoholism and teen suicide  half the reservations residents live in poverty  according to the census bureau  and the unemployment rate is 20 percent  compared with about 3 percent for south dakota as a whole  many people on pine ridge live in aging houses a mile or more from a highway  and some depend on wood burning stoves to keep warm the lack of resources  the lack of water  lack of transportation and the lack of facilities  this really compounds all of the issues  said valentina merdanian  a tribal council member who on friday was fielding calls from stranded constituents and trying to organize rescue crews in the few quiet moments  some people expressed worry that the treacherous conditions could become a new normal  with climate change  its getting worse and worse  said robert pille  who had to leave his home because of the floods  this is going to be a regular thing mr  bear runner said there had been no time to tally up how many buildings were destroyed  how many rescues had been made or how many people remained unreached we didnt have the proper training for the e m s   we didnt know what to do  said garfield steele  the president of the reservations wounded knee district  the site of the 1890 massacre of native americans by united states soldiers and the 1973 siege by members of the american indian movement governor noem  who took office in january  has a strained relationship with her states native american nations  some of which requested that their tribal flags not be displayed at the state capitol after she introduced and lawmakers passed a set of bills this month that would restrict protests despite those tensions  several people on the reservation said they would have liked to see a more robust national guard and state government presence during the storm response  as members of the tribe volunteered to cook meals and unload food delivery trucks on friday  and as people checked on older neighbors who lived far from the highway  some of the biggest needs remained unmet we just need the technical skills  said mary tobacco  who was helping lead recovery efforts  but who became stranded herself on friday as rising water made it impossible to leave her home on a butte   the water was moving too fast  she said  to make it out in her kayak  tribal officials were still working to determine whether as many as four more deaths in the past two weeks could be attributed to the storm  including some involving patients who needed medical help and could not be reached by ambulance  the tribes police chief  robert ecoffey  said on friday that it was not known whether those people would have survived if an ambulance had reached them in the meantime  some on pine ridge were hunkering down for what could be weeks more with little or no access to the outside world bernadine rowland  stranded since march 12  said saturday that she and her grandchildren had remained in good spirits and had passed the days by watching netflix and youtube videos  but her pantry had started to get bare  only two bags of beans left  plus some oatmeal and rice  and an attempted food delivery by horseback had to be aborted friday afternoon because a creek that had to be crossed was running too high just before sunset friday night  the horseback riders came back  this time by canoe  carrying big plastic bags full of macaroni and cheese  toilet paper  hamburger helper and canned pasta it was a relief  ms  rowland said  well have something to last us for a while .
 el chapo was found guilty on all 10 charges  read our latest story on his conviction  some of the drugs were hidden in passenger cars  concealed in trucks in cans of jalapeos or stashed in tanker trains with ordinary loads of cooking oil  others were sent beneath the border in sophisticated tunnels the 10 weeks of testimony at the trial of joaqun guzmn loera  the drug lord known as el chapo who was convicted on drug conspiracy charges on tuesday  revealed that his innovative smuggling network typically went through legal checkpoints  not isolated stretches of the border where a wall might be an obstacle president trumps plan to build a wall along the southwestern border was not mentioned at the trial  but it lurked in the background of mr  guzmns prosecution  a watershed moment in americas war on drugs the trial  in federal district court in brooklyn  was the first time that american federal prosecutors publicly revealed the inner workings of mr  guzmns sinaloa drug cartel  offering the most extensive details yet on the organizations structure  financing and distribution methods  in doing so  prosecutors relied on firsthand experts  a long list of mr  guzmns own former underlings and allies though mr  trump has primarily pitched his border wall as a way to stop illegal immigration  he has recently suggested that it would also help allay the cross border drug trade if we build a powerful and fully designed see through steel barrier on our southern border  the crime rate and drug problem in our country would be quickly and greatly reduced  he said on saturday  some say it could be cut in half he added  we can stop heroin but the guzmn trial indicated that stopping the flow of drugs into the united states might be more complicated than that  through the testimony of people who worked with mr  guzmn  prosecutors showed that his cartel for decades was endlessly creative  constantly inventing new methods to circumvent detection what youre hearing in this trial is what front line border workers observe throughout  said doris meissner  who served as the commissioner of the immigration and naturalization service from 1993 to 2000 and now works at the migration policy institute  a nonpartisan think tank ms  meissner added  the idea that people are walking drugs across the border as though they are illegal immigrants who would then be stopped by a wall across the border  that is not the pattern but some supporters of the wall have noted that a physical obstacle along the border is needed as a safeguard to ensure the frontier is sealed as much as possible its about checking all the boxes  sea  land  air  port of entry and the space between the port of entries  said james carafano  vice president for foreign policy and national security at the heritage foundation  a conservative leaning think tank  otherwise youre not implementing an effective border strategy  an effective strategy means that you create the most barriers possible  you dont just close off one so they have 99 others one thing revealed at mr  guzmns trial was that among his earliest  and favorite  smuggling methods was sneaking drugs across the border in normal looking passenger cars with secret compartments hidden in their chassis  witnesses described how he often split loads among several vehicles to help ensure that at least some of them made the journey undetected but mr  guzmn also used more dramatic and unusual tactics to transport drugs at one point  testimony at the trial showed  mr  guzmn sent tons of cocaine across the border in cans of jalapeos marked with the label la comadre chiles  the cans were stacked on pallets in the backs of commercial tractor trailers  which simply drove through official border entry points  to protect his product from being found  witnesses said  mr  guzmn often placed the cans filled with cocaine in the middle of the pallets  surrounded by cans with actual chiles proponents of the wall have said such a structure could help improve inspections at the border one of the big problems is we have too many people standing on guard between and at points of entry and not enough people doing inspections  analysis and intelligence  so the wall will certainly channel the flow into areas you can manage  analyze and search more thoroughly  said john p  walters  the former director for drug control policy for president george w  bush and the chief operating officer for the hudson institute  a conservative think tank  the wall itself does not stop all flow  but the wall becomes a way to stop all flow he added  im not saying a wall will do everything  but what im saying is  how do you try to stop it without a wall but mr  guzmns methods went beyond regular border crossings  one witness at the trial  tirso martnez sanchez  told jurors in december that he personally helped persuade mr  guzmn to use commercial tanker trains that traveled on cross border rail lines according to mr  martnez  cartel operatives first created front companies that appeared to be selling legal items like cooking oil  after shipping a few real loads of oil from mexico to various american cities to make it seem as if the company was legitimate  mr  guzmns workers then packed cocaine into secret compartments in the tankers and sent them over the border in the united states  other operatives received the trains at a network of secret warehouses  which  mr  martnez said  were located mostly on rail spurs so that the trains could be driven directly into them from major cargo rail lines sea routes were another  if a bit less frequent  means of moving drugs into the united states  this month  for instance  witnesses testified that mr  guzmn once sent a load of marijuana by boat from mexico north on the pacific ocean to the coast near san diego  the drugs were meant to be unloaded offshore by smaller boats  the shipment never reached san diego  and three of mr  guzmns workers were arrested the kingpin also sent bulk shipments of cash through normal border checkpoints in the opposite direction  from the united states to mexico  as early as 1989  in fact  one of mr  guzmns brothers  arturo guzmn loera  was briefly detained at the douglas  ariz   port of entry after border agents there found more than  1 million packed into the tailgate and side panels of his black ford bronco mr  carafano said he understood that drug smugglers would always try to find new methods  and that the wall would simply be part of the mix he added  it is part of the tool  but you have to do all three simultaneously  at the port of entry  on the border and you have to do it at sea  so youre creating just a series of bad options for the smugglers but then theres the matter of el chapos most famous smuggling method  tunnels early in the trial  jesus zambada garca  one of mr  guzmns top logistics chiefs  told jurors how workers had dug a tunnel in the early 1990s under an innocuous looking ranch house in agua prieta  mexico  that reached a warehouse in douglas the entrance on the mexican side  mr  zambada said  was hidden under a pool table that could be raised off the ground by hydraulic lifts  the lifts were activated by turning what appeared to be an ordinary garden hose valve in the yard outside and the tunnel exit in the warehouse in arizona remarkably  mr  zambada said  it was located only blocks from a local office of customs and border protection .

washington  house and senate negotiators on monday night agreed in principle to provide  1 375 billion for fencing and other physical barriers at the mexican border  part of a broader agreement that would stave off another partial government shutdown without funding president trumps wall the agreement would allow for 55 miles of new bollard fencing  with some restrictions on location based on community and environmental concerns  according to two congressional aides  who requested anonymity to disclose details of the private negotiations  that is a fraction of the more than 200 miles of steel and concrete wall that mr  trump demanded  and 10 miles less than negotiators agreed on last summer  before democrats took control of the house the deal  which must still pass the house and the senate  and secure mr  trumps signature  came together just before mr  trump  framed by banners emblazoned with finish the wall at an event in el paso  doubled down on his demands were building the wall anyway  he told the crowd  saying that aides had told him that the negotiators had made progress the funding for 55 miles of new fencing is a figure far lower than the  5 7 billion that mr  trump had demanded and marginally less than the  1 6 billion for 65 miles of pedestrian fencing in the bill that the senate appropriations committee had passed last year in december  the president  concerned about reneging on his signature campaign promise  refused to sign onto that legislation  forcing the nations longest government shutdown the negotiators also agreed to reduce the number of migrants and undocumented immigrants who can be held in detention  democrats demand for a limit on how much detention space could be used for unauthorized immigrants arrested within the united states had threatened to derail the negotiations over the weekend  but lawmakers agreed to waive the demand instead  lawmakers agreed to adhere to levels  set by a number of detention beds  established in the previous budget  that would fund 40 520 beds  a decrease of about 17 percent from current levels  which immigration and customs enforcement reached in recent months only by surpassing its funding caps privately  democratic aides admitted the provision could have no impact on the number of beds ice assigned for detainees  there is nothing to prevent trump administration officials from funding a greater number of slots in excess of the lower target number  and then securing congressional outlays to cover those expenses  as ice officials have done routinely in recent years  the aides said beyond the border barriers  the agreement  which primarily funds the department of homeland security  would provide  1 7 billion more for border security  including technology at ports of entry  more officers and humanitarian aid  sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  the republican and democratic leaders of the house and senate appropriations committees announced the agreement  which includes seven unfinished spending bills  after three private meetings on monday  disaster relief for areas affected by storms and natural disasters last year will not be included  and lawmakers said they would address it separately it is expected to be finalized as early as tuesday  well before the friday deadline when funding would again lapse for a number of federal agencies  with fears of another damaging shutdown  lawmakers seemed confident that they had the support of party leadership and that mr  trump would be willing to sign the agreement we think so  senator richard c  shelby  republican of alabama and the chairman of the senate appropriations committee  told reporters when asked about the likelihood of the presidents signature  we hope so the specter of another government shutdown this close  i thought tonight we didnt want that to happen  he added later senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  had urged him to get it done in negotiations  mr  shelby said  representative nita m  lowey  democrat of new york and the chairwoman of the house appropriations committee  said she had been in close communication with speaker nancy pelosi of california and expected her support she has confidence that i made the right decision  ms  lowey told reporters white house officials did not respond to requests for comment about the terms of the agreement  and the presidents conservative allies on monday night were already denouncing the deal  sean hannity  a fox news commentator and a confidant of the presidents  called it a garbage compromise pentagon officials spent the weekend readying for the possibility that mr  trump would declare a national emergency  something that his allies said he is still considering as a means to secure border wall funding but republican lawmakers remained optimistic that their agreement would hold this has been a difficult one  said representative kay granger of texas  the ranking republican on the house appropriations committee  i think everyone will say  good work a specific point of contention had been the number of detention beds under the control of ice  which had stalled talks over the weekend house democrats  urged on by immigration rights groups  had pushed hard  hoping to leverage white house fears of another damaging shutdown into a softening of the presidents hard line immigration policies that they say have torn apart families  wrenched productive workers from the communities they have lived in for years and infused a heartlessness into official american immigration policy the democrats goal was to cut the overall number of detention beds  including those occupied by asylum seekers and people caught at the border  from its current level of around 49 000 to 34 000  the number funded during the obama administration  democratic aides said  that  they say  would end sweeps and roundups  and force ice to focus on pursuing hardened criminals we started at zero on the wall  and we compromised a lot after that  and we are now asking them to change  too  said representative lucille roybal allard  democrat of california and a member of the 17 member house and senate conference committee tasked with hammering out a compromise mr  trump caught on  when mr  shelby presented him with the democrats demand  he rejected it quickly  according to two people briefed on the exchange these are the people coming into our country that we are holding and we dont want in our country  the president told reporters at the white house on monday  thats why they dont want to give us what we call the beds  its much more complicated than beds  but we call them the beds in private  republicans responded with a plan that would exempt many detained immigrants from the cap  including those people either charged with or convicted of crimes  including misdemeanor drug offenses and violent felonies  that  in turn  was rejected by democrats you have ice agents picking up mothers and fathers and children in their own neighborhoods  thats why the beds issue is so much more important than the wall  said ms  roybal allard  whose los angeles area district is 85 percent hispanic  the highest percentage of any district in the country the number of beds occupied by detainees fluctuates over time  influenced by a variety of factors  including ice enforcement policies and the flow of migrants at the border with mexico  the rate of that flow is unpredictable and determined by factors such as the performance of the economies north and south of the border  crime  gang activity and the business practices of coyotes paid to transport migrants from mexico and central america to california and the southwest the number of monthly apprehensions of migrants at the border has averaged 25 000 to 40 000 for most of the past decade  but has risen to about 50 000 over the past several months  according to statistics compiled by the department of homeland security if ice does not have enough room to place individuals and family members they detain  they must loosen their enforcement actions  creating a powerful motive for new migrants to enter the country illegally  trump administration officials say you cannot have border security  without strong interior enforcement  whether there is a wall there or not  said matt albence  the deputy director of ice  on monday in a conference call with reporters republicans closed ranks to blast the plan this is a poison pill that no administration  not this one  not the previous one  should ever accept  mr  mcconnell said on the senate floor  imagine the absurdity of this  house democrats want to set a limit on how many criminal aliens our government can detain .

good morning  heres the sign up  if you dont already get california today by email  refusing to change out of her turtleneck on a sweltering day in pasadena and being captivated by swaying palm trees thats most of what miriam tellez sorrosa remembers about arriving in the united states from mexico when she was 7 i had not seen palm trees in my life  she said  i thought they were going to fall ms  tellez sorrosa is now 22 and a dreamer  shes among the roughly 700 000 young immigrants brought into the united states as children  who were shielded from deportation under the obama era program known as deferred action for childhood arrivals shes getting ready to graduate from cal state university fullerton  where shes worked extensively with other undocumented students through the schools titan dreamers resource center and on tuesday  at the invitation of representative gil cisneros  she was in the chambers of the u s  house of representatives as president trump delivered his state of the union address mr  cisneros  who represents the 39th district  which includes parts of los angeles  orange and san bernardino counties  said he wanted the president to see that students like ms  tellez sorrosa are assets to the country this is her home  this is where she wants to make a difference and we need to be embracing that  he said while president trump has consistently used dire language about immigrants who come into the country illegally  his position on daca recipients has shifted in 2017  he moved to end daca  then last month  he offered to extend protections for daca recipients in exchange for border wall funding in the state of the union  he returned to describing a crisis on the border i talked to ms  tellez sorrosa on wednesday about visiting washington and listening to the president  heres our conversation  edited for length and clarity jill cowan  what did being at the state of the union represent for you i think the biggest thing for me was just understanding the history of it  to think the place where i was going to be was the place where generations of individuals were making laws that now affect me what being undocumented means to me is my resilient identity  so for me  i feel like its almost like a responsibility and a necessity to share my experience what was it like to be in washington as the guest of a congressman yesterday there was a period of time where i was shadowing him in his meetings and that just blew my mind what i love about it  too  was that everybodys experience and narrative is unique and theres not like  this persons guest is more important than this persons guest  it was just a handful of american people being present  that was one of the most magical things  to share the room  i feel like thats what america always strives to be  with the people and for the people was there another guest that you really felt like you connected with  i was super excited to hear that there were going to be more daca recipients attending and there was this moment where we were all in the same room  i was just like  yes what was it like listening to the speech  in a way  i was happy about where my seat was  i couldnt really see him  it helped me just listen to what he was saying  there were things where i was like  i believe this  too when he talked about immigration and immigrants  i paid a lot more attention  i think because ive known his rhetoric and how he talked about immigrants  that wasnt a surprise  i was indifferent to it but im learning research now as a sociologist  and i was like  theres so many potential flaws in this  i want to know where your information is coming from  read the timess fact check of the state of the union here  do you mind if i ask what you wore  i laugh because i was freaking out about what to wear  i was coming into a space where these people are people with power  economic status  everything  how do i fit in  i think i went the safe route  wearing business professional clothing  i did wear a white shirt in support of a lot of congresswomen on campus  we have a dreamers graduation and in our dreamers graduation we have a sash  so i actually asked for my sash in advance as a statement piece  i was hoping it would spark dialogue how are you going to use this experience going forward im definitely not as afraid as i was before i have until 2020 with my permit  and thats kind of my safety net  so im going to try to do as much as possible while i have daca and im going to continue to advocate for something bigger that will just benefit not only the dreamers  quote unquote last question  do you think that you might want to run for office someday  one of my lyft drivers  as i was telling him about why im here  he was like  i like how you talk  you should run for office  and i was like  would i have your vote  he was like  yes definitely  being here and being present and seeing people being passionate about moving forward the agendas that are

welcome to the climate fwd  newsletter  the new york times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change  sign up here to get it in your inbox hi  everybody  things have been heating up around here  especially in the ocean  a new study suggests the oceans have been warming more rapidly than scientists previously thought  zeke hausfather  an author of the study  told our colleague kendra pierre louis that 2018 would turn out to be the warmest year on record for the earths oceans  as 2017 was the warmest year  and 2016 was the warmest year the news about the oceans makes you wonder how high 2018 will rank among the hottest years in recorded history  wed love to tell you  but we cant  the government shutdown has stalled that data  and a lot of other important science besides  kendra has that story  too thats just one of the effects of the shutdown  coral davenport wrote about furloughed pollution inspectors at the environmental protection agency who would normally be checking up on chemical factories  power plants  oil refineries  water treatment plants and thousands of other industrial sites for pollution violations still  not everything is idle for the trump administration  it is bringing back at least 40 federal employees to work on plans to sell oil and gas drilling leases off the united states coastline  and the hearing over the nomination of andrew wheeler to head the environmental protection agency went on as scheduled in california  pacific gas and electric will seek bankruptcy protection over the billions of dollars in liability it faces from two years of deadly wildfires  climate change is a factor  helping to make wildfires more numerous and more destructive  and making the utility one of the first major financial casualties from climate change and  if all of that is the sort of news that might have you reaching for a comforting cup of coffee  you guessed it  climate change  and deforestation  is threatening many wild species of coffee  somini sengupta tells us that the loss of diversity means we could be losing options to adapt our morning cup to a changing world as the impasse continues over president trumps demand for a border wall  mr  trump and his allies have floated the idea of his declaring a national emergency that they say might allow him to build it without congressional approval mr  trump has already pulled back somewhat from his earlier threats of an emergency declaration  but the idea alone has caused consternation  and not just among democrats  senator marco rubio  republican of florida  said last week that the precedent of declaring an emergency to build the wall worried him  we have to be careful about endorsing broad uses of executive power  he said  tomorrow the national emergency might be climate change hmm  we thought here at team climate  could a future president who accepts the seriousness of the climate threat declare an emergency to get things done  how would that work there are 136 statutory provisions that grant powers to the president under an emergency declaration  according to a recent report from the brennan center for justice at new york university  these laws are very specific in their effects  said elizabeth goitein  a co director of the centers liberty and national security program whether the laws would allow mr  trump to build a wall is questionable  whether they would allow action on climate change is even more so some of the laws do allow the president to act on environmental safeguards and energy production  but they all cut the other way  ms  goitein said  these are laws that allow the president to temporarily suspend environmental protections  for example  in the case of a national emergency that requires a quick surge in energy production  so  those laws could not be used to tighten environmental protections or to reduce energy production there are no emergency provisions to protect the earth  ms  goitein said whats more  the meaning of an emergency when invoking these powers is rooted in the idea of things that happen suddenly  without the kind of warning that gives congress time to act  and one thing that isnt sudden is knowledge about climate change the intention of the provisions  ms  goitein said  is not to get around the law or to perform an end run around a congress that disagrees with the presidents wishes we are in a climate emergency  said michael burger  executive director of the sabin center for climate change law at columbia university  but just because you call something an emergency doesnt mean that it fits under the presidents statutory authority when you turn on the shower  chances are that hot water  eventually  comes out  while we may wonder why it takes so long for the water to warm  thats about as far as our minds probably wander on the subject  but heres something to remember  keeping water hot is one of the most energy intensive components of our daily lives according to the energy department  water heating accounts for about 18 percent of a homes energy consumption  thats usually second only to home heating  which we covered last month  and cooling  but it often goes overlooked  said gary klein  a consultant on hot water efficiency for energy conscious homeowners who have already gone through a standard checklist  water heating is going to be the biggest one thing thats left  mr  klein said  its like the next gold mine to go mining in there are a number of places to start  some easier than others if youre building a new home or doing major renovations  mr  klein suggests a design where the taps and hot water heater are as close to one another as possible  another consideration is whether to go with a traditional hot water tank or a tankless system  which is more expensive to install but uses less energy because it heats water only on demand high efficiency appliances also go a long way  mr  klein said  mainly because they use less water  thus reducing the need to heat it in the first place but there are also simple things that most anyone can do  switching to low flow fixtures  for example  reduces the demand for hot water  leading to significant savings another place to look is on the water heater itself  where the temperature is almost always adjustable  if your water is coming out of the tap scalding  the temperature is probably set too high  so go ahead and try inching it down until you feel comfortable  the energy department recommends 120 degrees mr  klein recommends looking into other modifications as well  demand activated pumps  for example  can help bring your water up to temperature without wasting water down the drain  pressure compensating aerators better regulate the flow from fixtures and can be quite inexpensive the technology  he said  is much better than it used to be  if you tried this stuff some years ago  he said  its time to try it again mr  klein also recommends insulating your hot water pipes  doing so keeps your unused hot water warmer for longer  meaning less energy is needed to heat it back up poorly insulated pipes  mr  klein said  is sort of like having screen doors in

good morning  and welcome to a special post state of the union edition of on politics  im lisa lerer  your host a ritual of sorts has developed around the state of the union address  president trump arrives in the capitol  basks in the pomp and ceremony  and delivers an uncharacteristically reserved speech that includes some passing appeals to compromise  this is the day trump became president  official washington crows  shocked by the apparent transformation early the next morning  the president fires off a tweet  and its back to the usual political chaos so  this year well let others break down the policy ideas and possibilities for bipartisan action  were going to view the speech as what it most centrally was  an opening salvo in mr  trumps re election campaign  heres video of the address  along with times reporters analysis  you can read highlights here  and a fact check here  with the largest audience hes likely to have all year  mr  trump used the address to please his still loyal base of conservatives  while trying to position the democratic party as too far to the left for the independents  women and suburbanites who have fallen away mr  trump opened his address with the message republicans desperately wanted him to push before the 2018 midterms  the strength of the economy he said that it had improved under his watch  particularly for blue collar workers  who i promised to fight for  he touted the campaign pledges hes kept  passage of the tax bill  withdrawal from the iran nuclear deal  increased oil drilling for his supporters  he promised to build that wall across the southern border  warning in sinister tones of a tremendous onslaught of migrant caravans  as democratic groans echoed in the chamber for independents  mr  trump offered some universally popular ideas  like fighting childhood cancer and rebuilding crumbling infrastructure  he singled out two key 2020 battleground states  michigan and pennsylvania  as hurt by foreign trade and he took digs at the ascendant left wing of the democratic party  including mounting a strong defense of immigration and customs enforcement  an agency that some democrats have said should be abolished  the president also urged lawmakers to reject the politics of resistance and said he was alarmed by calls to adopt socialism he also attacked the multiple investigations into his administration and his campaigns possible ties to russia  seeming to argue that democrats congressional oversight threatened national security and economic growth an economic miracle is taking place in the united states  and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars  politics or ridiculous partisan investigations  he said  as house speaker nancy pelosi quietly scoffed behind him but perhaps as telling as any of the topics he addressed was the one he did not  the government shutdown  during his nearly 90 minute speech  mr  trump didnt even mention the shutdown  which dominated national news  dragged down his approval ratings and delayed this very event less than two years away from facing voters for a second time  mr  trump finds himself in a moment of political peril he has not been able to get funding for his border wall and is flirting with declaring a national emergency to fulfill that major campaign promise  the special counsel investigation has ensnared some of his key allies  aides are preparing for a blizzard of subpoenas from the democratic controlled house  and hes still reeling from his political defeat over the longest government shutdown in history the challenges are adding up  while his base has largely stuck with him  a majority of voters now say theyve ruled out re electing him of course  there are some positive signs for the president  the economy is strong  and hes kept one of his core promises to supporters  sticking to his image as a fighter who punches back twice as hard but that base is shrinking  as evidenced by his falling approval ratings among women and independents  even congressional republicans who have long feared a backlash if they break with the president are showing signs of autonomy  opposing him on foreign policy and expressing jitters about another shutdown the hyperpolarization of the trump era has pushed voters so far into their corners that its almost hard to imagine what mr  trump could do to shift that dynamic during the trump administration  democrats have largely transformed into a party of fierce resistance  impossible to miss in the house chamber on tuesday as their female members appeared in a sea of white outfits the president never mentioned his re election campaign on tuesday  even with a number of potential opponents glaring at him from the audience  but its clear mr  trump is thinking about the 2020 race he attacks democratic candidates on twitter as political aides work behind the scenes to stave off republican primary threats  at a lunch on tuesday previewing his remarks to news anchors  mr  trump offered scathing assessments of his possible democratic opponents the address underscored that mr  trump and his team may believe their best hope for re election rests not with winning back independents and white women  but the selection of a democratic nominee who moves too far to the left for those voters whether the president fully recognizes his own vulnerabilities is less certain                     drop us a line we want to hear from our readers  have a question  well try to answer it  have a comment  were all ears  email us at onpolitics nytimes com

democratic rebuttal   some democrats were  predictably  annoyed with him   senator kamala harris took to facebook live before the speech to criticize what she expected to be the presidents insincere appeals to unity  senator kirsten gillibrand jumped on a viral moment of her looking exasperated with mr  trump  sharing a gif on twitter with a link to donate to her campaign   she may have broken a house ethics rule in the process   before attending tuesdays speech  senator cory booker addressed his mysterious relationship status  telling the breakfast club radio show that he does  in fact  have

the debate around a border wall and immigration has become so distorted by president trumps superheated nonsense  we must build a wall to keep out all these rapists and murderers  and mexico will pay for it  that weve forgotten what it would sound like if we actually had a president framing the real border issue in a really honest way to come up with a real solution  not just one to energize his base unfortunately  we have a president who wants to spend  5 7 billion on a wall to fix his political problems with rush limbaugh  ann coulter and laura ingraham  when what we need is a president who wants to spend  5 7 on a multipronged strategy that will address the actual immigration challenge we face here is how a real president would explain it  my fellow americans  we face a global crisis  more people are on the move today seeking jobs  asylum from murderous governments  safety from environmental disasters or just looking for order than at any time since world war ii  some 70 million people why now  answer  during the late 19th and the 20th centuries the world shifted from being governed by large empires in many regions to being governed by independent nation states  and the 50 years after world ii were a great time to be a weak little nation state  for several reasons  sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  first  because there were two superpowers competing for your affection by throwing foreign aid at you  building your army  buying your cheap goods and educating your kids at their universities  second  climate change was moderate  third  populations were still under control in the developing world  fourth  no one had a cellphone to easily organize movements against your government or even see what paris or phoenix looked like  fifth  china was not in the world trade organization  so every poor country could be in textiles and other low wage industries all of those advantages disappeared in the early 21st century  climate driven extreme weather  floods  droughts  record setting heat and cold  on top of man made deforestation began to hammer many countries  especially their small scale farmers  developing world populations exploded thanks to improved health care  africa went from 140 million people in 1900 to one billion in 2010 to a projected 2 5 billion by 2050  the same surge happened in central america  in countries like guatemala meanwhile  the smartphone enabled citizens to easily compare their living standards with paris or phoenix  and find a human trafficker app to take them there  also  china joined the w t o   gobbling up low wage industries  and the end of the cold war meant no superpower wanted to touch your country  because all it would win was a bill the result  its much harder to be a weak country today  and the weakest of them are starting to fail or fracture and hemorrhage their people  thats guatemala  honduras  el salvador and venezuela in our hemisphere and sudan  syria  afghanistan  libya and many countries in sub saharan africa across the atlantic this is creating wide zones of disorder  and the biggest geopolitical trend in the world is all the people trying to get out of zones of disorder into the world of order  and that is whats creating all the populist  nationalist  anti immigrant backlashes in the world of order  particularly in america and europe that is the real context for this immigration crisis  whats the answer  well  if you look at what slowed the flood of single mexican men illegally and legally coming to america in the last decade  it was the combination of greater economic opportunity in mexico  thanks in part to nafta  plus slower population growth in mexico  plus improved governance in mexico  plus better border security along the mexico u s  border that same formula has to be applied now to guatemala  honduras and el salvador  they have become the primary source of all those migrants and caravans coming to america today  including 187 000 minors without adult guardians  who were picked up by the u s  border patrol between 2014 and 2018  their parents sent them our way to connect with relatives already here or to be shielded from forced gang recruitment and violence a report last june by the council on foreign relations noted  in 2015  the latest year for which data is available  as many as 3 4 million people born in el salvador  guatemala and honduras were living in the united states  more than double the estimated 1 5 million people in 2000  because of rampant corruption and gang warfare  salvadorans  hondurans and guatemalans each year pay an estimated total of  651 million in extortion to organized crime groups  these gangs  like ms 13  exploded in central america in the mid 1990s following large scale deportations from the united states of undocumented immigrants with criminal records thats why  among other things  a smart u s  immigration policy would promote family planning in rural areas in central america  letting americas religious right limit u s  family planning assistance abroad is stupid  the only thing more stupid is not working to mitigate climate change  which trump refuses to do  extreme weather has been disrupting small scale farming in central america  and when small scale farming weakens or collapses  people leave the countryside and flock to the city  and if they find high unemployment and high crime rates there  they head to america at the same time  we need an investment shock by local and foreign companies and governments to build infrastructure  tourism and trade in central america so more people can thrive there  especially when 61 percent of the population is under 29 years of age alas  though  investment rates average just 12 percent of g d p  in guatemala  honduras and el salvador  while in mexico its 26 percent yes  both legal and illegal immigrants actually contribute  on balance  to american growth  but there is no question that border security  asylum courts  resettlement and absorption facilities put pressure on federal  state and local governments  but the u s  could spend millions of dollars to help stabilize central american countries  so that more of their citizens could stay home  which most immigrants prefer  and wed still save money and reduce illegal immigration  it costs us anywhere from  14 000 to  38 000 to detain and deport a single migrant finally  we also need fences  drones and sensors to strengthen the border in places  but rather than building a  5 7 billion wall against mexico  what we need most is to help mexico improve its capacity to intercept migrants at its southern border with guatemala  where all central american migrants headed north have to pass  its not that hard  there are only two main roads out of guatemala to the north  with a mountain in the middle  its called mexicos tehuantepec isthmus bottleneck if we worked with mexico to create better entry point infrastructure there with biometric controls and improved ability to inspect vehicles  people and merchandise to stop smugglers  and even interview potential asylum seekers there  we would significantly reduce the numbers coming out of central america  crossing mexico and piling up at our border in sum  we need a plan that creates a wall  not a wall that substitutes for a plan  thats what a real president would offer  if only we had one but have no illusions  more weak nation states will be imploding under these pressures in the coming decade and no empire is going to impose order there  those days are long gone  but many of these states simply cannot effectively govern themselves any longer   heck  britain cant effectively govern itself any longer  so how the world of order collaborates to bring order to more and more of these places  italy has basically created and funded the libyan coast guard to protect itself from migrants crossing the mediterranean  is going to become one of the biggest governing challenges of this century .
washington  president trumps legislative path to a border wall has narrowed significantly on the eve of tuesdays state of the union speech  and his fallback plan to circumvent congress by declaring a state of emergency could create a major division in his own party as he prepares to make his case to the largest national audience of the year  mr  trump appeared to be in an increasingly precarious position  unable to sway the wider public to his cause and unwilling  at least so far  to apply the persuasion and compromise that have gotten previous presidents out of political jams anxiety over the damage being inflicted on the party is growing  last week  in a one on one meeting with the president  senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  reportedly warned mr  trump that declaring a national emergency to build his wall would almost certainly spark a rebellion within his party  and a vote to overrule him  house and senate negotiators have been moving toward a bipartisan agreement as early as friday to keep the government funded after feb  15  with or without the presidents support but the presidents supporters continue to plead for unity this is the defining moment of his presidency  said senator lindsey graham  a south carolina republican who is one of mr  trumps biggest supporters on capitol hill  speaking at an event in greenville on monday to every republican  if you dont stand behind this president  were not going to stand behind you when it comes to the wall  said mr  graham  adding that he feared a war within the republican party if republicans did not support mr  trumps plans  including an emergency declaration the presidents advisers have said the speech will focus on unity  but he is also expected to double down on the wall  in an oval office interview last week  he cast doubt on a settlement being hashed out by a bipartisan committee of 17 house members and senators before the feb  15 deadline  saying that anything short of his full demand would be a waste of time at the same time  mr  trump continued to brandish the threat of an emergency declaration that would allow him to divert existing federal funding to the wall  an idea that has sparked heated opposition among senate republicans  who have grown increasingly comfortable in their defiance  on monday  the senate formally adopted an amendment to a broader middle east policy bill  70 to 26  that rebuked the president for what republicans saw as a precipitous withdrawal of troops from afghanistan and syria in december  republican senators broke with him to call for the withdrawal of american support for saudi arabias war in yemen  as they recoiled from his inaction in the face of the kingdoms murder of a washington post columnist  jamal khashoggi mr  trump is not expected to declare the state of emergency during tuesdays address  but he continues to threaten that he will divert funding for other military and infrastructure projects to build the wall  with or without congressional approval  he has told people close to him that he views the threat as his last remaining leverage in the fight that has some republicans openly fretting that such a declaration would embolden a democratic president to declare a national emergency on climate change or gun violence it would be a bad precedent  i think  for the president to decide to invoke national security as a way to bypass a congressional logjam  said senator patrick j  toomey  republican of pennsylvania  and i can imagine future presidents using that for purposes i would find very objectionable that sentiment has been expressed by about a dozen republican senators  publicly and privately  including roy blunt of missouri  lamar alexander of tennessee  marco rubio of florida  bill cassidy of louisiana and john cornyn of texas  who is considered to be among the most influential members of his party on immigration the whole idea that a president  whether its president trump or president warren or president sanders  can declare an emergency and then somehow usurp the separation of powers and get into the business of appropriating money for specific projects without congress getting involved is a serious constitutional question  mr  cornyn said on monday but the most important critic of the declaration is mr  mcconnell  i dont think much of that idea  mr  mcconnell said last month when asked about the declaration  i hope he doesnt go down that path mr  mcconnell  according to three people familiar with his thinking  has grown increasingly frustrated with the white house in recent days  telling associates that he thinks members of the presidents staff have failed to adequately brief him on the legislative and political perils of moving ahead with a disaster declaration during his white house meeting  disclosed by the washington post  mr  mcconnell predicted that speaker nancy pelosi would have the house immediately pass a resolution of disapproval attempting to block him from using existing funding for the wall any senator from either party could then demand a vote  because the resolution would be deemed privileged  mr  mcconnell told mr  trump that he would have no choice but to schedule a floor vote on the measure within 15 days  and republican aides have estimated that between three and 10 republicans would side with the chambers democrats against mr  trump that would force the president into a politically costly effort to keep the senate from overriding his veto of the resolution  even as democrats moved to block him in the courts hes been talking about all this for a month  in front of the cameras  said don stewart  a spokesman for mr  mcconnell  who played down the exchange the leader delivered a similar message to vice president mike pence and the presidents son in law and senior adviser  jared kushner  three weeks ago during negotiations to reopen the government  since then  both men have counseled the president to move cautiously on the emergency declaration  according to a senior administration official democrats have begun drafting legislation that would remove the presidents ability to shift money from one project to another  representative john garamendi  democrat of california  would repeal a line in the 1986 water resources development act that grants the president authority to use civil works money to respond to a national emergency administration officials struck a defiant note on monday  saying the president needed the threat of a declaration to pressure ms  pelosi the congress has failed to do its job  this congress  last congress and for quite a while to make sure that we have what we need at the southern border  which of course the centerpiece is a physical barrier  wall  steel slats  kellyanne conway  the counselor to the president  told reporters the house senate negotiating committee assigned to hammer out a border security deal to keep the government funded is expected to work through the week and into the weekend  lawmakers will begin working out some of the more tenuous aspects of the funding bill as early as tuesday  among the expected snags are a democratic provision that would prohibit the use of funds to deny asylum applications from survivors of gang violence and domestic violence  whether to increase or decrease the number of detention beds used by immigration and customs enforcement and what constitutes a border barrier democrats prefer a smart wall made up of sensors  drones and other technology but no physical structure  republicans say some physical barrier is necessary  though not a concrete wall from the pacific ocean to the gulf of mexico house republicans on the committee spent sunday and monday on the border in texas in mcallen and el paso  accompanied by representative henry cuellar  democrat of texas  senator richard c  shelby  republican of alabama and the chairman of the appropriations committee  has also suggested bringing experts in to testify on what is needed in border security but all of that work could be blown up by an emergency declaration  a move that would endear mr  trump to the republican base while infuriating democrats i think hes going to do it  said jeff roe  a veteran republican consultant and longtime political adviser to senator ted cruz of texas  hes responding to what too many republicans ignore  which is the screaming and yelling from our base to do something  lets stop fighting ourselves and letting democrats kick us in the face  weve been making these types of promises for ten to 15 years  tax cuts and regulatory reform aint enough  we want the wall .

washington  officially  republicans blame democrats for what is now the longest government shutdown in the nations history  privately  many concede  the stalemate over president trumps demand for a border wall has been made exponentially worse by white house ineptitude on capitol hill  where two years of contradictory statements and actions have built up a profound lack of trust republican lawmakers and aides worry that mr  trump has misunderstood democrats incentives to stand firm and that he has deputized the wrong aides to press his case  and they question who  if anyone other than the president  has the authority to resolve the impasse  they describe a dysfunctional dynamic where even senior leaders in mr  trumps own party never know quite what to expect from the president its always difficult when the person youre negotiating with changes their mind  including my wife  said senator john cornyn  republican of texas  when asked about the consequences of mr  trumps penchant for doing so mr  cornyn noted that in the days before the shutdown began on dec  22  he and every other senator had voted for a stopgap government spending measure that omitted wall funding  believing that the president supported it  only to learn later that mr  trump had no intention of doing so  the presidents about face  and house republicans decision to add  5 7 billion in wall funding to the senate bill  precipitated the shutdown  which reached day 22 on saturday my understanding was that the president was going to sign that  but apparently he changed his mind  mr  cornyn said such miscues and abrupt changes of course have become a staple of mr  trumps dealings with congress  the president has now repeatedly undercut vice president mike pence  to whom he has delegated the task of negotiating an end to a seemingly intractable stalemate mr  pence denied on thursday that he had ever told lawmakers that mr  trump would sign the bill  pressed personally by the majority leader  senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  to keep the government open without funding for the wall i said the president hasnt made up his mind  mr  pence said but that is not how republicans remembered it  he got off to a bad start  he kind of pulled the rug out from under mcconnells feet there with that one  said representative francis rooney  republican of florida it happened again on thursday  a group of republican senators were trying to forge a deal to pair wall funding with legal status for undocumented immigrants brought to the united states as children  often known as dreamers  then mr  pence told them that their effort would not earn mr  trumps support  effectively torpedoing the talks  members of the group said they recognized that their proposal would rise and fall according to the whims of the president the president is the chief executive who is going to be a part of solving this problem  said senator thom tillis  republican of north carolina  so i must trust him but hours later  the president contradicted mr  pence  saying in mcallen  tex   that he would be open to a broader immigration deal that would simultaneously deal with the dreamers and a wall  if senators would bring him one they could agree on again  republicans were left baffled by a president who has pitched himself as an expert in the art of the deal i wouldnt want to comment on his unique style of negotiation and communications  mr  rooney said  sometimes its worked very effectively for him  and sometimes it has confused a lot of people the concern goes beyond mr  trump and mr  pence  jared kushner  his son in law and senior adviser  has also been asked to help resolve the wall impasse  but mr  kushner has no experience in crisis negotiations on capitol hill  and his attempts at intervention have borne little fruit  the day before mr  trumps prime time oval office address to the nation  mr  kushner called senator joe manchin iii of west virginia  a centrist known for his enthusiasm for bipartisan deals  and said the president was firmly committed to his position on the wall and did not plan to budge  according to two people familiar with the conversation  who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the call was private mr  kushner has little relationship with mr  manchin  but he left the senator with the impression that the white house believed public opinion would be on the presidents side after the speech  and that democrats would simply have to relent  that did not go over well inside the white house  officials privately acknowledge that the president dove into this fight with no clear end game  in several recent discussions with allies  mick mulvaney  the presidents acting chief of staff  has signaled he wants to reach a deal soon  during staff meetings over the past week  mr  mulvaney has said there was only a limited window for the white house to win the public relations war around the shutdown but mr  mulvaney  who previously headed the office of management and budget  has been in this new role for less than two weeks  government shutdowns are difficult under the best of circumstances  and mr  trump is going through one in the midst of a protracted staff shake up inside the west wing and in his cabinet his legislative affairs chief  shahira knight  a former senior congressional aide who played a central role in pushing through mr  trumps tax cut  has also never had to manage a protracted battle for mr  trump  she is well liked and respected by members of both parties  but regarded with suspicion by some of the presidents staunchest allies on capitol hill  including members of the conservative freedom caucus  who urged him to dig in for a wall fight even as she was counseling avoiding a shutdown  according to people familiar with the talks but his acting budget director  russell t  vought  earned the enmity of more moderate republicans  and virtually every seasoned house democrat  as a conservative warrior and favorite of the freedom caucus on thursday  republican senators who had expected mr  vought to attend a weekly luncheon and brief them on the presidents current thinking were surprised when he did not show up  according to one senior aide he relies too much on the freedom caucus  said representative peter t  king  republican of new york  who broke this month with mr  trump and most members of his party to support democrat offered bills to reopen the government  he thinks that they are speaking for all republicans  and theyre not mr  king received a phone call from mr  trump last week asking him to vote against the measures to reopen the government  he said  adding that he refused  the president has to make real concessions  mr  king said  and so do the democrats but mr  trumps assumptions about what democrats will give in on  and what is motivating them  have also been almost comically wrong early this month  at a negotiating session in the white house situation room  mr  trump and his team said speaker nancy pelosi of california  at the time on the eve of her election to the top post  would be more willing to give in on the wall once the vote was behind her  but with the gavel in hand and an energized new class of liberal democrats enthusiastically supporting her  ms  pelosi only dug in more recently  that line of thinking has shifted to one mr  trump described to senators on tuesday in a closed door lunch at the capitol  that democrats would be ready to cut a deal with him once federal employees started missing paychecks that milestone was reached on friday  with no deal in sight .
 want to get this briefing by email  heres the sign up   good evening  the government shutdown will reach its 21st day tomorrow  and  if it lasts to saturday  become the longest in 43 years  but first

scientists say      2  no wall  no deal vice president mike pence flatly declared there could be no agreement to reopen the government without funding for a border wall  terms that democrats have already rejected and a bipartisan plan developed in the senate that would trade wall funding for legal status for undocumented immigrants facing deportation also seemed to be dead on arrival the partial shutdown  now in its 20th day  will almost certainly become the longest in american history  surpassing a 21 day lapse that began in december 1995 that leaves 800 000 federal employees still furloughed or working without pay  one example of the impact  600 pollution inspectors and other workers at the environmental protection agency responsible for detecting violations that endanger human

on a trip that he did not want to take  to discuss a crisis that democrats say does not exist  president trump repeated his demand for a wall he reiterated an untrue claim that mexico would indirectly pay for the wall through a revamped trade agreement  and heard from people who had loved ones killed by immigrants  above  mr  trump in mcallen  tex if we had a barrier of any kind  whether its steel or concrete  mr  trump said of tragic stories involving violence and human trafficking  they wouldnt even bother trying  we could stop that cold the president continued to float the idea of declaring

december  above  and as a consigliere to mr  trump  he was privy to workings of his inner circle under scrutiny by the special counsel robert mueller and federal prosecutors he could soon share the details on national television under oath      5  secretary of state mike pompeo declared  in a speech in cairo  that the united states would take a more activist role in the middle east mr  pompeo  above  apparently sought to reassure jittery nations with his declaration that the united states would expel every last iranian boot from syria  but the effect was confounding to many  coming weeks after president trumps impulsive announcement that american forces would leave syria he also rejected the obama administrations middle east policy  referring to it as the age of self inflicted shame  and outlined an approach based on alliances with authoritarian rulers mr  pompeo denounced the former president for underestimating the tenacity and viciousness of radical islam and for his policies on iran  here are the many ways mr  pompeo departed from mr  obama      6  tensions are high in congo  election officials awarded the presidency to a candidate who was not seen as the top vote getter  that dashed hopes of an undisputed transfer of power as the longtime leader of the democratic republic of congo  joseph kabila  steps down still  the pick  felix tshisekedi  pictured above in december  wasnt mr  kabilas first choice  that means mr  kabilas candidate lost so badly that his government could not simply hand him the presidency without risking widespread violence and international

washington  after two months spent scorching the earth in washington and complaining about being cooped up in the white house  president trump is planning to return this weekend to the one place where he knows he will receive a heros welcome for his troubles  mar a lago  his gilded club by the sea in palm beach you would have to be insensitive not to be touched by how he has stayed there working  said toni holt kramer  the founder of trumpettes usa  a booster group that is planning to welcome him  i think people will have tears in their eyes because theyre so grateful that hes come back to his home away from home mr  trump made a point of staying in washington over the christmas holidays  waiting  he said  for democrats to negotiate with him on funding for a border wall  so it will be the presidents first visit to mar a lago since thanksgiving it will not be a complete escape  he still has no deal on the wall and a state of the union address to give on tuesday  but after his arrival on friday afternoon  mr  trump is expected to do many of the things he always does when he is at mar a lago  dining at the owners table on the patio  spending the afternoon at trump international golf club  about a 15 minute motorcade drive away  and never venturing anywhere in palm beach outside his own two properties the first lady  melania trump  will travel there with him this weekend  her spokeswoman said  though mrs  trump tends to keep a low profile while at the resort in the mar a lago cocoon  the president is in his most comfortable mode  friends and allies say  playing the jocular host in front of an adoring crowd on saturday  p j  schrantz  who founded veleve  a charity that provides support for veterans  is betting on mr  trump to make an appearance at a  600 a plate fund raiser his organization is hosting in one of the clubs ballrooms  and plans for mr  trumps annual super bowl viewing party at his golf club on sunday evening  complete with a steak and lobster buffet  are still on i chose to have it there because ive attended galas there  mr  schrantz said of his event  which will feature a george michael tribute artist donating his time  as well as honor the astronaut buzz aldrin  the members are such giving people that we could raise a couple of million dollars in an evening some mar a lago members say they are already wistful about the blissful weeks without tangled traffic and increased security  a seven minute drive from home to the club takes at least 30 minutes when mr  trump is in town  one said  but many will brave the roads for the chance to participate in a presidential selfie or a similar show of support laurence leamer  a longtime palm beach resident who has known mr  trump since the 1990s and is the author of mar a lago  inside the gates of power at donald trumps presidential palace  said in an interview that even if people had an issue with the presidents policymaking  the meatloaf recipe or anything in between  they tended to keep it to themselves people have been trained to have like a pavlovian reaction or something  mr  leamer said  youre supposed to say things are great  when he asks you  how are things  youre not supposed to complain just as the trump international hotel in washington has become a safe space for the president and his supporters  mar a lago is a 20 acre oasis for those who adore all things trump  from his zero tolerance immigration policies to the menu items named after his children the focus on mr  trump has grown to the point where some democratic members  who have loved the clubs amenities for decades  have recently rescinded their memberships because they do not feel comfortable there anymore theres a political angle to being a member now  said cynthia friedman  a democratic fund raiser who joined the club 24 years ago and recalls playing tennis on saturdays with marla maples  mr  trumps second wife  there are a lot of people who i dont recognize  theyre not the people i used to play tennis with  things change  and its time to move on in december  instead of sending her  1 600 in monthly dues  she joined the beach club  a rival members only club  on the other side of town but ms  friedman is still in the minority  many mar a lago members book reservations weeks in advance to be in the same room with the president  and trumpworld celebrities  like anthony scaramucci  the former white house communications director  the presidents son donald trump jr   and antonio sabato jr   the trump loving model turned politician  have been spotted at social events and fund raisers in palm beach  serving as something of a warm up act to the main event karyn turk  a business owner and the 2016 winner of the mrs  florida beauty pageant  said if the walls looked like they were caving in on the president in washington  there were only blue skies in palm beach its a lot of hype  she said of the special counsel investigation  led by robert s  mueller iii  i feel like in a lot of ways  its still just a witch hunt if the winter white house is a boon for the members of mr  trumps exclusive club  and a respite not only for the president but also for the staff members who relocate with him  the annual decampment still raises ethical concerns the white house has refused to release a list of those who visit the president there  and elsewhere in the trump organization orbit  the company said it would introduce new procedures to screen for undocumented immigrants after the new york times reported that mr  trumps flagship new jersey golf club employed people who had entered the country illegally and propublica reported last summer that three mar a lago members had amassed an unusual amount of influence in the department of veterans affairs  meddling in agency initiatives and participating in the review of a contract worth some  10 billion it certainly seems unprecedented  said noah bookbinder  the executive director of the ethics watchdog crew  and highly troubling for people to be given significant authority over government matters seemingly primarily on the basis of being paying customers of the president the white house has taken at least one informal step to block people who have access to the presidents properties from asking for anything that seems to go too far  aides have long been on the alert to intercept any notes or policy proposals from overeager supporters  including one from a guest who once helpfully tried to show the president an executive order he had drafted  mr  trump has at times directed his aides to give those people ample listening time even if he cannot  according to someone familiar with the process and his thinking security around the president may have tightened since 2017  when mr  trump sat on the open patio  in front of hundreds of eyeballs and iphones pointed in his direction  discussing a response to north koreas missile test with shinzo abe  the japanese prime minister  but in many ways  mr  trump himself has not changed from the involved club owner he has always been he has always kept close watch over who comes and goes  and pays close attention to those in the latter category jeff greene  the palm beach billionaire who ran unsuccessfully in the democratic primary for governor of florida  joined the club when he moved to palm beach in 2010  but he quit because  he said  i have my own tennis court  i never loved going there mr  trump  he said  took his resignation personally  sitting next to him at a charity event at mar a lago  mr  greene recalled being confronted  he went right at me  saying  i cant believe you quit the club  hes figuring someone with plenty of money  why would they care about paying dues for a club .
to the editor re the people vs  donald j  trump  by david leonhardt  sunday review  jan  6  when richard nixon resigned  we as a country were still capable of being shocked by corruption  obstruction of justice and abuse of power  during the vietnam war  i remember how outraged we were when we discovered that the government had been lying to us about what was really happening  about the number of deaths  now  even though president trumps abuses of power and lies are far worse than those of nixon  i dont see his support crumbling  too many are now jaded and cynical  no matter what the investigations reveal  the reaction will be a shrug  well  what do you expect  all politicians are corrupt impeachment cannot  and indeed  should not  go forward unless there is broad public support for it  but the capacity to be shocked and outraged  or even to understand the danger of leaving mr  trump in office  is just not there  either in voters  or in congress  thats what really worries me margrit mcintoshtucsonto the editor david leonhardt lays out a clear and compelling case for why president trump is unfit for office  unfortunately  fitness for office wasnt what got him elected and isnt whats kept him in power  corrupt politicians in other countries use any means necessary to remain in office because the alternative is jail or worse mr  trump ran for president not to serve the public  but to serve himself  the power of executive privilege  freedom from prosecution and the possibility of self pardon no doubt motivate him to cling to power under increasing financial and legal peril so heres a deal for a president who fashions himself as a deal maker  republican and democratic leaders offer a pardon to mr  trump and his family  allowing them to retain their freedom and wealth  in exchange for his resignation  as distasteful as a pardon may be  it pales in comparison to the harm mr  trump can do by remaining in office jay markowitzwilson  wyo to the editor i believe that a majority of the electorate agrees with david leonhardts observations  however  i fear letting president trump off the hook  either by impeachment  after which mike pence could likely pardon him  or by negotiating his resignation in return for some sort of leniency for his crimes  the notion of his walking free following his despicable presidency is revolting so far  hes made a lavish living by dodging the law and common decency  and should not be rewarded for his deviance  better to vote him  and mr  pence  out of office in 2020 so that legal punishment is still available  that may mean we need to endure him for longer  but letting the trump presidency off the hook by either of the above expedients would be profoundly unsatisfying and damaging to the country and the rule of law andrew nelsonbend  ore to the editor the problem with david leonhardts analysis is that it suggests that the republican leadership will return to a fact based universe  instead of the fact free one that now prevails  the one where climate science is ignored  where the economic inequities caused by trickle down are treated as fiction  where every day president trump takes us all on an excursion into a fantasy land concerning immigration  it is here that the republican party has willingly chosen to reside those who have shut their eyes  turned their backs and held their noses for the past two years will not go easily into battle with mr  trump  no matter the damage he has done to party or country  they have shown no discernible backbone  while mr  leonhardts heart is in the right place  i fear that his head may unfortunately be in the clouds robert s  nussbaumfort lee  n j  to the editor david leonhardt has written the most articulate  well documented and soundly crafted argument for the removal of donald trump from the presidency  this article should be printed and mass distributed all over america  much as thomas paines common sense once was  i wasted no time sending it to my members of congress joyce graterpittsburghto the editor should david leonhardts powerful  comprehensive indictment of president trump not be enough to persuade republicans in congress that he must be removed from office  i suggest they ask themselves these questions  would they ever put their children on a plane piloted by someone with little previous flight experience  someone who had refused to read the planes instruction manuals  someone who had just locked his co pilots out of the cockpit  would they be comfortable if he had said in recent weeks that he felt at war every day  had seemed to be more and more suspicious of those around him  including  perhaps  even members of his own family  and had a history of hair trigger rage against those who defied him  and how would they feel if he had begun to make increasingly rash and dangerous decisions the terrifying truth is that all of our children  and all of us  republicans and democrats alike  are already on that plane  and as mr  leonhardt urgently warns  republicans had better figure out soon what they are going to do about it eric chivianbostonthe writer  a physician  is a former assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at harvard medical school to the editor while i agreed with much of david leonhardts article  it saddened me to read this part  the biggest risk may be that an external emergency  a war  a terrorist attack  a financial crisis  an immense natural disaster  will arise  by then  it will be too late to pretend that he is anything other than manifestly unfit to lead did mr  leonhardt miss the immense natural disaster that was hurricane maria  it took almost a year to restore power to all of puerto rico  and this certainly proved that president trump was unfit to lead at a time of disaster jeff wilsonenglewood  n j to the editor david leonhardts article captured the essence of what are perceived as wrongful acts  what i think was missing is the serious issue of president trumps stability  mental balance and irrational behavior  this  i believe  is what presents the most clear and present danger in his presidency a 2017 book by dr  bandy x  lee and colleagues  the dangerous case of donald trump  outlines very clearly and persuasively the real threat of mr  trumps power as our president donald h  sauvignewilton  conn to the editor david leonhardt makes a persuasive case that ample grounds exist for the impeachment of president trump  but he is far less persuasive in suggesting that the impending impeachment and resignation of president richard m  nixon in 1974 is a relevant precedent  providing grounds for hope that mr  trump will be removed or resign in 1974  unlike this year  the democrats had 56 votes in the senate  plus an independent who caucused with them  accordingly  only 10 republican votes were needed to remove nixon from office  among the senators likely to provide such votes were liberal republicans  admittedly an extinct species  like clifford case  jacob javits and lowell weicker  as well as middle of the road republicans like howard baker  robert packwood and bob dole especially following the departures of senators jeff flake and bob corker  one searches in vain among the republicans now in the senate for even a handful  much less the 20 whose votes would be required  who show any signs of measuring up to their 1974 predecessors steven b  rosenfeldnew yorkto the editor one point that david leonhardt didnt mention in his cogent case for impeaching president trump is that many republicans in both houses of congress might well prefer mike pence  who is  after all  one of them  to donald trump  who is decidedly not paul jellinekmercerville  n j  to the editor thanks to david leonhardt for so neatly summing up the voluminous case against president trump  my only quibble is that he actually understates the urgency for removal  when mr  trump says  as he did the other day  that the current government shutdown could last months if not years  i could not avoid the queasy feeling that his insistence on a demonstrably useless border wall is  in fact  a smokescreen  that the shutdown itself is his actual endgame it is well known that mr  trump thrives on chaos  and the shutdown raises that chaos to a new and alarming level  our systems of law  transportation  tax collection  health care and security  homeland and otherwise  all risk severe disruption the longer the shutdown lasts  while this could ultimately leave the country vastly weaker and more vulnerable  it would seem to play into mr  trumps  not to mention vladimir putins  hands  as we all wait to see when  or indeed if  spineless republican lawmakers will finally respond to this clear and present danger  it will be interesting to see if long lines at the airport can succeed where principle  ethics and patriotism have so obviously failed andy edelsteinberkley  mich .
washington  they think pulling out of syria and afghanistan would be a debacle  they think north korea cannot be trusted  they think the islamic state is still a threat to america  they think russia is bad and nato is good the trouble is their president does not agree more than two years into his administration  the disconnect between president trump and the republican establishment on foreign policy has rarely been as stark  in recent days  the presidents own advisers and allies have been pushing back  challenging his view of the world and his prescription for its problems the growing discontent among republican national security hawks was most evident on tuesday when senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader and perhaps mr  trumps most important partner in congress  effectively rebuked the president by introducing a measure denouncing a precipitous withdrawal of american troops from syria and afghanistan the senators repudiation came on the same day that mr  trumps own intelligence chiefs  led by dan coats  a former republican senator  gave congress a radically different assessment of international threats facing the united states from the presidents own  they warned about fresh russian efforts to interfere in american elections  predicted that north korea would never agree to give up its nuclear weapons and made clear that the islamic state is still plotting attacks around the world  they made no mention of mr  trumps top security priority of building a wall along the southwestern border nearly two weeks ago  more than two thirds of house republicans voted to overturn the trump administrations move to ease sanctions on russian companies linked to a prominent oligarch  oleg v  deripaska  and last week even more house republicans voted to bar mr  trump from withdrawing from the north atlantic treaty organization  as he privately suggested to aides several times last year perhaps as we now pivot to the presidential elections  the republicans may finally be thinking  well  maybe we ought to recalibrate a little here and understand there are real risks and we have to provide a check and balance on the commander in chief in whatever ways we can  said wendy sherman  an under secretary of state in the obama administration many traditional republicans have been uneasy about mr  trumps foreign policy since the beginning and from time to time have pushed back  most notably in 2017 when congress nearly unanimously passed sanctions on russia over the presidents objections  but the rupture of recent days comes amid disgruntlement over the 35 day partial government shutdown that ultimately failed to achieve mr  trumps goal of extracting money for his border wall weve had a couple of rapid fire shocks to the system  said eric s  edelman  under secretary of defense under president george w  bush now at the center for strategic and budgetary assessments in addition to the shutdown  he cited mr  trumps abruptly announced decision to pull american forces from syria  resulting in the  resignation of defense secretary jim mattis and quickly followed by the president vowing to withdraw half of american troops from afghanistan theres no dearth of evidence of the disconnect between the president and republican orthodoxy  said mr  edelman  a longstanding critic of mr  trump  but mr  edelman noted that the disagreement has been rooted in congress  as you look at the republican party in the electorate  i think its lining up a little more with the president because i think hes shifting republican voters more on things like trade and russia  maybe on syria and afghanistan indeed  many of mr  trumps supporters have cheered his more protectionist stance on trade and the tariff wars with china as well as american allies  likewise  many trump supporters have grown weary of overseas military ventures that never seem to end and therefore applaud his moves to bring home american troops  polls have even detected a shift in republican views on russia  which throughout the cold war was a unifying force in the party in republican circles in washington  however  the unease coincides with a critical juncture in mr  trumps foreign policy  his pullouts from syria and afghanistan come as trade talks with china head toward a climactic deadline and mr  trump prepares to get together next month with north koreas leader  kim jong un  for their second summit meeting after an initial encounter in singapore last year olivia enos  a policy scholar on asia at the heritage foundation  said doubts had grown about mr  trumps negotiations with north korea to eliminate its nuclear program many initially welcomed the presidents pursuit of diplomacy in north korea  she said  but after singapore  many questioned whether north korea was sincere in coming to the negotiating table  since that time  north korea has continued to play hard to get  calling its sincerity to denuclearize into further question some analysts said it was the way mr  trump makes his decisions as much as the decisions themselves that rattle the foreign policy establishment  announcing the syria pullout by twitter without preparing the allies or framing the public explanations left even some of the presidents strongest supporters in washington unnerved i dont think leader mcconnell or anyone else wants to take the wheel from the president or even give him rudder direction  said frederic c  hof  a former state department official who worked on syria and is now diplomat in residence at bard college  they want to be sure hes at the helm and he knows he has a crew  they want real deliberation to take place on these tough issues  they want the president to be part of it the administration has yet to even agree with itself on the state of affairs in syria  at first  mr  trump declared the islamic state defeated  then said it was not but could be finished off by others patrick m  shanahan  the acting defense secretary who took over for mr  mattis  predicted on tuesday that the terrorist group would lose its final stronghold in syria by next month  ninety nine point five percent plus of the isis controlled territory has been returned to the syrians  he said  within a couple of weeks  itll be 100 percent mr  mcconnell seemed less than convinced  in a speech introducing his measure on tuesday  he took on mr  trumps approach to the middle east  simply put  while it is tempting to retreat to the comfort and security of our shores  there is still a great deal of work to be done  he said  and we do know that left untended  these conflicts will reverberate in our own cities while not mentioning mr  trump by name  mr  mcconnell directly rebutted the presidents argument about the limits of american responsibility for patrolling the globe  we are not the worlds policeman  the senator said  but we are the leader of the free world  and it is incumbent upon the united states to lead the white house declined to comment on tuesday  mr  mcconnell attached the amendment to a bill intended to extend aid to israel and offer protections to state and local governments that refuse to do business with companies that boycott israel  the senate advanced the main bill on tuesday on a 76 to 22 vote  with all the negative votes coming from democrats about a half dozen announced or possible democratic presidential candidates voted against the bill  defying their party leaders  who favored it  just one of the potential candidates  senator amy klobuchar of minnesota  voted for it mr  mcconnells decision to offer his measure on syria and afghanistan  which has no binding force  was notable in part because he has sought to avoid open rifts with the president  unlike current or former republican senators like jeff flake of arizona or mitt romney of utah  mr  mcconnell rarely speaks out against mr  trump  preferring to keep focused on mutual priorities like judicial appointments but from time to time  he has made a point of staking out the more traditional republican position  look  senator mcconnell has a different worldview than the president does  said antonia ferrier  a former adviser  hes a national security hawk who believes american strength in the world is critical its pretty clear  she added  he wanted to send a message to both our enemies and our allies with this amendment that many in america continue to view isis and al qaeda as a threat in syria and afghanistan and pretty clearly a message to the white house as well .
good morning  the u s  government shutdown starts to bite  president trumps national security adviser tries to reverse engineer the syria withdrawal  and poland cracks down on escape rooms  heres the latest  the partial u s  government shutdown  now the second longest in history  is like sand in americas gears  impact  secret service agents  who are working without pay  told us that there is growing agitation in their ranks  the president they protect said on twitter last week that most of the workers not getting paid are democrats  but federal prison workers in the deeply republican florida panhandle  already bedraggled by hurricane michael  are among the 800 000 federal workers affected  were tired of being put in the middle  one said a near standstill at the securities and exchange commission is just one of the governments many stoppages of major functions  with more looming  some economists on wall street are predicting the shutdown will measurably reduce growth  whats next  president trump is set to deliver a prime time address about the shutdown on tuesday night and plans to travel to the border later in the week in an effort to persuade americans of the need for a wall  behind the scenes  dueling democratic and republican prayers at weekend negotiations over the shutdown underlined the dramatic stalemate that lawmakers find themselves in over mr  trumps demand for border wall funding  the national security council staff had zero role in brokering a debate over americas future in syria  officials told us  so when president trump announced that the u s  would be withdrawing its 2 000 troops from syria  the national security adviser  john bolton  had to play catch up  on sunday  he effectively adjusted mr  trumps course  laying down conditions for a withdrawal that could greatly extend troops time in syria takeaway  officials say that mr  boltons disdain for internal policy debates helped create the conditions that led to mr  trumps abrupt move analysis  bolton is trying to salvage the situation  but hes unable to do so  because everyone in the region will question whether he is speaking for himself or for the president  said martin indyk  a former american ambassador to israel now at the council on foreign relations in opinion  president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey praises mr  trumps decision to withdraw  saying his country can shoulder the heavy burden of fighting the islamic state five 15 year old girls died last week in koszalin  poland  when a fire broke out in a building that had been converted into so called escape rooms  a popular form of entertainment in which groups have to follow clues and solve puzzles to find their way out  a preliminary investigation has revealed that the house failed to meet the most basic safety precautions  officials say  the operator of the room was arrested  aftermath  there are now doubts about the safety of the thousands of such entertainment sites across eastern europe  the

washington  president trump was walking through the capitol corridors in february  en route to his state of the union address  when he spied mitch mcconnell  the taciturn senate majority leader  and rumbled over to deliver his signature verbal high five mitch  mr  trump said in a voice loud enough to be heard by a republican aide pinned against a nearby wall  i just saw you on fox  you were totally great with martha maccallum  he added  referring to a prespeech tv appearance in which he denounced the shutdown mr  trump initiated against his advice mr  mcconnell  of kentucky  who grumbled in private about mr  trumps decision  managed a laugh  the senator  allergic to public glad handing  would have preferred a more substantive interaction  he had spent much of that week urging mr  trump  unsuccessfully  to abandon his plan to declare a national emergency at the border with mexico to secure wall funds that congress had denied him but the exchange captured the essence of an awkward  compulsory yet increasingly close working relationship between two men divided by temperament but krazy glued together by shared self interest  over the last six months  necessity has cast mr  mcconnell into a new role  as one of the presidents most important counselors  upping the pace and intensity of his one on one interactions  nowadays  he speaks with mr  trump nearly every day and far more frequently during times of crisis  according to interviews with two dozen lawmakers  white house aides and administration officials the president talks to the leader a lot  and vice versa  said senator richard c  shelby  republican of alabama seeking little credit  and getting even less  mr  mcconnell has expedited virtually everything mr  trump has asked of him since 2017  rolling back obama era regulations  ramming through a giant tax cut that has driven up an already high budget deficit and playing wingman to the white house on contentious nominations  even those he had questioned  like brett m  kavanaugh for the supreme court but critics say mr  mcconnells acquiescence  he even strong armed senate rule changes to ease the presidents nominations to confirmation  has only encouraged mr  trump to go further out of the mainstream  while other republicans have openly questioned mr  trumps intention to nominate a former pizza magnate  herman cain  and a conservative commentator  stephen moore  to the federal reserve board  mr  mcconnell has held his tongue  he has scarcely mentioned last weeks jarring shake up at the department of homeland security and congress has left for a two week spring recess without passing a popular and much in demand disaster relief bill  in large part because mr  mcconnell does not want to provoke mr  trump by adding money for puerto rico that democrats are demanding but the president is refusing mr  mcconnell  speaking in his office last week  promoted his collaboration with the white house on nominations and tax reform but pushed back when asked if mr  trumps unpredictable behavior had hijacked his legacy my legacy is shaped by how i handle myself and what i do  he said  he sends up the nominees and signs the bills democrats disagree  anyone that deals with the president is part of the trump message  said former senator harry reid  a nevada democrat who was majority leader  when asked about mr  mcconnell during a phone interview on saturday  its not anything you want to define who you are  you know  by virtue of donald trump  but they are stuck with him  its too bad mr  mcconnell has been willing to express his opinions to the president in private  he vehemently opposed the emergency declaration at the border  continues to noodge him on tariffs and trade  counseled the president not to appoint ryan zinke as interior secretary  pushed him not to withdraw troops from syria and has  from time to time  even urged him to cool it on twitter i think senator mcconnell is not hesitant to give his advice  and the president appears to be increasingly willing to listen to that advice  said senator roy blunt  republican of missouri sean spicer  mr  trumps first press secretary  added  i think the president has come around to the idea that mitch is as good at his job as he is at real estate the two men are not personally close  but the leader has always had an open line to the president  until recently  mr  mcconnell preferred to discuss granular details with intermediaries  especially former defense secretary jim mattis and the former white house counsel donald f  mcgahn ii two factors have made that approach less attractive  the arrival of mick mulvaney  a former freedom caucus hard liner in the house  as acting white house chief of staff and the diminished clout of vice president mike pence as a dealmaker in closed door meetings with negotiators during the longest government shutdown in the nations history  mr  pence  with mr  trumps blessing  offered a compromise to reopen the government that would have provided about half of the  5 7 billion that mr  trump had publicly demanded  mr  trump shot it down soon after  mr  mcconnell told one fellow republican senator that mr  pence  while well intentioned  could not be entirely relied upon as a negotiator who spoke for the president david popp  a spokesman for the majority leader  said it was unfair and untrue to say mr  mcconnell had lost faith in the vice president but mr  mcconnell has told allies he is convinced that the only way to sway mr  trump is one on one  preferably with no one else in the room  since leaks appear inevitable when mr  trump summons aides and relatives to his oval office free for alls during the february debate over the border wall  mr  mcconnell took it one step further  requesting an early morning meeting with mr  trump in the white house residence  according to a person later briefed on the meeting cozying up to mr  trump does not come naturally to mr  mcconnell  who has a sly  sometimes self lacerating  sense of humor  mr  trump surrounds himself with self aggrandizing magazine covers  by contrast  mr  mcconnells office in louisville is decorated with political cartoons depicting him as  among other things  a turtle senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina  who has courted mr  trump relentlessly  has stepped in with some advice for mr  mcconnell your biggest problem is that he thinks you only call him with bad news  mr  graham told the leader recently  according to a senator who was present for the exchange  you got to keep positive  get in fast and get out fast mr  mcconnell prefers more businesslike interactions  on health care  he was direct  he called mr  trump to deliver a verdict  no way would he go along with a new effort to repeal the health law i told him that this was not going to be on the agenda  mr  mcconnell informed senators week at a recent tuesday lunch other times  mr  mcconnell sends his message more by what he does not do than what he does  the presidents emergency declaration was a flagrant violation of congresss constitutional prerogative to control the federal purse strings  an issue dear to the majority leader  a longtime member of the appropriations committee  since mr  mcconnell had used the declaration as a way to reopen the government  he could hardly vote to overturn it but he did almost nothing to stem the defection of a dozen republicans  an embarrassing rebuke  before the vote  he instructed members to vote your politics  freeing them to do whatever they pleased mr  trump was infuriated  telling a visitor to mar a lago  the presidents club in palm beach  fla   that he felt let down by mr  mcconnell none of this impresses democrats  neither mr  mcconnell nor mr  trump has proposed a serious policy agenda for the next year  they say  apart from changing procedural rules in the senate to keep the conveyor belt of trump judicial and subcabinet appointments humming when democrats were in the majority  we had a positive legislative agenda that would help the middle class in this country  said senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  the senate republican agenda for the last two years has been to do whatever donald trump tweeted that morning mr  mcconnells approach is rooted in his personal political realities  he cannot afford to have the president  whose support with the partys base remains solid  turn on him he is also up for re election next year  in a state enthralled with mr  trump mr  trump has mostly spared mr  mcconnell the scorching disdain he had for former speaker paul d  ryan  who had criticized mr  trumps personal behavior  the president has told people that he considered mr  mcconnell stiff and boring  but that is about it the obvious differences between mr  trump and mr  mcconnell obscure equally obvious similarities  both are obsessed with winning  both are transactional  both have a highly attuned sense of self preservation  both are obsessed with getting re elected another tie that binds  mr  mcconnells wife  elaine chao  is his transportation secretary  the leader has been unapologetic about leveraging that connection to bring increased funding to kentucky but managing mr  trump with mr  mulvaney in the presidents ear is challenging  mr  mulvaney goaded mr  trump into forcing the government shutdown in december  then tried to blow up the final deal to reopen it  mr  mulvaney  among others  helped sell the president on a short lived effort to press congressional republicans to try again to repeal and replace the affordable care act while mr  mcconnell does not interact with mr  mulvaney much  he did reach out to him last year  when mr  mulvaney was running the white house budget office  to ask that the president request  400 million for a new department of veterans affairs hospital in louisville  according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversation mr  mulvaney said yes .
 want to get this briefing by email  heres the sign up  good morning  the u s  partial government shutdown is over  for now   venezuela faces an international ultimatum  and the afghan war could be near its end  heres the latest  president trump temporarily reopened the government  but the clock is ticking  he warned that he was ready to shut down parts of the government again or bypass congress altogether if republicans and democrats cant agree on funding for a border wall by feb  15  the question in the meantime is whether the divided government can produce any results on the same day the president bowed to pressure  the special counsel indicted a decades long adviser of his  roger stone  and revealed the most direct link yet between the trump campaign and wikileaks effort to release hacked democratic party emails details  heres a profile of mr  stone  an eccentric nixon apostle and self described dirty trickster and an explanation of what his indictment means  and here is a visual representation of the trump campaigns extensive contacts with russian nationals and wikileaks  analysis  the shutdown and the stone indictment may have hurt the presidents leverage  according to some estimates  the american economy lost at least  6 billion during the 35 day stalemate  and mr  trumps poll numbers were down  stirring concerns among republican leaders about his ability to navigate the next two years european countries including britain  france  germany  the netherlands and spain urged president nicols maduro to schedule new elections within eight days if mr  maduro doesnt commit to fresh elections  the european governments say they will recognize the opposition leader  juan guaid  as interim president analysis  the ultimatum presents a new layer of uncertainty in a deepening crisis  mr  guaid has urged protesters to keep the pressure on the government if they dare to kidnap me mr  maduro  appearing to be striking a conciliatory tone  backed down from demanding that all american diplomats leave the country  over the past year  the trump administration has embarked on a global campaign to pressure allies to prevent huawei and other chinese companies from helping build out 5g networks the u s  has suggested to poland that future deployments of american troops could hinge on whether the country works with huawei  and in germany  american officials warned that working with huawei could pose a security risk to nato why  the u s  believes that whoever controls the high speed 5g internet networks will have an economic  military and intelligence edge for much of this century  the trump administration therefore calculates that beijing  and companies perceived to be working for the chinese government  must be shut out whats next  the u s  campaign may complicate the round of trade talks with china that begin in washington this week  particularly as beijing seeks to free huaweis chief financial officer  meng wanzhou  who was arrested in canada at americas request the u s  and the taliban wrapped up six days of negotiations to end the 17 year conflict in afghanistan  both sides reported progress  a first in nine years of intermittent peace efforts details  though much remains to be ironed out  the deal would kick off a phased withdrawal of american troops in exchange for a taliban cease fire  the taliban would also have to pledge not to allow international terrorist groups to use afghanistan as a planning hub  how the taliban would share power with the afghan government remains to be resolved caution  most observers dont believe afghan forces can stand up against the taliban without american support fear  the idea of a u s  troop withdrawal worries afghan women  who fear that their rights will be taken away   the toll  the wars toll has been immense  at least 62 000 afghan military and police officers have been killed  along with possibly as many taliban  and more than 24 000 afghan civilians over the last decade

washington  senator shelley moore capito  republican of west virginia  spent the last two weeks hammering out a deal on federal spending and border security with colleagues from both parties  reassured by a sense that congress was finally asserting itself as a civil  stabilizing force the feeling did not last  on friday  president trump mounted one of the most serious executive branch challenges to congressional authority in decades  circumventing congress with an emergency declaration  it would allow him to unilaterally divert billions of dollars to a border wall and presented his republican allies on capitol hill  who labored on a legislative compromise  with the excruciating choice of either defending their institution or bowing to his whims the presidents move left senate republicans sharply divided  and it remains to be seen whether they will act collectively to try to stop mr  trump or how far into uncharted territory they are willing to follow a headstrong president operating with no road map beyond his own demands with him you always have to expect the unexpected  said ms  capito  speaking on the phone from her kitchen in charleston  w va   exhausted from a week of late night talks at the capitol the republican resistance to mr  trumps emergency declaration was much more pronounced in the senate than in the house  where a few republicans  in the minority but more closely aligned to mr  trump  groused  but most of the conservative rank and file embraced it after threatening to kill the spending compromise needed to keep the government open  mr  trump opted to cite a national emergency to pry loose additional funding to build a wall longer than the 55 miles in the bipartisan agreement  it was the divisive step that senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  ms  capito and most other republicans in the senate had forcefully urged him not to take  because it would establish a precedent they feared future democratic presidents would use against them the decision left mr  mcconnell  a professed guardian of the senates prerogatives and power  joining with mr  trump in supporting an executive branch end run greater than any of the incursions into the legislative process he often accused president obama of pursuing  fellow senators said mr  mcconnell  a former member of the appropriations committee  was unhappy with the declaration but saw it as the only way to pass the spending bill some top republicans  led by mr  mcconnell  pivoted quickly to say they supported the presidents action because it was the only option left to him after congress failed to meet his demands for wall funding  mr  mcconnell has even begun offering the president strategic advice on how best to push his plan  aides said but mr  mcconnell is also warning mr  trump of the damage it could inflict on the party heading into the 2020 elections  other republicans portrayed it as a gross violation of the constitutional separation of powers  a blatant disregard by the president for congresss fundamental role in determining how federal dollars are spent he is usurping congressional authority  senator susan collins of maine  a veteran member of the appropriations committee  said in an interview  if the president can reallocate for his purposes billions of dollars in federal funding that congress has approved for specific purposes and have been signed into law  that has the potential to render the appropriations process meaningless several other senate republicans publicly and privately joined ms  collins in describing the move as a flagrant breach of congressional jurisdiction and a dangerous precedent  their numbers raised the clear possibility that enough republican defectors could join with senate democrats to provide a majority to disapprove of the presidents decision should the opportunity arise four republicans might be enough to join with senate democrats and pass legislation rebuking the president  and leadership aides put the number of potential defectors as high as 10  but the unrest seemed well short of the sort of partywide revolt necessary to override a veto by mr  trump of any legislative attempt to prevent his declaration of an emergency  leaving a legal challenge as the only recourse i would not vote for disapproval  said senator richard c  shelby  republican of alabama and the appropriations committee chairman who led the spending negotiations  hes got the power to defend the country  to defend the borders  to protect the people as commander in chief  i believe the courts would uphold him on this despite reservations about many of the actions taken by mr  trump and the white house over the past two years  most congressional republicans have been reluctant to put too much distance between themselves and the president given his grip on republican voters  many of whom consider the wall a national necessity  mr  trump exerts a powerful hold on his party  and lawmakers are cowed by the belief that opposing him will end in their political destruction still  the emergency declaration was a direct assault on the ability of lawmakers themselves to restrain the president  and it raised expectations that more could balk at what was widely viewed as a serious case of executive overreach somebody is going to have to say enough is enough  said trent lott  the former senate leader from mississippi  who questioned the wisdom of the move even those senators who said they were willing to abide by the presidents decision did so grudgingly  acknowledging that it was a bad way to govern and could have significant consequences i dont see anything that necessarily violates the law  but that is a very different question from whether we should be doing it  said senator mike lee  a conservative republican of utah who is known for his view that congress has handed over too much power to the executive branch we have relinquished power voluntarily because we dont want to make judgment calls that make people angry  so we leave it to the executive  he said  its almost as if congress doesnt want to go through the difficult task of lawmaking representative matt gaetz of florida spoke for many house republicans in praising the presidents action  im proud of our president for boldly declaring he will not allow politics to stand in the way of the united states national security interests  said mr  gaetz  a trump ally democrats were united in their condemnation  accusing mr  trump of claiming a false crisis because he could not win over congress with his argument  they said the president was so desperate to build the wall as a difficult re election campaign loomed that he was willing to shred the constitution to do so this is not how you use national emergencies  said mayor rahm emanuel of chicago  a former white house chief of staff to president barack obama  he is literally creating a constitutional crisis because he has a campaign crisis with republicans controlling both chambers of congress during his first term  mr  trump never had to issue a veto  but that streak could be broken with a democratic led house joining with democrats in the senate and the right number of republicans to support legislation voicing disapproval of the emergency declaration party strategists said a veto could even bolster mr  trump by showing his backers that he was willing to take on congress over his wall and that it was unlikely there would be enough votes to override it  the divide  though  could become a political problem for embattled republican incumbents up for re election next year  like senator cory gardner of colorado  who will face competing calls back home to break with the president or stick with him some republican senators said they were less concerned about the political implications than the effect on congress  members of the appropriations committee said that their spending bills had been carefully constructed and that shifting money could stall projects that both they and federal agencies including the pentagon had deemed necessary  and they fear consolidating too much power in the hands of a president it is inconsistent with the u s  constitution because  after the american revolution against a king  our founders chose not to create a chief executive with the power to tax the people and spend their money any way he chooses  said senator lamar alexander  republican of tennessee this is a fundamental constitutional responsibility of congress  said ms  collins  we should be opposing this strongly there is a small chance that mr  trump will accept a list of existing programs  compiled by mr  alexander  that republicans believe could be used for wall money  rendering the emergency declaration moot  but nobody is holding out much hope that will happen ms  capito said she would spend the holiday weekend weighing what to do next  she encouraged mr  trump to do the same hes got to ask himself  what are the ramifications of what im doing  she said  if the resolution comes from the house to the senate  where are those votes going to fall  what does that do to my momentum  hes got to be considering that  im certain  maybe hes willing to take whatever could happen  maybe thats not bothering him .
tijuana  life in tijuanas largest migrant shelter has begun to take on the familiar rhythms and sounds of a central american neighborhood  early in the morning  adults rise and get ready to go to work  children dress for school  mothers gather huge bundles of dirty clothes for the days wash  vendors hawk coffee we are getting used to this life  said norma prez  40  who left honduras in a migrant caravan bound for the united states about two months ago with her 5 year old son for weeks  they walked from central america up to the mexican border with the united states  fleeing poverty and violence  all along the way  president trump described the migrants as a danger  as invaders trying to crash their way into the united states  but they didnt stop their trek north when they arrived at the border  tijuana was not ready for them  the conditions were deplorable  and the migrants were surprised they would not be able to apply for asylum right away  twice  groups of migrants approached the border fence and were repelled by border patrol agents using tear gas and pepper spray but now  life for many of the new arrivals has settled down mexicos new president  andrs manuel lpez obrador  has begun to make good on promises to create alternatives to immigration  and he has already rolled out a plan to increase wages along the united states mexico border and the migrants themselves have begun to create a sense of community in the shelters here  like the citys largest  known as el barretal  they said they have no intention of turning back mr  trump should personally go to honduras so he can see with his own eyes that we simply cant go back  that there are no jobs  no companies  nothing  ms  prez said so she is settling in at el barretal  a concert venue turned into a shelter where tents are lined up in orderly rows on the clean concrete floor  for the thousands of migrants like her in el barretal and 18 other tijuana shelters  this is home  for now as she waits for her chance to apply for asylum in the united states  ms  prez has decided to apply for a temporary humanitarian visa in mexico  that will let her find a job in tijuana and support herself and her child for as long as necessary  she said rodolfo figueroa  an official with the national immigration institute  a government agency  said most of the migrants who arrived in tijuana with the caravan and who applied for humanitarian visas have been approved  in total  2 200 visas have been awarded in little over a month  he said  about 1 300 migrants have either been deported or voluntarily returned to their home countries  he added early on a typical morning in the el barretal shelter  migrants who already hold a temporary mexican visa head to work at a nearby market as meat and poultry vendors  others make their way to jobs as truck drivers  construction workers or laborers in the citys electronics manufacturing plants the shelters manager  leonardo nery  said the number of people living there had dropped from 3 000 a month ago to around 1 000 as some migrants found their own living arrangements in town  others have crossed over to the united states or returned home  he said around 10 a m   loudspeakers inside el barretal announced that buses sent by the mexican federal government had arrived to take anyone interested in mexican humanitarian visas to an immigration office  the same voice reminded migrants to gather any trash and place it in the available cans around noon on most days  english classes start inside a small white tent with bright blue carpets covering the concrete floor  puzzle pieces are spread on tables  along with drawings and crayons  posters with names of colors hang on the walls darwin bardales  an 18 year old honduran  has been working as a volunteer in the shelters english school it feels good to do something for the others  especially the kids  he said  after all  we are all in the same vulnerable situation the children usually take classes in english and spanish  learning to read  to color and to eat healthy foods  this friday  the classes got a late start  the arrival of donated teddy bears and piatas had the childrens full attention until a female voice boomed from the loudspeaker hello everybody  its your teacher  the voice said  its time for class  kids adult migrants scattered around the camp cheered in response food is cooked and distributed both by private aid groups and by mexican marines twice a day  rice  soup and sandwiches  it is a bare bones existence  but friendships have developed and at least one wedding took place in a downtown shelter early on friday  jos daniel castro  44  was already busy managing what has become the shelters corner shop  where he sells cigarettes  potato candy  soup and other basics around the clock mr  castro left honduras in mid october  now he buys supplies in tijuana every morning  and he earns about  20 a day reselling them  enough to buy his own food  he said  having been deported from the united states three times  he plans to stay in mexico indefinitely  working as a vendor  he said i can work here and make a little money  he said  that is already more than i can say about back home  in the end  all we wanted was to work and help our loved ones back home taracio prez stood nearby holding bottles of soda  hoping for customers we are fighting  and hustling  said mr  prez  who also scrubs floors in a downtown tijuana restaurant  the dream was and is the united states  but it has all become so difficult and dangerous for us that the best thing to do is work while we wait for things to get better their first few days in tijuana last november were chaotic  and a bitter disappointment  migrants said  the trump administration had limited the number of asylum applicants that could be seen in a day  separated parents from their children  sent troops to patrol the frontier  and even  starting last month  shut down the federal government in a bid to get funding for a border wall housed initially in an open air sports complex  the migrants saw a torrential downpour turn the ground to mud around their makeshift tents  children started to get sick and adults grew dispirited but to many  those hardships felt temporary  and less threatening than the conditions they had left at home  and life at el barretal is a definite step up from those first  soaking days elisabeth ponce  38  was putting the last touches on her makeup before she started her days work  she came from honduras and now has a job inside the shelter  handing out toiletries  medicine and other basic supplies she fled honduras  like so many others  fearing for her life after being threatened by criminal gangs  joining the caravan was a drastic decision  it meant leaving behind her four children and venturing outside her country for the first time  knowing she had no one to help her if she ever got to the united states now she knows she may never get the asylum she is

 want to get this briefing by email  heres the sign up   good evening  heres the latest 1  president trump agreed to reopen the federal government for three weeks while negotiations continued over border security  backing down after a monthlong standoff with democrats over funding for his border wall the decision paved the way for congress to pass spending bills as soon as friday  the stopgap measure will restore normal operations at a series of federal agencies until feb  15 and begin paying the 800 000 federal workers who have been furloughed or forced to work for free for 35 days the plan includes no money for the wall and was essentially the same approach mr  trump rejected at the end of december  but he cautioned that the cease fire might be only temporary we really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or steel barrier  mr  trump said in the rose garden  if we dont get a fair deal from congress  the government will either shut down on feb  15  or i will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and constitution of the united states to address this emergency airport delays this morning added to the urgency of a solution  la guardia airport in new york was closed to arriving flights  and a shortage of air traffic controllers triggered significant delays across the northeast      2  the special counsel  robert mueller  revealed the most direct link yet between the parallel efforts of the trump campaign and wikileaks to damage hillary clintons presidential bid in a seven count indictment against roger stone  above  an informal adviser to president trump  the special counsel disclosed evidence that a top campaign official had instructed mr  stone to get information from wikileaks about thousands of hacked democratic emails  that effort began well after it was widely reported that russian intelligence operatives were behind the hack the indictment makes no mention of whether mr  trump played a role  though mr  mueller did leave a curious clue about how high in the campaign the effort reached  a senior campaign official was directed by an unnamed person to contact mr  stone about additional wikileaks releases that might hurt the clinton campaign  according to the court document who is roger stone  anyway  heres what we know about him and his colorful career      3  venezuelas opposition leader made his first public appearance since he declared himself president  and told supporters to keep pressure on the authorities if they dare to kidnap me the rally was peaceful and there was no indication juan guaid would be arrested  as many feared at the same time  president nicols maduro took a more conciliatory approach than before and called for dialogue  the request appeared to signal that the standoff between the government and mr  guaid may be shifting opposition talks with the military may be a factor  venezuelas top brass swore allegiance to mr  maduro  but an opposition lawmaker said her colleagues were holding discreet talks with military leaders in hopes that they could build enough support to get large factions to switch sides      4  jennifer glover was assaulted by her fellow guards at a nuclear site in nevada  she said and instead of responding to her complaints  the government contractor she worked for eventually fired her the encounter followed months of sexual harassment that she said began soon

undergo psychiatric evaluations work went from being so exciting to being a nightmare  she said      5  mark zuckerberg once vowed to keep whatsapp and instagram independent  now hes changing course to keep their users inside facebooks ecosystem facebooks chief executive has mandated that the social networks three messaging services  the third is facebook messenger  be knitted together  the three services will continue operating as stand alone apps  but their underlying messaging infrastructure will be unified the changes also raise questions of data privacy because of how user information may be shared among the services  today  whatsapp allows people to sign up with only a phone number  by contrast  facebook and facebook messenger ask for users real names separately  amazons new facial recognition technology had more difficulty identifying the gender of female and darker skinned faces than similar services from ibm and microsoft      6  can paid parental leave be too much of a good thing the bill and melinda gates foundation is cutting its unusually generous paid leave in half  to six months  because yearlong leaves were impairing its work  it said  it is also adding a  20 000 stipend for new parents to spend on child care costs the gates foundations experience highlights the challenges of devising effective family policies  especially in the u s   the only industrialized country not to offer paid leave on top of questions about whether leave should be mandatory and who should pay for it  there has been little agreement on the right length of time  international evidence points to some answers  around six months seems to be the magic number  and paid leave is not enough  financial assistance for child care has a bigger effect on womens ability to keep working      7  it was nothing but a box of paperwork in 1979  a navy man credited with starting the quirky hawaiian iron man triathlon was reassigned to the mainland  he was looking for someone to run the third edition of the race  and handed off some papers to a couple who said they would do it they went on to make the ironman into an iconic test of endurance and one of the worlds premier sports brands  a chinese conglomerate paid  650 million for it in 2015  above  bikes awaiting their riders at the 2018 ironman world championship triathlon and because of that box  all these years later  the

hi  welcome to on politics  your guide to the day in national politics  im lisa lerer  your host for the first two years of his presidency  it seemed like donald trump could  as he famously put it during his campaign  shoot someone on fifth avenue and not lose his voters republican majorities in the house and the senate negotiated his agenda on capitol hill  the majority leader  mitch mcconnell  and house speaker paul ryan protected him from serious congressional investigations  and passed a sweeping tax bill  the presidents major legislative accomplishment  g o p  lawmakers largely lived in fear of angering the presidents still loyal base if they challenged him times have certainly changed  mr  trump spent the christmas holidays complaining that he was all alone in the white house  now  with the government in the middle of its longest ever shutdown  his state of the union address has been delayed indefinitely  even his g o p  armor shows some tiny cracks  with a half dozen republican senators voting on thursday afternoon in favor of a democratic proposal to reopen the government so far  divided government hasnt been a good look for mr  trump  and a batch of new polls released over the past few days tells a pretty unflattering story for him  his approval rating is at an all time low  36 percent in a cbs news poll  40 percent in a politico morning consult poll and 34 percent in an associated press norc center for public affairs research poll  perhaps  most importantly  his sales pitch on the border wall hasnt succeeded  only 22 percent of american voters  including 40 percent of republicans and 15 percent of independents  consider the situation along the southern border an emergency  according to a fox news poll  only about a third agreed that the wall would make the country safer  according to the a p  poll  not even a majority of republicans supported mr  trumps argument that a wall would reduce the availability of illegal drugs in the united states  the poll showed  the cbs news poll showed that seventy one percent of americans  including 43 percent of republicans  do not believe the wall is worth the federal shutdown  two thirds of respondents want him to agree to a budget without wall funding and 60 percent see the shutdown as causing serious problems for the country  according to the poll its unclear whether these numbers will sway the president  who spent the morning tweeting out his case for the wall  he has a history of focusing on the polling numbers that reinforce what he wants to see and discrediting the rest as fake news  and while proposals float around the white house for a big deal on immigration  there are certainly some in his administration who still believe democrats will cave on the wall but the economic pain of the shutdown is real  and spreading  theres a little bit of noise about a primary challenge to mr  trump  a rumbling that grew slightly louder last week after gov  larry hogan  a maryland republican  used his inaugural address to raise the specter of impeachment  and while shutdowns dont generally decide elections  democrats see an opportunity to undermine the presidents image as a master deal maker  a key piece of his political identity  ahead of 2020 keep in mind  this is all happening before the special counsel  robert s  mueller  delivers his findings on the trump campaigns dealings with russia  depending what that investigation reveals  mr  trump could be in for a chilly spring                     drop us a line we want to hear from our readers  have a question  well try to answer it  have a comment  were all ears  email us at onpolitics nytimes com                     here at on politics we spend a lot of time writing about the betos  bidens  warrens and sanders of the political world  the early possible stars of the 2020 democratic primary cycle  but it takes a crowd to create a crowded field  below those boldfaced names lurks a whole other world of presidential politics we spoke to two men yesterday  pete buttigieg and former representative john delaney  who are definitely long shots but are hoping to have their moment on the national stage they are probably little known beyond the world of political junkies  neither man is listed in early voting polls or has expansive lists of supporters  but both see little downside in taking their shot to become the leader of the free world a broad field  a wide open field thats a good thing for newcomers  said mr  buttigieg wednesday was a big day for mr  buttigieg  the mayor of south bend  ind   who announced his presidential exploratory committee at a hyatt hotel in washington  d c  the location was telling  it was chosen because it would be close to the offices of political reporters and on the sidelines of a conference for american mayors the youngest and only gay candidate in the race  mr  buttigieg  37  believes his economic record in south bend  his youth and his military service give him an edge in a crowded field im the only one who is living a middle class lifestyle in middle america  he told reporters  i get the odds but i also believe we can do something that no one else can do mr  buttigieg cast his underdog status as an advantage  saying it would allow him to be bold  though he didnt introduce any new plans during his announcement  his last moment on the national stage  a bid for the chairmanship of the democratic national committee in 2017 that ended with mr  buttigieg dropping out of the race shortly before voting some of the questions he fielded this time around  what makes him unique  how does he stand out in a packed race  and how do you pronounce his name mr  buttigiegs official twitter feed offered this pronunciation  boot edge edge  his husband  chasten buttigieg  offered some other options mr  delaney  meanwhile  has been running for president for more than 18 months  after announcing his bid in an op ed in the summer of 2017  almost three and half years before the election  the former maryland congressman told on politics that he thinks hes gaining traction in the race  citing his 20 visits to iowa and his six campaign offices in the state his pitch  he can bring americans together because hes someone whos not ashamed to say im more moderate  that might be a tough sell in a party thats tilted left  both on policy and tactics  during the trump era still  mr  delaney sees a way to win  the fact that hes able to self fund some of his campaign makes it easier  too i think i break out on the ground in iowa  he said  as people start

no sooner had the news of an impasse come out of a meeting room in washington than thousands of miles away  on an island in the pacific  tomas kaselionis had to start making decisions for me  its do i consider a car payment or do i pay the gas bill or the phone bill  said mr  kaselionis  who is working on typhoon recovery for the federal emergency management agency  unpaid and far from home in the united states commonwealth of the northern mariana islands  those are conversations within the next week that i have to have with my wife by saturday  the federal government will have been shut down for two weeks  a full pay cycle for federal workers  if the shutdown lasts through monday  it will surpass the one of 2013  and if it lasts beyond the following saturday  it will be the longest shutdown in united states history  politicians have said they were hopeful that the standoff could be over in a matter of days and weeks  a reassurance that rang hollow to hundreds of thousands of federal workers who were not getting paid  read more  what is and is not affected by the federal government shutdown  they have to realize that this affects everyday people  said ray coleman jr   a corrections officer who teaches g e d  classes at a federal prison in florida and is president of his local union  it affects the boots on the ground  to me  its like a political chess game that theyre playing  and we seem to be pawns by thursday  fallout from the shutdown was spreading fast  the chairman of the federal communications commission announced on twitter that the agency would suspend most operations federal court proceedings  to the irritation of judges  slowed as government lawyers asked for stays  the justice department asked to delay a hearing on a suit brought by the n a a c p  over the trump administrations census preparations  and a much anticipated e p a  hearing on lead contamination in east chicago  ind   was canceled all the while  claims for unemployment benefits were piling up  the district of columbia said it had received about 900 claims connected to the shutdown  and the state of maryland counted 637 at midweek  more than 350 federal workers in colorado had filed unemployment claims daniel a  sobien  a meteorologist with the national weather service in tampa  fla   who has been furloughed and is living on savings  said that federal workers are tired of being political pawns i realize that unfair things happen to people all the time  he said  but it really is unfair that because of politics  government employees have to shoulder the burden the impasse may be centered within a few blocks in washington  d c   but the federal work force shouldering the burden is spread across the country  fewer than one in five federal workers are in the washington statistical area  among the 800 000 federal workers affected are people with doctorates earning  100 000 a year and those making a quarter of that  workers in labs and workers in prisons  people who clean up majestic national parks and people who clean up cramped offices in the early morning hours among these workers  there was a widely shared sentiment of frustration  even disgust  that the people in charge seemed to lack concern for the people who actually keep the government working its indefensible to not appreciate the role and responsibility that there is to make sure the government runs smoothly  said a  ashley tabaddor  a federal immigration judge in los angeles and president of the national association of immigration judges  who is currently on furlough brian turner  an officer with the transportation security administration at the philadelphia airport  said he has for six years enjoyed being the last line of defense for people getting on airplanes  he endured a 16 day shutdown in 2013  but at the time did not have a house or a family  and the politics back then  as fierce as they were  just seemed more predictable  he said i love working for the country  he said  but  he added  i cant go two months without a paycheck about 420 000 of the workers affected are classified as essential and have been working without knowing when they will next be paid  about 380 000 federal workers have been furloughed  unions and federal agencies have not provided demographic information about the workers affected  but have said that the group is generally similar to the broader federal work force  some 2 1 million nonmilitary workers the work force is spread out nationally  with thousands of federal employees in every state  tens of thousands in states like georgia  pennsylvania and oklahoma  and the highest percentage in california  according to officials at unions which represent federal employees  the shutdown seemed to be affecting workers outside of the washington  d c  area most severely less populated areas may be hit disproportionately hard  including small towns such as pollock  la   where the biggest employer is a federal penitentiary our members get an average take home pay of  500 a week  and next week they arent going to get that  said j  david cox sr   president of the american federation of government employees  which represents about 40 000 bureau of prisons employees who have been furloughed in the shutdown  the places that are getting slammed are the ones  like pollock  that you cant find with a gps in addition to the federal workers  thousands of people who work for contractors  cleaning offices or serving food  are missing wages  but are not considered in proposed legislation that promises back pay once a deal is worked out just to think about it  its so frightening  said donna kelly  a contracted security guard who works  or did work  before the museums closed on wednesday  at the smithsonian institution  she had applied for unemployment benefits  but was still waiting for her application to be processed  i really dont know what ill do until im actually feeling the pressure nearly all of those affected  the contractors  furloughed employees and employees who were working without pay  were experiencing a growing  gnawing anxiety  they were keeping track of the news  mr  trumps demands for a border wall  the daily shifts over terms of an imaginable deal  the vows by democrats and republicans not to budge  but many said they were doing so simply to find out if they could pay mortgages  plan vacations or take care of car payments i dont think anybody who works for the government is worried about if this wall gets built or not  said la shanda palmer  a t s a  employee in philadelphia  they want to go back to work  she was concerned about paying her bills and racking up late fees  and providing for her family  she said she called her utility company hoping for an accommodation  she did not get a break right now  the stress level is at 1 000  said kutonya king  a correctional counselor at the federal prison in jesup  ga  like other corrections officers  ms  king said she was concerned about the safety of the inmates and of her fellow workers  who will have more and more to occupy their minds if the shutdown drags on  an officer at another prison wondered how many of her colleagues would end up staying home because they could not afford gas still  ms  king said some inmates had offered sympathy  that seemed to be more than workers were hearing from washington i dont particularly blame a particular party  i think its across the board  ms  king said  they need to think about the people ms  king has been making plans in case the shutdown lasts the promised days and weeks  having already canceled a long planned family trip for the holidays  she may need that money to pay bills  she said later on thursday afternoon  back in washington  a key republican senator suggested to reporters a new possible timeline for the shutdown  months and months .

house on thursday  president trump invited congressional leaders from both parties to a gathering in the situation room billed as a border security briefing the meeting yielded no agreement  it only served to highlight the gulf between the president  who has dug in on his demand for congress to fund a border wall  his signature campaign promise  and democrats  who have refused to do so earlier  mr  trump rejected a plan that vice president mike pence privately floated to democrats last month  saying  2 5 billion for border security  rather than the  5 6 billion that the president has requested  was insufficient  he also rejected a compromise that would pair money for a wall with legislation to protect young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children  above  at a

it was a case study in mixed messaging  on a thursday in early january  border patrol union leaders appeared at a news briefing with president trump  backing the shutdown and his plan for a wall on the southern border  a week later  employees of the transportation security administration protested the shutdown outside hartsfield jackson atlanta international airport adding to the dissonance was this inconvenient detail  both groups of workers are represented by the same umbrella organization  the american federation of government employees  whose leadership has the unpleasant task of finessing their irreconcilable views there are some members at the border patrol that support the wall even if it means they have to go without pay  and we respect that  said david borer  the federations general counsel  but there are many thousands more government employees for whom the paycheck is the first and only issue at a time when 800 000 federal employees  largely unionized  are going without pay  they might be expected to speak with one voice  in fact  the stress of the situation is highlighting differences in both tactics and philosophy the federation  by far the biggest union of government workers  represents 700 000 employees in more than three dozen agencies  from the coast guard to the census bureau  it has been a hefty contributor to democratic candidates and causes  but some groups within the organization  representing border patrol agents and immigration officers  endorsed mr  trump the contrasting approaches complicate efforts to influence a dispute in which the ultimate weapon  the right to strike  is denied by law  and other traditional sources of leverage  like political lobbying  are less useful than usual beyond being unable to strike  a vast majority of federal workers are forbidden to collectively bargain over wages and benefits  which are set by congress  the unions that represent them bargain over work rules and working conditions  like safety measures or whether they can telecommute  and due process rights for workers who have been disciplined or fired but just because the unions cant bargain over pay and benefits doesnt mean they exert no influence on these questions  the unions maintain close relationships with powerful members of congress  stemming in part from political spending the american federation of government employees spent over  5 million in the 2016 campaign cycle  between contributions to candidates and super pac expenditures that paid for ads and turnout efforts  nearly 90 percent of the contributions went to democratic candidates many members of congress  especially in less populated areas  are also aware that federal employees are among their largest blocs of voters on a trip to washington this month  eric young  president of the federations labor council representing 30 000 federal prison workers  met with the senates democratic caucus  mr  young said his members  many of them military veterans  were nearing their breaking point after working for weeks without pay  he has met with the staffs of several swing republicans  like senators cory gardner of colorado and lisa murkowski of alaska  to tell them that he would hold lawmakers responsible if the shutdown resulted in death or injury for any of his members they will absolutely have blood on their hands  mr  young said in an interview  when people are distracted by trying to pay their bills  they may take their eyes off an inmate theyre supposed to be supervising as he was making the rounds in the capitol  his members were picketing the office of senator mitch mcconnell  the majority leader  in lexington  ky  and this week the prison workers council erected billboards across the state  home to five federal prisons  saying the shutdown is hurting law enforcement and putting the onus on mr  mcconnell to end it historically  the combination of this inside game and grass roots pressure gave the unions sway in washington  last year  after mr  trump proposed freezing federal pay  the unions used their influence in the senate to help pass the nearly 2 percent pay increase they sought  by a 92 to 6 margin   the president later issued an executive order blocking the increase  which congress is likely to seek to overturn whenever it passes legislation to fund the rest of the government  the shutdown is putting that model to the test  most senate republicans  however sympathetic they may be privately  have so far resisted the appeals of union officials  deferring to the president on a fight he says is central to his re election  and the raw emotion of the shutdown is fraying some labor unions that are typically united on matters that affect their personal bottom lines the border patrol  whose leadership has been most outspoken about backing mr  trump  employs a tiny fraction of the hundreds of thousands of workers affected by the impasse in washington  but the tensions are being felt more broadly john kostelnik  the head of the union local that represents about 850 workers at a federal prison in victorville  calif   said the border wall and the shutdown had become divisive topics at his workplace  where political discussions are normally rare its created a political environment within the prison  which is the last thing you want when our brothers and sisters are trying to protect themselves  said mr  kostelnik  who estimates that his members split fairly evenly between mr  trump and hillary clinton in 2016  its to the point where people are arguing with one another in a poll of 1 228 federal employees in mid january by govexec com  most opposed the wall  but a surprising chunk  21 percent  said they supported the shutdown even without the right to strike  workers could use other forms of pressure to end the stalemate  say  a work slowdown by air traffic controllers and airport security personnel to throttle air travel if this were done in certain key locations  choke points  it would have a big effect  said joseph a  mccartin  a labor historian at georgetown university yet that does not appear to be in the cards  there is no shortage of bright ideas about how we should slow the system down  said trish gilbert  the executive vice president of the national air traffic controllers association  a union representing nearly 20 000 workers  but thats something we will never ever do lurking in the background is the pervasive fear of repeating history  in 1981  when air traffic controllers began an unlawful strike  president ronald reagan fired almost all of them  over 11 000  and barred them from ever being rehired  the episode traumatized the labor movement for decades in addition  many of the agencies ordered to work through the shutdown are staffed by career civil servants or military veterans  the latter make up about 30 percent of the federal work force  who are conservative by disposition its not in the workplace culture of most federal workers to be rebels  mr  mccartin said  they work within large organizations  it only works if the rules are respected or as lorie mccann  head of the national treasury employees union chapter that represents internal revenue service workers in the chicago area  put it  were kind of by the book people still  union leaders said that beyond a certain point  many federal employees would no longer be able to afford to work without pay  especially those who have large work related outlays  like child care and gas i think its going to eventually occur in the sense that people are not going to be able to get to work  they cant afford to get to work  said mr  young  the prison union leader today  airport screeners for the transportation security administration are among the lowest paid federal workers  earning an average of about  35 000 a year a growing number of t s a  workers are already calling in sick  one in 10 did not report to work on sunday  often citing financial limitations  the agency said  if absenteeism remains high  it will add stress to an already strained industry and other parts of the labor movement could also play a role  sara nelson  the president of the association of flight attendants  said her union was watching closely to see whether the furlough or potential attrition began to seriously jeopardize safety if the system is unsafe  our members do not have to go to work  ms  nelson said  if the shutdown continues  our aviation network will unravel  and ultimately the entire system will come to a screeching halt .

latest  a day after an opposition leader proclaimed himself the countrys rightful president  the military declared its loyalty to president nicols maduro  deepening the political crisis details  the trump administration recognized the opposition leader  juan guaid  as the legitimate leader of venezuela  and secretary of state mike pompeo called on nations across the americas to do the same   several  including canada and denmark  already have  mr  maduro  in turn  cut ties with the u s  and ordered american diplomats to leave venezuela  but the u s  said it would not heed the order

the country  20 million in aid  but with the military standing by mr  maduro  an analyst told us  commanders appear to have concluded mr  maduro has the upper hand for now lawmakers voted against two

government reopens go deeper  aviation workers unions warned that the shutdown presented an unconscionable safety threat for air travel  and nearly six weeks in  the shutdown is eroding the good will

genetically edited babies  scientists are trying to devise international standards that would prevent such experiments in the future while most researchers agree that major health and science institutions should act quickly  they differ on the best approach background  some u s  researchers said dr  he told them beforehand about his experiment  in which he disabled a gene in the embryos that allows a person to become infected by h i v   but they were unable to stop him  in part because chinas system is so complex that the scientists didnt know who to alert  a global system would ideally eliminate that problem why it matters  scientists fear that genetically edited babies could develop unknown health problems that could be inherited by subsequent generations  they also worry about attempts to alter genes for physical features  intelligence or athletic prowess whats next  the world health organization is assembling a panel to create global standards and the world economic

washington  america will get its first taste of divided government under president trump this week when a democratic house tries to wrest control of the political agenda from mr  trump  who appears determined to keep the focus on border security  immigration and his big  beautiful wall after the midterm elections ushered in the most diverse freshman class in history  house democrats intend to put a spotlight on the issues that worked well for them during the campaign  diminishing the influence of the wealthy and connected  expanding voting rights  lowering prescription drug costs and passing a bipartisan infrastructure bill mr  trump  on the defensive and presiding over a federal government that remains partially closed  is trying to stomp on that message  on tuesday  as the government shutdown was in its 11th day  mr  trump invited congressional leaders of both parties to a briefing on border security wednesday afternoon  sarah huckabee sanders  the white house press secretary  said on tuesday night that mr  trump would attend it would be the first visit by democratic leaders to the white house since dec  11  when the president told representative nancy pelosi and senator chuck schumer he would be proud to shut down the government for border security mr  trump appeared to make a gesture of peace ahead of wednesdays meeting border security and the wall thing and shutdown is not where nancy pelosi wanted to start her tenure as speaker  he said tuesday on twitter  lets make a deal just what deal mr  trump had in mind was not clear  while ms  pelosi has repeatedly signaled she would like to find a compromise that would allow the government to reopen  she has also made it clear that a wall cannot be part of any such deal  whether or not that leads to a messy start to her speakership after she is elected speaker on thursday  she hopes to introduce a transparency in governing measure to portray democrats as a responsible governing party and draw a contrast between them and mr  trumps scandal ridden administration  the measure would require disclosure of shadowy political donors  end gerrymandering of congressional districts and expand voting rights but their first order of business will be reopening the government  as ms  pelosi said tuesday on twitter in response to mr  trump the president has given democrats a great opportunity to show how we will govern responsibly   quickly pass our plan to end the irresponsible  trumpshutdown  she said  just the first sign of things to come democrats also intend to use their first months in the majority to push for a bipartisan infrastructure bill and legislation to lower prescription drug costs  issues that they believe will have bipartisan appeal the democrats plan to pass two bills on thursday  the first includes six bipartisan spending measures that would fully fund agencies like the interior department and the internal revenue service through the end of the fiscal year in september  the second would fund the department of homeland security through feb  8  with  1 3 billion for fencing but no money for a wall on the mexican border with the plan facing a shaky future in the senate and an intransigent president  some rank and file lawmakers in both parties are suggesting that a deal to revamp the nations immigration laws  pairing border security and protections for some undocumented immigrants  may be the way out of the stalemate how about comprehensive immigration reform  representative debbie dingell  democrat of michigan  said on cnn on tuesday  when asked how democrats intend to compromise with mr  trump one of mr  trumps closest allies  senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina  has revived his long stalled immigration proposal to marry  5 billion for the wall with immigration law changes that might appeal to democrats  including three year renewable work permits for young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children  known as dreamers mr  trump has raised the prospects of broader talks on twitter  we will be forced to close the southern border entirely if the obstructionist democrats do not give us the money to finish the wall   also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with  he said last week  hard to believe there was a congress   president who would approve mr  trump has also claimed  somewhat misleadingly  that democrats had already voted for a wall im in the oval office  he tweeted on monday  democrats  come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for border security  including the wall  you voted yes in 2006 and 2013 he was referring to the secure fence act of 2006  which authorized building a fence along 700 miles of the southern border  and to a 2013 comprehensive immigration bill  that bill passed the senate with 68 votes but did not make it out of the house  it combined the republican priority of enhanced border security with the democratic goal of offering legalization and a pathway to citizenship for the nations 11 million undocumented immigrants democratic leaders are wary of any immigration negotiations with mr  trump  whom they view as an unreliable partner  representative hakeem jeffries of new york  the new chairman of the house democratic caucus  said in an interview on tuesday that democrats would not again broach immigration before the government is reopened we do have a broken immigration system that needs to be fixed in a sustainable and bipartisan way  mr  jeffries said  however  its impossible to have a mature conversation about comprehensive immigration reform in the midst of a reckless trump shutdown sparked by his desire to build a medieval border wall democrats have not forgotten that a year ago  when they talked to mr  trump about daca  he promised to work with them on a bill of love  only to back away  prompting mr  schumer to declare that negotiating with mr  trump was like negotiating with jell o senator chris van hollen  democrat of maryland  said the challenge lies with the republican majority in the senate if you want to get a bipartisan immigration bill in the coming months  youre going to have to have republican senators willing to work across the aisle to get things done  mr  van hollen said  i dont think they can give president trump the pen to write every word of legislation at the same time  democratic leaders will face pressures of their own  from a freshman class packed with first  and second generation immigrants  latinos and immigrant advocates  house democratic leaders and their staffs have indicated to immigration advocates that they plan to act on legislation to protect immigrants who face an imminent threat of deportation after the shutdown is over  that proposal would grant permanent residence to daca recipients and to others who came under temporary protected status  which mr  trump has also moved to rescind what we want in 2019 is early action on a bill that combines a permanent solution for dreamers and for t p s  holders  said frank sharry  the executive director of americas voice  an immigrant advocacy group democrats have already begun strategizing privately around such a bill  which would most likely pass the house with little to no republican support  but senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the republican leader  has shown little appetite for politically tricky measures that divide republicans or put them at odds with mr  trump  particularly on immigration the issue could expose fissures among democrats as well  liberals are agitating for measures such as abolishing immigration and customs enforcement  the agency that carries out deportations  or killing funding for immigration detention beds and enforcement agents but democratic congressional leaders and many rank and file members  including freshmen elected in districts carried in 2016 by mr  trump  say they are all for border security and enforcement  as long as it is effective and reasonable broader immigration legislation would be nice  if we had a reliable person at the other side of the table to negotiate with  said representative gerald e  connolly  democrat of virginia  i wouldnt be so bold as to predict a magic bullet .

observers say ms  harris  a 54 year old former california attorney general  could bridge generations of the party  both in terms of her age and experience and her positions while shes firmly a product of what she once described as san franciscos hard knocks politics  ms  harris has also tried to align herself with democrats leftward drift  after initially hesitating  she disavowed most corporate donations still  experts have suggested that her toughest criticism will stem from her time as san franciscos district attorney and the states attorney general already  in a stinging op ed piece  a law professor wrote that ms  harris wasnt the progressive prosecutor she claims she was  that prompted a response from a supporter and civil rights advocate who described ms  harris as a voice for the voiceless and vulnerable  when she was a prosecutor in any case  experts think shell try to turn that vulnerability on its head  politico reported  by presenting her law enforcement background as a

 want to get this briefing by email  heres the sign up   good evening  heres the latest 1  senate leaders offered the first glimmers of a potential resolution to the government shutdown  scheduling procedural votes thursday on two competing bills to reopen the government one measure includes funding for president trumps border wall  the other is a short term spending bill that would fund shuttered agencies through feb  8  although neither is likely to pass  the compromise gives each party a chance to press its proposal  and the votes could prompt the two sides to negotiate a bipartisan compromise above  mexican migrants prepare to jump the border fence to get into the u s  in december at the same time  mr  trump and speaker nancy pelosi remained in a private standoff

barring most transgender people from serving in the military the justices voted 5 to 4 to temporarily allow the ban to go into effect while court challenges move forward the policy prohibits people identifying with a gender different from their biological sex from serving in the military  with narrow exceptions  since the ban was announced on twitter by president trump in 2017  it has been challenged in lower courts with mixed success  above  protesters outside of the white house after mr  trumps original announcement the court also agreed to hear a challenge to a new york city gun law that restricts people with a particular kind of gun license from transporting their guns outside of the city  it will be the first second amendment case to go before the court since 2010 and will shed light on the courts approach to gun rights under a newly reliable five member conservative majority      3  a trump administration deal to lift sanctions on companies controlled by a prominent russian oligarch may have freed him from hundreds of millions of dollars in debt  according to a confidential document last month  the administration characterized the move as tough on the oligarch  oleg

suspects genetic code to previously collected samples in 90 minutes  and they allow the police to analyze results themselves  instead of needing outside labs and waiting a month or more but forensic

shaler  pa   this should be an upbeat moment for pennsylvania democrats  desperate to deprive president trump of a second term in elections last year  two trump like republicans running for governor and senator lost to democrats by blowout margins  four democrats wrestled away republican held congressional seats  including conor lamb  whose victory here outside pittsburgh seemed to be a template for how to win back voters in trump country but  listening to strategists and voters in a critical state for democrats  the midterms feel like a long time ago  instead  there are widespread worries that the momentum in pennsylvania  and in other key rust belt states  could screech to a halt if the issues in the 2020 presidential primaries and the partys eventual nominee stray too far left for the regions many centrist voters  make sense of the people  issues and ideas shaping american politics with our newsletter  the more we have presidential candidates or newly elected congresspeople talking about the green new deal  talking about medicare for all  talking about socialism  the more that plays into the trump campaigns hands  said ed rendell  a former pennsylvania governor and national democratic chairman he mentioned issues that are tantalizing to some primary voters and candidates but which risk alienating general election voters  such as reparations for descendants of slaves and a rapid  costly transition to carbon free energy  reparations  what are we talking about  mr  rendell scoffed  having only renewable energy by 2030  its not possible to achieve that mr  trump is in the white house in large part because of the crumbling in 2016 of three so called blue wall states  pennsylvania  michigan and wisconsin  which had not voted for a republican presidential candidate in more than two decades in 2020  if the rest of the electoral map is unchanged  with mr  trump winning the swing states of florida and ohio  democrats understand that their most promising path back to the presidency is to resurrect the blue wall  mr  trump carried the three states by less than 80 000 total votes  so small fluctuations in his support or opposition would be pivotal christopher borick  a political scientist and pollster at muhlenberg college in allentown  called 2016 a lightning in a bottle victory that will be hard for the president to duplicate but  he said  democrats are in danger of creating the conditions in which it could happen a more left leaning candidate opens the door for trump  mr  borick said  if you want to lock up pennsylvania for a democrat  the more moderate democrats are the key some democratic strategists said it is much too early to rule out any of the 2020 hopefuls as unable to defeat mr  trump in pennsylvania  where disapproval of his job performance is 54 percent  with 42 percent approval  according to gallup im not going to sit here and say theres a democratic nominee that cant win pennsylvania  said jason omalley  a party strategist in lancaster county  a republican leaning region coleman lamb  a senior adviser to his brother conor  said a candidates personal qualities mattered more to voters than ideology  i dont

flipped many precincts that had voted for mr  trump  especially in the north hills suburbs of pittsburgh  recent interviews with two dozen voters there  a mix of blue  and white collar workers

pennsylvania said the most likely nominees to carry the state  at this early stage  appeared to be former vice president joseph r  biden jr   a native of scranton  and senator amy klobuchar of minnesota  both of whose centrist policies fit comfortably with the states voters both are a yuengling order for a pennsylvanian right now  said ryan costello  a former republican congressman from

to win back white blue collar voters who defected to mr  trump across the rust belt but some democrats quietly hope mr  biden does not run  fearing that his age  he is 76  four years older than mr  trump  puts him at a disadvantage  as does political baggage he carries from an earlier era i love joe  but i think that with the new era  and the metoo and all that  joe has some skeletons in his

opened at 19  had voted democratic for decades before casting a ballot for mr  trump  he liked the way he sounded as if he were on the next barstool  and mr  iezzi chuckled approvingly recalling mr

washington  president trump attacked speaker nancy pelosi on sunday for rejecting his proposal to end the partial government shutdown  as he and republican leaders in congress sought to put democrats on defense  a place they have rarely been during the shutdown stalemate in a series of morning tweets  mr  trump said ms  pelosi had behaved so irrationally in spurning his offer to restore the temporary protections he took away from some undocumented immigrants in exchange for  5 7 billion for a border wall  he also pushed back against conservative critics who called the plan amnesty for immigrants who came to the united states illegally senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  plans to bring up legislation as early as tuesday that would wrap mr  trumps proposal into a broader package that would include billions of dollars in disaster relief and immediately reopen the government  an aide said  the move is intended to ratchet up pressure on democrats  who have insisted they will not negotiate with mr  trump until the shutdown is over president trump has put forward a serious and reasonable offer to reform parts of our broken immigration system and reopen government  representative kevin mccarthy  the republican leader  said on twitter  the moment now turns to nancy pelosi and chuck schumer  the country is watching but there was little indication from democrats  who have denounced mr  trumps plan as hostage taking  that they would abandon that position if he opens up the government  well discuss whatever he offers  but hostage taking should not work  senator chuck schumer  the democratic leader  told reporters in new york on sunday  adding  its very hard to negotiate when a gun is held to your head with the shutdown now in its fifth week  and 800 000 federal employees still furloughed or working without pay  pressure is rising on both republicans and democrats to end it  if it lasts until friday  congress will be forced to reckon with another grim milestone  affected workers will miss their second paycheck  read  trumps deal meets with skepticism among immigrants in texas as republicans go on offense in the senate  democrats will stay on offense in the house  where they have already passed a string of government funding bills that mr  mcconnell  who has largely remained on the sidelines during the shutdown debate  has refused to take up  on wednesday  ms  pelosi plans to bring up a package of six bills to fund shuttered government agencies  ignoring mr  trumps requests the measures gained approval last year from republicans on the house and senate appropriations committees  in effect  ms  pelosi will be daring republicans to vote against their own legislation  democrats will also begin talking more about their own vision for border security  a shift in strategy for a party that has focused mostly on the economic and personal toll of the shutdown amid the posturing  however  there were some hints that mr  trumps proposal  which he unveiled in a 13 minute white house address on saturday  might open the door to talks that could result in a deal  vice president mike pence  in an appearance on fox news sunday  suggested that mr  trumps proposal might be amended on the senate floor well  of course  mr  pence said  when the host  chris wallace  asked if he was open to negotiation  the legislative process is a negotiation and senator mark warner of virginia  a centrist democrat  described mr  trumps plan as a starting point on nbcs meet the press  though he added  youve got to start by reopening the government polls show the public largely blames mr  trump for the shutdown  and his advisers have been searching for an exit strategy  last week  mr  mcconnell told mr  trump  mr  pence and white house advisers that he needed the president to put forth a public offer so he could bring legislation to the floor mcconnells view of shutdowns is when youre in one  its a great opportunity for both sides to get things  said scott jennings  a republican strategist and former mcconnell aide who remains close to him  and what i think is dumbfounding everyone here is  why arent the democrats treating it as a situation where they could get something  the president has opened the door for them to get something  so lets talk throughout his administration  mr  trump has sought to limit both legal and illegal immigration  last year  he moved to rescind deferred action for childhood arrivals  or daca  which shielded from deportation hundreds of thousands of young unauthorized immigrants known as dreamers  he also revoked temporary protected status  or t p s   for some undocumented immigrants from latin american and african countries in the plan he unveiled on saturday  mr  trump offered to restore the daca and t p s  protections for three years  but democrats say that is a nonstarter  because it does not offer a pathway to citizenship for dreamers  and because mr  trump is simply giving back protections that he himself took away the mcconnell aide  don stewart  said the republican legislative package would include seven appropriations bills that would fund government agencies that have been partially closed for a month the legislation that the majority leader will bring to the floor this week would both reopen the remaining portions of the government  fund disaster relief  fund border security and address immigration issues that both republicans and democrats would like to address  all in one bill  mr  stewart said mr  mcconnell would need votes from all republicans and seven democrats for the package to pass  but only a handful of democrats in republican leaning states might feel pressured enough to cross the aisle  a spokesman for one of them  senator joe manchin iii of west virginia  said mr  manchin  who just won re election  would remain undecided on the republican proposal until he saw it in broadening the package beyond mr  trumps plan  mr  mcconnell may be trying to pick up additional democrats  especially those who are eager to vote for disaster relief hes starting to move the pieces around to see whats going to fly and whats not going to make it  said jim manley  who was a top aide to harry reid  the former democratic leader from nevada  hes trying to put the pressure back on democrats  and hes trying to see what the possibilities of a deal are by putting a larger package there  hes trying to see how large the package has to be to bring democrats on board but mr  trump seemed to be holding fast  he retweeted a series of endorsements of his proposal from republican lawmakers on sunday evening  and earlier in the day  he took aim at ms  pelosi and pushed back against conservative critics who have described the plan as amnesty for undocumented immigrants nancy pelosi and some of the democrats turned down my offer yesterday before i even got up to speak  mr  trump wrote  they dont see crime   drugs  they only see 2020  which they are not going to win  best economy  they should do the right thing for the country   allow people to go back to work mr  trump went on  nancy pelosi has behaved so irrationally   has gone so far to the left that she has now officially become a radical democrat  she is so petrified of the lefties in her party that she has lost control   and by the way  clean up the streets in san francisco  they are disgusting and to his conservative critics  mr  trump wrote  no  amnesty is not a part of my offer  it is a 3 year extension of daca  amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal  whether on immigration or something else  likewise there will be no big push to remove the 11 000 000 plus people who are here illegally  but be careful nancy ms  pelosi took to twitter to strike back   realdonaldtrump  800 000 americans are going without pay  re open the government  let workers get their paychecks and then we can discuss how we can come together to protect the border  she wrote  using the hashtag  endtheshutdown .
washington  kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  resigned on sunday after meeting with president trump  ending a tumultuous tenure in charge of the border security agency that had made her the target of the presidents criticism i have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside  ms  nielsen said in a resignation letter  i hope that the next secretary will have the support of congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure americas borders and which have contributed to discord in our nations discourse ms  nielsen had requested the meeting to plan a way forward at the border  in part thinking she could have a reasoned conversation with mr  trump about the role  according to three people familiar with the meeting  she came prepared with a list of things that needed to change to improve the relationship with the president mr  trump in recent weeks had asked ms  nielsen to close the ports of entry along the border and to stop accepting asylum seekers  which ms  nielsen found ineffective and inappropriate  while the 30 minute meeting was cordial  mr  trump was determined to ask for her resignation  after the meeting  she submitted it the move comes just two days after mr  trump  who has repeatedly expressed anger at a rise in migrants at the southwestern border  withdrew his nominee to run immigration and customs enforcement because he wanted the agency to go in a tougher direction mr  trump has ratcheted up his anti immigration message in recent months as he seeks to galvanize supporters before the 2020 election  shutting down the government and then declaring a national emergency to secure funding to build a border wall  cutting aid to central american countries and repeatedly denouncing what he believes is a crisis of migrants trying to enter the country he took aim again sunday night after announcing ms  nielsens departure  tweeting  our country is full ms  nielsen said she planned to stay on as secretary through wednesday in order to assist with an orderly transition  the abruptness was unusual because the department of homeland security currently does not have a deputy secretary  who would normally take the reins the president said in a tweet that kevin mcaleenan  the commissioner of customs and border protection  would take over as the acting replacement for ms  nielsen  who became the sixth secretary to lead the agency in late 2017  but by law  the under secretary for management  claire grady  who is currently serving as acting deputy secretary  is next in line to be acting secretary  the white house will have to fire her to make mr  mcaleenan acting secretary  people familiar with the transition said  ms  grady has told colleagues that she has no intention of resigning to make way for mr  mcaleenan  read about kevin mcaleenan  the new acting homeland security secretary  among the possible replacements for ms  nielsen in the long term is ken cuccinelli  the former virginia attorney general who is a favorite among conservative activists and who fits the profile that mr  trump wants the next homeland secretary to have  people familiar with the discussions said ms  nielsen had been pressured by mr  trump to be more aggressive in stemming the influx of migrant crossings at the border  people familiar with their discussions in recent months said her entire time in the job was spent batting back suspicion from the president  even as he told people he liked how she performed on television and enjoyed dealing with her personally  he initially was skeptical because of ms  nielsens previous service in the george w  bush administration  and then because she was close to john f  kelly  mr  trumps former chief of staff the president called ms  nielsen at home early in the mornings to demand that she take action to stop migrants from entering the country  including doing things that were clearly illegal  such as blocking all migrants from seeking asylum  she repeatedly noted the limitations imposed on her department by federal laws  court settlements and international obligations those responses only infuriated mr  trump further  the presidents fury erupted in the spring of 2018 as ms  nielsen hesitated for weeks about whether to sign a memo ordering the routine separation of migrant children from their families so that the parents could be detained in a cabinet meeting surrounded by her peers  mr  trump castigated her repeatedly  leading her to draft a resignation letter and to tell colleagues that there was no reason for her to lead the department any longer  by the end of the week  she had reconsidered and remained in her position  becoming an increasingly fierce supporter of his policies  including the family separations mr  trump and stephen miller  the presidents top immigration adviser  have privately but regularly complained about ms  nielsen  lou dobbs  a fox news host who is one of the presidents favorite sounding boards  has also encouraged mr  trumps negative views of her handling of the migrant crisis ms  nielsen lost a powerful protector when mr  kelly  her mentor  left his job as white house chief of staff at the beginning of the year  mr  kelly was the trump administrations first homeland security secretary and lobbied for ms  nielsen to replace him multiple white house officials said she had grown deeply paranoid in recent months  after numerous stories about her job being on the line  she also had supported the immigration and customs enforcement nominee mr  trump withdrew  ronald d  vitiello  and her support for him was described as problematic for her with the president  mr  trump felt mr  vitiello did not favor closing the border  as the president threatened again to do in a tweet on sunday night in early 2019  as the number of migrant families from central american countries surged  the presidents fury at ms  nielsen did  too  he repeatedly demanded that she cut off foreign aid to central american countries even though the funding was the responsibility of the state department  she repeatedly deflected his demands one day after ms  nielsen traveled to honduras to sign a regional compact with officials from guatemala  honduras and el salvador  mr  trump cut state department funding for the countries  and in recent days  the president made public moves to undercut her authority  leaking news that he might nominate an immigration czar to assume oversight of the issue at the heart of ms  nielsens department still  ms  nielsen embraced the presidents crisis language as apprehensions of migrants at the border shot up to thousands per day  on friday  mr  trump traveled with ms  nielsen and mr  mcaleenan to calexico  calif   to highlight the issue while the number of border crossings is not as high as in the early 2000s  the demographic of migrants has shifted largely from individual mexicans looking for jobs  who could easily be deported  to central american families  overwhelming detention facilities and prompting mass releases of migrants into cities along the border ms  nielsen estimated last month that border officials had stopped as many as 100 000 migrants in march but despite the trip and several stories about how much better her relationship with mr  trump was  ms  nielsen never learned how to manage him  people familiar with their discussions said  he often felt lectured to by ms  nielsen  the people familiar with the discussions said and his son in law  jared kushner  was not an admirer of ms  nielsen  several administration officials said  that came to a head recently as mr  kushner had inserted himself into immigration discussions while mr  trump often blamed ms  nielsen for the surge in migrant crossings  she will be remembered for leading the department during the trump administrations zero tolerance policy along the southwestern border  which initially resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant children from their families an intense backlash ensued  and the department of homeland security was unprepared to deal with separating nearly 3 000 children from their parents hampered by misstep after misstep  kirstjen nielsens tenure at the department of homeland security was a disaster from the start  said representative bennie thompson  a mississippi democrat and the chairman of the houses committee on homeland security  it is clearer now than ever that the trump administrations border security and immigration policies  that she enacted and helped craft  have been an abysmal failure and have helped create the humanitarian crisis at the border mr  trump eventually moved to halt the family separations  though the government struggled in some cases to reunite those it had already separated by naming mr  mcaleenan acting secretary  mr  trump is installing another veteran of previous administrations  not a loyal foot soldier of mr  trumps campaign married to a salvadoran immigrant  mr  mcaleenan is a lawyer who wrote an honors thesis at amherst college on marriage equality and applied at the f b i  after the sept  11 attacks described by colleagues as a savvy political operator  mr  mcaleenan worked cooperatively with obama administration officials but later embraced mr  trumps agenda  which included unshackling border patrol agents from restrictions that the previous administration had imposed mr  mcaleenan was also one of three department of homeland security officials who had urged ms  nielsen to sign the memo authorizing the routine separation of migrant families at the border the department  which has a budget of more than  40 billion and more than 240 000 employees  is an amalgam of 22 government agencies that was created after the sept  11 terrorist attacks  it is responsible for everything from protecting the nation from cyberattacks to responding to natural disasters at 46  ms  nielsen was the youngest person to lead the sprawling department  and an unlikely choice for the job in the months immediately after the sept  11 attacks  she helped set up the transportation security administration  now an agency within the department  she also worked as a special assistant to president george w  bush on natural disaster response while serving on the white house homeland security council when mr  trump moved mr  kelly to the white house in july 2017  ms  nielsen moved with him  as the principal deputy chief of staff  she enforced mr  kellys attempts to regulate access to mr  trump in the oval office  including the presidents schedule  irritating white house staff members  who complained she was uncompromising mr  kelly later backed ms  nielsen to succeed him at the homeland security department  though she was criticized as too inexperienced for the job by democrats and anti immigration groups  mr  trump  however  said she was ready on day 1 there will be no on the job training for kirstjen  mr  trump said in october 2017  announcing her nomination for the post but by the following spring  ms  nielsen was telling associates she was miserable in the job .
washington  as the reality of divided government sank in the day after the midterm elections  senator mitch mcconnell  the kentucky republican who had just expanded his majority  held out hope that he and incoming speaker nancy pelosi would find a way to get things done despite their deep differences were not unfamiliar with each other  mr  mcconnell told reporters in november  recounting their time working together on spending bills  and well probably have a lot more dealings with each other in the future those dealings are off to a terrible start  a significant portion of the government remains shut down  angry accusations of irresponsibility are flying and the prospects of finding a quick solution to the crisis  or of coming together to pass significant legislation when it ends  remain grim now  with mr  mcconnell making his first significant legislative overture to break the stalemate on sunday  the outcome might rest on the capacity of ms  pelosi and mr  mcconnell to find a way to bridge the divide between them  their parties and the white house the two congressional leaders are ideological opposites who are two of the capitals most experienced deal makers  yet to this point each has mainly called on the other to relent they come from very different universes  said antonia ferrier  a former top aide to mr  mcconnell who also worked in the house for the republican leader john a  boehner ms  pelosi says the senate should allow votes on house passed measures to reopen government agencies  mr  mcconnell says democrats should support border protection measures they have backed in the past  including those in the presidents offer on saturday that would extend temporary protections for thousands of young immigrants at risk of deportation in exchange for wall funding  mr  mcconnell is intending to put on the senate floor this week a plan that would immediately reopen the government  impose the deportation protections  provide the presidents wall money and offer other sweeteners for democrats mr  mcconnell has tried to turn up the pressure on ms  pelosi in recent days  with little success  in a series of speeches on the senate floor  accusing the very distinguished congresswoman from san francisco of playing to her partys left wing with her description of the wall as an immorality these days  it seems like democrats are happy to take their cues from the gentle lady from san francisco and her extreme  fringe position that walls have now become immoral  mr  mcconnell said in a typical rebuke to the newly restored speaker in a phone call with the president before saturdays proposal announcement  mr  mcconnell encouraged mr  trump to extend the offer with temporary immigration protections as a way to reach out to ms  pelosi and other democrats with a more appealing overture  according to a person familiar with the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation ms  pelosi has argued that it is mr  trumps intransigence  and mr  mcconnells refusal to allow a vote on house bills that would reopen the government but not fund a border wall  despite the senates passage of such a measure last month  that is putting the nation at risk the presidents insistence on the wall is a luxury the country can no longer afford  ms  pelosi said on thursday senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  suggested that mr  mcconnell was way out to lunch in trying to place responsibility for the shutdown on ms  pelosi  her allies in the house say the speaker is hardly the sort to wilt under mr  mcconnells attacks the bottom line is pelosi is showing some leadership over here  representative jim mcgovern  democrat of massachusetts and chairman of the rules committee  said last week  mcconnell is behaving like a coward  he is afraid to take on trump as longtime party leaders  ms  pelosi and mr  mcconnell have history with each other  much of it not good given their divergent ideologies  ms  pelosi was a harsh critic of the 2017 tax law that mr  mcconnell championed  they have also clashed bitterly over the affordable care act and the economic stimulus program enacted by democrats under ms  pelosis stewardship during the first years of president barack obamas administration despite mr  mcconnell rallying his party in near blanket opposition to the democratic agenda ms  pelosi  in a television interview last year  characterized mr  mcconnells 2010 claim that his top priority was to make mr  obama a one term president as a racist statement  the criticism irritated mr  mcconnell  who prides himself on his civil rights record and history  ms  pelosis office said she did not refer to mr  mcconnell himself as racist  but the comment still rankles the senator and his team as the parties clashed over the shutdown  mr  mcconnell threw more fuel on the fire last week with an op ed article in the washington post assailing the ethics and election overhaul legislation that democrats proudly designated h r  1 to emphasize its centrality to the partys image and agenda  mr  mcconnell belittled the package as a power grab and a naked attempt to change the rules of american politics to benefit one party ms  pelosi and mr  mcconnell managed to work together in the past to produce spending measures covering foreign operations when they served as top members of the relevant appropriations subcommittees in the house and senate nearly two decades ago  during the economic collapse of 2008  mr  mcconnell called ms  pelosi extraordinary in negotiating an economic recovery package embraced by both parties to calm the crisis  and she praised his leadership as well a spokesman for ms  pelosi said that the relationship between the two was strictly business and that much more of ms  pelosis time was dedicated to working with mr  schumer and representative kevin mccarthy of california  the house republican leader ms  pelosi has ignored mr  mcconnells attacks  and democrats do not believe they are doing much damage  she has instead focused her own efforts on pinning the shutdown on mr  trump  and suggested that he delay his state of the union address scheduled for this month  he retaliated by canceling a military flight she intended to take to visit american troops in afghanistan democrats had planned to use their new power center on capitol hill to showcase their legislative priorities  but the shutdown fight is instead consuming congress and putting in serious doubt any possibilities for initiatives on a new north american trade deal  a plan to lower drug prices and a long sought public works bill  among other proposals with some bipartisan underpinning  not to mention the fact that congress needs to raise the federal debt limit this spring i hope this is the low water mark  and not the high water mark  said representative will hurd of texas  one of the few republicans who have consistently joined democrats in voting to reopen the government  if this is an indication of how every particular issue is going to be  then divided government is going to be pretty rough on both sides while democrats are not advancing their planned agenda at the moment  they believe the shutdown is significantly harming mr  trump  with public opinion polls showing him getting most of the blame  senate republicans also take solace in the fact that polls show they are not being held accountable  one of the reasons mr  mcconnell has kept his distance from the fight despite the lack of legislative activity  members of both parties still hope they can get back on track once the shutdown is resolved  with a public works bill considered the top bipartisan possibility infrastructure is not and should not be a partisan issue  said representative peter a  defazio  democrat of oregon and chairman of the house transportation and infrastructure committee  there is substantial agreement that it needs to be done  once we can put this behind us  we can apply ourselves to doing a real infrastructure bill senator john cornyn  republican of texas  said common ground could be reached  i mean  well figure something out  we always do  he said  we passed the criminal justice reform bill that got  what  80 plus votes in the midst of all this polarization  so well figure something out  dont despair .
hi  welcome to on politics  your guide to the day in national politics  im lisa lerer  your host four years ago  the conservative political action conference featured a parade of republican stars  there was ted cruz  chris christie  marco rubio  rand paul  even the reality tv personality donald j  trump made an appearance fast forward to 2019  now  theres only one attraction  president trump this year at cpac  attendees can pose at a fake white house podium  admire an enormous mural of mr  trump with a bald eagle  and buy maga gear at an official trump store set up at the front of the convention center  wandering the halls are once high profile supporters of mr  trump like kris kobach  who lost his bid for governor of kansas  and the former white house press secretary sean spicer founded in 1974 as a protest of sorts against president richard nixon  the conservative confab used to be a wild event  a mash up of religious leaders  tea partyers in colonial garb and all kinds of fringier parts of the right  from the stage  rising republican stars fought for their support this is where ronald reagan  as governor of california  tested early versions of his message of a shining city on a hill  where newt gingrich celebrated becoming house speaker  where mitt romney described himself as severely conservative as he tried to win over the base in 2012  and where mr  trump first alluded to running for president as a republican eight years ago cpac is the place where conservative activists have long declared their priorities to the republican establishment but in 2019  they dont need to make their agenda known to the establishment  they are the establishment this is probably my eighth or ninth cpac  and it feels very different  said mark lloyd of virginia  who headed up a tea party organization before backing the trump campaign  youve actually got people here now that they dont doubt trump  trump doubt is dissipated during my visit  speaker after speaker thanked the president  for nominating brett kavanaugh  fighting abortion rights  standing up for israel  supporting gun rights  they blasted democrats for threatening impeachment weve got a lot in common now  i like him and he likes him  said senator lindsey graham  a onetime critic of mr  trump who has become one of the presidents strongest supporters  four more years of course  the biggest attraction on the agenda is the president  who will address the crowd on saturday  vice president mike pence speaks tomorrow  along with a number of other administration officials and supporters but conservative celebrities  not political leaders  are the big draw  diamond and silk  two african american women who have become minor internet stars for their videos praising mr  trump  got the liveliest reception today  when they try to play the race card  i want you all to stand up and play the trump card  so we can win and win  they said  as the audience jumped to their feet  cheering the issues that could expose some cracks in the republican party  trade  economic populism  the emergency declaration over the border wall  got little attention compared to topics like abortion  censorship of conservatives and the rise of socialism in my tour through the conference  i found that it lacked the kind of freewheeling energy that once made it a must see political show  the audience wasnt nearly as raucous  the garb not nearly as gonzo  even the infamous straw poll  once a test of conservative opinion  asked participants to rate not republicans but democrats some of that is because republicans are no longer fighting for power in the same way  given that the party controls the senate  the supreme court and the white house  some is a result of how the organizers have worked over recent years to push out the raucous ron paul supporters who once overran the event but mostly  the changed atmosphere underscores just how much the president and his brand of no holds barred politicking has conquered the republican party                     drop us a line we want to hear from our readers  have a question  well try to answer it  have a comment  were all ears  email us at onpolitics nytimes com                     when we talk about the democratic presidential field  we mostly focus on what democratic voters think about the various candidates  we thought it might be fun to flip the question and ask republicans which democrat worries them most  heres some of what attendees of cpac had to say i would say probably joe biden  the rust belt is why trump won  and i think he would have the biggest shot of winning over those voters   david shaulis  student  22  maryland i say tulsi gabbard  she taps into some of the more centrist viewpoints  i think a lot of people on both sides are sick of the foreign policy entanglements  its not necessarily right or left   ken greenberg  student  20  maryland kamala harris is extraordinarily dynamic  she has a certain presence i think it all boils down to this at this point  its the image you can create  shes strong  she is a woman   joyce porter  retiree  76  virginia                     this is the soapbox  a forum for you to share your thoughts with

welcome to crossing the border  a limited run weekly newsletter from the new york times  like what you see  send this to a friend  if someone forwarded it to you  sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox by kirk semple in ciudad jurez  mexicoin 1994  franklin pupos father fled cuba by way of central america and mexico  before settling in las vegas now  25 years later  mr  pupo is following roughly the same path incredible  said mr  pupo  40  marveling at how his familys history was repeating itself i spoke with mr  pupo and his wife  yaima garca  37  this week in an evangelical church that had been converted into a temporary migrant shelter  the building  a cinder block warehouse that previously served as a hardware store  was tucked in a scrappy  semi industrial neighborhood of this border city in northern mexico the couples journey had come to an abrupt halt here a month ago when their quest for sanctuary in the united states ran up against the cold realities of the border  they are now among many thousands who are waiting in ciudad jurez and other border cities for their chance to apply for asylum in the united states its a quirk of current migratory patterns that mr  pupo and ms  garca also find themselves among many other cuban asylum seekers in ciudad jurez  by the estimates of government officials  as many as 70 percent of the more than 3 000 migrants waiting here to apply for asylum across the border in el paso  are cuban in other border cities  those waiting to cross are mostly central americans the cuban always tries to be in a group  ms  garca explained  i see it as a form of protectionhow ciudad jurez came to be the preferred crossing point for cubans remains a mystery  but migrants say that it has the reputation for being safer for migrants and less crowded with asylum seekers than other popular crossing points  word traveled through the cuban migrant grapevine  in whatsapp messaging groups  by phone and on social media while cubans have been a common sight for years on the migrant trail through mexico  their numbers rising and falling in response to events back home and shifts in american policy  the flow appeared to pick up in recent months officials here in ciudad jurez said they began registering a sharp increase in the number of cuban asylum seekers in late fall the cubans  by and large  say they are fleeing political repression in the caribbean nation  cubans seeking sanctuary used to get special treatment in the united states  under a policy known as wet foot  dry foot  cubans who made it to american soil were allowed to stay and eventually apply for permanent residency  but the obama administration halted those privileges in january 2017  and since then cuban asylum seekers have been like everyone else in ciudad jurez  they have run up against a trump administration system that limits the daily number of asylum seekers allowed to present their cases at ports of entry  this practice has given rise to informal waiting lists in border towns so  the cubans and others are biding their time  in migrant shelters  in budget hotels and in cheap  rented rooms  and suppressing the impulse to hire a smuggler and cross illegally mr  pupo and ms  garca left cuba on feb  6  flew to panama and traveled overland to mexico  arriving in ciudad jurez on march 1 and finding their way to solus christus church the shelter is overseen by lilia and rodolfo barraza  who opened its doors to migrants on feb  26 after local officials appealed for help in absorbing the flow of asylum seekers into the city mr  barraza  65  a pastor  said that initially he had been inclined to say no  but he remembered a biblical passage that described the moral obligation to do good and when i thought of that biblical verse  i said  bring them  mr  barraza recalled  and the next day they were here the couple has hosted as many as 74 migrants at one time  jammed into a space suitable for far less  there are currently 38  all but one of them cubans   the exception is a venezuelan woman  ms  barraza  61  said that before they had opened their doors  she had never met a cuban  but now i think theyre beautiful  she said  we love them  they are our brothers and sisters the symbolic focus of the space is a white board on which is written the waiting list number of the last migrant allowed to cross the border and present themselves to the american authorities  a migrants number in line has become almost as important as any other piece of data in their life when a migrants number is called and they successfully cross  its a bittersweet moment for those who remain behind  they lose a traveling partner but move one step closer to their own appointment it could be a week  two weeks  a month  ms  garca mused on a recent afternoon at the shelter the number on the board was 6995  her number is 7533  mr  pupos is 7534 for now  mr  pupo added  this is our refuge kirk is one of a team of new york times journalists currently reporting from the border  each week theyll be sharing a slice of their reporting about the border and the people who spend time on both sides of it read more about kirks time in ciudad jurez here  do you have questions about life on the border  or feedback about this newsletter  email us at  crossingtheborder nytimes com mcallen  tex   the border patrols largest detention center has swelled in recent weeks amid an influx of migrant families from honduras  guatemala and el salvador  the processing center in the border city of mcallen has frequently exceeded its capacity  leading to mass releases of migrants that have overwhelmed nonprofit shelters the building  known informally as ursula because of its ursula avenue address  has been criticized by immigrant advocates for holding migrants in large pens made of chain link fencing   manny fernandez  the new york times houston bureau chief  spoke to senator jon tester  a montana democrat who spent more than an hour touring the ursula facility last week the following is an edited and condensed version of the conversation q  what was it like a  i was there on sunday  march 24   im not going to talk to you like most democrats will talk to you  im going to tell you that  when i walked in there  it ripped your guts out  it made you cry  it did all those things that people say it did to you  because you had children and you had mothers  i looked at them as kids the same age as my grandkids  on the other side of the equation  there were a lot of people in a fairly small area  and the ventilation had to be pretty darn good because it didnt stink how many migrants were there at the time twenty two hundred  and their capacity is 1 500 did it feel overcrowded or just crowded gosh  youre asking the wrong guy  because this is the first time ive been in that processing center  it felt crowded can you describe it its a metal building thats insulated  each one of the holding areas had a bathroom and a sink  theyre held by sex  of course  and then the families were held in different steel cages  basically  everybody had a blanket that wanted one  mylar blankets  most of them were laying down on mats  some of them were standing up  some of them were sitting on benches what were border patrol officials saying about all this they said they were processing them through as quick as they could  they said the manpower they were using here was manpower that theyd rather have on the border  but nonetheless they had to process these folks  look  i mean  i dont like prisons  i dont like holding people up  but the bottom line is that i dont have any better idea than the way they were doing it  and i asked them if they did and they didnt either  although they were tasked with trying to find a better way to do it  they were providing food and water and baby formula  and were treating these folks as good as they could treat them  in the conditions that were there  im simply just not critical of border protection in this situation because i dont know what the solution is some democrats were calling the mass releases a manufactured attempt to fuel the crisis at the border narrative  do you agree i dont think i can agree with it  look  im not a conspiracy theorist  i think i have to go with what i saw  and what i saw literally was a bunch of families in this facility and i think it is what it is right now  the direction i would take it is  what are the push factors in these countries that are pushing these families to our southern border was border patrol cooperative during the tour they were absolutely cooperative  ive been on these trips before  and i know for a fact they show you want they want you to see  but they were very cooperative were the conditions horrible  beauty is in the eye of the beholder  i guess  i dont think they were horrible  but by the same token it was gut wrenching to see mothers and children sitting there in cages it sounds like it was packed but people still had some room i dont know how many square feet each person needs to determine whether it was overflowed or packed or beyond the pale  i just know as i looked there  there was some space and people could mill around  although it was very crowded  it would drive me crazy  my nearest neighbor is a mile away  it would drive me nuts president trump visited a portion of the border wall in california on friday  a day after backing off a threat to close the border with mexico the president  floated the idea of closing the border last week  defending it repeatedly here and here  even as economic experts warned doing so could damage the economy  the agricultural and manufacturing industries would have been especially hard hit by a closing  including a potential avocado shortage  instead  on thursday  mr  trump said he would give mexico a one year warning before closing the border if the drugs dont stop or arent largely stopped  were going to put tariffs on mexico and products  in particular cars  the whole ballgame is cars  he said  and if that doesnt stop the drugs  we close the border read earlier installments of crossing the border here

washington  a bus emblazoned with the united states air force logo was idling outside the capitol on thursday  members of congress on board  ready to depart for joint base andrews and a waiting military aircraft  inside  speaker nancy pelosi was in her office making final preparations to lead the congressional delegation on a secret visit to american troops in afghanistan with a stop in brussels then came word from the white house  president trump was grounding their plane and killing the trip mr  trumps decision to upend ms  pelosis travel plans was a remarkable bit of one upmanship in an increasingly bitter government shutdown drama in which mr  trump and ms  pelosi  the newly elected democratic speaker  are the main antagonists the day before  ms  pelosi had suggested that the president cancel or delay his state of the union address this month  citing security concerns amid a prolonged partial shutdown that has forced thousands of federal employees to work without pay  mr  trump at first said nothing  but 24 hours later  without mentioning her request  the president released a sarcasm tinged letter in which he told her the trip was off in light of the 800 000 great american workers not receiving pay  i am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate  mr  trump wrote  i also feel that  during this period  it would be better if you were in washington negotiating with me and joining the strong border security movement to end the shutdown obviously  mr  trump added  she still had the option of flying commercial  read more on how nancy pelosis aides are accusing the trump administration of leaking her travel plans  the letter amounted to the latest reminder  if any was needed  that the stalemate over mr  trumps demand that democrats support his request for  5 7 billion to build a border wall has reached such a poisonous pitch that even the most tradition bound rituals of government  the presidents annual address to a joint session of congress  lawmakers periodic trips overseas to gather facts and perform oversight  have been consumed in a storm of ill will and competing agendas it came on the 27th day of the shutdown  a day on which there were once again no negotiations between the two sides  but there was some indication that house democrats  increasingly concerned that they have not sufficiently countered mr  trumps demands for a wall with ideas of their own  were privately weighing offering their own plan for more effectively securing the border the move would be something of a shift in strategy for the democrats  who have steadfastly refused to engage in a debate with mr  trump about border security as long as the government remains shuttered there have been concerns by some members saying we need to tell our constituents what were for and what it would look like in terms of border security  said representative lucille roybal allard  democrat of california and the chairwoman of the appropriations subcommittee that handles homeland security  that is probably a way to respond to that  and a way that does not violate what we are saying  open up the government and then we will talk about border security representative peter a  defazio  democrat of oregon and the chairman of the transportation and infrastructure committee  who told a group of committee chairmen at a closed door meeting on wednesday that it was time for their party to go public with its own border security ideas  reiterated the idea in an interview the president  he said  is making this about border security  but what he is proposing would not provide real border security  its a stupid  static wall which is a symbol  and its not a great symbol  and it would be ineffective among the investments that mr  defazio said should be made instead are more money for coast guard equipment and personnel to intercept maritime drug shipments  better technology to scan vehicles legally crossing the border to detect illegal drugs  resources for costly reconfiguration of border crossings to make them more secure  and funds for additional personnel to police them its a horrible waste of money when we have real needs  mr  defazio said of mr  trumps wall  so i just want to highlight the real needs to counter his fake proposal ms  pelosi hinted at such a proposal in a morning news conference on thursday  where she also said that mr  trump had yet to respond to her request about delaying his speech  very silent more than 24 hours  the speaker told reporters but the lull did not last long mr  trumps decision to revoke ms  pelosis military transport drew howls of outrage from democrats and some republicans  and threw into disarray a long planned trip by the speaker and senior lawmakers  including the chairmen of the house intelligence and foreign affairs committees  to visit american allies and troops stationed overseas democrats  newly in control of the house and eager to use their power to challenge mr  trump  vowed that they would not be bullied into scrapping the trip altogether were not going to allow the president of the united states to tell the congress it cant fulfill its oversight responsibilities  it cant ensure that our troops have what they need whether our government is open or closed  said representative adam b  schiff of california  the chairman of the intelligence panel we are a coequal branch of government  mr  schiff said  suggesting that the president apparently did not understand the new reality in washington  it may not have been that way with the past two years when he had a republican congress willing to roll over anytime he asked  but that is no longer the case mr  schiff was on the bus outside the rayburn house office building near the capitol when mr  trump fired off his letter  along with representative eliot l  engel  democrat of new york and the chairman of the foreign affairs committee  and several other lawmakers in what made for an unusual tableau instead of heading for joint base andrews and boarding a military plane  the lawmakers sat stunned on their bus  unsure of what to do next  until it eventually drove slowly to the capitol driveway  some journalists jogging or riding electric scooters to keep up  to disgorge its perplexed passengers  at one point  the house sergeant at arms  the chambers chief law enforcement officer  turned up to puzzle over the security arrangements for the lawmakers  whose secret travel plans were now public  and the speaker  holed up in her office with aides as reporters mixed near the rotunda with tourists oblivious to the drama  calmly plotted her next steps in the hallway one floor below  representative steny h  hoyer of maryland  the majority leader  sputtered with anger its petty  its small  its vindictive  mr  hoyer said  it is unbecoming of a president of the united states  but it is unfortunately a daily occurrence white house officials  including mick mulvaney  the acting chief of staff  had been irked by ms  pelosis invocation of security concerns as her premise for urging mr  trump to move his speech  and sought to put her in her place after she had emphasized that she represented a coequal branch in governing  according to aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions depriving ms  pelosi of an aircraft was the easiest way to remind her  they said  so mr  trump made a play for dominance and one upmanship reminiscent of his personal lawyer  rudolph w  giuliani  when he was mayor of new york  white house aides were tickled by the move  even as some acknowledged that republican house members might fear for their own trips going forward some of mr  trumps usual allies were less amused one sophomoric response does not deserve another  senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina  said in a statement speaker pelosis threat to cancel the state of the union is very irresponsible and blatantly political  he added  president trump denying speaker pelosi military travel is also inappropriate  read the letter here  later in the day  the trump administration had some good news for state department employees  announcing that despite the stalemate it was asking furloughed workers to return to work on tuesday  citing the departments vital national security mission it was the latest instance of the administration determining that an agency or department has a critical mission and its employees should return to work  but unlike in other parts of the government  the state department employees will be paid  at least for work performed in the next pay period military planes are traditionally provided to congressional delegations for foreign trips  which are typically kept secret because of security concerns  particularly when lawmakers are heading to war zones and the delegation includes high ranking congressional leaders  the white house has known about the trip since early last week  when it was brought to its attention by the defense department  according to white house officials a spokesman for ms  pelosi  drew hammill  noted that mr  trump had traveled to iraq to visit with american forces there during what he referred to as the trump shutdown  he added that the trip by the congressional delegation had a similar purpose the purpose of the trip was to express appreciation and thanks to our men and women in uniform for their service and dedication  and to obtain critical national security and intelligence briefings from those on the front lines  mr  hammill said a white house spokesman said that all coming official visits by lawmakers  known as congressional delegations or codels  would be canceled until the shutdown is over  and by days end on thursday  officials announced that mr  trump had also canceled plans to send treasury secretary steven mnuchin  secretary of state mike pompeo  and commerce secretary wilbur ross to the world economic forum in switzerland but melania trump  the first lady  kept her plans to fly on a military jet to west palm beach  fla   to go to the familys mar a lago compound as of late thursday  multiple congressional officials could not say  citing security concerns  whether ms  pelosis trip to afghanistan was still on .
president trumps family business has employed undocumented workers more broadly than it was previously believed  with multiple workers losing their jobs last month at a trump golf club in southern new jersey the club in pine hill  n j   known as the trump national golf club philadelphia  was the third trump property where undocumented workers have been fired since the new york times reported in december that the trump club in bedminster  n j   for years employed immigrants who were in the country unlawfully the presidents company terminated about a dozen undocumented workers at the bedminster property after the article was published  as well as a dozen workers at the trump national golf club westchester  in briarcliff manor  n y people familiar with the terminations at pine hill said that about five workers at that property were fired or told not to report to work again  including two seasonal employees who were not scheduled to work until the spring  one of the people familiar with the matter said that many other seasonal workers expected to be told not to return in the coming weeks the revelations about the undocumented workers has been an embarrassment for the trump organization  coming to light as mr  trump has railed against illegal immigration  blamed undocumented immigrants for crime and pledged to build a wall along the mexican border to keep more people from entering the country unlawfully the company has said it was duped by employees who used false identification to get their jobs  but some of the workers in bedminster told the times they were kept on the payroll despite the fact that management was aware of the false documents a spokesperson for the company declined to comment on friday the workers at the pine hill property said their terminations  which occurred in january  came abruptly just like that  i got fired  said victor reyes  who is from mexico and worked in the kitchen alongside the chef the manager called me and asked  victor  are you legal  i said  no  i am not legal  it surprised me because i knew he knew that i was illegal  i have worked for him 16 years and then he asks me  said mr  reyes  who added that it was his first job since crossing the border mr  reyes had worked up from a dishwasher to grilling steaks and preparing a la carte orders  he said  and acquired many cooking skills along the way the firings at the pine hill golf club were the result of a broader audit that the trump organization is conducting at its properties across the country  according to people briefed on the review  although the organization has conducted similar reviews in prior years  this is the largest effort yet to ensure that the companys employees are authorized to work in the country the review has presented yet another legal and public relations headache for company executives who are trying to contain the fallout from the revelations  it comes as the trump organization is facing wider scrutiny from congressional democrats examining the companys business practices at this point in the review  the issues appear to have been largely concentrated in the bedminster and westchester golf clubs  the people said  though the discovery of undocumented workers at the southern new jersey property show that the matter is more widespread than initially believed  the terminations at the westchester club were first reported by the washington post the trump organization announced on tuesday that it was using a system  known as e verify  to prevent undocumented workers from getting jobs at its properties  for the last several years  the company had utilized that system in many of its hotel properties  though it did not adopt it at most of the golf courses i must say  for me personally  this whole thing is truly heartbreaking  eric trump  an executive vice president with the trump organization  said in a statement on tuesday  our employees are like family  but when presented with fake documents  an employer has little choice he said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the trump organization  and that it demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately about eight million undocumented workers participate in the united states labor force  and it is an open secret that they use fake documents to get hired  typically made up social security numbers and permanent residency cards the pine hill club has an 18 hole golf course surrounded by maple and pine trees on 365 acres  members enjoy putting greens and a 43 000 square foot clubhouse where weddings and other events take place  sitting atop a hill  it boasts a view of the philadelphia skyline the golf club employs 100 to 200 people  many of them in seasonal jobs  immigrants employed there were charged with watering  mowing and manicuring the greens  the upkeep of the banquet hall  which has a 300 person capacity  and preparing food in the clubs restaurant because the workers do not have lawyers and remain in the country illegally  two of those who described the firings  as well as their family members  declined to be named workers said that those who were terminated were summoned to a meeting with eric quinn  the general manager  and a human resources executive who they believed was from the trump organization  each was told that their documents did not pass inspection after an audit and that they should leave the premises immediately  leaving some of the workers who lacked drivers licenses to scramble to find rides home people were getting fired on the spot  no warning  no nothing  no time to find a job  said one worker  who declined to be named the worker said that the immigrants had been treated well by the clubs management and that some of them had broken down when they were fired  its not easy to find a job if you dont have papers  after you worked there  the worker said  the general manager  according to several accounts  was said to have lamented the terminations executives at the pine hill club declined to comment the problem of undocumented workers at trump properties came to light in december  when the times wrote about victorina morales of guatemala  a housekeeper at the bedminster property who made the presidents bed  washed his clothes and dusted his golf trophies for five years  after mr  trump was elected  a manager told her that her fake documents had expired and helped her acquire new ones ms  morales said that on the advice of her lawyer  she stopped going to work on dec  4  two days before the times article was published  the lawyer  anibal romero  has said that neither he nor his client had been notified that she was fired  and that her employment status was not clear ms  morales  who is protected from deportation because she applied for asylum  was invited by her democratic congresswoman  bonnie watson coleman  to attend the state of the union address on tuesday  also attending will be sandra diaz  a native of costa rica and a legal resident of the united states who said she was undocumented when she worked at the trump resort  she will be the guest of representative jimmy gomez  a california democrat another undocumented worker  emma torres  told the times that someone in human resources at the bedminster club had removed her name and other undocumented workers names from a list of employees submitted to the secret service in 2017  ms  torres quit shortly after on her own volition at pine hill  mr  reyes said that he was treated well by mr  quinn  the general manager  and expressed gratitude for the opportunity to grow professionally during his years at the golf club  where his hard work was recognized  he said  over the years  on the job his repertoire of dishes grew and he learned english i had too many raises  said the immigrant from puebla  who said that he earned  18 an hour  the money enabled him to pay his rent and send money to his family back in mexico he received his first bonus in all his years working at the club  he said  in late december  in hindsight  mr  reyes wonders whether that was because management knew that he would not be welcome back after the winter hiatus now  he said  he is seething with a sense of betrayal i loved my job  i learned to cook everything  they helped me grow  he said  erupting in tears  now i feel bad  i dont trust nobody mr  trump  who during his campaign called mexicans rapists and criminals  has made border security and protecting jobs for americans cornerstones of his presidency  his commitment to erecting a border wall resulted in the recent partial government shutdown he has deemed illegal immigration a major  major problem  and his administration has intensified workplace raids and payroll audits at companies suspected of employing undocumented workers .

washington  as the partial government shutdown took hold over the holidays  president trump seemed to express wonder at being alone in the white house with little but the cheeriness of heavily armed guards to keep him warm for the better part of a week i was waving to them  mr  trump said just after new years day  i never saw so many guys with machine guns in my life  secret service and military  these are great people mr  trumps home alone like christmas tale has hardened into a 20 day standoff as relations between his administration and congress over his  5 billion demand for a border wall grow ever frostier  the white house has stopped paying its water bill  desks of some furloughed employees  whose job can include such drudgeries as helping their bosses work the copy machine  sit empty in the west wing and the secret service agents mr  trump was so impressed with  down to the officers who check ids and wave black suvs in and out of the gates surrounding the complex  are all working unpaid  everyone in the secret service is  according to an official at the agency however  the agency said  those employees who are performing emergency work involving the safety of human life or the protection of property  the majority of the secret service work force  must continue to report to work with paychecks failing to fatten the bank accounts of some 800 000 federal workers  the pain of this partial shutdown bit into all corners of america  even the white house  where there is often very little sympathy for those whose job it is to keep washington running  only 156 of the executive mansions 359 full time employees are allowed to report for duty because their work is considered essential  according to a government contingency plan but multiple administration officials have stressed this week that despite the shutdown  it is still business as usual  the janitors are emptying the trash and vacuuming offices  the navy run white house mess is still serving food  this week  chicken and dumpling soup was on the menu  after leaner offerings including fruit  nuts and other snacks were presented last week on an abbreviated schedule because of the new year still  while trump administration officials emphasize the normality  others who have endured lengthy shutdowns warned of the broader effects on the white house staff  including an inevitable slowdown in accomplishing important policy decisions with fewer workers i dont think people appreciate how isolated you feel  jennifer palmieri  a former communications director for president barack obama and a former aide in the clinton white house  which owns the current record  21 days  for a shutdown  an unfortunate benchmark mr  trump is poised to pass if the impasse continues ms  palmieri said the two shutdowns she experienced were distinct in my mind as extraordinary moments because there are so few people around and because the stakes are so high during a shutdown during the obama administration in 2013  ms  palmieri recalls that she and other workers were forced to bring in their own food  feed the occasional hungry reporter with instant macaroni and cheese fished out of desk drawers  and cart out their own trash emptying her own trash was not her biggest concern you can get caught up in winning this fight to the detriment of a lot of other policy  ms  palmieri said  and also your own political capital for the long term bracing for a fight has not always appeared to be a particular concern for aides in this white house  which tends to function in a state of personnel flux and operates with a trench warfare mentality in the best of times at the center of the operation  after all  is a commander in chief who emphasizes the importance of never backing down  and mr  trump  who is said to be exploring ways to circumvent the need for congress to provide money by declaring a national emergency  has given every indication that he doesnt care how long this fight goes on but some of the presidents furloughed aides are among those who are not able to communicate with others using work phones or email  or seek outside income  rules that have spanned administrations  it all sounds familiar to cody keenan  a former speechwriter for mr  obama  mr  keenan recalled that he was able to continue commuting to his west wing office during the shutdown in 2013  but many other staff members  including fellow speechwriters  most of whom were stationed in the adjacent eisenhower executive office building  could not our teams were hit really hard  mr  keenan said in an email  my speechwriters were furloughed  and we were legally barred from contacting each other until the shutdown ended  not being paid was especially hard on younger staff who didnt have any savings yet  but theres nothing you can do federal employees are counting on getting back their lost pay at some point  but contracted workers could face a different outcome  a spokeswoman for the general services administration said that facility managers  considered federal employees  and many contracted janitors and maintenance workers in some offices are still working  but was not able to say whether the contractors would eventually receive their pay if they are contractors  said amanda osborn  a spokesman for the agency  their pay is determined by the status of their contract besides the issue of paying workers  other practical matters at the white house have been left unattended for now days after the shutdown took hold  representatives from the treasury department left notice with dc water  the washington water utility  that the federal governments  16 5 million quarterly water bill would not be fully paid  leading to a lively discussion among the dc water board about at what point a clients water could be cut off  according to a report from the news website wamu it turns out the board will let this one slide we are not turning off water to the white house  vincent morris  a dc water spokesman  said in an email  the outstanding tab   5 million lengthy shutdowns can be disastrous for the white house for other reasons the last time a shutdown went on for this long  president bill clinton put himself on the long road to impeachment when he approached a young intern named monica lewinsky in an empty corner of the west wing  nonessential employees had been sent home  unpaid interns were brought in to work  and the rest is bitter history the obama administration barred interns from coming to work during a shutdown  and the trump white houses new class of interns has not yet started  according to a senior official  its a smart move not to allow them in  leon e  panetta  mr  clintons former chief of staff during the shutdown  said in an interview  on thursday  as the most recent shutdown approached the 21 day mark  mr  trump was grudgingly coaxed from the white house  he took a handful of people still working in the white house with him aboard air force one to texas  where he met with border security officials and people whose lives had been affected by the scourge of illegal immigration  not a nagging shutdown at least seven senior aides were aboard the flight  including jared kushner  mr  trumps son in law and senior adviser  sarah huckabee sanders  his press secretary  bill shine  his deputy chief of staff for communications  mick mulvaney  his acting chief of staff  and stephen miller  a senior white house adviser and architect of the administrations zero tolerance immigration policies some may have seen it as a way for the president to break out of his self imposed shutdown isolation and learn about its effect on legions of federal workers  some of whom are back home  standing sentry on his front lawn  but mr  panetta warned that it might have had another effect the primary danger is that the president feels that somehow whatever hes doing hes winning  mr  panetta said  and tries to tell himself that its the other side thats going to break first .

the government shutdown that began 20 days ago will become the longest shutdown in american history if it continues through saturday  and president trump has said that it could last months or even years where does this leave the 800 000 federal employees who are caught up in the shutdown  most of whom will miss a paycheck on friday we asked them to tell us how much longer they personally could endure a shutdown before experiencing financial setbacks  and how they felt about the fight over the border wall that is at the center of the standoff more than 200 responded  describing the hardships

regulation  we generally have no say or input into either  we are not to blame for badly designed programs  unintended consequences and objected to goals  we certainly should not be punished as a

peaceful transition of power  but all options are open ahead  the opposition has not said how it will break past mr  maduros blockade  saying that releasing plans would allow him to stymie the effort

since dec  22  furloughed workers and those working without pay have been living off their savings  credit cards and the last paychecks that landed in their accounts but many of those wells are now dry  and as president trump warns that the shutdown could last months or years if democrats do not agree to fund his border wall  unpaid federal workers across the country  from the washington suburbs to farming towns to remote federal prisons  are growing increasingly desperate and furious at the political impasse  they are now in shutdown survival mode  opening new credit card accounts to pay off their bills  borrowing from relatives and eating the dregs of their pantries i have child support and rent  and ive told my landlord that any increase and i will have to move  said joseph gudge  41  an electronics technician who works for the federal government maintaining and inspecting air traffic control safety systems at seattle tacoma international airport if the shutdown goes on long enough  when the hard reality of working without pay just cant be sustained no matter what  he said he will have to quit two months  he said  describing his personal crisis clock  some co workers are already looking a furloughed health communications worker in dallas applied for a temp job at his local y m c a  an international development worker in washington is scrounging for babysitting gigs  a wildland firefighter in western colorado sold his truck to pay next months bills amid the uncertainty about workers pay  the trump administration moved on tuesday to head off what could have been another far reaching effect of the shutdown  potential cuts to food assistance for millions of americans the agriculture department said that benefits under the supplemental nutrition assistance program  formerly known as food stamps  would be fully provided for the month of february  but the department offered no assurance about what would happen in march if the shutdown continued the timing of workers paychecks varies across the federal government  but many employees would normally receive a paycheck on friday  according to a former official at the office of management and budget  others would normally be paid next week in orlando  fla   joe rojas  a federal corrections officer  is starting a side job driving for uber to help make next months  2 000 mortgage payment this weekend

housing and equal opportunity at the department of housing and urban development  she would normally be paid by direct deposit at the end of this week  and she is terrified about what missing this paycheck will mean  she is most afraid of not being able to pay the roughly  1 400 in rent for her apartment in the bronx  and being kicked out on the street im just scared that this is going to be for a long time  and im a single woman  she said  what is going to happen with me  who could help me for now  she is trying to spend as little money as she can  she is not buying any groceries except

firefighter in montrose  colo   should be getting paid on saturday  the money would have gone to his mortgage  insurance  groceries  the normal costs of trying to live that american dream instead  the

columbus  n m   just minutes from the border in rural new mexico  the borderland cafe in the village of columbus serves burritos and pizza to local residents  border patrol agents and visitors from other parts of the country seeking a glimpse of life on the frontier  the motto painted on the wall proclaims life is good in the borderland this is the sleepiest little town you could think of  said adriana zizumbo  31  who was raised in columbus and owns the cafe with her husband  the only crisis were facing here is a shortage of labor  fewer people cross the border to work than before  and americans dont want to get their hands dirty doing hard work president trump has shut down part of the government over border security and his plan to build a wall along the border with mexico  and in a prime time speech on tuesday night he painted a bleak picture of life in towns like columbus he said border residents were suffering through a humanitarian crisis  and he described a landscape scarred by violence and prowled by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs  but that is not how ms  zizumbo sees it  people in columbus  she said  opposed the idea of a wall by about a 90 to 10 margin enough about the wall already  she said  we have other problems here that need fixing extending nearly 2 000 miles from southern texas to a fence jutting out into the pacific ocean in san diego  americas border with mexico is as long and as varied as the terrain  remote spots in the desert like columbus  a town of 1 600 people about 80 miles west of el paso  are sleepily tranquil  in cities like el paso and san diego  the growing number of migrant families pushing for entry to the united states has generated crowds and controversy  with migrants packed into detention centers and bus stations  and clashes at the fences between rock throwing immigrants and federal agents in anticipation of the presidents speech  the new york times sent correspondents to the mexico side of the border and to the four states on the united states side  california  new mexico  arizona and texas  and found few who shared the presidents sense of alarm many said there was indeed a humanitarian crisis unfolding  but they blamed the trump administration for worsening it with a series of policies aimed at deterring central american migrants from making the journey  those policies  many of which have been blocked by legal challenges  have failed to stop the flood of migrants  but they have succeeded in escalating tensions  overwhelming volunteer shelters and putting those seeking asylum from violence at renewed risk of health threats and other problems once they arrive in the united states the border has long been more than a barrier or a headline  it is the setting of a uniquely american story  a binational place of contradictions and commerce  one afternoon a few months ago  a latino teenager walked through the bus station in the south texas city of mcallen  a transit hub where hundreds of apprehended immigrants are dropped off daily by the authorities  the boy was not fresh from detention  he was a native texan  he was visiting a relative and wore a black t shirt correcting any misconceptions about his identity  it read relax trump  im legal that was the vibe along many parts of the border on tuesday  ahead of mr  trumps speech a cattle rancher in southern arizona said he had traveled to mexico a day earlier  and he saw no emergency  the lines were long  officials have shut down the number of ways people there can cross  but there were no signs of conflict or people pressing to get in there is no border problem  except for ones we are causing  said the rancher  who said he had not had any problems with illegal border crossers on his property and who asked not to be identified out of fear of retribution from strident supporters of mr  trumps planned border wall  theres no need for a bigger wall  there is not a border crisis down here some of the worsening problems  some city officials have said  are a result of the federal governments own management of the border  in el paso and other cities in california and arizona  the federal immigration and customs enforcement agency has in recent weeks released thousands of immigrants unannounced onto city streets  forcing city officials and migrant shelter operators to scramble to accommodate them they were just being dropped off with nothing  no money  nothing  said kevin malone  one of the founders of the san diego rapid response network  which has been dealing more frequently with unannounced releases  theyre setting people up for failure every step along the way  this is a contrived emergency  they dont have to be doing it like this from 2014 to 2017  local municipalities in south texas had to spend  873 000 on immigrant relief efforts  expanding staffing  securing migrant assistance centers and maintaining restrooms  generators and sleeping quarters then we get blasted for being sanctuary cities  get real  said jim darling  the mayor of mcallen  its not our fault  the feds are the ones dropping them off  what are we supposed to do some of those along the border  to be sure  believe the government should be not rushing to accommodate new migrants but fortifying to keep them out  james johnson  a prominent farmer in columbus  said he had voted for mr  trump in 2016 and continues to support the president  including his proposal for a wall listen  we need security and a wall will provide that security  said mr  johnson  43  whose family owned onion and chile farm sits along a stretch of the border  im 100 percent for the wall  trump is bold in pushing for it for a look at those whom mr  trumps supporters would like to keep out  one needed only to take a short drive across the border from southern texas to the mexican town of matamoros  where hundreds of migrants were biding their time on tuesday  waiting to cross into the united states and apply for asylum a porous tarp at their makeshift camp shielded them from the sun and  for the most part  the rain a honduran mother  iris patricia oseguera  51  sat in slightly better conditions  at a nearby shelter  with her 10 year old son  having been turned back from the international bridge crossing by mexican authorities when she tried to enter the united states  she said the two of them had been told to find permanent housing soon we have nowhere to go  ms  oseguera said  adding that she and her son could not return to honduras because of the worsening gang violence there  if forced to leave the shelter  she said  she wasnt sure where she would go  we dont even have money to eat  how am i going to pay for a house at the migrant camp  a group of american volunteers was giving away bags of fruit and bottles of water one of them was cyndie rathburn  the mayor of the texas town of rancho viejo  home to what she described as a large population of conservative trump supporters  this is not a national security crisis  she said as she purchased a bag of fruit from a local vendor  president trump has a flair for hyperbole and rhetoric back at the borderland cafe in new mexico  ms  zizumbos husband  lawrence haddad  keeps a pistol underneath the cash register in case something happens  he hasnt had to use it nothing much happens  and thats the way people like it  said mr  haddad  32 still  quiet columbus hasnt escaped the political turmoil over border policy  ahead of the midterm elections in november  self described militia members from around the country descended on the town to prepare for the arrival of a caravan of central american migrants  then making its way up through mexico honestly  these guys were kind of absurd  wearing camo and looking at their maps  ms  zizumbo said  they accomplished nothing  and now theyre gone  maybe theyll be back after trump talks hours ahead of mr  trumps address on tuesday  randy shaw  71  was outside the borderland cafe  he held a sign that read stop truth decay  dump trump mr  shaw is from wyoming  but spends winters in columbus  this whole crisis thing is trumps creation  he said  dont let him fool you .

marianna  fla   a federal prison here in floridas rural panhandle lost much of its roof and fence during hurricane michael in october  forcing hundreds of inmates to relocate to a facility in yazoo city  miss   more than 400 miles away since then  corrections officers have had to commute there to work  a seven hour drive  for two week stints  as of this week  thanks to the partial federal government shutdown  they will be doing it without pay  no paychecks and no reimbursement for gas  meals and laundry  expenses that can run hundreds of dollars per trip you add a hurricane  and its just too much  said mike vinzant  a 32 year old guard and the president of the local prison officers union if nature can be blamed for creating the first financial hardship  the second is the result of the even less predictable whims in washington  president trump warned last week that the shutdown might last months or even years in florida  where republicans dominated the november midterms and the states only democratic senator went down in defeat  conservative towns like marianna  along with farm communities in the south and midwest  and towns across the country that depend on tourism revenue from scaled back national parks  will help measure the solidity of public support for mr  trump and his decision to wager some of the operations of the federal government on a border wall with mexico jim dean  mariannas city manager  said he had already been concerned  even before the shutdown  that the hurricane would prompt public agencies to consider reducing their footprint in the region  what if an extended shutdown contributed to keeping the prison closed indefinitely i worry about the government pulling out of rural america  he said this  after all  is one of many towns across the country where private industries are few and the federal government is intimately connected to livelihoods  wedged near the border with alabama and georgia  mariannas 7 000 residents depend on the federal medium security prison to employ nearly 300 people in good paying jobs with attractive benefits   the prison once housed lynette fromme  a charles manson disciple  known as squeaky  who tried to assassinate former president gerald ford  as well as members of a spy ring known as the cuban five   read more about how the shutdowns effects are reverberating across the economy  with mortgage applications delayed and paychecks missed  and the prison isnt the only federal benefactor  the united states department of agriculture provides crucial assistance to farmers  many of whom plant cotton or peanuts or raise cattle the u s  department of agriculture office is currently closed  due to the lapse in federal government funding  read a printout taped to the door of a local u s d a  office on friday  the office will reopen once funding is restored the phone rang occasionally in the office next door  a federal worker who was working without pay patiently explained to frustrated callers that no  she could not connect them to the person they needed to talk to  because that employee was furloughed for the shutdown mr  dean recently received a letter from the bureau of prisons assuring city officials that the bureau would pay its utility bills  though the payments might be slow to arrive but prison workers were facing trouble even before the partial government shutdown  at least two thirds of the marianna staff members sustained hurricane damage to their homes  according to prison managers  the local prison officers union estimated that 10 percent of its affected members experienced total property losses charles jones  32  a corrections officer and vice president of the union  said he and his wife were expecting their first child next month  because of the storm  ive already had to defer a payment here and there for my car  he said  those are the basic things that were trying to do robert richards  33  returned from a monthlong stint in mississippi the day after the shutdown began  he said he was owed about  2 500 in expenses  were tired of being put in the middle  he said though mr  trump  said on twitter over the weekend that most of the workers not getting paid are democrats  that is far from true in places like jackson county  fla   where marianna is the county seat  it is a republican bastion so deeply conservative that it was illegal to sell liquor by the drink until november 2017  the president and his plan for a wall along the border are popular here  as they are across much of the state  which might explain why florida republicans in congress have done little to pressure party leaders in the senate to put an end to the shutdown everybody i talk to wants the wall  james grover  72  a car salesman from nearby blountstown  said over breakfast on saturday at the waffle iron  a diner on route 90 that opens six days a week even though its facade  destroyed by the hurricane  is temporarily made up of plastic sheeting and plywood few prison guards interviewed leveled any criticism at the president or his border policy  instead blaming the impasse on both republicans and democrats in congress who have failed to reach any agreement you can point fingers at both sides  said jason griffin  44  i point fingers at everyone  if they want to get something done  they can  heres a look at what is and what isnt affected by the government shutdown  mr  vinzant  the union president  said he believed a wall was necessary because he trusted fellow public employees who work for the border patrol  those guys will sit there and say  we need help  he said  so i have to agree with it  we dont have a choice but that solidarity does not make the prison officers situation any easier  especially since they face an added stress  the bureau of prisons as a general condition of employment requires that its workers pay their debts in a timely fashion  failure to do so can result in discipline i hate the shutdown  said joseph sims  37  a corrections officer of six years  sometimes youve got to do stuff to get stuff done  he said of mr  trumps stance  but now its starting to take a toll on everybody at work on saturday  mr  sims stood in his living room as his wife  melissa sims  a prison nurse  prepared to hug their 3 year old twins before embarking on the nearly seven hour drive to work for two weeks in mississippi mommys got to go bye bye  she told her son  eli  who shrieked  no  you cant oh my gosh  dont make me cry  said ms  sims  39 the day after she is scheduled to return  her husband will have to leave for yazoo city himself  so they will hardly see each other  and the shutdown seems likely to delay repairs at the marianna prison  which workers fear will remain effectively closed for at least a year we can handle a month or two  but if it gets much longer than that  im going to look for another job  a job in the private sector  ms  sims said of working without pay she blamed mr  trump for the shutdown  a point on which she disagreed with her husband and most of her colleagues  this definitely is making me more political than i have been in the past  ms  sims said  she has been researching how congress passes budget bills my stance is that if theres a wall  theyre going to find a way to get past it  legal or not  ms  sims said i believe there should be a barrier  her husband countered a few miles away  another prison employee  crystal minton  accompanied her fianc to a friends house to help clear the remnants of a metal roof mangled by the hurricane  ms  minton  a 38 year old secretary  said she had obtained permission from the warden to put off her mississippi duty until early february because she is a single mother caring for disabled parents  her fianc plans to take vacation days to look after ms  mintons 7 year old twins once she has to go to work the shutdown on top of the hurricane has caused ms  minton to rethink a lot of things i voted for him  and hes the one whos doing this  she said of mr  trump  i thought he was going to do good things  hes not hurting the people he needs to be hurting .
washington  with the government shutdown over for now  the 116th congress will hit reset this week  showcasing a democratic agenda in the house that was overshadowed by the struggle to reopen the government and furnishing both chambers with early opportunities to test whether divided government can produce results the house  which spent weeks passing futile bills to reopen the government  will turn to legislation higher on the democrats priority list  including a bill to raise pay for civilian federal employees  leading democrats also plan to reintroduce a marquee bill to close the pay gap between men and women that they have fought to enact for years in the senate  republicans will try to push through a bipartisan middle east policy bill that includes a disputed provision targeting the movement to boycott  divest from and sanction israel  with the measure  republicans will test for fractures in the resurgent democratic party  where palestinian rights activists have found new voices in house freshmen such as rashida tlaib of michigan and ilhan omar of minnesota and in both chambers  lawmakers have teed up a high impact lineup of hearings  effectively the first of the year  house democrats will zero in on the cost to the military of president trumps election eve troop deployments to the border and begin to consider their ambitious legislation to expand voting rights  make political giving more transparent and do away with partisan gerrymandering senators will press the leaders of the nations intelligence services on the status of global threats  kick off a push to search for common ground on cutting prescription drug prices and begin to advance dozens of mr  trumps nominees  including his pick for attorney general  william p  barr we have a lot of different things we have to deal with  said representative jerrold nadler of new york  chairman of the house judiciary committee  which will hold the first hearing on democrats ambitious elections bill on tuesday  the shutdown slowed things down somewhat  probably by a couple weeks  there is only so much time and attention people can give in a day looming over all of this action will be the border wall fight mr  trump is threatening to shut down the government again in less than three weeks if congress cannot reach a deal that provides him money for a wall along the southwestern border  and democrats and republicans will enter formal negotiations this week to see if they can reach a compromise on border security funding levels and what constitutes a wall if youre the president of the united states  and you know that you have to defend the nation  do you want to shut the government down  no  mick mulvaney  the white house chief of staff  said on cbss face the nation  do you want to declare a national emergency  no  but you do need and want to defend the nation but with much of the early negotiating likely to take place behind closed doors  both parties seem to agree that after weeks of a near total shutdown eclipse  congress needs to move on  they hope that some regular order can help heal the bruises left by the impasse border security and immigration issues are important  and we should deal with them  but we can deal with several important issues at the same time  said senator susan collins  republican of maine  we cant put the rest of the business of government on hold while these issues  important though they are  are resolved for house democrats  the return to normal governance provides a window to reclaim some of the attention the shutdown drained from the initial rollout of their legislative agenda  house democratic leaders had insisted when they took control early this month that the shutdown would not affect their carefully choreographed agenda rollout  but it did speaker nancy pelosi of california and her allies plan to hold a ceremony on wednesday to formally reintroduce the paycheck fairness act  a measure intended to equalize pay between men and women that democrats have tried to enact for 20 years  like other bills under consideration in the house  it is unlikely to be taken up by the republican controlled senate  but it is a key piece of democrats messaging to voters ahead of the 2020 elections ms  pelosi and mr  trump also are likely to renew discussion in the coming days about a date to reschedule the presidents state of the union address  which was previously scheduled for tuesday and became a casualty of the shutdown  last week  ms  pelosi rescinded her invitation for the president to address congress while the government was still shuttered  and has said subsequently that the two sides will work to find an agreeable date in the future to allow time to prepare on the house floor  democrats will bring up a vote on legislation that would give nonmilitary federal workers a pay raise in line with the pay increase members of the military have received  the legislation  if it became law  would override an executive order issued by mr  trump a week into the shutdown that froze civilian federal pay the house armed services committee will hold a hearing on tuesday about the cost and rationale behind the deployment by mr  trump of thousands of active duty troops to the southern border  representative adam smith of washington  the committees chairman  said in a statement that there has not been adequate justification for the use of our military personnel in this way and the judiciary committee will hold the first hearing on the for the people act to start building support for the legislation that would overhaul key aspects of the way federal elections are financed and held  in an interview  mr  nadler ticked off a dozen or so other policy areas awaiting attention by his committee alone we were all elected on much of this stuff  he said  there is a frustrating backlog even lawmakers in mr  trumps party  many of them rattled by the costs of the longest shutdown in the nations history  have signaled they are eager to broaden their work  in part to lower the temperature around immigration talks and show voters they can govern ms  collins said she had stalled the introduction of important bills because of the shutdown  and she stressed that the senate needs to demonstrate to the american people that we can work together on issues that really affect them  such as infrastructure  prescription drug pricing and retirement security one of the frustrating side effects of this awful shutdown was that it prevented the senate from getting a fast start on a lot of important issues  she said on sunday several senate committees will begin to change that this week in the senate judiciary committee  republicans will effectively restart the gears of machinery they used in the last congress to confirm record numbers of conservative judges to lifetime appointments on federal courts all over the country  on the agenda for a meeting on tuesday are mr  barr  mr  trumps nominee for attorney general  as well as six potential federal appeals court judges and more than three dozen other judicial nominees  the committees chairman  senator lindsey graham of south carolina  said last week and though committee customs are such that the nominees are unlikely to get a final vote this week  mr  graham is taking an important step in filling up a reservoir of nominees that senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  can slowly bring to the senate floor for confirmation the senate intelligence committee will push the leaders of the f b i   the c i a   the national security agency  the defense intelligence agency  the national geospatial intelligence agency  and the director of national intelligence to account for developments in geopolitical hot spots like russia  china and north korea and senator charles e  grassley  republican of iowa  will convene the senate finance committee for the first in what he said would be a series of sessions focused on the sky high cost of prescription drugs  one of the few areas in which democrats and some republicans believe they could reach an agreement with mr  trump this term we already know what the problem is  mr  grassley said last week  its time to look at bipartisan solutions and work to turn them into law the legislative package the senate will vote on beginning monday  called the strengthening americas security in the middle east act  is expected to pass with bipartisan support  but not without controversy  it pairs three noncontroversial bills with a fourth that affirms the right of state and local governments to break financial ties with companies that participate in efforts to boycott  divest investments from and sanction israel  a movement known as b d s supporters view the legislation as a key pillar of a sustained push to counter growing support for the b d s  movement and continue what has been historically strong bipartisan support for israel  but republicans believe that it will highlight the divide among democrats  between that more traditional view and that of a younger generation in the house critical of israels treatment of palestinians already the national republican congressional committee has taken to labeling ms  omar an anti semite for her positions on israel  a charge she hotly rejects with the shutdown over  i look forward to my colleagues putting politics aside and considering this bill that will keep america and our allies safer and more secure  senator marco rubio  republican of florida and the bills lead author  said in a statement on sunday .
reynosa  mexico  as the human smugglers stalk the bus stations  migrant shelters and twisting streets of this mexican border town  they have no trouble collecting clients like julian escobar moreno the honduran migrant arrived in reynosa  mexico  intending to apply for asylum in the united states  but new policies north of the border have instead driven him into the hands of the citys smuggling cartels  whose business is booming i honestly dont want to cross illegally  but i dont really have a choice  said mr  moreno  37 the trump administration  which has partially shut down the federal government in a fight over funding for an enhanced border wall  has adopted a number of strategies over the last two years to deter migrants and persuade them to turn around  or not to come at all its latest effort is a policy that admits only a few asylum seekers a day  if that  at border crossings  as a result of this metering  migrants are now waiting on the mexican side of the border for weeks and months before they can submit their applications in reynosa and elsewhere  the delays caused by the policy are prompting many migrants to weigh the costs and dangers of a faster option  hiring a smuggler  at an increasingly costly rate  to sneak them into the united states in november  the number of migrant families apprehended attempting to cross the border skyrocketed to its highest levels on record  with some of those caught having turned to smugglers at some point in their trip what we have seen is that no one is getting across the border  said hector silva  the director of a center providing services to migrants that sits near the banks of the rio grande  which separates reynosa from mcallen  tex  this forces families  with all the desperation they feel  to go illegally the decision to endure a long wait or illegally expedite the journey to the united states is playing out not only in reynosa  where the crack of gunfire has become a soundtrack of the city  but across the long sweep of the united states mexico border  all the way to tijuana  where a crisis is unfolding as thousands of central americans wait their turn to cross the border a visit to a reynosa migrant shelter quickly makes it clear how many are considering the smuggling option im scared to go to the border crossing  because they will deport me  said maximo rene arana nunez  a guatemalan who arrived in reynosa a few days ago and is looking to cross  im stuck here until my family in the united states can save enough money to pay for a smuggler according to those recently deported  migrants who are attempting to cross and local officials  the price that smugglers can command is rising along with the demand for their services for those able to afford it  and willing to accept the risk  finding smugglers in reynosa is easy  the streets seethe with smuggling cartel agents  who openly pitch their services the dangers of an illegal crossing are not enough to dissuade migrants  they are fearful  but many feel they have no other recourse  for many  the calculation is predicated on a simple truth  what lies behind them is worse than what may lie ahead i dont have an option  i cant be there  mr  moreno said of his native honduras  our government is totally corrupt  and if the mexicans or americans deport me  im dead mr  moreno now works 12 hour shifts on the outskirts of the city  trying to save enough to pay for a smuggler for other migrants in the shelter  the equation was not necessarily of life or death  but of exchanging well known hardship for vaguer hope look  we know what the situation is in our country  said osman noe guilln  28  who reached reynosa with his partner shortly after their marriage  having treated the ride on the buses up from honduras as something of a honeymoon  we dont know what will happen when we cross mr  guilln gripped the hand of his wife  lilian marlene menndez  and allowed himself a smile  blind faith and economic need were enough for them  they did not know how grim and dangerous reynosa was before they arrived  only that it was the closest crossing from honduras and therefore the cheapest to reach yes  they had heard the angry rhetoric about migrants coming out of the united states  they said  and knew about the deportations and long waits at the border  but they didnt care desperation makes you do crazy things  mr  guilln said  i dont think anything would stop me  and certainly not a wall the couple  having priced out the next leg of the journey with local smugglers  said they had accepted the risks of continuing  the smugglers  or polleros  are known to kill or strand migrants who falter in their payments  and to extort those who have families that can mortgage homes or drum up more money in recent days  the couple was quoted a price of  7 000 apiece just to make it to the banks on the texas side of the river that appears to be on the higher end  many central americans recently have been quoted  5 500 to be ferried to reach the other side of the river  not long ago   4 000 was the going rate some of the migrants interviewed who were planning to try the smuggling route said they still intended to apply for asylum if and when they made it to the united states while the united states revised policy toward asylum seekers is primarily aimed at dissuading central american migrants from making the trip to the border  it is also affecting mexican policy and the lives of mexicans in border cities the mayor of reynosa  maki esther ortiz dominguez  noted that her city  in the state of tamaulipas  was already one of the most dangerous in mexico  she said she is worried the situation in reynosa could grow even worse  as migrants are either preyed upon by criminals or recruited to join their ranks this policy could at any moment detonate a new crime wave here  ms  ortiz dominguez said in the center of the bridge that connects reynosa with mcallen  the united states border patrol this summer constructed a new booth for prescreening people hoping to make it into american territory  at least two officers are on duty in the tiny structure  asking everyone who passes for their documentation more recently  mexican officials have begun acting as a first line of border defense  as people queue up to cross the bridge  mexican agents are now pulling central americans out of the line  demanding their paperwork and detaining them if they have not filled out the proper documentation some have languished for months waiting for family members to send money to pay the fee for the paperwork the new approach by mexican agents at the border was begun under pressure from the united states  said one mexican official in reynosa  requesting anonymity because this person was not authorized to discuss the decision publicly it was this new approach by the authorities in mexico that ensnared mr  moreno having been run out of honduras by the notorious 18th street gang for refusing to work for them  he believed he had a good case for political asylum in the united states and went to the bridge in reynosa so he could start the application process but moments after arriving with his pregnant wife and three children at the foot of the international bridge  he and his family were stopped by mexican officials and detained a few months ago  mr  morenos lack of proper paperwork would have been ignored by the mexican authorities  according to local officials and immigration lawyers  but mr  moreno was held in a cell for 20 days and his family was placed in a temporary shelter the lure of the smugglers in reynosa is not limited to central americans  mexicans  too  employ their services  although the cost is lower  the prices charged seem to depend on just how bad the situation is in a migrants home country on a recent day in a migration office in reynosa  a group of mexicans sat waiting to be processed after their deportations from the united states for the migration authorities  it is a job  said melvin gmez  18  who is from the mexican state of chiapas  for mexicans and central americans  immigration is a dream mr  gmez had just tried crossing for the fourth time the day before we have something to live for  he said  and that keeps us going .
 want to get this briefing by email  heres the sign up  good morning the u s  pushes allies to block huawei  venezuela faces mounting international pressure and india struggles to keep troublemaking monkeys in line  heres the latest over the past year  the trump administration has embarked on a global campaign to pressure allies to prevent huawei and other chinese firms from helping build out 5g networks the u s  has suggested to poland that future deployments of american troops could hinge on whether the country works with huawei  and in germany  american officials warned that working with huawei could pose a security risk to nato why  the u s  believes that whoever controls the high speed 5g internet networks will have an economic  military and intelligence edge for much of this century  the trump administration has therefore adopted a zero sum calculus in which beijing  and companies perceived to be working for the chinese government  must be shut out whats next  the u s  campaign may complicate the round of trade talks with china beginning in washington later this week  particularly as beijing seeks to free huaweis chief financial officer  meng wanzhou  who was

updated jan  10 the partial shutdown of the federal government is nearing the end of its third full week  if it continues through saturday  it will become the longest such shutdown on record while some essential work  such as mail delivery and law enforcement  is still being performed  the shutdown has affected operations at nine departments  including homeland security  justice  state and treasury  and several agencies  including the environmental protection agency and nasa much work has ground to a halt  about 800 000 government workers are living without pay  with more than half working and most likely being repaid once the government reopens and the rest sent home with no such expectation  and  if history is any guide  it may ultimately cost more to have shut down the government than to have left it open  analysis  president trumps insistence on a border wall is boxing him in  heres a brief look at some of the government functions that have and have not been affected by the shutdown since the shutdown began  transportation security administration workers  many of them responsible for screening passengers and baggage  have been calling out sick in increased numbers at airports across the country last week  a federal official who spoke to the times on the condition of anonymity said that the call outs seemed to be a coordinated protest  but union officials said that many workers were most likely just looking for work elsewhere to cover for missed wages  a t s a  spokesman played down the disruption this week  a union that represents tens of thousands of t s a  officers said that some officers had quit and many were considering quitting because of financial hardship  government workers feel like pawns in a political chess game      many national parks are closed to visitors  and while some remain open with limited staffing or thanks to help from states  the national park service has warned that access may change without notice joshua tree national park  for example  remained open after the shutdown  but then suffered temporary or partial closings as officials struggled to keep up with the toll visitors had taken  at some parks  volunteers have stepped in to help with cleanup  read more on how parks and museums are affected by the shutdown  limited staffing has also raised questions about visitor safety  at least three people have died on national park service land since the shutdown began  and while it is unclear if the shutdown had any effect on the authorities immediate responses to the accidents  the announcement of at least one of the deaths was reportedly delayed because of the lack of resources museums have been affected  too  the national gallery of art  all 19 smithsonian museums  and the national zoo were closed last week because of the shutdown   essential personnel remain on hand at the zoo to care for the animals   though the museum is closed  you may still be able to see the art within  some paintings have a double life online      the scientific community has been affected  too  some government labs are empty  with scientists having been sent home  research  some of it time sensitive  has been disrupted  and the flow of grant money may be interrupted  too some agencies  including the centers for disease control and prevention and the national institutes of health  are largely or entirely unaffected  but others  such as the fish and wildlife service and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  which includes the national weather service  have sent many workers home  read more about the shutdowns toll on science and research  inspections of chemical factories  power plants  oil refineries  water treatment plants  and thousands of other industrial sites have also ground to a halt because the environmental protection agency had to furlough most of its employees in charge of inspecting pollution and monitoring compliance     the shutdown has also affected food safety oversight while the agriculture department is still inspecting meat  poultry  eggs  grain and other commodities  the food and drug administration has stopped its routine inspections of seafood  fruits  vegetables and other foods at high risk of contamination the 40 million or so people who receive food stamps will still receive the benefit for january  according to the agriculture department  which administers the program  and other programs focused on child nutrition  including school lunch and breakfast programs  will continue operating into february  the department said food assistance programs for women  children and infants and for people on native american reservations can continue to operate at the state and local level  depending on what funding remains  but federal funding for those programs is suspended until the shutdown ends  the department said  heres how the shutdown leaves food  medicine and pay in doubt for native americans      fear not  older americans  the social security checks are still coming   and the postal service will still deliver them  thats because the social security administration received funding for the 2019 fiscal year back in september  according to mark hinkle  an agency spokesman social security services and offices will remain fully operational  and social security benefits will be paid on time  he said in an emailed statement medicare  medicaid and veterans benefits are similarly unaffected  fact check  president trump has told a number of falsehoods about the shutdown      tens of thousands of law enforcement personnel are among those working without pay that includes workers at the f b i   the drug enforcement administration  the bureau of prisons  customs and border protection  the coast guard  the secret service  and more but the shutdown has nonetheless affected the criminal justice system  federal court proceedings have slowed as government lawyers ask for delays and federal district courts remain open though their funding remains in doubt already backlogged  most immigration courts are closed because of the shutdown  leading to long delays in deportations that is the irony of this shutdown  judge amiena khan  the executive vice president of the national association of immigration judges  the judges union  told the times  the impact is most acutely felt in immigration courts and proceedings where cases will not be going forward  how the shutdown could turn a day in court into a four year wait      the shutdown has had mixed effects on government investigations f b i  investigations will continue  according to the justice departments shutdown plan  because all operations of the f b i  are directed toward national security and investigations of violations of law involving protection of life and property the office of the special counsel  robert s  mueller iii   will also continue its investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election because it does not rely on congressional action for funding at the securities and exchange commission  though  all but 6 percent of the agencys approximately 4 400 employees have been sent home  according to a contingency plan  that limited staff will handle emergency enforcement  but much investigative work is not being done     when the shutdown began  most i r s  operations  stopped  with just about 12 percent of the agencys nearly 80 000 employees still working  according to a contingency plan that plan  which covered the end of last year  did not make clear what the i r s  would do in 2019  the white house has said it will call back i r s  employees in order to make sure tax refunds are issued  though it remains unclear whether it has the authority to do so  what the shutdown would look like if it happened in other industries  with tax filing season about to begin  the agency will no doubt face plenty of questions from taxpayers over the recent changes to tax law     the violence against women act  which funds programs for survivors of domestic violence  stalking and sexual assault  expired last month when the government shut down the justice department already awarded grants to those programs for the 2019 fiscal year  but its payment system was affected by the shutdown  as a result  requests for grant payments filed after dec  26 are on hold during the shutdown local programs have other sources of funds  said monica mclaughlin  the director of public policy at the national network to end domestic violence  but when they are in a situation where theyve done the work that is federally funded and they arent able to reimburse for it  it certainly puts them in a financial bind .
 what you need to know to start the day  get new york today in your inbox  gov  andrew m  cuomo of new york on tuesday cast himself and the state that he leads as progressive beacons and a bulwark against president trump  taking the oath of office while standing on ellis island in his third inaugural address  mr  cuomo pledged to pursue a new justice agenda that would confront a cancer of hatred and division that he said threatened the nation mr  cuomo conspicuously avoided invoking the president by name  even as he sharply rebuked a federal government that he said has sought to demonize our differences and make our diversity our greatest weakness rather than our greatest strength americas only threat is from within  it is the growing division amongst us  mr  cuomo said  new york  he vowed  would be the light to lead the way through the darkness mr  cuomo has said flatly and repeatedly he is not running for president in 2020  even as he has leaned in to cast himself as a leading democratic foil to the republican president mr  cuomo  61  was determined to deliver his inaugural address on ellis island  where millions of immigrants arrived at what became the symbolic gateway to a new life in the new world in the early 20th century the fact that mr  cuomos administration is currently footing the bill   65 000 per day  to keep ellis island open during a federal government shutdown  sparked by mr  trumps insistence that congress fund a border wall with mexico to keep immigrants out  made the location all the more poignant a contrast let new york say that the federal government may shut itself down but it will never extinguish the statue of libertys torch  it will never erase the words of her poem  mr  cuomo declared  they will never close our harbor  they will never close our hearts  they will never close this hall of dreamers it was a highly produced evening  complete with a campaign style five minute video introducing mr  cuomo and touting his life achievements  his half hour speech was followed by a live performance of rise up by the singer andra day  a full gospel choir also performed  the inaugural speech was followed by a reception on ellis island for mr  cuomo and his supporters  paid for by the state democratic party much of new yorks political class  friends of mr  cuomo  labor leaders  lobbyists  elected officials and party functionaries  had piled into big boats at battery park for a rare ride to ellis island after dark  attendees whipped out their cellphones and opened windows wide for a clearer shot of the glowing statue of liberty  as cold winter air gushed in this was mr  cuomos third inauguration and the sixth for a cuomo governor  his father  mario m  cuomo  also served three terms  so thoroughly has the cuomo family dominated new york politics that for anyone born in 1980  a cuomo has been governor for a majority of their lifetime  even before the younger mr  cuomo embarks on his new term mr  cuomo had labored intensely on the inaugural address for weeks  drafting passages by hand as he spent the holidays in the executive mansion in albany  according to people familiar with his preparation while he never once mentioned mr  trump by name  he did pointedly say that ellis island was the harbor where frederick trump arrived from germany  noting that his grandson would become the president of the united states mr  cuomo said that his own family members had come through ellis island and that the ancestors of so many others  including vice president mike pence  justice ruth bader ginsburg of the supreme court and the former secretary of state colin l  powell had marched through this sacred place never forget where you came from  he said mr  cuomo blamed those running the federal government  and thus mr  trump  for taking advantage of deep divisions in the country  if not creating them  like looters during a blackout  they didnt cause the darkness but they exploited it  mr  cuomo said mr  cuomo won his third term resoundingly  capturing nearly 60 percent of the vote in the general election and nearly two thirds of the primary vote  campaigning consistently against the trump administration like the nation  new york has become increasingly polarized between its urban liberal base in new york city and its more conservative rural areas  mr  cuomo won only six counties north of westchester county in 2018  and those were mostly counties with urban centers like buffalo  syracuse  rochester and albany  mr  cuomo carried fewer counties than four years ago  even as he finished 10 percentage points further ahead of his republican challenger in 2018 than in 2014 the tenor of tuesdays swearing in was a far cry from mr  cuomos first inaugural address  in which he offered an olive branch to republican lawmakers in new york  promising  i say i will not govern in a partisan way and my administration will not be a partisan administration the coming term will be mr  cuomos first with a legislature fully controlled by democrats  presenting a new set of challenges for a politician who initially campaigned as a centrist but who now describes himself as a pragmatic progressive i feel liberated  mr  cuomo said of working with a democrat run legislature notably  neither democratic legislative leader  assemblyman carl e  heastie or senator andrea stewart cousins  chose to attend mr  cuomos inauguration the governor has already outlined an ambitious agenda for his first 100 days  invoking the frenetic start to the presidency of a former new york governor  franklin d  roosevelt  as his inspiration as our nation once confronted a great economic depression  we now confront a great social depression  mr  cuomo said  adding  just as f d r  turned the frustration of the economic depression into a movement to pass the new deal  let new york use the frustration of the social depression to pass a new justice agenda the cuomo prescription for 2019 included a wish list of liberal policies  legalizing recreational marijuana  making election day a holiday  ending cash bail at the state level  enacting more restrictive gun laws  strengthening abortion rights protections  banning corporate money in state elections  tightening rent control protections  and instituting automatic voter registration few are underestimating a governor who approaches everything from event staging to the wording of a news article about him as a win at all costs battle hes no day at the beach  diane savino  a veteran democratic state senator from staten island  said of mr  cuomo  but  she added  over the last eight years  whether you love him or hate him  no one can say andrew cuomo doesnt get stuff done third terms have historically been challenging  and mr  cuomo has benefited heavily from governing during robust and almost continuous economic growth and  as he enters his ninth year in office  mr  cuomos tight inner circle of advisers has shrunk to the point of concern among even his close allies  his relentless pace  intense management style  stubbornness and reluctance to trust newcomers have made him ever more reliant on a select few aides  he survived two corruption trials in 2018 involving senior administration officials that resulted in convictions  including of joseph percoco  once one of mr  cuomos top lieutenants he was sworn in on tuesday evening by janet difiore  the chief judge of the state court of appeals  surrounded by his mother  his longtime girlfriend  sandra lee  and his daughters the speech marked mr  cuomos first full inauguration day without his father  who died exactly four years ago  in a twist fit for a novel  the 56th governor was informed of the death of the 52nd governor just moments after finishing his second inaugural address in buffalo on tuesday  he called the anniversary bittersweet for me i can hear his voice and i can imagine his pain and anger if he could see his beloved country today  mr  cuomo said .
london  to hear some british politicians tell it  they are mere servants  they can only execute popular will  whatever the cost to the country or themselves  to do otherwise would be to betray democracy itself the will of the british people is an instruction that must be delivered  prime minister david cameron said after voters narrowly approved leaving the european union in a 2016 referendum  though this meant both his resignation and  in his telling  devastation to the british economy yet lawmakers also believe they must determine for themselves how to serve britains best interests  prime minister theresa may  mr  camerons successor  justified her plan for withdrawal  or brexit  as the best way forward  even if it was not the most popular voters seem to share these dual expectations  the british government  many believe  should first and foremost safeguard the national good  including from the whims of public opinion  which has flipped several times since the initial vote  but it must also respect public opinion  as captured in that nearly three year old vote  above all else that contradiction is as old as liberal democracy itself  said steven levitsky  a harvard university political scientist  but it is growing sharper and more destabilizing  he said  and not just in britain around the world  rising populists and angry electorates are putting pressure  sometimes deliberately  on what mr  levitsky called democracys two conflicting imperatives  majority rule and liberalism in western countries  white majorities are challenging rights long promised to minority groups and outsiders  populist leaders  including president trump  are clashing with institutions that they say oppose popular will  political establishments weaken every year the result is a widening divide between two visions of democracy  there is the ideal of rule by the people  and there is the more complicated reality  in which institutions and representatives balance majority opinion against considerations like universal rights and the common good unable to reconcile those contradictory demands  once solid seeming democracies are breaking down  faith in a system that makes two contradictory promises is declining  the resulting chaos  far from elevating one vision of democracy over the other  could weaken both democracy may have begun as the idea that authority comes from the people  but there was always more to it as its modern form first took hold  philosophers and revolutionaries debated how to balance several lofty ambitions  of which popular rule was just one  and they fretted over how to make their new system last they concluded that democracy could never work as simply the rule of public opinion  said nadia urbinati  a columbia university scholar of democracy  it would need rules and procedures to guard against factionalism  an abusive majority or a power hungry leader they converged on a system in which elections are just one leg  alongside a second leg of rules  rights and institutions  she said  without that  we dont call it a democracy edmund burke  the 18th century irish philosopher  argued that an elected leaders duty required both listening to constituents and putting his or her mature judgment ahead of their whims during debates over the american constitution  james madison warned in one of the essays that became the federalist papers that unbridled majoritarianism had made earlier democracies as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths  only a republic of representatives subject to rules and institutions as well as the public  he wrote  promises the cure for which we are seeking such treatises formed the basis of todays democracies  in which the peoples will is carefully incorporated but rarely intended to dominate but that is not quite how this new system won the consent of everyday citizens the first democracies built their legitimacy on that of monarchies  then common  with a few proper nouns swapped around  instead of having one king  you have a collective king  the people  ms  urbinati said that vision of democracy as rule by the people persists  still heard in classrooms and in campaign rallies  where citizens are told that their authority is paramount it has set up voters for shock and outrage when they discover  time and again  that they are not as powerful as theyd thought  the checks imposed on popular will can feel like democracy failing  though its actually the system working as intended  provoking angry backlashes brexit is a near perfect encapsulation of this contradiction mr  cameron and others sold the 2016 referendum as handing power to the people  never mind that the prime minister  confident that the measure would never pass  was really just looking for a political fig leaf   but it has left britons more politically disaffected than at any other point in years members of the 48 percent who voted to remain in the european union have asked why a slim majority should dictate the nations fate  lately  with the polls having turned against brexit  it can feel like raw majoritarian rule by a majority that no longer exists meanwhile  britons who voted to leave have watched lawmakers fight over widely divergent plans  none of which enjoy majority popular support  there is speculation about a second referendum that might overturn the first  feeding suspicion that the establishment never intended to follow the peoples will referendums can end up feeling less democratic than promised in part  political scientists argue  because they are not actually all that democratic they tend to be volatile  turning on unrelated political events or even the weather  which is thought to have influenced colombias 2016 referendum on a peace deal with insurgents  they are notoriously poor at reflecting public opinion  particularly on a complex issue like brexit  and they force majoritarian rule onto a political system that is designed to resist it  setting up voters and leaders for collision but even if democracies are not designed for direct popular rule  democracy is often idealized as being exactly that  making it nearly impossible for british leaders to justify ignoring the 2016 vote  even many who wish to do so are arguing for holding a second referendum  repeating the same risks as in the first challenges to liberal democracys checks on popular input are growing globally in france  protesters known as the yellow vests  not content to defer national policy to emmanuel macron  the centrist president  have demanded that the country hold regular referendums on new legislation the alternative for germany  a far right party  has also pushed for referendums  including on whether to leave the european union  though the party is unlikely to get its wish  merely asking allows it to portray itself as a champion of popular will against an unresponsive establishment some elected leaders are governing as if by never ending referendum  pushing for raw popular will to carry the day in the united states  failing so far to get his border wall  president trump  as populist leaders often do when institutions stand in their way  has portrayed congress as opposing the will of the people  then he allowed the federal government to be partially shut down other populists have taken things further  the ruling party of poland  after portraying the judiciary as an obstacle to popular will  briefly tried to purge the supreme court  in the philippines  president rodrigo duterte told the police that they could keep citizens safe only by favoring him over the rule of law such crises are growing more common  mr  levitsky argues  because of a shift within democracies leaders have always needed the support of both voters and establishments to win elections  voters wanted popular rule  establishments wanted checks and institutions  the two held each other in balance but in recent years a series of changes  including the rise of social media and online fund raising  have severely weakened establishments power now  politicians are learning that they need to be much more responsive to voters than to the establishment  mr  levitsky said marginal figures like jair bolsonaro of brazil  a longtime lawmaker and now the president  can win by promising to empower popular will over the establishment  that doesnt have to mean abolishing democratic checks  but it makes doing so far easier that can be taken to extremes  a new generation of elected strongmen has risen by exploiting the gap between popular expectations of democracy and its reality institutions and rules really do limit the publics role  though they are meant to protect universal rights and the common good  they can be portrayed by populists as an elite conspiracy to subvert the people the only way to save democracy  the populists argue  is for a strong leader to smash those institutions and rule directly on the peoples behalf this can initially feel liberating to that leaders supporters  but  as mr  madison warned in the federalist papers  a democracy imposed by the superior force of an overbearing majority may not always remain democratic and sooner or later  with the establishment taken care of  strongmen tend to start going after the people themselves .
sault ste  marie  mich   for one tribe of chippewa indians in michigans upper peninsula  the government shutdown comes with a price tag  about  100 000  every day  of federal money that does not arrive to keep health clinics staffed  food pantry shelves full and employees paid the tribe is using its own funds to cover the shortfalls for now  but if the standoff in washington continues much longer  that stopgap money will be depleted  later this month  workers could be furloughed and health services could be pared back  everything  said aaron payment  the chairman of the sault ste  marie tribe  is on the table for many americans who are not federal workers or contractors  a shutdown is a minor inconvenience  a trip to a national park may be canceled  a call to a government office may go unanswered  but for native american tribes  which rely heavily on federal money to operate  a shutdown can cripple their most basic functions all across indian country  the federal shutdown slices deep  generations ago  tribes negotiated treaties with the united states government guaranteeing funds for services like health care and education in exchange for huge swaths of territory the federal government owes us this  we prepaid with millions of acres of land  said mr  payment  who also criticized the shutdown on monday from the stage at his tribes new years powwow  we dont have the right to take back that land  so we expect the federal government to fulfill its treaty and trust responsibility on the navajo nation  a mostly rural reservation of red rock canyon that spans parts of new mexico  arizona and utah  the government shutdown has already been difficult  said russell begaye  the navajo nations president a blanket of snow has covered the region  but roads are unplowed because federal maintenance has stopped  many people are now trapped in their homes  unable to make the 20  or 50 mile journey to buy water  groceries and medicine  said mr  begaye the interior departments indian affairs bureau provides basic services to about 1 9 million american indians and alaska natives  often by funneling funds to the tribes to administer the services themselves or by employing federal workers to run the programs  this means that services from law enforcement to tribal courts  disaster relief and road maintenance are often completed by tribal employees whose salaries rely on federal funding  or by federal workers  some of whom are tribal citizens the bureau of indian affairs was set to furlough 2 295 of 4 057 employees during a shutdown  meaning at least some of those services and salaries will be slowed or stopped because the federal government contributes to the salaries of many members of the navajo nation  mr  begaye said the lack of pay would hurt families on the reservation  where a single salary can support a family of six  10 or even 12 people  mr  begaye said loan sharks have started circling  leaving fliers on cars and doorsteps it just kind of snowballs into our people doing things that they know they shouldnt do and further financially obligating themselves  mr  begaye said  they have to keep their heater going  they have to keep their water on on the bois forte indian reservation in northern minnesota  tribal officials have instituted a hiring freeze and are planning to meet later this week to discuss budget cuts  cathy chavers  the tribes chairwoman  said tribal functions were continuing for now  but it will probably come down to minimal  minimal basic services if the shutdown lasts another month already  police officers on her reservation  who are employees of the federal government and not the tribe  were being forced to work without pay these officers are putting their lives on the line  ms  chavers said  and they dont know if theyre going to get a paycheck or not tribes are making plans for how much longer they can operate  while not knowing whether they will be reimbursed for shutdown related expenses  officials with the oneida nation of wisconsin said that they had made contingency plans but that they could manage at least another month without any cuts  the shoshone bannock tribes in idaho posted on facebook that they had enough money to operate at full strength through saturday  but would then have to re evaluate things do grind to a halt  said kevin washburn  who served as the assistant secretary for indian affairs under president barack obama  indian country stops moving forward during a shutdown  mr  washburn said  and starts moving backward a spokesman for the interior department  reached on new years eve  said so many people were out of the office for the holiday  or furloughed  that he had no information about the way the shutdown was playing out in indian country literally  theres a handful of people that are currently excepted and able to work  said the spokesman  john bockmier  about his office  i just dont have any details from around the country to give you  he went on  because there is no one out there that is currently able to provide that information for me for tribes  this has become a familiar  painful scenario  in 2013  during mr  obamas presidency  a lengthy shutdown forced a california tribe to close its child care program  in minnesota  a tribe postponed nonemergency medical procedures  and the sault ste  marie chippewa in michigan lost several employees to layoffs  including hard to replace medical staff who did not return after that shutdown ended with those bad memories in mind  the sault chippewa tribal council approved a resolution last month  on the same day president trump sparred with democratic leaders about a border wall on television  that allowed leaders to shuffle funds if federal money stopped flowing  that step has delayed the worst of the pain  but it can help only for so long  already  tribal officials have sent a memo encouraging frugality and canceled the purchase of a new computer server were not going to collapse  we may have to decide  what we can do with our own funding  said christine mcpherson  the sault chippewa tribes executive director  but well never close there have been some efforts to limit the impact  representative markwayne mullin  republican of oklahoma  introduced a bill last month that would have maintained funding for the indian health service during a shutdown  his proposal did not make it to a vote  but mr  mullin  who said i have no read on how long the shutdown would last  said he hoped his idea would gain bipartisan traction if the broader impasse stretches on this is a true federal obligation to treaties to native americans  said mr  mullin  who is a citizen of the cherokee nation and who received health care at an indian health service facility while growing up  this is different than really any other government agency if the shutdown continues  it could also curtail a department of agriculture food program that helped feed about 90 000 native american people in fiscal year 2017  the program is funded through january  but no new federal money will be designated if the government closing goes beyond that  according to a memo from the department  state and tribal agencies will have to decide if they can fill in the gap  chairman joseph rupnick of the prairie band potawatomi nation  headquartered in northeast kansas  said he feared the impact that this would have on his members those stores will be depleted  mr  rupnick said of the tribes food distribution center  when theyre going through a shutdown  theyre thinking  i need five billion for a wall  i need dollars for this or that  the bottom line is it always impacts the neediest people in the country the shutdown has further eroded many native americans confidence in the federal government  which they said has never lived up to lofty promises made in long ago treaties  i believe very strongly that it adversely affects a population that is already adversely affected by the united states government  said harry barnes  a former chairman of montanas 17 000 member blackfeet nation .
washington  as the most diverse freshman class in history settles into the house of representatives  newcomers like alexandria ocasio cortez of new york and rashida tlaib of michigan have been racking up social media followers and soaking up the spotlight  liberal firebrands largely elected to safe democratic seats but overlooked in the hallway protests and often glowing news media coverage  a larger group of more centrist democrats has arrived with a different agenda  and now  they are quietly asserting their influence as the partial government shutdown  which has left them scrambling to explain why 800 000 workers are still without pay  enters its fifth week the centrists  elected to seats held last year by republicans  delivered democrats their house majority  and their re elections will be critical to keeping the party in power  they include a sizable subset with backgrounds in military  intelligence and national security  and won by promising to work across the aisle and to end dysfunction in washington  now they are caught in the most dysfunctional situation of all  a record breaking shutdown  and they are under pressure from constituents to do something about it  the latest  in white house address  trump proposes daca deal in exchange for wall funding this past week  a group of freshmen in trump leaning districts convened a private strategy session to discuss how they could press speaker nancy pelosi to reclaim the issue of border security for democrats and to open the door to negotiations with president trump  some also aired their frustrations with representative hakeem jeffries  the chairman of the democratic caucus  who hosted a small dinner for freshmen from battleground districts we have very real credibility on the border security issue  said representative jason crow  democrat of colorado and a former army ranger  i did two combat deployments to afghanistan  both of those were on the afghan pakistan border interdicting drug and gun smuggling and insurgents coming across from pakistan and the tribal regions  so i like to think i know a thing or two about border security  and you dont do it by building walls ms  pelosi appears ready to listen  when congress returns to washington in the coming week  she is expected to bring up legislation that will include an additional  1 billion for border security measures  including 75 additional immigration judges and infrastructure improvements at ports of entry  though no money for mr  trumps cherished border wall she is also weighing whether to propose a democratic homeland security bill that could lay the foundation for talks with mr  trump  a step that would be a significant shift in strategy for the new majority  which has instead spent the past several weeks emphasizing the shutdowns emotional and financial toll on unpaid workers as someone who worked on preserving the homeland her entire life  im ready to talk about homeland security  said representative elissa slotkin  democrat of michigan  a former pentagon official who also served in the c i a   and who organized the strategy session  i dont think we need a wall from sea to shining sea  but am i willing to talk about more fencing and more drones and technology and radar and border agents  absolutely of the roughly 60 new democrats in congress  two thirds  including a tight knit group of 10 who are either veterans or have national security experience  flipped republican seats  they represent a very different face of the party  pragmatic moderates who believe they were elected not just to resist the president but also to cooperate with him where they can every single one of them ran on a platform of going out to washington  shaking things up and getting things done  said representative cheri bustos of illinois  a member of democratic leadership who focuses on electing democrats in trump districts  from the day they were sworn in  the government has been shut down  and they dont like it and the people they represent dont like it several of the freshman democratic centrists  all members of a bipartisan group called the problem solvers caucus  met with mr  trump at the white house this past week  representative abigail spanberger of virginia  a former c i a  operative who handled and recruited spies in europe  said she told mr  trump that people in her district  including prison officials and transportation security administration officers  are suffering  she said mr  trump did a surprising amount of listening i cant speak for how he interpreted what we said  or how he listened to that information  she said  but it was a calm meeting  most people spoke multiple times  and so i found that to be a positive thing but while democratic leaders understand the eagerness to quickly end the shutdown  a sentiment shared by democrats across the philosophical spectrum  they are also urging caution  and sticking to their insistence that they will not negotiate with mr  trump on border security until the government is fully open its fair to say that the freshman members of congress  particularly the veterans and national security professionals  were sent to washington to solve problems  and they would like to resolve the issue of border security in a bipartisan way  mr  jeffries said  that is the position of the house democratic caucus as well  but its just a question of timing and the republican willingness to stop acting like wholly owned subsidiaries of the trump administration and engage in a meaningful conversation after just three weeks in washington  many of the centrists say the partisan split in the capitol is even worse than they had imagined  and some have been quietly reaching out to freshman republicans to see if they can find a way to bridge the divide and end the shutdown when i think about being deployed on an aircraft carrier and we are simultaneously launching strikes against terrorist targets in iraq and afghanistan and im supervising the operation at the nuclear reactors  i dont turn to one of the operators next to me and say  are you a democrat or a republican  said representative elaine luria  democrat of virginia  who spent 20 years as a surface warfare officer and nuclear engineer in the navy  were all very frustrated by the partisanship ms  slotkin  who was an acting assistant secretary of defense under former president barack obama  described what she called a lack of evidence based planning to secure the border if i was back at the defense department  we would look at an objective needs assessment for securing the border and we would build a budget to fund that security  and we would be negotiating on it  she said but she said that when she asked senior house members if such a document existed  she was told that the white house had its needs assessment and democrats had theirs  and that neither was truly objective in talking points issued to democrats  ms  pelosis office ticked off a list of items that the party favors as part of a plan for strong  smart  effective border security  including scanning technology at ports of entry to screen for drugs and weapons  drones and radar to spot migrants crossing illegally  filling more than 3 000 vacancies for customs officers and building up infrastructure at official border crossings the service candidates  as the veterans and national security professionals call themselves  see themselves taking a leading role in articulating that vision in addition to discussing the financial toll of the shutdown  representative mikie sherrill of new jersey  a former federal prosecutor and navy pilot  said democrats needed to start underlining the safety aspect as well  while we are arguing over border security  were not paying our customs and border patrol agents  so were creating less security right now but the emphasis on border security may not sit well with their more progressive colleagues  who are more apt to talk about abolishing the immigrations and customs enforcement agency than stopping the flow of drugs at the southern border with mexico i dont think we need to try to out border security the republicans at this point with this president  said corbin trent  the communications director for ms  ocasio cortez  it makes more sense to focus on ways of creating an immigration system to bring people into this country to help build our economy and our society  rather than to help keep them out but ms  slotkin said it was time for the voices of those who flipped districts to be heard by the numbers  we should and do have a strong voice in the caucus  she said  adding  i think alexandria has done a great job of attracting new young people into the political process and getting people engaged  i think thats a good thing  do i think she always represents every freshman  no .
achiri nelson geh  a young activist deeply involved in the independence movement in southern cameroon  knew he had to flee  police officers had killed his brother  and they were looking for him  making his way by plane  boat  bus and foot to mexico  he surrendered to united states authorities at the border in the hope of winning asylum but his new life wasnt what he expected  he has spent the 21 months since then inside three federal immigration detention centers  imprisoned until he can collect  50 000 for a bond  while his asylum case winds through the appeals court one day this past summer  though  a lifeline arrived  not  50 000  but a letter from anne marie debban  a professor of geography at san diego state university  near the otay mesa detention center  where he was housed for the first 20 months  i am terribly sorry for what you are going through both in cameroon and here  she wrote  i applaud you for your bravery  courage and determination in standing up for justice and freedom mr  geh  now 29  was elated to hear from someone  even someone he had never met  thank you for your letters  he wrote  it gives me courage here began an old fashioned correspondence that bloomed into a friendship  part of an unusual epistolary campaign initiated by san diego state professors and others in suburban san diego  last week  the university library made public the digital archive of hundreds of letters from detainees  throwing open a window into the fragile lives of migrants from more than 20 countries living  some of them for years  inside a nondescript private prison the debate over how to receive immigrants in a country that both depends on their labor and criminalizes them as intruders has emerged as the signature flash point of the trump administration  which has swept a growing number of undocumented immigrants like mr  geh into detention at places like otay mesa and vowed to secure the border against future illegal crossings but as washington battles over the presidents plan for a border wall and how to handle an influx of new migrant families arriving from central america  the letters exchanged in san diego have made an international political drama intensely personal in the u s  our tendency is to really dehumanize migrants  said kate swanson  another geography professor at san diego state  we put them in these concrete boxes  this helps them become visible detainees began writing letters  many using stubby golf pencils purchased for 6 cents from the commissary  they pleaded for help while telling their stories of rape  murder and torture in their home countries  and of separation from their children at the border  volunteers responded with shock and empathy  sending christmas cards  poems  pictures and updates about their own families  they also sent small amounts of money to the detainees accounts for purchases of such things as extra food and drinks  toothbrushes and sneakers for those awaiting imminent deportation  all we could offer was commissary and moral support in the meantime  like the cup of coffee on the deck of a big ship thats going to sink  said joanna brooks  an associate vice president at the university who initiated the campaign  which has grown to 200 volunteers otay mesa  operated by a private prison corporation under a contract with the federal immigration and customs enforcement agency  opened in its current building southeast of san diego in 2015  of the 930 immigrants in ice custody as of this week  796 are men but fewer than half of the detainees have criminal convictions  according to the latest records kept by the transactional records access clearinghouse of syracuse university  most are simply awaiting the outcome of deportation or asylum proceedings  of those with criminal records  drunken driving and illegal entry into the country are the most common offenses  the analysis shows we are not who president trump thinks we are  wrote luis  a 19 year old gay man from el salvador  what i want is to create conscience of who we are as migrants  we are not a danger to society the letters  written in halting english and flowing spanish  told stories of how people had wound up in a place so far from home  mostly  they expressed longing to know that someone knew they were there whenever you reply my letters  it is a light for me in the darkness  said an asylum seeker from the democratic republic of congo who goes by the initial k in the archive  it is true it makes me cry because your letter showed care and love as a human as much as the communication has helped ease the loneliness for the detainees  it has deeply affected the lives of the letter writers as well  for professor debban  whose academic specialty is post apartheid south africa  the letters to mr  geh led to in person visits and prison calls  they talked about colonialism in africa  and shared books and articles we are there for one another  and i believe that we appeared in each others lives at just the right moment  she said of mr  geh  who was taken out of otay mesa by ice on his 29th birthday and is now at a detention center in alabama i have all of her letters with me  he said in an interview  i read them every day the letter writing project began when the trump administrations policy of separating migrant parents from their children at the border was roiling the country last summer  professor brooks gathered similarly outraged friends and colleagues at her house  together  they found the names and alien registration numbers for 30 detainees at otay mesa who had been part of a migrant caravan held up at the border in tijuana  the volunteers rented a post office box for the detainees responses when the first batch of 16 handwritten letters came back july 11  jennifer gonzalez  a lawyer in the group  said  we were all sharing bits and pieces and names and stories  i had this intense sense that each one of those letters didnt just represent a real person  but they represented a family who missed this person  their community  down to their ancestors within six weeks  the group had a system in place for writing letters daily and depositing funds into detainees commissary accounts  the group estimates it has spent more than  10 000 since july there are 140 of us who have organized to share our commissary  wrote ulises  who came to the united states to seek protection from the abuse he suffered as a gay man in honduras  we are people from different countries  india  china  pakistan  cuba  jamaica  vietnam  etc  there are many different languages and sometimes we have to communicate by signals because we dont speak the same language  but that does not prevent us from providing moral support to each other terrie vorono  a volunteer in the group  thanked him for his letter and offered a connection  as the mother of a gay son  she is an advocate for gay rights  we know that our children are never 100 percent safe even in the united states  she wrote to him the letter writers have not found universal support  rosanna benink  who has hosted volunteers at her house every monday  said one of her friends wondered why she bothered she said to me  well  they shouldnt be here in the first place  so what did they expect  ms  benink said  she said she tried to explain that these were true asylum seekers  but ran into more apathy  you get that reaction and it blows me away  she said the volunteers asked the detainees to describe their living conditions at the prison  and the letters revealed common complaints  spoiled food  itchy soap  harsh treatment  lack of access to legal counsel  an advocacy group formed by the letter writers  detainee allies  published a separate report based on the findings from the letters things here become more and more unbearable  a 50 year old woman from guatemala wrote on dec  3  they make the temperature intensely cold  our bones hurt  the meal schedule is irregular and the food is not healthy  an officer said that it was food for dogs the detainee named luis  who had come via the migrant caravan and has since been granted asylum  wrote that for personal hygiene  we are only given soap and shampoo  but the soap and shampoo they give us makes us itch  to avoid it  he said  detainees must buy a better brand from the commissary amanda gilchrist  a spokeswoman for corecivic  the company that operates otay mesa  said officials at the detention center had been responsive to the needs of detainees  correcting problems when they came to light  she said facility managers monitored the temperatures and the food  meals in corecivic facilities meet or exceed nutritional standards  which are set by our government partners  she said as the months have passed  some of the detainees have left  either winning the right to live in the united states or  more often  sent back to their home countries professor swanson has found herself thinking often about one of the men she wrote to juan  who had come to the united states to avoid death threats from ms 13 gang members in honduras she had written to him about her son and husband  and sent honduran soccer scores  but he was deported after three months  and the letters stopped  professor swanson said she was sure he was dead but it wasnt so  reached in honduras last week  juan said he was safe and planning to leave again for mexico to find work  he wouldnt try to return to the united states  but he did have one lasting memory from the experience  professor swansons letters i felt like i had family  he said .
 sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race  burlington  iowa  beto orourke  the 46 year old former texas congressman whose near miss senate run last year propelled him to democratic stardom  announced on thursday that he was running for president  betting that a broad message of national unity and generational change will lift him above a slate of committed progressives offering big ticket policy ideas his decision jolts an early election season already stuffed with contenders  adding to the mix a relentless campaigner with a small dollar fund raising army  the performative instincts of a former punk rocker and a pro immigrant vision to counteract president trumps yet mr  orourke also comes to the 2020 race with few notable legislative accomplishments after three terms in the house representing el paso  and in a primary so far defined by bedrock policy positions  like the economic agendas of senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren  mr  orourke enters without a signature proposal that might serve as the ideological anchor of his bid this moment of peril produces perhaps the greatest moment of promise for this country and for everyone inside it  mr  orourke said in a video announcing his candidacy  released hours before a three day tour of iowa began on thursday morning shortly after 8 a m  thursday  mr  orourke stepped into a coffee shop on main street in keokuk and began introducing himself to a state he had never visited before hey  nice to meet you  beto orourke  he said  squeezing between news cameras and caffeine seekers  good morning  good morning to you  he said to people in the southeastern iowa town of keokuk  a county where donald j  trump beat hillary clinton by 16 percentage points in 2016 but where former president barack obama won four years earlier soon  he was standing on a chair taking questions  perched between paintings of flowers and musical instruments  this is democracy  he said mr  orourke was planning on spending much of the next three days in similar communities across eastern iowa  the historically democratic part of the state where so many voters swung to mr  trump three years ago  keeping with the do it yourself spirit of his senate race  the new candidate did not release a full schedule of stops  details of his appearances spread by social media and word of mouth his democratic rivals quickly sent notice  however  that they were not going to let his long anticipated launch go unimpeded  former mayor julian castro of san antonio released a list of 30 new endorsements from texas  including one state lawmaker from mr  orourkes hometown  mr  sanders of vermont  ms  warren of massachusetts and senator kamala harris of california emailed fund raising appeals noting mr  orourkes entry into the race  with ms  harris citing the historic diversity in the field  which she represents and president trump also swiftly weighed in  using a photo opportunity in the oval office to ridicule mr  orourkes gesticulations i think hes got a lot of hand movement  the president said  ive never seen so much hand movement  i said  is he crazy or is that just the way he acts unlike many of his 14 democratic rivals for the nomination  mr  orourke has spent little time until recently even considering a white house run  let alone building an operation that would sustain one  some voters and activists have also wondered aloud if a white man is the best fit for this democratic moment  particularly after midterm successes powered often by female and nonwhite candidates  check out our tracker of the 2020 democratic candidate field  with mr  orourkes entry  the primary field appears close to settled more than 10 months before the iowa caucuses  former vice president joseph r  biden jr   the only holdout among the expected major candidates  seems poised to join the race next month early polls have shown mr  biden and mr  sanders on top  mr  orourke  three decades their junior  hopes to supply an unsubtle contrast  particularly given mr  sanderss success with the kinds of young voters who flocked to mr  orourke in texas advisers to other democratic candidates have watched mr  orourkes plans with concern  recognizing that the kind of face to face politicking that fueled his campaign to unseat senator ted cruz in texas should suit him well in early voting states like iowa and new hampshire  where voters crave personal interaction with candidates mr  orourke made his town hall forums the centerpiece of his senate candidacy  turning the race into a national cause  the underdog liberal running in a famously red state  trailed by a documentary film crew and endorsed by celebrities from beyonc to willie nelson  he made a point of visiting each of the 254 counties in texas  helping him bulldoze fund raising records and come within about 200 000 votes of mr  cruz on election day  where beto orourke stands on the issues mr  orourke also attracted many fans outside the state  drawing them into a perpetual social media live stream capturing not only his political events but unscripted moments on the road  late night burger stops  skateboarding in a parking lot  reminiscing with a former bandmate behind the wheel  for many politically obsessed liberals  his inevitably upbeat musings offered a welcome online antidote to mr  trumps twitter rampaging  on the eve of his announcement  vanity fair released a cover story on mr  orourke with photographs by annie leibovitz yet his boast in that interview  im just born to do this  and off the cuff comments he made thursday about only sporadically helping his wife raise their children  quickly drew criticism and illustrated the peril of taking his unplugged style to the crucible of a presidential race admirers  however  believe it is this ability to generate his own narrative orbit that could separate him from his peers in a political environment where its so hard to break through  he has an ability to pique peoples interest and to drive a narrative on his own  said jesse ferguson  a democratic strategist who worked for mrs  clinton in 2016  and is not advising any candidate in 2020  he isnt just shadowboxing with the presidents twitter handle on one central issue  though  mr  trump has provided mr  orourke with a useful foil  this year  when the president traveled to el paso to press for a wall on the border with mexico  the two headlined dueling rallies subsequently  he even said he would support tearing down the existing border wall in the el paso area  a declaration that republicans have suggested they will use against him should he make the general election but the democratic primary could present unique challenges to mr  orourke it is an open question whether he will be able to scale up his skeletal organization and hand over control to the sort of political professionals he largely shunned in his senate race  the lead up to mr  orourkes official announcement thursday has been highly improvisational  in part because he was personally directing much of the planning on wednesday night  he was texting supporters in early nominating states to share his plans and to tell them he would have advisers get in touch with them about his schedule  and for weeks  he has been meeting and talking on the telephone with a number of democratic strategists to gauge their interest in working for him  finding encouragement but also a reluctance to move to el paso  where he is planning to base his operations mr  orourke discussed the campaign manager job for 90 minutes with one strategist  jennifer omalley dillon  at the south by southwest festival in austin  but even on the eve of his announcement it was uncertain who would be at the helm of his organization yet he enjoys the support of many of mr  obamas aides  some tacitly and others more full throated  and he has relied on advice from a number of mr  obamas strategists  including the 2008 campaign manager  david plouffe   mr  plouffe is not  however  planning to formally participate in the race on behalf of any candidate  but unlike mr  obama  who ran in a year when the iraq war was the single overriding policy issue in the democratic race  mr  orourke is seeking the presidency at a moment his party is lurching left on issues across the board  he will be immediately under pressure to expand upon the sometimes vague liberalism that has colored his public life already  allies of mr  sanders in particular have questioned mr  orourkes commitment to progressive priorities   mr  orourke has declined to call himself a progressive  saying he was not big on labels  in 2016  he supported a centrist challenger to nancy pelosi to lead house democrats  in 2018  he frustrated texas activists by refusing to endorse gina ortiz jones  a prized democratic recruit for a house seat  because she was facing mr  orourkes republican friend  representative will hurd  who eventually won by fewer than 1 000 votes mr  orourke should have little trouble pulling in enough money to get a presidential campaign off the ground  though it is possible that some of his fund raising success in 2018 owed to his opponent  mr  cruz  whom liberals love to loathe some in the party have questioned whether a senate race losing candidate  should even be running for president so soon  senate democrats aggressively lobbied him to take on texass other republican senator  john cornyn  who is up for re election next year  even dispatching senior party officials to el paso to make the case in the months since his defeat  mr  orourke himself seemed to be casting about for answers  discussing a possible run with advisers but appearing genuinely conflicted  seeking clarity at one point by making a solo road trip to meet americans in unrehearsed settings on thursday  any lingering apprehension was well concealed this is the moment  he said  standing atop a coffeehouse counter in burlington  hands flying  for the leadership of the indispensable country he left little doubt which leader he had in mind for the top job .
fort dodge  iowa  the coffee crew at zakeers still likes steve king  they voted for him over and over and dont believe he is a bigot  they say hes getting a raw deal from the news media and republicans in washington but heres the thing  these rock solid supporters of mr  king  whose comments seeming to endorse white supremacy brought stinging rebukes from his own party leaders  are also convinced that his 16 year career in congress representing northwest iowa is effectively over i think hes dead in the water  said pat reed  a retired history teacher in a purple university of northern iowa sweatshirt  reacting to the news that house republicans this week had stripped mr  king of his positions on the agriculture and judiciary committees i think hes done  echoed ross nemitz  the owner of rosss appliance center in fort dodge  a small blue collar city in the heart of mr  kings district full of agribusinesses every rural iowa community has its zakeers  a cafe with a table of early morning regulars  a greek chorus speaking with a collective voice on dramas playing out on the local and national stage the men at zakeers have had breakfast together for more than 20 years  they keep attendance logs and play a game of chance to see who picks up the coffee tab   on wednesday the loser was an out of town reporter  for mr  king  69  losing the chorus at zakeers spells deep trouble  a copy of the des moines register on a table displayed a top of the page headline  house rebukes king  it upstaged the story of gov  kim reynoldss state of the state speech mr  king was also the top story on who  a conservative talk radio station broadcasting across much of his vast  39 county district of corn and soybean fields  whose black furrows lay under two inches of snow john kilmer  a retired truck driver listening from an adjacent table  who had voted for mr  king in the midterms  said now he must resign  theyve stripped him of his committees and hes just taking up space  he said and it wasnt just voters who think mr  kings career is nearing an end  republican officials are already planning to move past him  and are busy recruiting and raising money for primary challengers in 2020 if he does not step down mr  king says he has no plans to seek another line of work  as mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the senate majority leader  recommended this week  he pushed back on wednesday in a fund raising letter to supporters  writing that the unhinged left has teamed up with republican nevertrumpers and is pulling out all the stops to destroy me he attacked the new york times  which published a quotation from him in an article last week that led to the firestorm in congress white nationalist  white supremacist  western civilization  how did that language become offensive  mr  king told the times  comments he now says were taken out of context some longtime supporters in mr  kings fourth district said that even if the nine term congressman defiantly stays on  they will most likely back a primary challenger  two candidates announced this week that they would jump into the race  including a prominent republican state lawmaker  randy feenstra  and others are expected the fort dodge messenger  which in november endorsed mr  king over his democratic challenger  j d  scholten  issued an unusual correction on wednesday night calling on mr  king to resign it is now clear that the endorsement we made was a mistake  the editorial board wrote  we should have pondered more carefully kings pattern of making outrageous statements there are many reasons mr  king has been re elected repeatedly despite years of white identity politics and demeaning comments about hispanic immigrants  whom he has compared to dogs  dirt and drug mules with calves the size of cantaloupes the most basic reason may be the deeply conservative nature of his district  where republicans almost always triumph  president trump carried it by 27 points  mr  kings conservatism on abortion and gun rights lines up with a majority of his constituents  as does his reputation as an outsider defying the party establishment some supporters said the rebuke by party leaders in washington and des moines would only increase his appeal and backfire on those hoping he leaves congress now that theyve stripped him of his committee assignments  ive seen people dig in their heels and say  no  congressman king is one of us  congressman king is a pro life  pro gun  pro conservative person  just like we are  said jacob hall  who leads an activist group  sioux county conservatives mr  hall disputed the notion that mr  kings latest comments about white supremacy would move many votes one way or the other theres nothing anybody is going to hear congressman king say thats going to change their mind about him  whether theyre a supporter or a detractor  he said  our minds are made up in the fourth district but the results of novembers midterms call into question that view  mr  king barely squeaked out a three point victory  after winning by 23 points two years earlier  his support plummeted late in the race after he endorsed a toronto mayoral candidate with neo nazi ties and met with members of a far right austrian party accused of trivializing the holocaust  the chairman of the house republican election committee issued a stinging rebuke of him a week before the election  labeling him a white supremacist many iowa republican officials fear that if mr  king is on the ballot in november 2020  he will drive up democratic turnout  threatening other republicans running  especially senator joni ernst down ballot and up ballot hes definitely a liability  said dane nealson  a former republican chairman of story county  the largest and most democratic county in mr  kings district ms  ernst may be vulnerable even if mr  king is not running  after distancing herself from him only this week  as did iowas senior senator  charles e  grassley  and governor reynolds  each had spent years embracing mr  king because they needed his conservative base of voters grassley  joni ernst  kim reynolds  they could have taken a stance on this years ago  said troy price  chairman of the iowa democratic party  its appalling  its a failure of leadership on their part opponents of mr  king  and even some of his supporters  have long been frustrated by the impression he gives to non iowans who think his 16 years in office prove that his constituents are racists im embarrassed by him  said amy presler  48  a librarian in fort dodge  who grew up on a farm as the youngest of 10 siblings  i dont want people in the nation and the world to think that iowans are behind him and support that sort of talk  we dont mr  kings racist remarks over the years have mainly been directed at undocumented latino immigrants  he was years ahead of mr  trump in calling for a concrete border wall  in demonizing migrants as violent criminals and opposing any plan to legalize dreamers as a form of amnesty mike mccarville  a former fort dodge mayor  said that when it came to the many latinos who work in meatpacking  construction and agriculture in the region  native born iowans could be two faced all the farmers will bitch about all the hispanics  he said  but they hire them and we cant get along without them if they accomplished what they say they want and just round them all up and ship them back  our economy would grind to a halt  he added on monday  after house republicans stripped mr  king of his committee assignments  lorena lopez  the publisher of la prensa  a spanish language newspaper in the district  received a flood of texts and emails from readers  every latino knows how he has been  his negative comments especially against latinos  she said the response of the latino community  she said  has been simple  it is about time back at zakeers  the coffee crew said that mr  kings loss of committee assignments means the fourth district now has no seat at the table in congress no matter how much you may like the guy  if that person cant represent you as well because hes been stripped of powers  began mr  nemitz  the

in his first state of the union address last year  president trump outlined his vision for an america first approach to overhauling the immigration system  revitalizing manufacturing and prioritizing national interests abroad  as mr  trump prepares to deliver his second address on tuesday  which is also expected to highlight the presidents immigration agenda  heres an assessment of his progress on the promises he made last year  attempts to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul failed in congress  with proposals backed by the white house receiving the least support the four pillars mr  trump described are providing a pathway to citizenship for the young immigrants known as dreamers  building a wall on the southern border  ending the diversity lottery visa program and limiting family based immigration in february 2018  the senate rejected three immigration bills  the white house plan  which met all four of mr  trumps requirements  received the fewest votes  the two other bills did not fulfill all the requirements  in june  the house rejected another bill that included the four pillars as well as a more hard line measure that did not provide a pathway to citizenship for dreamers  who were brought to the country illegally as children and mr  trumps address this year comes after a 35 day government shutdown  the longest ever  over the presidents demand for border wall funding  toyota and mazda broke ground on their  1 6 billion joint venture in alabama in november  chrysler had announced that it would move production of heavy duty pickups  not the plant itself  from mexico to michigan  but has since paused those plans a database maintained by the reshoring initiative  a group that encourages companies to move back to the united states  listed plans by chevrolet to expand car battery production in michigan  fords unveiling of a 3 d printing operation in the state and the opening of a new factory in ohio by a japanese company that makes prototype parts  but no other company has announced or opened a new assembly plant in the united states  in contrast  general motors said it would idle five car factories  new rules for automakers in the successor to the north american free trade agreement would require automakers to eventually produce 75 percent  up from 62 5 percent  of a vehicles content in north america to qualify for zero tariffs  but the deal still awaits congressional ratification  and the changes would do little to encourage investment in the united states since most vehicles are going to be able to get over those new thresholds pretty easily  said kristin dziczek  vice president for industry  labor and economics at the center for automotive research in ann arbor  mich even if the administration raised tariffs on foreign car imports  spurring investment in the united states  automakers would still be mindful of the volatility of mr  trumps trade policies and investment would sit on the sidelines  ms  dziczek said employment in the auto industry has increased slightly under mr  trumps watch  to about one million in november 2018 from 955 800 in january 2017  the number of vehicles manufactured in the united states has continued to decline  even after a slight uptick last summer  according to the reshoring initiative  announcements to increase investment or move companies back to the united states peaked in 2016 mr  trump has renegotiated nafta and a bilateral trade deal with south korea while the changes to the south korea agreement were modest  the revised nafta strengthens intellectual property rights in canada  an investigation into chinas trade practices concluded that beijing had  among other unfair trade practices  violated american intellectual property rights  as a result  the trump administration imposed tariffs on  250 billion worth of chinese products  the two sides are in talks over a trade deal to resolve the dispute mr  trump signed right to try legislation into law in may  allowing terminally ill patients to seek access to experimental medicine that is not approved by the food and drug administration a similar program known as compassionate use  or expanded access  has been in place since the 1970s  and the f d a  says it authorizes 99 percent of the requests it receives  the new law allows patients  with the approval of their doctor  to ask drug companies directly for access  rather than wait for approval by the agency drug prices are still increasing  albeit at lower rates than in previous years an associated press analysis found that from january to july 2018  drug companies raised prices on more than 4 400 products  with a median increase of 5 2 percent  that was lower than the median increase of 8 percent for the same period in 2017  drug prices have continued to increase on hundreds of medicines this year no comprehensive bill has emerged since mr  trump nudged congress to act a detailed version of mr  trumps proposal  released by the white house in february 2018  pledged  200 billion in federal funding  less than half of what the trump transition team promised in december 2016   the money would come from savings from other cuts in the federal budget  according to the white house  and would spur states and private companies to invest  1 5 trillion in infrastructure over the next decade yet congress has not passed any bill that would make good on this  200 billion proposal  draft legislation to temporarily increase the gas tax to shore up the highway trust fund was never formalized or voted on mr  trump signed an executive order in may making it easier to fire government employees  but a federal judge struck down most of its provisions  a similar bill was introduced in the house but did not advance to a vote while congress has not yet repealed the defense sequester limiting military spending  lawmakers effectively ignored it and increased funding last year the budget control act of 2011 imposes caps on federal spending for the next decade  to compel congress to find savings in the budget  if lawmakers do not reduce spending  sequestration kicks in and enforces the caps  later spending deals raised the caps  limiting military spending to  549 billion in the 2018 fiscal year and  562 billion in the 2019 fiscal year mr  trump signed legislation that allotted the pentagon  629 billion and  647 billion in 2018 and 2019 fiscal years  far exceeding the spending limits   those figures do not include a separate pentagon account for war spending  while the sequester is still in place for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years  it is not difficult to imagine lawmakers and the president continuing to raise the cap  rendering the sequester moot congress ignored mr  trumps calls to drastically reduce foreign aid  instead approving budgets that included billions more than the president had requested  and made no significant changes to foreign aid policy sarah rose  an analyst at the center for global development  said the administration had been constrained by congress  and its own fundamental inconsistency in funneling money to friends and allies while simultaneously giving aid to countries that might not otherwise receive it in order to counter chinas influence  mr  trump has threatened to cut off aid to central american countries over migrant caravans  and nikki r  haley  the former ambassador to the united nations  had proposed making aid contingent on support for american backed policies at the united nations yet the amount of assistance given to honduras  guatemala and el salvador has been typical  and while the united states did end funding for palestinian refugees in august  it did not follow through on withholding aid from countries that voted for a united nations resolution condemning mr  trumps decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel  said jeremy konyndyk  a former director of the foreign disaster assistance program at the united states agency for international development the issue is that he made a promise that was well beyond his ability to accomplish  mr  konyndyk said  the president is not a monarch and cant just do things unilaterally .
 want to get this briefing by email  heres the sign up   good morning boeings decision making processes  indias strategically bloated budget and apples impact on the chinese economy  heres the latest in 2010  airbus announced it would introduce a more fuel efficient version of its popular a320 jetliner  within months  boeing announced plans to upgrade its own 737 jets in designing the new 737 max  boeing tried to avoid a complete overhaul of its systems so that it could persuade the u s  regulator  the federal aviation administration  that there would be no need for expensive  time consuming retraining for pilots that decision appears to have left the crew of the lion air jet that crashed in october  killing 189 people  without a full understanding of how to respond when faulty data led the flight control system to repeatedly push the planes nose down how we know  our journalists interviewed engineers  former boeing employees  pilots  regulators and congressional aides to understand some of the choices boeing made as it developed the 737 max the central problem  the maxs enlarged engines had to be mounted differently  which had a destabilizing effect  a new  automatic flight control system was created to counter the possibility of stalls  its likely the lion air pilots werent made of aware of the system  or how to handle it in an emergency the takeaway  safety on modern jetliners is shaped by a complex combination of factors  including fierce industry competition  technological advances and pilot training  in the rare instances when things go awry  the interplay of those factors can create unintended and potentially fatal consequences a new pension plan for rickshaw pullers  tax breaks for the middle class  cash handouts for struggling farmers these are some of the financial gifts for voters in the governments new budget  released just a few months before elections that could unseat prime minister narendra modi analysis  most analysts believe neither mr  modis party  the bharatiya janata party  nor the indian national congress party will win an outright majority  that means regional and caste based parties will probably become the kingmakers  and the farmers who make up the bulk of their voters will be major beneficiaries of the new budget  there are also some sweeteners for rickshaw pullers  tea sellers and others in the informal sector that makes up another large chunk of indias economy background  mr  modi was elected in 2014 on a campaign pledge to provide more employment opportunities  but he and his ministers are under fire  accused

and food stands impact  the cycle is worsening chinas economic slowdown  which has posed a major challenge for beijing and could put it at a disadvantage in the trade war with president trump in january  at the world economic forum in davos  prime minister shinzo abe boasted that 67 percent of women in japan were working  an all time high but many are stuck in limited roles in the workplace  unable to advance in part because of rigid gender expectations that shoulder them with most of the domestic work by the numbers  women who work more than 49 hours a week do 25 hours of housework a week  according to an analysis of government numbers  their husbands put in an average of less than five hours at home  among the lowest rates in the developed world  as a result  almost half of the countrys working women are employed part time  and more than half are on temporary contracts why it matters  mr  abe has prioritized what he calls womenomics to help boost japans slowing economy  and analysts say that helping women reach higher level jobs would help the countrys severe labor shortage  but cultural norms stand in the way state of the union  president trump will deliver his yearly address to congress on tuesday night in washington  immigration  a topic that has led to weeks of political impasse  will be a main theme  the white house said in the oval office  in an interview with

beto orourke has driven alone across the plains  straining to find his emotional bearings  or at least a pancake house in liberal  kan  he has collected an el pasoan of the year award  before a modest audience  and smiled coyly through an interview with oprah winfrey  before a bigger one he has surfaced on college campuses  to listen to students  at a metallica concert  to listen to metallica  and at the premiere of a documentary about his star making senate run in texas at the south by southwest festival  to listen to himself on screen he has journaled extensively were in this together  like it or not  mr  orourke wrote  summarizing the lessons of his recent solo travels in one of several stream of consciousness online posts  the alternative is to be in this apart  and that would be hell as the democratic presidential field takes final shape  mr  orourke seems inclined to be in this  according to interviews with people who have spoken to him and other top democrats  he says he has made a decision about whether to run and could announce it as early as this week  unsettling prospective rival campaigns that consider mr  orourke a credible threat yet in the four months since his senate loss  mr  orourke  46  has done little to demonstrate the kind of intensive preparation  building national political infrastructure  projecting a signature policy rationale for a candidacy  typically associated with a top flight presidential campaign there has been no flirtation tour in iowa  no trip to new hampshire since his college years as an ivy league rower  mr  orourke had no traditional campaign in waiting at the ready after the midterms  the sort of operation available to a more experienced holdout like former vice president joseph r  biden jr  or carefully built over months by first time presidential candidates like senators elizabeth warren  cory booker and kamala harris few doubt mr  orourkes capacity to upend the race regardless  buoyed by a talent for relentless retail politics  a formidable low dollar fund raising army and an unsubtle contrast to front runners in their 70s  like mr  biden and senator bernie sanders he also can count on help from several veterans of former president barack obamas campaigns  one of them  paul tewes  mr  obamas 2008 iowa state director  has been helping to plan mr  orourkes candidacy  according to three democrats familiar with the effort  and mr  orourke is expected to appear in iowa this weekend to campaign for a local candidate in an upcoming special election  sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race  but perhaps no major 2020 player invites as many question marks as mr  orourke  and his drawn out non candidacy has provided few answers is this the moment for a relatively untested white male in a party eager to elevate female and nonwhite voices in the quest to dethrone president trump can mr  orourke scale up to a national campaign without losing the intimate  semi improvisational feel of his perpetually live streamed senate bid and in a primary where some top candidates have already sought to establish progressive litmus tests on key issues  what does mr  orourke actually believe hes still an open book  said maurice mitchell  national director for the working families party  he sort of catapulted himself into the national spotlight without answering a lot of questions about where he stands amanda litman  a democratic strategist who worked for hillary clinton in 2016  wondered aloud if mr  orourke would be considered a top tier candidate if he wasnt a handsome young white man hes certainly effective at communicating the values behind a policy  she said  but that may not cut it in a primary where we all share the same values and are debating the execution on those values mr  orourke has betrayed little concern about catering to his left flank  people close to him say a central takeaway from speaking to disparate audiences in recent months is that voters are far less ideological than some in the party might believe  supplying an opening  mr  orourke senses  for a unifying figure in a bog of partisan warriors  check out the democratic field with our candidate tracker  robby mook  mrs  clintons campaign manager in 2016  said that mr  orourke stands apart as a politician who can drive his own news  independent of mr  trump  alluding to his history of social media ready flourishes on the campaign trail its not just a matter of being authentic  mr  mook said  its authentically taking on trump and challenging political norms still  most candidates considered to be top 2020 contenders tend to check at least one of the following three boxes  a firm policy bedrock anchoring their campaigns  like the economic platforms of mr  sanders or ms  warren  the potential to make history  like ms  harris or her female senate peers in the field  or deep experience and national standing  like mr  biden mr  orourke would appear to satisfy none of these descriptions  though his instinct for viral internet ubiquity and generational uplift may amount to its own category his fans compare him to mr  obama or the kennedys  a font of rangy inspiration  rarely dwelling on his record  but mr  orourke would enter the race without a signal achievement over six years as an el paso congressman  nor an obvious big ticket policy idea that might animate his bid in public settings of late  mr  orourke has placed immigration  education and especially climate change at the center of his remarks  which tend to focus most on a high minded but vague message of uniting a divided nation  perhaps mindful of this reputation  he has recently unveiled multi point plans on immigration and criminal justice reform  both sketch out ideas he has largely outlined before friends say he has cycled through a number of policy passions through the years  marijuana legalization  advocacy for veterans  rural hospital access  often prompted by insights from the people he meets its the time that calls his issues  said steve ortega  a friend who served on the el paso city council with him mr  orourke spent much of the last two months of 2018 finishing his work in congress  condensing his preparation period even more tightly  in recent weeks  though  he has done some of the more typical work of a politician considering a run for president  conferring with longtime staff and others who he hopes might join his cause  speaking to key groups  like a conference of hispanic leaders in chicago and gun control advocates in his hometown  headlining a rally to counter mr  trumps call for a border wall when the president appeared in el paso but his indecisiveness has compelled some veteran democratic aides who admire him to accept positions with other candidates  several people who have spoken to his team came away questioning whether mr  orourke was thoroughly prepared for the crush of a national race  some suggested he lacked detailed plans like a comprehensive strategy for amassing delegates   mr  orourke and his advisers have  however  spoken to campaign veterans with experience in managing the delegate process about possibly joining his team  according to a person familiar with the discussions  unlike other candidates who recruited staff members over the past year with a wink and a nod  all but sure that they would enter the race  mr  orourke was still conveying uncertainty as recently as last month  according to the people who spoke to him since then  he has sounded firmer i think he feels his time is now  said randi weingarten  the president of the american federation of teachers  who met with mr  orourke at length recently ms  weingarten  speaking with mr  orourke and his wife  amy  in el paso  raised the possibility of mr  orourkes challenging senator john cornyn in 2020 texas democrats have prodded him on this score as well  but few expect mr  orourke to confine his ambitions to another state level race  after prolific success with small dollar donors during the midterms  mr  orourke is likely to have little trouble raising enough money to get a presidential run off the ground  his presence could energize some crucial voting blocs  like young people  who formed much of his coalition in texas if he got in  it would be a pretty big game changer  said eliana locke  who leads the college democrats at the university of wisconsin madison  where mr  orourke met with students last month supporters also say it is laughable that some liberals  particularly allies of mr  sanders  have described mr  orourke as a squishy moderate because of a congressional record that sometimes veered toward centrism more recently  mr  orourke moved well to the left of many 2018 democrats by raising the prospect of impeaching mr  trump  argued for the destruction of existing border barriers between el paso and mexico  and  in perhaps his most widely seen social media moment  defended the professional football players who were kneeling in protest during the national anthem in texas  ted cruz called me a socialist  im too liberal for texas  mr  orourke told the students in wisconsin  outside of texas  people say  is he really a democrat  i think hes a closet republican  i dont know where i am on a spectrum  and i almost could care less  i just want to get to better things for this country mr  ortega  the friend from the city council  suggested that part of mr  orourkes appeal owes to his self awareness on matters of substance  he knows what he doesnt know and is unafraid to concede that a question extends beyond his expertise hes not the kind of guy whos going to give you a made up  half baked answer  mr  ortega said for now  supporters would settle for the fully baked

 want to get this briefing by email  heres the sign up   good evening  heres the latest 1  the f b i  opened an inquiry into whether president trump was secretly working with russia after he fired james comey as f b i  director  according to former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation the inquiry carried explosive implications  counterintelligence investigators had to consider whether the presidents own actions constituted a possible threat to national security the special counsel  robert mueller  took over the inquiry when he was appointed days after f b i  officials opened it  the investigation also had a criminal aspect  which has long been publicly known  whether mr  trumps firing of mr  comey constituted obstruction of justice the inquiry into mr  trump is part of mr  muellers broader examination of how russia interfered in the 2016 election and whether any trump associates conspired  it is unclear whether mr  mueller is still pursuing the

shutdown became the longest in american history our white house correspondents analyzed the mood in washington officially  republicans blame democrats  privately  many concede  the stalemate over

antelope wells  n m   the border patrols tiny base in the southwest corner of new mexico is so remote that the wind howls through the surrounding basin where mountain lions still stalk their prey but that hasnt stopped thousands of central americans from journeying in recent weeks to the rural outpost and other isolated points along the southwest border  launching increasingly desperate bids for asylum in the united states in a two day span in january  362 migrants surrendered to the border patrol in antelope wells  overwhelming the small bases capacity to process asylum requests  last week  a new group of 306 migrants arrived at the same location  including children in need of immediate medical care  a situation officials in new mexico say is without precedent prompting these trips to ever more remote border locations are not only the nearly 700 miles of border wall and fencing built since 2006  but the trump administrations increasingly rigid immigration policies aimed at deterring the flow of migrant families  mostly from central america  that have streamed in from mexico since 2014 over the past year  the government has limited the number of asylum seekers who are allowed to present their cases each day at certain ports of entry  stationed agents on bridges to turn asylum seekers away and launched tear gas at migrants attempting to cross the border near san diego the administration went even further last week  announcing that it would start requiring some asylum seekers to wait in mexico while their applications are processed  which can take years  officials plan to implement the new policy at the san ysidro border crossing near san diego before expanding it to crossings in arizona  new mexico and texas taken together  these moves effectively have forced some central american migrants to wait for months to apply for asylum  sometimes sleeping on the street or in crowded shelters in mexican border cities frustrated and increasingly desperate  thousands of families have lately been opting to pay smugglers to take them to remote border stations where they can surrender quickly to american officials and hope to be allowed to remain in the united states while their asylum claims are processed in december  which saw a record number of families arriving at the border  27 518 migrants traveling in families were apprehended in areas outside normal border stations  the el paso sector  which includes the suddenly busy area of rural new mexico  saw a 1 866 percent increase in family apprehensions during october and november of 2018  compared with the same period a year earlier pushing migrants toward remote desert locations puts them at higher risk of dehydration  heatstroke or hypothermia  most are choosing the more dangerous crossing routes because they have been foreclosed from seeking asylum at the more widely traveled border crossings  said fernando garcia  director of the border network for human rights in el paso  how else to explain the desperation of thousands of people making it to the middle of nowhere just so they can surrender to border patrol trump administration officials have argued that the new policies are an attempt to discourage migrants from even attempting the dangerous trips through mexico where they are especially vulnerable to extortion and human trafficking  officials contend that existing legislation encourages parents to bring children along on the journey katie waldman  a spokeswoman for the department of homeland security  laid blame on the federal government having to comply with the flores agreement  a 1997 legal settlement aimed at preventing lengthy detentions of migrant children  and subsequent legislation codifying parts of the settlement into federal law we continue to call on congress to address this humanitarian and security crisis that entices smugglers to bring families across the border  ms  waldman said border patrol officials have put forward various theories about why crossings at remote locations are climbing that have nothing to do with the administrations policies  kevin mcaleenan  commissioner of customs and border protection  said in a conference call with reporters in december that smugglers could be trying to hold down the transit fees they pay to other criminal organizations with sway in northern mexico by dropping migrants near remote locations like antelope wells in an interview in el paso  jose romero  a supervisory agent in the border patrols sector that oversees operations in new mexico  offered another explanation  claiming that mexican cannabis smugglers were trying to distract agents in the field by flooding remote stations with asylum seekers our adversary is no idiot  mr  romero said  adding that while agents were arresting 247 migrants in antelope wells one january day  traffickers were trying to smuggle hundreds of pounds of marijuana across the border in another location  now they know where our weak spots are  he said the administration has not been unmindful of the hazards of migrants venturing into little traveled regions  partly in an attempt to deter such crossings and what government officials describe as meritless asylum claims  the administration tried last year to refuse to accept asylum applications from anyone who had not entered the country at a legal border crossing  but that policy was blocked by the courts  and antelope wells  though remote  is a legal border crossing just how dangerous such crossings are became apparent in december  when jakelin caal maquin  a 7 year old girl from guatemala  died in united states custody after she and her father crossed the border in a group of 163 migrants that surrendered to agents at antelope wells  only a few weeks later  an 8 year old boy from guatemala  felipe gmez alonzo  died after crossing the border about three miles west of the paso del norte port of entry in el paso but the numbers have only continued to grow  since the start of the 2019 fiscal year  the border patrol said  it has found at least 24 groups of 100 or more migrants that had crossed around the bootheel  the sparsely populated area where new mexicos border with mexico dips southward like a cowboy boots heel at the end of a 45 mile road from the decaying hamlet of hachita that runs through grazing lands dotted with creosote bushes  the border patrol has maintained a small presence at antelope wells for decades  a sign says the base is open from 10 a m  to 4 p m  the population of antelope wells  once 2  sometimes soars all the way into the high single digits when more than a handful of agents are deployed here for weeklong assignments at another remote point to the west in arizona  the border patrol reported that 376 migrants had tunneled through the sandy soil under the border fence near yuma  earlier this month and then surrendered to agents  the group  which included dozens of children  ranks among the largest groups of families and unaccompanied children ever arrested on the border with mexico immigration activists say the increase in remote crossings is just the latest development in a decades long effort to push immigration out of urban areas  tracing back at least to operation blockade  a clinton administration initiative in 1993 to curb unauthorized crossings in the city of el paso  border fencing erected in southern california and arizona in recent years drove some of the biggest migration flows toward the rio grande valley in texas  where the river marks the border and many migrants are able to cross with a short boat ride busy border crossings like the one in mcallen  tex   now have relatively elaborate infrastructure set up to handle newly arrived families seeking asylum  but no such facilities exist in this stretch of rural new mexico  raising fears that the recent deaths of the two guatemalan children wont be the last the grim cost of united states immigration policies is hardly new  law enforcement authorities have found the remains of about 8 000 migrants who have died while crossing the border with mexico since the 1990s  and while undetected illegal border crossings have fallen sharply over the past decade  hundreds of migrants continue to die making the attempt each year at least 413 migrants were found dead along the border in 2018  according to a preliminary count by the international organization for migration  up from 412 in 2017 and 399 in 2016 were seeing the increase in people crossing out here  and were afraid  said amanda adame  39  a cattle rancher whose family lives in hachita  about 45 miles north of antelope wells  were fearful for the families that are going across and fearful for our own safety still  humanitarian groups say they are waging an uphill battle to save lives along the border  some cite the conviction in january of four volunteers from the unitarian universalist church in tucson on charges of abandonment of property after they left caches of food and water in an arizona wildlife refuge where migrants have died while crossing into the united states asylum seekers shouldn t have to cross in the middle of the desert  said justine orlovsky schnitzler  a member of the advocacy group no more deaths in tucson  this is the newest stage of policies that have been sentencing migrants to death for decades .
good tuesday morning  want this by email  sign up here the justice department partly unsealed a pair of indictments yesterday that accuse the chinese telecommunications firm of trying to steal trade secrets  evade economic sanctions on iran and obstruct a criminal investigation into its behavior the context  the charges come as officials from beijing and washington prepare to continue trade negotiations and as the trump administration tries to shoulder huawei out of international efforts to build the next generation of wireless networks  known as 5g  the company has denied the claims  a spokesman for chinas industry and information technology ministry called them unfair and immoral the allegations  the u s  says that meng wanzhou  huaweis chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder  ren zhengfei  participated in a plot to defraud four large banks into clearing millions of dollars in transactions with iran in violation of international sanctions  american officials say that huawei tried to impede their investigation by destroying evidence and by moving employees out of the u s  to prevent them from being called as witnesses  the company  prosecutors say  also stole information about a phone testing robot called tappy from t mobile facilities in washington state and encouraged employees to steal other confidential information from competitors what now  matthew whitaker  the acting attorney general  said that the u s  government wants to have ms  meng extradited from canada  where she was detained last year at washingtons request and where officials are now on tricky political turf trying to balance american and chinese interests  the tussle has the industry on edge  an internal assessment from deutsche telekom concluded that the 5g rollout in europe would be delayed by at least two years and cost billions of euros if governments banned huawei  whose technology underpins much of the current network infrastructure                             todays dealbook briefing was written by andrew ross sorkin and stephen grocer in new york  and tiffany hsu and gregory schmidt in paris                             the huawei charges will complicate

robert lighthizer  president trumps top trade negotiator  and steven mnuchin  the treasury secretary  on thursday  mr  liu is expected to meet with mr  trump mr  mnuchin said there had been significant movement on talks that involved very complicated issues  including intellectual property protections and questions of enforcement  the chinese may offer to increase their purchases of u s  farm products and energy  and slightly change their industrial policies  while pushing back on demands to eliminate subsidies to favored industries the parties have until early march to reach an agreement  or else risk an escalation in the trade conflict mr  trump is being pressured by the markets and the corporate sector to deliver a deal  a recent survey found that his trade policies had led more than a third of american manufacturers to raise prices  yesterday  the chip maker nvidia and the bulldozer builder caterpillar both issued warnings about business conditions in china as eswar prasad  the former head of the international monetary funds china division  notes the five weeks when much of the government was out of commission cost the u s  economy  11 billion  nearly a quarter

threatening to shut down the government to get the damage will be mitigated somewhat as furloughed workers start to receive their back pay  but with the government only funded for three weeks  many

hi  welcome to on politics  your guide to the day in national politics  im lisa lerer  your host  get on politics delivered to your inbox  for jlia quintanilla  a janitor at the department of agriculture  the government shutdown isnt about building a border wall or standing up to president trump  its about groceries more specifically  its about being able to feed the three people living in her home  ms  quintanilla  her disabled mother and her 3 year old grandson i had put a lot of food in the freezer and were taking it all out  the last fish and the last shrimp and the last chicken is all were eating now  said ms  quintanilla  54  whos worked for nearly three decades cleaning government offices since she came to the united states from el salvador  im worried about not having food this week as the government shutdown continues into a third week  were starting to hit the pain point  where the impacts will begin to ripple far beyond the 800 000 affected federal employees  many of whom will miss their first paycheck this week  those workers are already cutting their spending  meaning that everyone from the owner of city cup cafe in oakland  calif   to landlords in duluth  minn   are feeling the effects theres a lot that the government does thats been put on hold  like collecting critical scientific data  providing business loans and funding some health care services and then theres the world of government contractors  a sizable industry that relies on the federal government for their income  including not only the usual suspects  like big defense contractors  but security guards and cleaning services like the one that employs ms  quintanilla ms  quintanilla makes about  600 a week from her work at the department of agriculture  a second  part time job cleaning at the department of housing and urban development provides some additional income  she hasnt gotten paid from either since the shutdown began  before christmas  and shes scared of what the future might bring months or years  she asked  through a translator  when told on friday of mr  trumps suggestion that the shutdown could continue almost indefinitely  oh my god  were going to die of hunger her story is just one example of the economic damage wrought by a prolonged shutdown if it lasts into february  it could mean severe cuts in food stamps for 38 million low income americans  economists have warned that if it stretches into march  the shutdown could shake consumer confidence and impact the economy contractors are in a particularly untenable situation  because they work for private companies  theyve never received back pay when the government reopens  advocates are drafting legislation to change that  but it remains far from certain whether it can actually pass the damage is already done  says hector figueroa  president of 32bj s e i u   a labor union that includes 2 000 building service workers caught up in the shutdown  our members dont have savings to rely on  they

to start campaigning  my colleague astead herndon traveled with ms  warren through the state over the weekend  and he sent us this dispatch in her five city iowa tour  senator elizabeth warren gave a preview of what figures to be her defining message throughout the campaign season  a broad defense of government intervention  and the overarching belief that washington corruption is the must solve problem of our time across the state  ms  warren told voters that the countrys politics had been corrupted at its core  even before president trump  and that the next president must work to undo the harm  she seemed comfortable in settings big and small  including a larger des moines rally where she lost her voice from a lingering cold but  to paraphrase the t shirts at her merch table  persisted nevertheless key applause lines  when ms  warren calls for ethics reform in washington and a mandate for all federal candidates to release their tax returns  the crowd also sits at ready attention when she talks about black white wealth disparities and tells more of her personal story of humble beginnings  unlike other politicians  who may begin with a joke to put a crowd at ease  ms  warren begins with the story of her familys near foreclosure  and how that informed her political thinking attendees  some of whom did not consider themselves supporters of ms  warren at the outset  often told me they left feeling positively about her candidacy  many said it was the first time they had heard about her familys struggles with poverty one worry  though  several iowans mentioned fears that republicans had already branded her as too far left  and one audience member asked ms  warren about her decision to take a dna test to prove her native ancestry  ms  warren again avoided apologizing or acknowledging the criticism from some native american groups  who remain livid at her decision read asteads latest story from iowa  with warren visit  iowans get the first taste of 2020  im ready

washington  for weeks  senator mitch mcconnell  the republican leader  has remained conspicuously on the sidelines  insisting that it was up to president trump and democrats to negotiate an end to the partial shutdown of the federal government but with the shutdown soon to enter its third week  and mr  trump dug in on his demand for  5 billion to build a border wall  mr  mcconnell for the first time is facing pressure from members of his own party to step in to resolve the stalemate that has left 800 000 federal workers either furloughed or working without pay by absenting himself  mr  mcconnell had hoped to push the blame for a prolonged shutdown onto democrats while protecting republicans running for re election in 2020  including himself  much as democrats did in 2018  republicans will face a difficult map in 2020  with a handful of incumbent senators facing re election in swing states or states won by hillary clinton in the 2016 presidential race but on thursday  as a new era of divided government opened in washington  perhaps the most vulnerable republican  senator cory gardner of colorado  broke ranks to become the first member of his party to call for an end to the shutdown  with or without mr  trumps wall funding i think we should pass a continuing resolution to get the government back open  mr  gardner  whose state has a heavy federal presence  told the hill newspaper  the senate has done it last congress  we should do it again today a second vulnerable republican  senator susan collins of maine  one of the chambers most moderate members  said thursday that she would support separating homeland security funding from the other bipartisan appropriations bills already approved in committee to reopen much of the government  as democrats have proposed  but mr  mcconnell is refusing to take up the democrats measures it would be great to have them signed into law because there is not great controversy over them  and at least wed be getting those workers back to work  ms  collins said mr  mcconnells distant posture reflects his new status as the man in the middle in a capitol where democrats now control the house of representatives and republicans have netted two seats to hold a 53 to 47 majority in the senate  he has repeatedly said he will not bring up legislation that mr  trump does not support  a point he reiterated in a speech on thursday on the senate floor ive made it clear on several occasions  and let me say it again  the senate will not take up any proposal that does not have a real chance of passing this chamber and getting a presidential signature  mr  mcconnell said  lets not waste the time  lets not get off on the wrong foot  with house democrats using their new platform to produce political statements rather than serious solutions after two years of trying to advance mr  trumps agenda  mr  mcconnell now sees his primary job as standing in the way of speaker nancy pelosi  who vowed in her inaugural speech on thursday to reach across the aisle in this chamber  but who is also poised to pass legislation on a bevy of liberal priorities  including gun restrictions and protections for young undocumented immigrants i think mcconnell is going to be trumps best friend when it comes to blocking all of nancy pelosis worst shots  said scott jennings  a republican strategist who is close to mr  mcconnell  for trump and mcconnell  theres a lot of good politics for that  particularly for mcconnell in kentucky democrats are trying to drive a wedge between republican leaders and their vulnerable incumbents up for re election in 2020  especially mr  gardner  ms  collins  senator thom tillis of north carolina and senator martha mcsally of arizona  who was appointed to fill the seat left vacant after senator john mccains death  the campaign arm of the senate democrats released a series of statements to local news media on thursday targeting each senator and demanding they make a choice to fund the government or own the consequences cory gardner owns every miserable consequence of his pointless government shutdown  and he just realized its a problem for his own political career  read one from david bergstein  a campaign committee spokesman  when he votes 99 percent of the time with president trump and then tries to run away from his record  all it proves is coloradans cant trust him to look out for anyone but himself and senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  called on mr  mcconnell to jump into the talks with mr  trump the power to end the shutdown is in two peoples hands  donald trump and mitch mcconnell  mr  schumer said thursday in a brief hallway interview  either one of them could end the shutdown  they both should try mr  mcconnell  76  is the longest serving senate republican leader in history and is a wily tactician  while he is not generally considered vulnerable  his popularity is lagging at home  a poll by western kentucky university last spring found that only 30 percent of kentuckians approve of his job performance  sticking with mr  trump  whose approval ratings top 50 percent in kentucky  is in his own political interest but if he wants to hang onto his job as majority leader  mr  mcconnell must also be mindful of the political fortunes of republicans seeking re election in states won by mrs  clinton in 2016 or by democrats in november  a prolonged government shutdown is the last thing those lawmakers need  and even some republicans up for re election in states won by mr  trump  like senator shelley moore capito of west virginia  sound uneasy a shutdown  in my view  is a no win proposition  ms  capito said  adding that she heard complaints from transportation security administration workers as she was returning to washington for the start of the new congress this week  ms  capito is the chairwoman of the appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the department of homeland security  the panel has already passed a bill funding the department  including  1 6 billion for border security including fencing  but with no money for mr  trumps wall it is just a lot of unneeded stress on a lot of people  she said of the shutdown i would like to see it resolved soon  said senator joni ernst  republican of iowa  who also faces re election in 2020  she repeated herself for emphasis  i would like to see it resolved soon for mr  mcconnell  the shutdown fight presents a dynamic that is likely to become familiar over the next two years  as house democrats rush to pass long sought liberal policies and  in many cases  try to use the chamber to highlight republicans opposition to legislative changes they believe are overwhelmingly popular  mr  mcconnell has already been burned once  having negotiated and passed through the senate a plan to avoid the shutdown in the first place only to have mr  trump pull his support at the last minute he faces that reality now on every issue  whats the white house going to do with this  said senator richard j  durbin  democrat of illinois and mr  schumers no  2  he predicted that mr  mcconnells approach  to simply stand in the way so that mr  trump is not forced to use his veto pen  would only change if republican senators up for re election begin to fear political costs of carrying the presidents water senator john cornyn of texas  mr  mcconnells former no  2  compared mr  mcconnells task to threading a needle  mr  mcconnells former chief of staff  josh holmes  said it was considerably more simple than that hes seen this situation many times before and knows where the leverage points are  mr  holmes said  he knows that there are attempts to try to get republicans to negotiate against themselves  but hes not going to be bullied into putting his conference into a disadvantage senator richard c  shelby  republican of alabama and the appropriations committee chairman  has taken a more activist stance  running sideline negotiations with democrats over the holidays to try to hatch a compromise that they and mr  trump could support  but those negotiations ultimately amounted to nothing  and on thursday  mr  shelby predicted a protracted shutdown i am thinking we might be in for a long haul here  he told reporters  if we can ever get over this  then you have a new week  a new day and so forth  but if we dont get over this  if this goes on for months and months  it could  hope not  then this might be a preview of coming attractions mr  shelby predicted the standoff would end with one side agreeing to come to the negotiating table  but he bemoaned the half dozen appropriations bills he helped guide through committee that have  at least for now  been laid to waste absolutely  its frustrating that we have not reached a resolution  he said .
washington  ramona wormley mitsis got welcome news in december  after years of waiting  the federal government had approved a subsidy that allowed her to rent a three bedroom house  bracketed by a white picket fence to keep her two autistic sons from bolting into traffic a few days later  the dream was deferred  the department of housing and urban development  one of the federal agencies hit hardest by the shutdown  would not be able to pay her new landlord until the government reopened it is my dream home  its like my last stop  its like my last chance  you know  said ms  wormley mitsis  39  who lives in fall river  mass   and is staying with relatives until the check clears  we drive by that house all the time  its torture  waiting  waiting  waiting one month after the government shutdown began  its effects have begun to hurt some of the most vulnerable americans  not just homeless people  but also those who are one crisis away from the streets  and nonprofit groups dedicated to helping low income renters are already scrambling to survive without the lifeblood payments from hud that began being cut off on jan  1 that has left a small but growing number of tenants  like ms  wormley mitsis  in limbo  landlords  especially smaller management companies operating on narrow margins  have begun pressuring poor  disabled and elderly tenants who cannot afford to make up the difference on friday afternoon  a tristate management employee in newport  ark   taped notices on the doors of 43 federally subsidized tenants  demanding that they cover the gap between what they typically pay and the full rent as of feb  1  2019  all tenants will be responsible for full basic rent  the letter said  we will extend the due date for the rent to the 20th of the month  this will remain in effect until the government opens up amanda neeleys heart sank  the three bedroom home she shares with her daughter and granddaughter goes for a monthly rate of  505  of which she is required to pay  110  the rest  which her landlord now wants her to pay  is supposed to be picked up by the federal government under a program intended to help out the rural poor this is putting a hurt on all of us  everything was going along normal until they decided to shut down the government  said ms  neeley  48  who gets by on a small disability check  i cant pay that much  it is beyond my means  it is not fair a tristate management employee hung up the phone when asked about the policy on friday  but lawyers for the poor say that renters can fight evictions in court  and many organizations  including the fair housing action center of maryland  have begun distributing fliers informing tenants of their rights under local law a week earlier  a property manager at another subsidized low income housing complex in rural arkansas  run by the agriculture department  sent a similar notice to tenants  until the government opens again  you are responsible for all of your rental amount  the letter said the letter was rescinded when federal officials vowed to cover the payments most other social safety net programs are facing a similar  if less imminent  emergency  the department of agriculture has announced that funding for the supplemental nutrition assistance program  which provides food stamps and other aid to almost 40 million poor and working class americans  will run out by march 1  and other nutrition programs are facing the same fate the department of health and human services was largely exempt from the showdown and medicaid and medicare are not affected by the funding lapse  but congress failed to reauthorize one of its main programs  the  16 5 billion temporary assistance for needy families  which provides states with block grants for a range of services  cash welfare and child care  states are likely to pick up the tab for most programs  but a protracted shutdown lasting into the spring could result in cutbacks  according to analysts while the housing crisis is just starting to hit individual tenants  it has already wreaked havoc on organizations responsible for housing homeless people and providing support services to veterans  people with disabilities and victims of domestic abuse the funding lapse is being felt most acutely by providers who owe their survival to the month to month cash flow provided by the annual  2 8 billion federal homeless assistance grant program susie sinclair smith has helped build a network to help homeless people in marylands high rent washington suburbs  an impressive but precarious jenga tower of programs dependent on  3 million in annual federal funding the crisis has arrived  said ms  sinclair smith  the executive director of the montgomery county coalition for the homeless  the last payment the group received from hud was a  250 000 reimbursement for its december expenses  which arrived at the start of the year the coalition is now preparing to tap its modest reserve fund  of just over  200 000  that was intended to cover unintended emergencies  like floods or the loss benefits by individual clients  it will be used to bridge the loss of federal cash to cover rent  the salaries of case managers who provide support to disabled and elderly clients  maintenance costs  and other expenses for the 250 households of formerly homeless people we can get by for a while

clashing with the housing secretary  ben carson critics said hud officials inadequately planned for an extended shutdown  failing to recertify more than 1 000 contracts with landlords who provided subsidized housing i am thoroughly disgusted with the department of housing and urban developments failure to follow its own contingency plan for the shutdown  representative maxine waters  democrat of california and chairwoman of the house financial services committee  wrote in a letter to mr  carson on friday ms  waters was particularly critical of mr  carson for exposing homeless programs  including those providing housing for victims of domestic violence  to financial harm a spokesman for mr  carson did not immediately respond to a request for comment the shutdown has stopped vital funding allocations for public housing repairs  new housing voucher applications and even the processing of post disaster housing requests from puerto rico and several hurricane ravaged states hud officials often play down concerns about the impact of funding decisions on poor people  but privately  they too are growing increasingly concerned that some tenants and local groups that rely on funding from the department could be stranded if the shutdown lasts even a few more weeks smaller organizations  especially those that serve rural areas  are particularly vulnerable because they often lack endowments  cash reserves or lines of credit that their big city counterparts can tap we are providing services without getting paid for those services  and eventually that is going to catch up

washington  president trump  facing a growing public backlash over the partial government shutdown  shifted course on saturday and offered democrats a deal  temporary protections for roughly 700 000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for  5 7 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border but the proposal  which mr  trump unveiled in a 13 minute address from the white house  appeared dead on arrival in the capitol  speaker nancy pelosi rejected it even before mr  trump spoke  and senator chuck schumer  the democratic leader  denounced the offer as not a compromise but more hostage taking with the shutdown entering its fifth week and polls showing a majority of the public blaming mr  trump  the presidents advisers have been searching for an exit strategy  saturdays speech grew out of talks that vice president mike pence and the presidents son in law and senior adviser  jared kushner  have had in recent days with lawmakers including senator mitch mcconnell  the majority leader the proposal was mr  trumps first public offer to democrats since the partial shutdown began nearly a month ago  it came after an acrimonious week of tit for tat politics  in which ms  pelosi told the president he could not deliver his state of the union address in the capitol until the shutdown was over  and the president retaliated by grounding a plane that was supposed to take ms  pelosi on a fact finding mission to afghanistan in casting the plan as a compromise  the president sought to shift pressure to democrats  who have repeatedly refused to give mr  trump any money for his border wall  to end the shutdown  but democrats continued to insist they will not negotiate with mr  trump over border security until the government reopens over the course of his administration  mr  trump has repeatedly sought to curb both legal and illegal immigration  he has revoked temporary protected status  or t p s   which offers crucial protections for immigrants  for people from some latin american and african countries  and he has moved to rescind deferred action for childhood arrivals  or daca  an obama era program that shielded the young undocumented immigrants known as dreamers from deportation in the deal he outlined on saturday  mr  trump offered to restore t p s  protection for 300 000 people  and said he would allow 700 000 dreamers to keep their protections for three more years in exchange for  5 7 billion for a border barrier that is our plan  mr  trump said  border security  daca  t p s  many other things  straightforward  fair  reasonable and common sense with lots of compromise  the proposal  mr  trump added  was intended to break the logjam and provide congress with a path forward the speech was the second time during the shutdown that the president addressed the nation about the immigration crisis  but unlike his first address  a prime time broadcast from the oval office that leaned heavily on dark messaging about the dangers of crime and illegal drugs flowing across the border  mr  trump seemed on saturday to soften his tone he paired the address with his first naturalization ceremony at the white house  a move intended to underscore the idea that he supports legal immigration  and his language was markedly different  instead of insisting on the big beautiful wall he promised during his 2016 campaign  mr  trump took care to use the word barrier as well  and seemed to pare back his vision for it calling the wall a powerful and beautifully designed see through steel barrier on our southern border  mr  trump said  this is not a 2 000 mile concrete structure from sea to sea  these are steel barriers in high priority locations  much of the border is already protected by natural barriers such as mountains and water mr  trump noted that he had adopted some democratic proposals on border security  the president proposed  800 million for humanitarian assistance and  805 million for drug detection technology  in addition to funding for 2 750 more border agents and law enforcement officials and 75 new immigration judge teams in her talking points  issued to democrats  ms  pelosi said her party favored new drug  weapons and contraband scanning technology at official ports of entry  and filling the more than 3 000 vacancies for customs officers  ms  pelosi also intends to bring up legislation in the coming days that includes an additional  1 billion for border security  including  563 million for 75 new immigration judges and support staff even so  democrats roundly criticized the presidents plan  they were particularly incensed that mr  trumps offer extended protections to dreamers and t p s  recipients that he himself revoked  and they said the deal was a nonstarter because it did not offer any permanent protections for dreamers i think its simply more fake promises raising false hopes  senator richard blumenthal  democrat of connecticut  said  it will fool few americans because its neither serious nor credible as a real remedy for dreamers some on the right also pushed back  describing the proposal as amnesty  james carafano  a national security expert at the heritage foundation who worked on mr  trumps transition  was among the critics  amnesty encourages further illegal immigration  incentivizes the tragedy of human trafficking and undermines our citizens confidence in the rule of law  he said mr  pence  briefing reporters after mr  trumps remarks  said the speech reflected a painstaking process of listening to lawmakers  including rank and file democrats who made it clear they believed that protections for daca and t p s  recipients must be included in a border security deal and he pushed back forcefully against critics like mr  carafano who said the measure amounted to an unacceptable amnesty for undocumented immigrants there is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal  mr  pence said but that was one reason many democrats considered it unacceptable  other senior administration officials made it clear that part of mr  trumps strategy was to try to drive a wedge within the party between those who want to hold out for a much more generous solution and those who may feel enough political pressure to end the shutdown that they will feel obliged to support it noting that tuesday is the deadline for the government to reopen in time to prevent federal employees from going a second consecutive pay period without a check  mick mulvaney  the acting chief of staff  said senate democrats had a tricky decision to make  he also noted that the presidents ability to declare a national emergency was absolutely still a tool available to mr  trump to find funds to build the wall if a legislative agreement could not be reached now it will be up to mr  mcconnell to put legislation incorporating mr  trumps proposal on the senate floor mr  mcconnell  who has insisted he will not put any legislation on the floor unless the president will sign it  spoke to mr  trump  mr  kushner and mr  pence on thursday night about finding a way forward mr  mcconnell told the president that before he could bring up legislation on the senate floor  he needed a public reassurance that mr  trump would sign it  one person close to the talks said  speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions the presidents proposal strikes a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle  mr  mcconnell said in a statement after mr  trumps speech if mr  mcconnell does indeed put a bill on the floor  as the president said he would  senate democrats will have to decide whether to block it or let it come up for a vote  despite democrats vow to reject the measure  it could create an opening for negotiations between the two sides the shutdown stalemate is creating increasing nervousness on capitol hill  especially among republicans seeking re election in democratic leaning states  one of them  senator susan collins of maine  is among only a handful of republicans who have broken with the president and called for the government to reopen without a border security deal on saturday  she praised the president  saying she hoped that mr  trumps offer would lead to constructive debate that will end this impasse white house aides and allies of mr  trump said saturday that mr  trump succeeded in ratcheting up the political pressure on ms  pelosi  especially if the senate succeeded in passing a bill the democrats talking points have been that the president is solely responsible for shutting down the government  marc short  the former white house legislative director  said  this puts more onus on them to come back and say why this proposal is insufficient but one reason democrats are so leery of the deal is that they have been down this road with the president before  last year  mr  trump and mr  schumer negotiated  25 billion in wall money for a pathway to citizenship for the dreamers  but that deal fell apart when hard line white house advisers persuaded the president to back away the standoff over the shutdown  some former aides noted  was the first time mr  trump has had to engage in meaningful  high stakes negotiations  but even that has come as a last resort  in what some have likened to negotiating out of desperation after failing to score political points .
representative steve king of iowa  who was stripped of his house committee seats on monday night after making remarks defending white supremacy  has a long history of racist comments and insults about immigrants republicans rarely rebuked him until recently  with some suggesting that mr  kings language and views were new to them this just popped up on friday  representative steve scalise  the second ranking house republican  said on sunday  when asked if the party would penalize mr  king for saying  in an interview with the times  white nationalist  white supremacist  western civilization  how did that language become offensive national republicans courted his political support in iowa  he was a national co chairman of ted cruzs 2016 presidential effort and of gov  kim reynolds 2018 election  house leadership appointed him chairman of the subcommittee on the constitution and civil justice  and president trump boasted in the oval office that he raised more money for mr  king than for anyone else yet mr  king  who won a ninth term in november  has publicly promoted white nationalists and neo nazis on twitter and disparaged nonwhite groups for years   as republicans rush to condemn steve king  some ask  why not trump  mr  king on the house floor  speaking of how law enforcement officers can spot undocumented immigrants mr  king in a speech opposing the affordable care acts mandate to cover contraception on a panel at the conservative political action conference with peter brimelow  a white nationalist  mr  king referred to multiculturalism as mr  king on why he opposes legal status for dreamers  who were brought into the country as children .
st  louis  andrea caviedes and her friend  ximena gumpel  live in the st  louis suburbs  have two children and helped plan a christmas party together  but when it comes to the partial federal shutdown  now entering its fourth week  they might as well live in different countries ms  caviedes  42  a furloughed bilingual loan processor in the agriculture departments rural development program  spent the week visiting her churchs food pantry  applying for unemployment insurance and job hunting at walmart and walgreens it has been terrible  said ms  caviedes  a single mother whose 10 year old son is partially blind and autistic  my rent bill is due  my electric bill is due  my water bill is due  and i have medical expenses for ms  gumpel  46  whose husband works at a chemical company  the shutdown is no more than a recurring segment on the nightly news  she feels for her friend  but it hasnt affected me at all  she said  you kind of push it aside and figure it will pass  that its just political bickering after all  the schools are still open  the mail is still being delivered  the trash is still being picked up  the buses are still running and  most important  her familys income is uninterrupted the shutdowns day to day impact on americans  both federal employees and the people who depend on the services they provide  shifts radically from workplace to workplace and neighbor to neighbor  on one side of the divide  the shutdown is inescapable  on the other  it is all but invisible some large scale ordeals  like a recession  are pervasive  quickly gumming up the economys gears and seeping into the national psyche  but the fallout from this stoppage is wildly uneven  zigzagging across communities and workplaces in unexpected ways  and fracturing americans reactions to the shutdown as well as the ways they experience it some reverberations depend on location  the shutdown touches one quarter of the federal government  the district of columbia  maryland and virginia have large concentrations of federal employees  but about four fifths of the roughly 800 000 of them who are not being paid live and work outside the capitals orbit  thousands are in crowded urban areas in populous states like california  new york  texas and florida  thousands more are in smaller cities and remote areas  where they often power the local economy  spending their paychecks at restaurants  gas stations  nail salons and stores the scattershot nature of what is funded and what is not is also varying the experience of public sector workers and private citizens   agencies including the pentagon  veterans affairs  and social security are operating because of appropriations bills that already passed  others like homeland security  justice  state  interior  agriculture  housing and urban development  environmental protection  and commerce are not so military bases are open  social security checks are going out  and g i  benefits are being processed  but farmers affected by the tariffs are unable to apply for emergency aid  tenants who depend on federal housing subsidies to cover their rent are facing eviction  private contractors working for the federal government are not getting paid  and rural homeowners and businesses who need a mortgage extension or guarantee cannot get one  farm country has stood by president trump  but the shutdown is pushing it to breaking point  in boulder  colo   where hives of researchers  engineers and scientists are variously funded by universities  private businesses  nonprofit organizations and the federal government  the effects can diverge from one desk to the next depending on who is providing the cash or sponsoring the research  colleagues who normally work side by side have vastly different prospects like the rows of numbered steel briefcases on the game show deal or no deal that can contain a disappointing penny or a million dollar jackpot consider the cooperative institute for research in environmental sciences  a partnership between the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the university of colorado  boulder the staff there and around the university falls  in essence  into three camps  explained waleed abdalati  the institutes director worst off are people employed directly by the federal government who cannot work and are not getting a paycheck then there are those paid by the university whose income is intact but who are locked out of their federal offices and may even be temporarily cut off from their research data the last group comprises university professors  researchers  students and others who are unaffected  for them  mr  abdalati said  its  shutdown  what shutdown  i am not feeling anything the first days of the stoppage in late december had the discouraging but familiar feel of previous short term budgetary standoffs between the president and congress  many private businesses were also closed or operating with skeleton staffs through the holidays  but as the work world revved back to life after the new year and many federal offices remained dark  the ripples extended further  air travel is starting to be affected as a growing number of security agents are refusing to work for no pay  twenty six miles from the boulder campus is the sprawling denver federal center in lakewood with 28 agencies spread across 44 buildings  its low slung buildings  ringed by wire fence  were abnormally quiet this week across the street  at a barbershop called sport clips  april guerrero  47  said business was way down  because so many people were now on furlough this has meant a pay cut of several hundred dollars for employees  who receive minimum wage and count on bonuses to pay rent  the majority of girls this week didnt get bonuses  she said  im trying to push it to the back of my mind  but eventually its going to affect all of us one of the few customers that day was lauren kramer  33  a furloughed microbiologist for the food and drug administration  who brought her son wade  10  for a haircut  after wade had climbed into the barber chair  ms  kramer put her face in her hands  clawing nervously at her chin she had turned down high paying jobs in the pharmaceutical industry for what she thought was a stable job with the federal government now ms  kramer  a single mother  found herself picking up food provided through a county program  unsure of when her next paycheck would arrive  i felt demoralized  she said  i felt like a lot of the efforts that i have made in my life  the hardships i have had to endure to get to where i am  was just kind of taken right out from under my feet when she told her best friend  jessica rasmussen  31  about her situation  ms  rasmussen was initially unsure what getting furloughed even meant  it hasnt affected me at all  it makes me feel terrible  said ms  rasmussen  a vocal teacher who is struggling with the thought that as she considers buying her first home  her best friend is worrying about feeding her son the shutdown  propelled by a dispute between the president and congress over building a border wall  is splitting the nation  she said its very frustrating  ms  rasmussen said  that wall is going straight through the country  not between us and mexico those divides continue to shift  blur and deepen  between friends  neighbors  family members  and co workers  as the shutdown entered its 22nd day on saturday to become the longest in the nations history  heres a rundown of what is and isnt affected by the shutdown  idled workers spoke of intense stress  anger and boredom in st  louis  furloughed employees at the agriculture departments rural development program coped in different ways  patricia battle  an accountant  was keeping the thermostat down in the home she shares with her husband  a veteran  her college age son  and her 10 year old grandson  ive been wearing layers in the house  said ms  battle  who earns about  70 000 a year  sweaters  warm clothes and two pairs of socks on thursday evening  ms  battle attended a meeting of her college alumni group  whose other members  unaffected by the shutdown  were surprised to learn that she was out of work when they come into the knowledge that were not being paid  its like  oh my  she said at one point  two members of the group took her aside and murmured a quiet prayer  asking god to keep her covered  i really appreciated that  ms  battle said  it made me feel like someone had a heart and rick willenberg  31  who earns  41 000 a year as a loan processor for the rural development program  is worrying about how to pay his own mortgage bill  its so arbitrary  he said  he had never before applied for unemployment insurance  but when he heard president trump say the shutdown could go on for months or even years  he said  i thought i better go ahead and file both he and his older brother  steve willenberg  who lives in a nearby suburb with his family  were drawn to work for the government out of a sense of civic duty  nurtured by a mother who is a nurse and a father who worked for general motors  we live pretty identical lives  rick said except that the department of veterans affairs  where steve works processing benefits  is funded  so while his younger brother protested the furlough outside the federal office complex in wind whipped weather  steve was enjoying the last day of his scheduled paid vacation in playa del carmen  mexico  where he swam with dolphins and drank pia coladas by the beach for the months of january and february  my department is on mandatory overtime of 20 hours a month to correct widespread delays in benefit payments caused by computer glitches  said steve willenberg  compare that to my brother not knowing when his next paycheck is going to come .
tijuana  mexico  pushed beyond their limits by prolonged waits in dangerous and squalid conditions in parts of northern mexico  thousands of caravan members who had been waiting to seek asylum in the united states appear to have given up  mexican officials said  dealing president trump an apparent win after a humbling week for his immigration agenda about 6 000 asylum seekers who had traveled en masse  many of them in defiance of mr  trumps demands that they turn around  arrived in northern mexico in late november as part of a caravan that originated in honduras  since then  more than 1 000 have accepted an offer to be returned home by the mexican government  the officials said  another 1 000 have decided to stay in mexico  accepting work permits that were offered to them last fall  at the height of international consternation over how to deal with the growing presence of migrant caravans mr  trump resorted on friday to declaring a national emergency after he failed to secure funding from congress for a border wall that he said would block migrants from entering the united states  but the data from mexican officials suggested that harsh policies he has introduced to crack down on asylum seekers may already be achieving some of its intended effects added this week to new policies that are bearing down on asylum seekers  which include tight limits on the number of people who can apply for the status each day and a heightened standard of proof to qualify  was the extension of a rule that certain asylum seekers must wait in mexico for the full duration of their legal cases  which can take years  read the first edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  the requirement originally applied only to adults  but the department of homeland security expanded it to include families with children as well among those who have been dissuaded  at least for now  is natali  32  who asked to be identified only by her first name because she feared for her safety  speaking from her modest apartment atop a steep hill in western tijuana  she explained that she and her husband had fled their home in el progreso  honduras  after she witnessed a murder carried out by a local criminal gang  soon after  she began to receive threats in the mail warning her to keep quiet once in mexico  they heard about the increasingly long odds of receiving asylum in the united states  and feared more than anything that officials there would return them to their home country  rather than crossing the border  they decided to seek humanitarian visas to remain in mexico legally for at least one year  and have slowly begun to build a life she still believes she might ask for asylum in the united states  but is realistic about her chances  i like tijuana  she said  its a very pretty city and theres a lot of work  more than anything  she fears the united states would deport her back to honduras mexican officials said the data on people who have deferred or given up their quest for asylum in the united states reinforced an idea that is often raised by mr  trump  that many caravan members are not truly desperate for protection what happened is that many people came on an adventure  trying their luck  said cesar palencia  tijuanas chief of migrant services  when they realized that it was hard to cross and the conditions in mexico were also difficult  among many factors  they decided to return home the honduran caravan ballooned in size as it swept through impoverished villages  drawing a swarm of national media attention and an eclectic mix of participants  many came from poverty  lacking education and resources  and said they were unfamiliar with the complex set of laws that would ultimately determine who would be granted legal status in the united states  and who would not immigrant advocates said that hype and false promises had attracted a group that was somewhat unrepresentative of typical asylum seekers  but they pointed to the roughly 4 000 members who had successfully entered the united states and had at least requested protected status to argue that most had legitimate claims michelle bran  the director of migrant rights and justice at the womens refugee commission  warned that while mr  trumps tough policies may discourage the undeserving  they might also endanger people who need protection  she said they would likely drive vulnerable migrants into the arms of human traffickers  who promise to provide passage into the united states it may look like its working in the short term  ms  bran said  but i dont think its a long term solution  its driving people further into the shadows and thats exactly the opposite of what we want when they arrived in mexico  many of the caravan members had been living in squalor  sleeping in tents or lean tos inside the benito jurez sports complex  a downpour devastated the grounds  and those who remained fled to a new expansive shelter called barretal on the outskirts of tijuana  once packed with 2 500 people  that location also recently closed because it had shrunk to fewer than 200 it is not the same as when we had barretal and benito jurez  said esme flores  an immigrant rights advocate at the san diego office of the american civil liberties union  it really feels that the population has moved on on friday  all that remained of the formerly bustling migrant quarter around the barretal shelter was a small camp around the corner  only partially covered by a tin roof  the conditions are far from comfortable  but the occupants said it was better than sleeping on sidewalks most were not yet ready to give up trying to enter the united states  but knew of others who had  elde rodriguez  26  said he had left honduras hoping to send money back to his wife and daughter  believing that he would not qualify for asylum  he tried last week to cross the border illegally but he and a friend were unable to find their away across and turned back theres enough work here in mexico  and you can live on that if youre alone  but you cant make enough to send money home  and thats the point about all this  he said  if i cant get in  ill just keep trying while tijuana appears to be emptying  large groups of migrants have accumulated in other areas along the border as a result of the new policies  after a riot the day before  authorities in mexico said on friday that they would disband a group of 1 400 central american asylum seekers who had been waiting in the city of piedras negras to cross the border into eagle pass  tex   according to news reports the trump administration has said that the latest policy requiring asylum seekers to wait in mexico  which it called migrant protection protocols  is a vital response to a crisis at the border  kirstjen nielsen  secretary of the department of homeland security  has said the policy aims to alleviate a humanitarian crisis on the border and secure the united states  introduced as a pilot program across the border from san diego  the administration plans to expand the policy into texas border patrol apprehensions of families along the southwest border remain near all time highs  though there was a slight downward turn in january  as is often the case  according the latest government figures  customs and border protection said more than 1 800 central american parents and children crossed the border illegally on monday  the largest number of families recorded on a single day  and like other asylum policies of this administration  the remain in mexico policy has already drawn legal scrutiny  leaving its future uncertain on thursday  the american civil liberties union and two other groups sued the administration on behalf of 11 asylum seekers who were required to wait in mexico  claiming that the policy  which was introduced last month at the san ysidro port of entry  near san diego  violates united states and international laws the lawsuit was filed in federal court in the northern district of california on behalf of migrants from guatemala

 want to get this briefing by email  heres the sign up   good morning  scientists find acceleration in ocean warming  president trump makes another push for a border wall  and a baby shark version becomes a global hit  heres the latest  in a new analysis published thursday  scientists found that the oceans are heating 40 percent faster than the u n  estimated five years ago  a finding with dire implications for climate change  it also concluded that ocean temperatures have broken records for several straight years a few months ago  a version of a study also found that the worlds oceans were heating faster  which we reported here in the briefing  but the study contained calculation errors that caused its authors to revise their estimates down  now  the revision is much closer to the new consensus why it matters  the oceans have always provided a critical buffer against the effects of climate change by absorbing most of the heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions  warmer oceans can lead to more powerful storms and increased stress on coral reefs the trip to mcallen  tex   a border community  is meant to press for funding for a wall president trump said he would probably declare

washington  at the beginning of the government shutdown  bill shine was about as far away from the capital as president trumps most senior communications official could get  while the president was complaining about sitting alone in the white house trying to force democrats to accept a wall on the mexican border  mr  shine was on a hawaiian vacation as the shutdown presented mr  trump with an ever expanding political challenge  mr  shine  who joined the white house staff with the expectation that he would deliver on his promise to satisfy mr  trumps hunger for positive news coverage  stayed on vacation  keeping in contact with colleagues by phone eventually  mr  shine came home early to help manage the administrations response  but any expectation that he would be by the presidents side crafting a cohesive message would be a miscalculation of the role he has actually come to play as mr  trumps latest communications director  according to interviews with over a dozen former and current administration officials an alumnus of fox news  where he was known as a protector of the networks chairman  roger e  ailes  mr  shine has confined his white house role mainly to stagecraft  people who have worked with him say  and mr  trump  who chafes against being managed  has openly expressed skepticism about what he has done once he was back in washington  mr  shine was among the aides pushing mr  trump to deliver tuesdays prime time oval office speech and make a visit to the border on thursday  and it was mr  shine who was among the unnamed targets of the president when mr  trump criticized those plans at a lunch with broadcasters before his speech the border visit was not going to change a damn thing  mr  trump said  belittling the plan as a photo op urged on him by these people behind you  he said  pointing to mr  shine and a cluster of other communications aides the criticism was nothing surprising given mr  trumps habit of quickly turning on his staff  and his recent habit of asking people whether mr  shine has been good for him since arriving last summer had a familiar ring for mr  shine  there was one obvious challenge from the beginning this presidents never going to be happy with his coverage because hes in a permanent war with the media  newt gingrich  the former house speaker and an occasional trump adviser who has been a contributor on fox news  said in an interview  shine in that sense is in a challenging environment  his primary client is somebody who would like a result that requires change but is not willing to change the white house declined to provide comment for this article from a spokesperson  from mr  shine or from mr  trump  after multiple requests  but kellyanne conway  the counselor to the president  praised his instinct for a good story in a text message donald trump is an irrepressibly press savvy  communications centric president  ms  conway said  of mr  shine  she added that he has a gut for what sells and an eye for what compels a longtime associate of mr  ailes  who spoke on the condition of anonymity  said mr  trump thought he was getting roger  who built fox with a keen eye for aggressive political strategy  in his hire  but mr  shine  according to his critics  has shown little understanding of the conservative media beyond the cable news ecosystem and his former network  the one place where the president does not need much assistance  and where mr  shine has few remaining admirers mr  shine has survived mainly by fulfilling the presidents desire to be in charge of his own messaging he understands really strong personalities  mr  gingrich said  noting mr  shines past at fox  he understands that his job is to operate within the framework of that personality  not to try to change that mr  shine  for his part  has told several colleagues he is used to working for crazy bosses  a reference to his time at fox that made its way back to the network  where officials were displeased at 55  mr  shine is older than many other aides in the west wing  he is widely described as genial and good humored by his colleagues  several of whom refer to him as an adult in the room  he is usually at his desk around 6 45 each morning  a white house official said  bearded  tall and often bleary eyed  he works late into the evenings as a rotating cast of reporters filter in and out of his office  he is known as a level presence and  in the words of one senior administration official  is good at staying in his lane  unlike many other white house aides  mr  shine tends to avoid matters that are not in his immediate purview exactly what that purview is can be hard to discern  multiple people close to the white house  for instance  said the communications office issued no guidance on what points they should make on television after mr  trumps oval office address according to one senior administration official  mr  shine  arriving at the white house  appeared overwhelmed by a fractious west wing  in part because he was hired by the president after john f  kelly  his former chief of staff  was unwilling to reassign mercedes schlapp  the white house director of strategic communications early on  mr  trump was impressed with mr  shines ability to help pull him out of an unflattering news cycle after a widely criticized news conference in helsinki  finland  with president vladimir v  putin of russia days after the meeting  mr  shine arranged for the president to step out in front of reporters on the south lawn and hail his administrations economic accomplishments  describing the scene  a senior administration official said that mr  trump kept his eyes trained on mr  shine  who stood casually nearby with a starbucks cup in hand  while the president addressed the group and momentarily shifted the news cycle but two senior administration officials said that mr  shines new colleagues  who expected him to come in with a degree of ailes genius  have not been impressed by what they considered timeworn suggestions  such as the president not tweeting so much the shutdown has highlighted the inner workings of a strategy challenged white house  where one official described mr  shine as a bridge between the bifurcated communications and press teams  he is one of four assistants to the president  an official distinction  who focus on communications  they often do not work in concert  according to several white house officials but it is not as if there have not been some novel communications tactics last week  riding high from a meeting over the plans for funding his long promised border wall  the president held a haphazardly arranged press briefing with law enforcement officials without taking any questions  at a cabinet meeting  he conspicuously displayed a game of thrones inspired sanctions poster  and then there were his taped rose garden videos  or the tweet with the video of him singing green acres at he 2005 emmys mr  shine had nothing to do with any of that  according to an administration official to his friends and allies  mr  trump wistfully brings up hope hicks  his most successful communications director  who departed nearly a year ago  ms  hicks had the presidents trust in a way that only a few remaining aides do  and she was generally seen as among the small number of people who could suggest to mr  trump that he hold back from indulging in some of his public relations whims since arriving  mr  shine has chosen to become useful to jared kushner and ivanka trump  the presidents son in law and eldest daughter  at one point  mr  shine tried to help craft a network special for a planned trip by ms  trump to africa  which has been postponed amid the government shutdown so far  mr  shine has not satisfied the presidents demand for better news coverage  but the two have bonded over mr  trumps tendency to hold grudges toward certain journalists and news outlets  in november  as the president stepped up to the podium in the east room of the white house for a news conference that devolved into an aggressive exchange with jim acosta  a cnn reporter  mr  shine turned to sarah huckabee sanders  the white house press secretary this is going to be fun  mr  shine said  a remark that was overheard by people nearby white house aides said mr  shine could not have planned that a confrontation between mr  trump and mr  acosta would take place  or known that it would turn into a fight that ultimately went to court  and insisted he was referring simply to the presidents feistiness before he went to the podium but mr  shines willingness to encourage a confrontation that led to mr  acostas white house access badge being pulled  something that aides for months had kept the president from doing  is in keeping with much of his private advice to the man he now works for after hes done with all of this  mr  gingrich said  shine will be able to write a great book  i joke with him that in the long run  theres a great opportunity here .
good wednesday   want this by email  sign up here  a new research paper tracked the political donations of thousands of c e o s from 2000 through 2017  the results  andrew writes in his latest column  reveal what top business leaders really think about politics theyre usually republican  nearly 58 percent of c e o s showed a preference for the g o p   with just 18 percent designated as democrats   for executives to be counted as either  two thirds of their donations had to go to candidates affiliated with one party  about a quarter were considered neutral  the report doesnt disclose who was in each category  but its authors told andrew that tim cook of apple was neutral  having donated to both hillary clinton and paul ryan over the years the disparity was narrower in some sectors  tech and internet companies had somewhat more democratic leaning c e o s  and female leaders were nearly evenly split between the g o p   democrats and neutral territory but the republicans are quieter  the study found that there was a statistically significant association between a company having a republican c e o  and less disclosure of political contributions why it matters  the opinions held by executives have always resonated beyond their own industries  but their importance is more pronounced today  andrew writes  mr  trump  for example  has not hesitated to equate economic policy with foreign policy  it is  then  instructive to understand the political views of our business leaders the u s  and china will embark on another round of high level trade talks in a final attempt to hash out an agreement  according to the wsj  u s  trade representative robert lighthizer and treasury secretary steven mnuchin plan to fly to beijing next week to meet with chinese vice premier liu he  trump administration officials said  the following week  a chinese delegation led by mr  liu is expected to continue talks in washington there are conflicting views on how far theyve got  america seems upbeat  president trump yesterday said that talks were going very well  and myron brilliant  executive vice president of the u s  chamber of commerce  said that were in the endgame  but china may be wary  some u s  negotiators are concerned that china is pushing back against american demands in trade talks  bloomberg reports  citing unnamed sources  it may walk back some promises because they didnt prompt assurances about american concessions a deal could be ready by the end of april if the next talks go well  the wsj estimates  about a month later than previously expected meanwhile  in europe   president xi jinpings trip to italy and france this week is drawing attention to europes conflicted views on china after years of criticism  facebook said it would no longer permit advertisers in key categories to show their messages only to people of a certain race  gender or age group  noam scheiber and mike isaac of the nyt report  anyone advertising housing  jobs or credit would no longer have the option of explicitly aiming ads on the basis of those characteristics  the new rules also cover advertising on instagram and messenger  which facebook owns  facebook said it planned to carry out the changes by the end of the year  the changes are part of a settlement with groups that have sued facebook over these practices in recent years the shift will annoy advertisers  sheryl sandberg  facebooks c o o   told the nyt that the changes could make advertising on facebook less efficient for some customers  but that it was a cost well worth bearing and it has limits  i

crashes involving boeings 737 max 8 plane  a new focus for investigations is how the f a a  certified the jet as safe  david gelles and tom kaplan of the nyt report  the 737 max was one of the first commercial jets approved under new rules  which delegated more authority to boeing than had been the case when most previous planes were certified  top f a a  officials  who are briefed on significant safety issues  were not aware of an automated piloting system suspected in the crashes  mr  gelles and mr  kaplan report  citing unnamed sources  the software did not elicit what are known as special conditions  usually applied to a novel feature that requires additional regulations before it can be certified as safe  but other features  like non rechargeable lithium batteries  received that designation  skepticism about the f a a s approval process existed before the crashes  in 2012  an investigation by the transportation departments office of inspector general found that f a a

washington  president trump threatened on friday to keep the federal government partly closed for months or even years if he did not get  5 6 billion for his wall at the southern border  and he warned that he was considering declaring a national emergency to build it without congressional approval mr  trump and democratic leaders emerged from a two hour meeting in the white house situation room without a deal to reopen government agencies that have already been shuttered for two weeks  and the two sides offered sharply contrasting views of where they stood  by days end  the two sides appeared to be still locked in a stalemate democrats called the meeting contentious while the president and republican leaders in the house called it productive  and while mr  trump announced that he had assigned vice president mike pence to lead a working group to negotiate with democrats over the weekend  democrats said the phrase working group was never discussed we told the president we needed the government open  senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  told reporters outside the white house  he resisted  in fact  he said hed keep the government closed for a very long period of time  months or even years  president trump took the public stage this week clearly intent on framing the conflict on his own terms  appearing in the rose garden later  mr  trump confirmed the remark  i did say that  absolutely i said that  he said  flanked by mr  pence  kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  and house republican leaders  i dont think it will  but i am prepared the impasse  heading into its third week  has closed parts of nine federal agencies  including the interior department and the internal revenue service  and left 800 000 federal employees either furloughed or working without pay  mr  trump expressed little concern for their plight  telling reporters on friday afternoon that when he hosted members of the border patrol union  his political allies  on thursday at the white house  they told him not to worry about them  and that he was doing a great thing for our country fridays effort to jump start talks was an early test of the new political dynamic in washington  where democrats have just taken control of the house for the first time in eight years  mr  trump  trying to seize control of the narrative  followed the session with his rambling rose garden appearance  there  he said he told democrats he wants  5 6 billion for the wall  a figure that is a nonstarter for democrats  who insist he will get no funding for the barrier at all ever the real estate developer  mr  trump offered his vision for what the wall would look like  saying it would be either solid concrete or solid steel  though steel is actually more expensive  he said the president then boasted that its construction would be a boon for american industry  all of the border things that well be building will be done right here in the good old u s a  by steel companies that were practically out of business when i came into office as to invoking his emergency powers to build it  i may do it  mr  trump said  but we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly  and its another way of doing it  but if we can do it through a negotiated process  were giving that a shot but if mr  trump is showing no signs of backing down  the pressure may be building on republicans in congress  two republican senators have said they want votes to reopen the government  and more than a half dozen house republicans joined democrats on thursday night to do just that the president was asked if he was still proud to own the shutdown  a reference to a comment he made last month during a televised oval office meeting  when he said he would be proud to shut down the government over border security im very proud of doing what im doing  he replied  i dont call it a shutdown  i call it doing what you have to do for the benefit and for the safety of our country the white house later said it has scheduled a meeting for saturday morning with aides to house and senate leaders  it was unclear whether mr  pence and the others would be involved behind the scenes  there were some indications that a search for a way out of the impasse was underway  some conservative commentators  including sean hannity of fox news  who is close to mr  trump  may have signaled a path out  suggesting that the president resurrect the old democratic notion of twinning wall funding with protections for the young immigrants brought illegally to the country as children who are known as dreamers such immigrants are currently protected by deferred action for childhood arrival  or daca  a program created by president barack obama that mr  trump has moved to rescind  on his way to the white house meeting  representative kevin mccarthy  the republican leader  seemed open to such a deal we can find common ground  mr  mccarthy told reporters  daca is a problem  border security is a problem and anything that can make sure that we can get everything together and move forward  im willing to discuss senator lamar alexander  republican of tennessee  has also suggested that democrats could give mr  trump an additional  1 billion to fortify ports of entry rather than a border wall but while mr  trump said daca was raised during the white house session  one democratic aide  speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private talks  said it came up only fleetingly  and in the news conference  mr  trump made clear that he did not want to address the daca issue  which is now the subject of several lawsuits that are working their way through the federal courts  until the supreme court renders a final decision on whether mr  trumps order to rescind the program can stand mr  trump also raised the issue of ports of entry for immigrants  but again  he eventually stuck to his demand that any strengthening of controls at such ports needed to be complemented with a wall the president said he invited democrats to send negotiators to meet over the weekend with three high ranking officials  mr  pence  ms  nielsen and jared kushner  his son in law and senior adviser  to negotiate a deal to strengthen security along the border  democrats told reporters after the meeting that they implored the president to first reopen the government so they could negotiate without holding federal operations and employees hostage no matter what happens  the government will remain partly shuttered at least through tuesday because both houses of congress are adjourned until then on friday  the president also sent a letter to congress that was an unsubtle rebuff to democratic leaders with whom he had previously met on wednesday  according to a person in that earlier meeting  representative nancy pelosi  who was then on the verge of becoming house speaker  cut off ms  nielsen as she reeled off statistics about the border  in his letter  mr  trump said that some of those present did not want to hear the presentation at the time  and so i have instead decided to make the presentation available to all members of congress on thursday  under ms  pelosis leadership  the house passed a two bill package to reopen the government  the first measure combines six bills that have already garnered bipartisan support in the republican led senate  they would reopen nearly all of the shuttered agencies and fund them through sept  30  the end of the fiscal year the second is a stopgap spending measure to fund the department of homeland security through feb  8  a date that senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  proposed toward the end of last year in a measure that passed the senate by voice vote  but which the president rejected  in their last meeting  mr  trump rejected reopening the government while wall talks continued  telling the group  i would look foolish if i did that for his part  mr  mcconnell has refused to take up the house package  insisting that he will not bring anything to the floor that mr  trump will not sign  democrats argued in the meeting that mr  mcconnell should at least pass the cluster of appropriations bills while continuing to negotiate over border security  but mr  trump again rejected that idea on friday mr  mcconnell has largely absented himself from the talks  insisting that it is up to democrats to resolve the impasse  and one person familiar with fridays meeting said that mr  mcconnell said very little  but he is beginning to face pressure from republicans who are seeking re election in 2020 and are targeted by democrats two senators from democratic leaning states  cory gardner of colorado and susan collins of maine  have already expressed misgivings over their leaders intransigence  mr  gardner called on his party to end the shutdown  even if it meant not funding the wall  and ms  collins  who took a leading role in ending a previous shutdown  said she would support measures to fund the government in already approved appropriations bills .
for a sense of the true cost of his government shutdown  now deep into its second week  president trump should spend less time rage tweeting and venting his spleen in cabinet meetings about democrats refusal to throw money away on his wasteful border wall and more time perusing the  shutdownstories making the rounds with even a quick peek beyond his bubble  the president could learn much about the legions of government employees and contractors who spent the holiday season agonizing over how to cover their next mortgage payment or electric bill or trip to the grocery store if this political charade drags on much longer lets be clear  this fight is not about security  contrary to mr  trumps claims  there is no flood of savage foreigners pouring across the border  even so  reasonable democrats and republicans acknowledge a need for some mix of a bigger staff  better technology and  yes  fencing  as well as humane and sensible immigration and asylum policies  achieving all of that has proved a tall order even for competent administrations  but its why congress  on a bipartisan basis  has already been allocating more money for border security  although the administration has spent less than 10 percent of what congress has allocated in the past year to avoid the complex  hard work that has traditionally gone with his job  mr  trump has instead manufactured a political impasse over a symbol  a wall  that even his new acting chief of staff  mick mulvaney  back when he was a congressman  derided as an easy thing to sell politically that doesnt really solve the problem  john kelly  mr  trumps departing chief of staff  told the los angeles times that the administration long ago abandoned the idea of a concrete wall as irrelevant to the real needs of border security  drawing a heated contradiction from the president on twitter if mr  trump would take the time to check in with whats happening in the real world  he might read about the divorced army veteran whod worked three jobs to survive before getting hired as a paralegal at the federal trade commission  and who now has no idea if hell make the rent  he could hear from the single mother who says that shell have enough for rent  but not for food  he might be moved by the wife of a corrections officer wondering how her family will handle their mortgage  day care and car payments while her husband is working without pay  or by the disabled air force vet who  having waited more than a year for service connected surgery  cannot get final approval for her procedure until the shutdown ends an estimated 800 000 federal workers have had their lives upended by this latest presidential temper tantrum  some 420 000 of those  deemed essential personnel  are working without pay  this includes upward of 41 000 law enforcement officials  54 000 border patrol agents and 53 000 transportation security administration workers   if you flew this holiday season  it was only thanks to these unpaid women and men   another 380 000 workers have been furloughed  including 28 800 employees of the forest service  16 000 in the national park service and 16 700 at nasa  the longer the stoppage continues  the more people will feel the squeeze  already  the small business administration has been shut down  delaying the processing of loans  a growing number of national parks  museums and historic sites will need to close  disrupting tourism for the sites and for surrounding businesses  at some of the parks kept open during the holidays  even as many rangers and other support staff members were furloughed  there were reports of trash piling up  toilets overflowing with human waste and episodes of vandalism  routine screenings by the food and drug administration are being put on hold  and the federal communications commission is set to halt most of its operations on thursday  the situation on indian lands is about to get dire  the list goes on and on for the workers directly affected  among those facing the greatest economic uncertainty are contractors  who make up more than 40 percent of the government work force  this includes not only white collar positions  but also thousands of blue collar jobs  such as janitors and security guards  unlike regular government employees  many contractors may not be compensated for lost time  they could simply lose the income even for regular  non contract employees  who have eventually been granted back pay after past shutdowns and can reasonably expect the same this time  the grinding anxiety and financial costs of scraping by in the meantime mount with each passing day  many of these workers live paycheck to paycheck  with little wiggle room  some of their creditors are more understanding than others  and even one missed payment can carry heavy consequences last thursday  the office of personnel management tweeted a link to sample letters that workers could use in negotiating payment plans with creditors  this is not a new practice  similar templates were sent during the 2015 shutdown  the letters nonetheless earned much mockery on social media  especially the section suggesting that workers ask their landlords about trading services to perform maintenance  e g  painting  carpentry work  in exchange for partial rent payments  after suffering a twitter beat down  o p m  removed the offending passage and issued a statement that it was part of a legacy document from 2013 that had been posted in error no matter  on the same day that federal workers were being urged to try their hands at a barter economy  mr  trump was busy firing off a series of rabid  finger pointing  wall related tweets  including one about how a wall deal had been thwarted not only by democrat obstruction but also by uppity federal judges in one characteristically empathetic post  mr  trump sneered that most of the people not getting paid are democrats  while this divisive  evidence free claim tells you everything you need to know about this presidents hyperpolitical approach to his role  it most likely failed to impress the hundreds of thousands of families across the political spectrum who are suffering as a direct result of mr  trumps grandstanding for pure lack of class  however  nothing topped the presidents tweets of saturday  blaming democrats opposition to his wall for the tragic death of two migrant children who had been apprehended by the border patrol and put into custody as if all this werent bad enough  on friday  mr  trump issued an executive order freezing pay for the governments civilian work force in 2019  around two million people  the order can be  and is expected to be  overridden by congress once the budget impasse is resolved  so  practically speaking  mr  trumps move does little more than further fuel tensions mr  trump has claimed  without evidence  naturally  that many federal workers have urged him to stay out until you get the funding for the wall  this seems unlikely considering that a recent poll by reuters ipsos found that only a quarter of all americans support the shutdown  only 35 percent said they favored including money for the wall in a spending bill this is  to put it mildly  not a broadly popular policy point on which the president is holding the nation hostage not that mr  trump seems much interested in either the public will or the public good  for him  this shutdown is a self declared point of pride  a gaudy display of his boldness  his manliness and his political steadfastness  after all his bluff and bluster  if the president backed down now  he would incur the wrath and ridicule of hard right pundits like rush limbaugh and ann coulter  who seem to call the shots in this white house  as well as die hard supporters who still think a concrete wall  or at least some artistically designed steel slats  will make america great again  during a wednesday cabinet meeting  just hours before sitting down with congressional leaders  mr  trump doubled down on his intransigence  rejecting a compromise proposal for  2 5 billion in wall funding that his vice president  mike pence  had floated to democrats  this is the second time mr  trump has torpedoed a negotiation attempt by mr  pence  raising the question of why the vice president even bothers  mr  trump accused democrats of playing politics with an eye on 2020  even as he re upped his false claim that former president barack obama has a high wall around his compound in washington  d c  resolving the impasse  he said  could be a long time  or it could be quickly but there is likely to be a limit to how much mr  trump can make americans suffer for an empty political gesture  the realities of a divided government may provide him with an opportunity  or an excuse  for a fresh start  the new democratic house is set to vote thursday on a spending plan to end the shutdown without more wall money  leading to the kind of intense negotiations that he has not faced in two years of single party control of congress if theres a minimum of grandstanding on everyones part  mr  trump might get a lesson in how to make a deal .
good thursday    was this email forwarded to you  sign up here  some business leaders are feeling the swift and sharp repercussions of charges issued by federal prosecutors relating to a college admissions scandal  in which wealthy parents were accused of using fraud and bribery to help their children get places at elite schools  gordon caplan  a co chairman of the global law firm willkie farr   gallagher  was put on leave by the firm yesterday  he may face legal challenges from regulators and his own company  according to the new york law journal  he is accused of paying  75 000 to have someone improve his daughters score on the act exam  william mcglashan  a partner at the private equity firm tpg  was placed on leave by the company  yesterday  he stepped down from the board of

after days of mounting pressure  the u s  grounded boeings 737 max 8 aircraft on wednesday  reports the nyt the turnaround came after canadian and american aviation authorities studied newly available satellite tracking data  it suggested similarities between sundays crash in ethiopia and one involving a boeing 737 max 8 in indonesia in october  boeings c e o  said the company was supporting this proactive step out of an abundance of caution the cost to boeing could be huge  airlines have begun to demand compensation for their losses during the grounding  natalie kitroeff of the nyt writes  and one analyst estimated that the company may have to spend nearly  1 billion to resolve issues with the 737 max fleet  it could also face lawsuits from the families of passengers who died in the disasters but the bigger financial unknown is whether airlines lose confidence in the max  ms  kitroeff adds  if that happens  orders for the 737 max  the companys best selling jet  could dry up  handing an advantage to boeings european rival  airbus  which makes a similar plane  the a320neo  but outright cancellations of orders seem unlikely  because airlines typically put down large deposits the british parliament voted last night to oppose the prospect of britains withdrawal from the e u  without an agreement with the bloc  writes stephen castle of the nyt the vote was another harsh blow to prime minister theresa may  mr  castle writes  a critical part of her strategy has been to play for time and use the fast approaching threat of a chaotic  disorderly and economically damaging exit as leverage mrs  may said that if lawmakers can support a deal in the next few days  she could request a brexit delay until june 30 to put it in place  he adds  but that appears unlikely  parliament rejected the agreement she negotiated with the european union in a humiliating 432 to 202 vote in january  and defeated it again on tuesday  391 to 242 without an approved agreement  a longer extension would be needed  forcing britain to take part in european parliament elections in may  that suggests mrs  may might make one more effort to get her unpopular plan through parliament  threatening hard line brexit supporters that  if it fails  she will seek a long delay that could  potentially  mean brexit never happening brookfield asset management announced yesterday that it had

president trump leaned hard on the strength of the american economy during his second state of the union address on tuesday  but with a blend of precise statistics and gauzy superlatives that are much more difficult to measure he also returned to a theme that dominated the second year of his presidency  a quest for a border wall with mexico to cope with what he said is a crisis of crime and drugs in the united states caused by illegal immigration the two issues dominated his address  which in tone was more measured than his biting twitter feed  but in substance contained numerous claims that were false or misleading here is what mr  trump said and how it stacked up against the facts   sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  the u s  economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office  and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world the american economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 5 percent in the third quarter of 2018  growth in latvia and poland was almost twice as fast  same for china and india  even the troubled greek economy posted stronger growth  and a wide range of economic analysts estimate that the growth of the american economy slowed in the fourth quarter  and slowed even further in the first month of 2019  we recently imposed tariffs on  250 billion of chinese goods  and now our treasury is receiving billions and billions of dollars since mr  trump imposed tariffs on certain imports from china  and imported steel and aluminum from around the world  federal tariff revenues have increased  revenues from customs duties  which include tariffs  rose by  13 billion in the third quarter of 2018 compared with a year earlier  the commerce department reported  technically  that money is paid by americans who bring the goods across the border  and it is often passed on to american consumers in the form of higher prices my administration has cut more regulations in a short period of time than any other administration during its entire tenure the trump administration has slowed the pace of adopting new rules  and it has moved to roll back some existing or proposed federal regulations  particularly in the area of environmental protection  the white house claimed that as of october  a total of  33 billion worth of future regulator costs had been eliminated  but experts say the scale of the rollbacks in the trump era still does not exceed extensive cuts in federal rules during the carter and reagan administrations  when rules governing airline  truck and rail transportation were wiped off the books  among other changes  we have created 5 3 million new jobs and importantly added 600 000 new manufacturing jobs  something which almost everyone said was impossible to do  but the fact is  we are just getting started  the bureau of labor statistics reports that since january 2017  when mr  trump took office  the economy has added 4 9 million jobs  including 454 000 jobs manufacturing jobs  far from being impossible  that is closely comparable to the pace of job creation during some two year periods during the obama administration  and significantly slower than the pace of job creation in manufacturing in the 1990s wages were growing for blue collar workers  who i promised to fight for  they are growing faster than anyone thought possible wages are rising faster for construction and manufacturing workers than workers in service occupations  according to the labor department more people are working now than at any time in our history while the total number of people working in the united states is higher than ever  it is not because of the presidents policies  it is because more people than ever live in the united states  the border city of el paso  tex   used to have extremely high rates of violent crime  one of the highest in the entire country  and considered one of our nations most dangerous cities  now  immediately upon its building  with a powerful barrier in place  el paso is one of the safest cities in our country  el paso was never one of the most dangerous cities in the united states  and crime has been declining in cities across the country  not just el paso  for reasons that have nothing to do with border fencing  in 2008  before border barriers had been completed in el paso  the city had the second lowest violent crime rate among more than 20 similarly sized cities  in 2010  after the fencing went up  it held that place san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country  in response  a strong security wall was put in place  this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings  border apprehensions decreased by 91 percent in the san diego sector between the 1994 fiscal year  right after the original border fencing was completed  to the 2018 fiscal year  but  according to the congressional research service  that fence alone did not have a discernible impact on the number of immigrants crossing the border into the united states illegally  as we speak  large  organized caravans are on the march to the united states at the end of january  a new caravan of thousands of migrants from central america was headed north  and some of the travelers said they intended to try to cross into the united states  but many in the caravan have said they plan to remain in mexico  thanks in part to policies put in place by the new mexican government  president andrs manuel lpez obrador has made it easier for central americans to get visas and work in mexico  president trumps warnings of an imminent invasion from new caravans is overstated i hope you can pass the u s m c a  into law  so we can bring back our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers  expanding american agriculture  protecting intellectual property  and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words  made in the u s a the revised trade deal with canada and mexico  known as the united states mexico canada agreement  does include provisions that are intended to bring manufacturing jobs back to the united states  like minimum wage provisions for some auto manufacturing  but some economists have said those provisions could ultimately push more manufacturing  and jobs  outside north america  the deal does allow american farmers to sell more dairy products to canada  but the trade pact has yet to be approved by congress  and both democrats and republicans say that is unlikely to happen without significant changes  when i took office  isis controlled more than 20 000 square miles in iraq and syria  just two years ago  today  we have liberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters  the defense department reports that the islamic state now controls only around 20 square miles of territory in syria  down from 34 000 in 2014  but many of the gains against the sunni extremist caliphate began under president barack obama  with the trump administration continuing obama administration policy  and the top american military commander in the middle east told a senate hearing on tuesday that the islamic state could return if the united states and its allies abandoned the fight  in december  mr  trump announced he was withdrawing american troops from syria we condemn the brutality of the maduro regime  whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in south america into a state of abject poverty and despair this has become a popular talking point among american conservatives  it is true that the rule of president nicols maduro of venezuela has brought that country to economic ruin  inflation is at astronomical rates  and ordinary people are struggling to get basic food and health supplies  three million citizens have fled  some of the collapse can be traced to mr  maduros economic policies  which do fall under the broad label of socialism  but analysts say that corruption  the lack of rule of law and the absence of democracy  all the hallmarks of a dictatorship  have played just as big or larger roles  if i had not been elected president of the united states  we would right now  in my opinion  be in a major war with north korea  in 2016  at the end of the obama administration  there was no sign that the united states and north korea were about to go to war  though pyongyang had been conducting nuclear tests and mr  obama had continued economic sanctions  in mr  trumps first year in office  he increased tensions with north korea by attacking its leader  kim jong un  in a series of twitter posts  which prompted hostile statements from pyongyang  mr  trump wrote that north koreas actions would be met with fire and fury and called mr  kim little rocket man  analysts said at the time that the chances of war between the two nations had grown because of these exchanges lawmakers in new york cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mothers womb moments from birth on jan  22  the 46th anniversary of the supreme courts landmark decision roe v  wade  gov  andrew m  cuomo  democrat of new york  signed the reproductive health act  the new law ensures a womans right to an abortion in new york if roe v  wade were to be overturned  it does not broadly allow abortions until shortly before birth  as mr  trump suggested  instead  it will allow for an abortion after 24 weeks to protect the mothers health or if the fetus is not viable  under the prior law  abortions were allowed after 24 weeks only if the womans life was in jeopardy we had the case of the governor of virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth in an interview last month  gov  ralph northam said that he supported a late term abortion bill that would loosen restrictions on the procedure  and allow women to consult with a doctor on an abortion up to  but not including  the time of birth the governor  a pediatric neurologist  also talked about some of the dangerous medical emergencies that pregnant women could face  such as carrying a nonviable fetus  he said that in such a case  the mother would deliver the infant and then  the infant would be resuscitated if thats what the mother and the family desired  and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother  while mr  northam was talking about an end of life care discussion in the case of a child that would not live  republicans seized on his remarks as

washington  the trump administration said on friday that it was suspending one of the last major nuclear arms control treaties with russia  following five years of heated conversations over accusations by the united states that moscow is violating the reagan era agreement the decision has the potential to incite a new arms race  not only with russia  but also with china  which was never a signatory to the 1987 intermediate range nuclear forces treaty  widely known as the i n f it also comes as the united states has begun building its first long range nuclear weapons since 1991  a move that other nations are citing to justify their own nuclear modernization efforts taken together  the two moves appear to signal the end of more than a half century of traditional nuclear arms control  in which the key agreements were negotiated in washington and moscow it is unclear whether president trump plans to replace the i n f  or to renew another major treaty  called new start  which drove american and russian nuclear arsenals to their lowest levels in nearly 60 years  that accord expires in 2021  just weeks after the next presidential inauguration secretary of state mike pompeo announced the decision to suspend the accord  declaring that countries must be held accountable when they break the rules we can no longer be restricted by the treaty while russia shamelessly violates it  mr  pompeo said  adding that the united states would terminate the accord in six months unless russia destroyed its growing arsenal of intermediate range missiles and launchers mr  trump said later that i hope were able to get everybody in a big  beautiful room and do a new treaty that would be much better  he did not define what he meant by everybody the russian government counteraccused the trump administration of looking for any excuse to end the cold war era agreement  dmitri s  peskov  the spokesman for president vladimir v  putin  said the united states failed to negotiate in good faith on the whole  the reluctance of the americans to listen to reason and to hold any kind of substantive talks with us shows that washington decided to crush the treaty a long time ago  mr  peskov told reporters in a series of public and private comments  the president and trump administration officials have made clear they are seeking a new strategy that would revive the treaty  but only if all countries that now field such weapons are willing to curb or eliminate them  the current agreement applies only to russia and the united states that would be an enormously ambitious task  it would require china  india  pakistan  iran and north korea to sign on to the same agreement  that is much tougher than negotiating a bilateral treaty between russia and the united states  which still possess  by far  the worlds largest nuclear arsenals while the administration has not yet formally announced any such effort  a range of officials pointed to language used by mr  trump at the pentagon last month to embrace a new missile defense strategy  for too long  we have been held back by self imposed limits while foreign competitors grow and they advance more than we have over the years  he said some experts are skeptical nobody in the administration has laid out what the action reaction cycle looks like as the united states makes all these moves  building new warheads  withdrawing from treaties  pursuing new missiles  said jon wolfsthal  a nuclear expert on the national security council during the obama administration the enemy gets a vote  he added  the idea that were going to do these things  and theyre going to stand still  is nonsensical  theyre going to respond for both political and military reasons one thing is clear  if a new arms race begins  it will be expensive  while the makeover of americas aging nuclear arsenal and laboratories began during the obama administration  the ambitions to remake the united states nuclear capabilities have accelerated under mr  trump for the next 10 years  the congressional budget office said in january  the cost of nuclear upgrades has increased to  494 billion  or 87 times the amount mr  trump is seeking for his border wall  over the next 30 years  the estimate is  1 2 trillion the move on friday to suspend and likely end the i n f  treaty  once considered the gold standard of arms control agreements  was telegraphed months ago the united states began accusing russia of violating the treaty in 2014  when it revealed that moscow was developing a new missile that would violate the range limits  the russian government maintains that missile battalions it has deployed near european borders would not fly far enough to violate the treatys terms russian officials have raced to portray the united states as the nation at fault they charge that american missile defense interceptors in eastern europe could be easily refashioned into offensive weapons  and that the rise of armed drones  which had not been invented when the treaty was signed  now threaten to provide washington with similar intermediate range ability without violating the precise wording of the treaty american senior national security officials  notably john r  bolton  the national security adviser  have made no secret of their desire to leave arms control agreements that limit american action during the administration of president george w  bush  mr  bolton was a major force behind the withdrawal fromthe antiballistic missile treaty with russia  last year  he pressed mr  trump to end the 2015 iran nuclear accord with world powers  in the i n f  treaty  mr  bolton had an easy target  even president barack obama had considered exiting it the question now is whether the united states will begin to deploy new weapons to counter chinas efforts to cement a dominant position in the western pacific and keep american aircraft carriers at bay  much of beijings growing arsenal currently consists of missiles that fall into the ranges  land based missiles able to fly 300 to 3 400 miles  that are prohibited by the treaty china was still a small and unsophisticated military power when ronald reagan and mikhail s  gorbachev  the last leader of a rapidly weakening soviet union  negotiated the i n f  agreement the decision to leave it took american allies by surprise when word of the decision first leaked in october  since then  european capitals have been caught between their fears of mr  trumps unilateral instincts and their recognition that mr  putin poses a growing threat the north atlantic treaty organization  the military alliance that was created to counter the soviet threat 70 years ago  said on friday that russia was fully responsible for the breach of the treaty the united states is taking this action in response to the significant risks to euro atlantic security  said jen stoltenberg  the secretary general of the atlantic alliance mr  trumps critics in congress  however  immediately condemned the decision and pledged to introduce legislation seeking to stop the country from withdrawing from the treaty in six months senator edward j  markey  democrat of massachusetts  who focuses on nuclear issues on the foreign relations committee  called the treatys suspension a tragedy that makes the world less safe president trump and his war cabinet have yet again decided that america should go it alone  this time  by paving the way for a dangerous arms race  he said it seems unlikely that mr  pompeos announcement will result in a flurry of last minute negotiations with moscow  and it could accelerate the cold war like behavior among the united states  russia and china  american intelligence agencies warned this week that russia and china were more aligned than at any point since the mid 1950s the fate of the treaty has quickly become a test of the struggle inside the trump administration  and with its allies  over how to handle an increasingly aggressive russia mr  trump campaigned on remaking washingtons relationship with moscow  the open investigation by the justice departments special counsel is  at its core  about whether he and his campaign aides promised to relieve sanctions and other impediments to russia in return for financial or electoral benefits from mr  putins government russia was first to have second thoughts about the i n f  treaty  it complained to the bush administration 12 years ago that newer nuclear powers  chiefly china  were not constrained by its terms  they proposed expanding it to include other major nuclear states that logic  said graham allison  a harvard professor known for his studies of nuclear strategy dating to the cuban missile crisis  is correct but whether the chinese and others would agree  i doubt it  mr  allison said if china refused  so would india  which feels threatened by beijings nuclear fleet  if india failed to sign on  pakistan would reject the limits complicating the diplomatic issue is another  less publicized announcement that recently came from the energy department  for the first time in 28 years  the united states began producing a new warhead for a strategic weapon  the long range weapons devised to reach russia  china or north korea the announcement was not entirely surprising  in early 2018  the trump administration indicated in a nuclear strategy review that it would develop a new warhead for an unspecified number of trident missiles  which are carried aboard submarines  the first of those weapons  called a w76 2  is now being assembled at a weapons plant near amarillo  tex in an emailed statement on wednesday  the national nuclear security administration  which runs the countrys atomic weapons complex  said it was on track to complete the initial order and deliver the new warheads to the navy by the end of this fiscal year  the number it is producing has been kept a secret the exact power of the weapon is also secret  but it is widely estimated to be roughly half the hiroshima blast  what the trump administration calls a low yield weapon the trump administration has argued that it must match russian strides in low yield weaponry to deter conflict  by helping ensure that potential adversaries perceive no possible advantage in limited nuclear escalation but critics see the new class of strategic weaponry as making unthinkable outcomes far more likely  not less  if an american submarine ever fires a trident missile with a low yield warhead  critics predict that could provoke a nuclear retaliation before impact the cost of the w76 2 and the administrations other new weapons are raising the price of making over the nations nuclear arsenal last week  the budget office updated its projections to account for the coming decade though 2028  lifting its estimate by  94 billion the house  now under control of the democrats  is vowing to review that budget  the buildup could result in a new global arms race  it might also be used as a bargaining chip to produce an arms control breakthrough last year  when defense secretary jim mattis testified on capitol hill about the administrations new arms policy  he alluded to a benign outcome  we have to give our negotiators  he said  something with which to negotiate .
good tuesday   want this by email  sign up here  chinas premier said today that his government would respond to an economic slowdown by cutting taxes  easing burdens on the private sector and giving markets a bigger role  keith bradsher and chris buckley of the nyt write 2019 is a crucial year for chinas economy  premier li keqiang  the second ranking official in the country after president xi jinping  said at the opening of the national peoples congress in beijing this morning  he said the trade war with america had had an adverse effect  adding  we must be fully prepared for a tough struggle  china has lowered its growth target for this year  mr  li said that the nation was now aiming for gross domestic product growth of 6 to 6 5 percent  down from a target of 6 5 percent over the past two years other policy changes include a reduction in value added tax  which is expected to boost corporate earnings  and mr  li said the government would act with resolve to hand matters it shouldnt manage over to the market but mr  lis speech did not go as far as domestic or foreign critics would have liked  mr  bradsher and mr  buckley write  adding that economic anxieties have come to dominate policy in china over the past year and china may just need to accept the new normal  a gradual decline in an astonishing growth rate is what happens when you become a big  maturing economy  daniel moss of bloomberg opinion writes more  china is getting ready to overhaul to its laws on foreign investment in order to ease its trade dispute with the u s a tokyo court ruled today that the former auto industry leader carlos ghosn could post bail  months after he was charged with financial misconduct  the court set the bail at 1 billion yen  or about  9 million it was mr  ghosns third bail request  but the first led by his new legal team  including the high profile defense lawyer junichiro hironaka  prosecutors previously argued that mr  ghosn was a flight risk and might tamper with evidence the court imposed strict limits on mr  ghosn  including a ban on leaving japan  surveillance outside his tokyo residence and a pledge not to contact people beyond his legal team  the bail conditions are severe  but we will make sure to comply  mr  hironaka said the battle for bail highlighted japans use of what critics call hostage justice  the ft writes that it prolongs the detainment of defendants who  like mr  ghosn  assert their innocence and refuse to make a confession mr  ghosn isnt free yet  prosecutors have appealed  and his own legal team says hes unlikely to be released today the chairman of the house judiciary committee  representative jerry nadler  issued a flurry of document requests yesterday to all corners of president trumps world  its the most sweeping effort yet by democratic lawmakers to investigate the president for alleged misdeeds mr  nadler requested information from 81 people and agencies  including the trump organization  the trump campaign  the trump foundation  the inaugural committee  the white house  and family members and aides  other house committee chairs have requested documents related to mr  trumps communications with president vladimir putin of russia democrats are looking into possible violations of campaign finance law and use of office for personal gain  particularly where it might violate a constitutional ban on foreign emoluments  theyre also investigating claims about hush money payments to the porn star stormy daniels and attacks against critics they clearly wont wait for robert mueller  the nyt notes that the house has a different standard of evidence not wedded to a criminal indictment  republicans accused their colleagues of laying the groundwork for impeachment proceedings but hurdles remain  unlike mr  mueller  house democrats cant compel document production by convening a grand jury  and the white house could assert executive privilege to block some requests  though trump administration officials said they would cooperate when possible the telecom giant finally unveiled its new structure for what was once time warner yesterday  days after it beat the justice departments effort to block the acquisition  warner media  as it now is  has been reorganized to better fight old rivals  like verizon  and new ones  like netflix  whos in  bob greenblatt  the former head of nbc and showtime  will be chairman of warner media entertainment  jeff zucker  the current cnn chief  will oversee news and sports  and kevin tsujihara will continue to lead the warner bros  movie studio  along with a new division for family and kids programming the battle has two fronts  at t hopes 24 hour news and content like game of thrones will help it fend off telecom competitors  but it also wants to compete in streaming against giants like netflix and amazon  john stankey  the head of warner media  told the nyt that the reorganization would speed the development of a new online video service the man in the hot seat is mr  greenblatt  who as hbos new boss replaces richard plepler  the much admired former c e o  who resisted at ts desire to make the network more like netflix  mr  greenblatt defended at ts approach  telling vanity fair that hbo would have to increase its output because now we live in a volume world  and theres no way to really avoid that more  the new yorker

depression  the glass steagall act forced lenders to separate their commercial and investment banking operations  now  representative david cicilline  who leads the house antitrust subcommittee  wonders if something similar could apply to tech its an interesting idea whether there would be a way to think about separating what platforms do versus people who are selling products and information  a glass steagall for the international tech companies  mr  cicilline told the ft his views hold weight  mr  cicilline has been an outspoken voice in the democratic party about tech regulation  he previously said that facebook cannot be trusted to regulate itself  and his committee position is a powerful one others in washington are making similar noises  last week  the f t c  announced a new big tech task force  and its director of competition  bruce hoffman  said that some companies could be forced to spin off previous acquisitions lawmakers on both sides of the aisle want to limit companies ability to buy back their shares  but josh bolten  the c e o  of the business roundtable  and ken bertsch  the executive director of the council of institutional investors  write in an nyt op ed that such efforts could hurt the economy  restricting buybacks and dividends  the two write  could force companies to sit on cash or waste it on projects with a low potential for success  some critics of buybacks miss this point  money returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends does not disappear from the economy  mr  bolten and mr  bertsch add  citing individuals making big purchases  angel investments in new businesses and loans as potential uses of such cash  while there was a substantial increase in buybacks and dividends last year  business investment also increased substantially and grew at the fastest rate since 2011  not only do buybacks and dividends support a stronger and more dynamic economy  they also contribute to americans retirement security  mr  bolten and mr  bertsch write  citing widespread stock ownership in american households  the two concede that buybacks could be abused and advocate companies having strong corporate governance  but they argue federal limitations would stifle innovation and opportunity in america a recent google study into pay equality at the company found  to the surprise of just about everyone  that men were paid less

good tuesday   want this by email  sign up here  dealbook exclusive  the energy company plans to announce today that it has given  5 million to catalyst  a nonprofit focused on making corporate america more hospitable toward women its funding men advocating real change  a catalyst campaign that teaches male executives how to improve diversity and inclusion at their companies   among its tactics  lessons on unconscious bias   lorraine hariton  catalysts c e o   said it was the single biggest grant in the nonprofits 50 year history chevron has been a longtime supporter of catalyst  it began working with the nonprofit 20 years ago  and mike wirth  the oil and gas giants c e o   helped introduce this program to the company two years ago  it now runs in seven chevron offices worldwide diversity and inclusion has improved at chevron  in 2010  only 6 percent of its board and 11 percent of its management committee were women  now  its 36 percent for the board and 20 percent for the management committee  i think the business case for this is compelling  mr  wirth told michael de la merced of dealbook  saying more diversity has improved innovation but theres still a lot to do  mr  wirth said that oil and gas needed far more women in engineering and technical roles  and ms  hariton said that while companies have been hiring more women  the number of top female executives remains too small president trump is facing increasing pressure from republicans  democrats and even some of his own advisers to win the kind of large concessions that beijing has long resisted  alan rappeport of the nyt writes mr  trump has softened his threats against china  citing substantial progress in talks between the united states and china  mr  trump on sunday evening halted plans to raise tariffs on  200 billion worth of chinese goods at the end of this week  mr  rappeport explains but the chinese may be dangling false promises  some top democrats say  in hopes of ending a trade war that is damaging their economy  as well as hurting american farmers  some republicans fear that mr  trump may settle for a deal that simply reduces the trade deficit and offers relief to huawei  the chinese telecom giant many big sticking points remain  including chinas state subsidies for its businesses  beijing also still appears to be falling short of the administrations demands over intellectual property and cybertheft the blowback from both directions may leave mr  trump little choice but to keep the threat of tariffs alive so that he can continue to claim hes being tough on china  analysts said  according to mr  rappeport more  the ft imagines what a trade deal might look like  trade war is only one of the threats worrying president xi jinping of chin  u s  companies are planning their lowest rate of expansion in china since 2016  and a delay on further tariffs probably staved off inflation in america the securities and exchange commission says a series of tweets elon musk published last week violate its agreement with tesla  and wants him held in contempt of court mr  musk got in trouble last year by tweeting that he had funding secured to take tesla private  when that wasnt exactly the case  tesla settled  promising the s e c  that it would set up mandatory procedures to oversee and preapprove mr  musks tesla related written communications then last week  he tweeted about a manufacturing triumph  saying tesla would make around 500 000 cars this year  up from a target of 400 000  he soon corrected himself and repeated the target of 400 000 deliveries  teslas lawyers conceded that mr  musk hadnt had his tweets reviewed  but argued the substance of his post had already been vetted and publicly disclosed  mr  musk followed up by needling the s e c   tweeting that it forgot to read tesla earnings transcript  in which he forecast production of between 350 000 and 500 000 cars  how embarrassing  he added this is not an innocuous tweet  rebecca roiphe  a professor at new york law school  told the nyt  insiders have to be careful about revealing misleading information to the public punishments the s e c  could seek  ms  roiphe said  include a fine  more restrictions on mr  musks social media use  or even his removal as c e o with just over a month to go before britain is scheduled to leave the e u   prime minister theresa may could u turn on her commitment to keeping to schedule  and the opposition leader  jeremy corbyn  under heavy pressure  has promised to support a second public vote mrs  may is letting her cabinet think the unthinkable  the prime minister  who has repeatedly insisted that brexit will occur on march 29  will allow her colleagues to discuss extending the deadline today  according to bloomberg  which sets out what shed be risking and why  on one hand  it would avert mass resignations from pro e u  ministers in mays team  and potentially a defeat in parliament this week  but it would also risk a destabilizing backlash from euroskeptic conservatives and mr  corbyn has made a big concession to pro europeans  he had long resisted a second brexit referendum  but has had to reconsider after several pro e u  lawmakers quit his labour party  stephen castle of the nyt explains what the reversal means  at the moment  it is unlikely that a second vote would win a majority in parliament because most lawmakers still oppose the idea  but if mrs  mays brexit plan is rejected next month for a second time  then the calculation in parliament could change dozens of current and former employees of a company called cognizant  which reviews content for the social network  spoke to the verge  the investigation makes for grim reading  employees described a workplace that is perpetually

hi  welcome to on politics  your guide to the day in national politics  im lisa lerer  your host when people talk about the emerging 2020 democratic primary field  it can sound an awful lot like the opening lines of a childrens book one candidate  two candidates old candidates  new candidatessome are slightly left  some are farsay  what a lot of candidates there are but theres one thing many leading democrats seem to agree on  kamala harris is a formidable contender  when you ask 2020 candidates  likely candidates and members of their teams what possible opponent they worry about  the california senators name comes up frequently those concerns only grew on monday when ms  harris formally announced her presidential bid  she matched senator bernie sanderss record by raising  1 5 million from 38 000 donors in the first 24 hours of her campaign so why is a first term senator  with little experience outside california state government  making democrats so nervous  she doesnt fit into a neat ideological lane  as my colleague astead herndon wrote on monday  ms  harris comes out of the bay areas democratic establishment  but since joining the senate in 2017  shes embraced elements of a sanders lite liberal agenda  backing medicare for all and rejecting most corporate donations  as a result  her team argues  she can appeal to a wide array of factions in the party  she would make history  should she prevail in the primary season  ms  harris would be the first african american woman and the first person of asian heritage to be a major party nominee  as a graduate of howard and a member of alpha kappa alpha  the oldest black sorority  ms  harris has deep ties to the black community  the primary map favors a candidate who can win strong support from black voters  and california  its no accident that ms  harris is making her first campaign stop on friday in south carolina  where african americans will likely make up a majority of the electorate in that states early primary  the rising popularity of early voting also means that primary voters will start casting ballots in her native state of california on the day of the iowa caucuses  in diverse states of illinois and ohio  voters can start casting early ballots before new hampshire holds its primary after iowa and new hampshire  the race moves to potentially favorable terrain for ms  harris  nevada  which borders california and has a large latino population  then south carolina  then  on super tuesday  california will be among the states voting  as will four southern states where black voters made up more than a quarter of the 2016 primary electorate even with these advantages  ms  harris still has plenty to worry about  already  shes fending off attacks on the tough on crime positions she took as a prosecutor in california  in her first remarks after announcing her campaign  ms  harris described the criminal justice system as horribly flawed  and her liberal bona fides may be found lacking by an insurgent wing that is ascendant in the party obviously ms  harris does not have anything locked down   need i take you back to the winter of 2007  when hillary clinton led primary polls by double digits   were in the early stages of what will likely be a very  very long primary contest  a lot can happen just ask howard dean                     advisers to former vice president joseph r  biden jr  are circulating a document to his supporters that outlines a rationale for him to run for president and rebuts potential lines of attack  the latest indication that mr  biden is leaning toward a 2020 bid but has not yet fully committed the talking points  which were sent to the timess jonathan martin by an ally of mr  biden  reflect some of his core arguments he would make if he does enter the democratic primary  he and his advisers contend that his long experience in politics  he served in the senate for over 35 years  would represent an appealing contrast to president trumps erratic style in a time of almost unprecedented political chaos under a president whose first and last thought every day is about himself  his image  and using the most powerful office in the world to enrich himself  americans are reacting to  and looking for  the trustworthy  compassionate leadership that joe biden has brought to the national and international stage his entire career  the document states but what is more revealing about the 10 paragraph document is that mr  biden and his small circle of aides feel the need to sketch out his message before he announces his candidacy  it is  a biden ally said  a distillation of his thinking  the decision to put these thoughts on paper while other democrats are announcing full blown campaigns indicates mr  biden is still eager to gauge reaction to his candidacy before taking the plunge to that end  the talking points attempt to grapple with some of the most frequent critiques of mr  biden  that his initial lead in some democratic primary polls is simply based on name identification and will melt once other candidates become better known he is passionate  he is empathetic  he is trustworthy  and voters know these things about him  the document states  its why hes atop so many polls  its not because voters know his name  its because they know his character  that he is too moderate for todays democratic voters and will struggle with liberals he was outspoken on lgbtq rights even when every pundit around said that it was a political mistake  according to the talking points  adding that he also sought to address climate change early in his career and is an unwavering ally of organized labor  at 76  mr  biden may be too old to run for president he campaigned for nearly 70 candidates  across the ideological spectrum  across 26 states in the last two years stay tuned  folks                     drop us a line we want to hear from our readers  have a question  well try to answer it  have a comment  were all ears  email us at onpolitics nytimes com                     catholic high school students from covington  ky   found themselves in the middle of a national firestorm last weekend after videos surfaced showing dozens of students appearing to be in a standoff with an older native american man  more videos later emerged that complicated the story  showing the encounter had been preceded by african american protesters  who identified themselves as hebrew israelites  shouting slurs at the students the incident has emerged as a kind of rorschach test for views on politics  race and the trump administration we talked to elizabeth dias  the new york times religion correspondent who was in covington  about what she discovered about our political culture lisa  why did this video touch such a nerve  elizabeth  there are these flash points now in our political culture  this one was particularly polarizing because it touched every nerve  race  president trump and the behavior of young white men as a religion reporter  ive covered a lot of sensitive topics and the level of vitriol and aggression from the right and the left about every part of this story is remarkable  some of the people involved in the videos have been experiencing threats of violence all weekend  so what did you learn about the context for these videos  when you actually are on the ground  in the kids community  you start to get an idea of the cultural context behind these kinds of inflamed moments  the school is in an overwhelmingly white  heavily republican and catholic area  the boys in the video  their school is known around town as the colonel crazies for their intense school pride and their all male brotherhood  and now the catholic community and the parents of these kids are joining together to protect them the last time the country was this intensely focused on catholic high school boys was during the kavanaugh hearings  this time were seeing it in a pocket of the country that fueled mr  trumps election and with the videos  theres now this fight over whose narrative wins out what does this incident tell us about our political culture so covington  where this happened  is right across the river from cincinnati  the covington area voted for mr  trump in 2016  while the cincinnati area has become increasingly blue  they are very close  but may have very different realities of what it is to be american how have politicians tried to capitalize on this episode mr  trump jumped into the fray praising the covington catholic boys and used the moment to attack the media  i wouldnt be surprised if the kids get a visit to washington or the white house or even the state of the union  if it happens  the right already sees this as part of their narrative  that christians are under attack                      furloughed federal workers try to join the gig economy  one womans haul on uber  less than  4  sneaking drugs through tunnels  in cans of jalapeo and

good wednesday   want this by email  sign up here  aviation regulators will testify before senate subcommittees today on the crashes of two boeing 737 max 8 jets  while boeing meets with airline executives to update them on a fix for the software thought to be responsible for the accidents the f a a s acting chief will defend the agencys practice of delegating some plane safety checks to boeing as critical to the success of the certification process  the official  daniel elwell  will argue that the process for the max 8 was detailed and thorough senators are expected to ask about long running doubts about the process  the nyt reports that f a a  employees and a transportation department watchdog worried over the years that the agency had too close a relationship with boeing officials  lawmakers will also ask why an update to the jets anti stall software is still not ready boeings response to the crisis is also being questioned  particularly since its c e o   dennis muilenburg  has largely remained silent  their comments have been very engineering esque  richard levick  a communications expert  told the nyt   the companys public response has become more assertive since hiring the crisis communications firm sard verbinnen  the company will meet today with 200 pilots and airline representatives at the factory where the max 8 is made  its expected to offer some updates on the anti stall software more boeing news  a max 8 made an emergency landing in orlando yesterday  though the incident is not thought to be connected to malfunctions that may have led to the two recent crashes the european parliament voted yesterday to pass a new copyright law requiring technology platforms to sign licensing agreements with musicians  authors and news publishers in order to post their work online  adam satariano of the nyt reports the new law is meant to force tech firms to aggressively remove unlicensed copyrighted material from their websites proactively  rather than waiting for complaints to come in before acting  mr  satariano writes the policy is deeply divisive  digital rights activists and the tech industry say it could result in censorship  media organizations say it should protect europes creative industries and ensure companies pay for content they share online some digital business models could be affected  because website owners will take on more responsibility for what ends up on their platforms  sites may find the law too expensive or cumbersome to police  even google shuttered its news service  which would require licenses from publishers under the new rules  when a similar initiative was introduced in spain smaller organizations may be hit hardest  these websites contend that giant tech platforms already have the resources to comply with the law  mr  satariano writes purdue pharma  the drug maker behind oxycontin  said yesterday that it will settle a lawsuit by oklahomas attorney general over its role in the opioid crisis  jan hoffman of the nyt reports purdue and its owners will pay  270 million  far more than they have paid in previous settlements  the payout helps purdue avoid a televised trial that was scheduled to begin on may 28 but many more legal battles await  a federal judge in cleveland alone is overseeing a consolidated collection of 1 600 lawsuits  and 35 other states have sued purdue as well the settlement raises questions about a purdue bankruptcy  the company has contemplated filing for chapter 11 protection to help contain the cost of defending or settling its legal fights  in bankruptcy  lawsuit claimants would most likely get only a fraction of any court determined payout chapter 11 weighed heavily in the oklahoma case  the state made a bird in the hand decision  and other plaintiffs may need to make a similar choice  the concern is that counties and states may settle on the cheap early to avoid getting little to nothing later on  elizabeth chamblee burch  a law professor at the university of georgia  told the nyt new data about wall street compensation shows that the financial sectors huge pay has widened the national disparity between white men and women and people of color  according to a new report from the institute for policy studies  a liberal think tank new york citys financial sector bonus pool fell last year by 14 percent from the previous year  to  27 5 billion  but that is still three times bigger than the combined annual earnings of all u s  full time minimum wage workers a majority of financial workers are white men  especially at the top ranks  according to the institute  no less than 68 percent of senior managers at the five largest u s  investment banks are white men but they make up just 37 percent of americas minimum wage workers  who have full  or part time jobs that pay  7 25 an hour  due to washington inaction  the federal minimum wage continues to be a poverty wage  while the reckless bonus culture is alive and well on wall street  the report concludes as at least 80 patent fights between apple and qualcomm trickle through courts around the world  both companies scored victories yesterday  the wsj reports some iphones now face a u s  import ban after an international trade commission judge issued an initial ruling yesterday finding that apple had infringed a qualcomm patent but apple scored a bigger victory when another i t c  judge ruled that the phone maker had not infringed a qualcomm patent relating to power efficiency in mobile phones  that overturned a previous court finding qualcomm is hoping a victory  particularly an import ban  could give it greater leverage in technology licensing negotiations  bloomberg explains  qualcomm says its due billions of dollars in unpaid royalties on the iphone apple denied infringing any of the patents in the two cases and claimed qualcomm is trying to shut its only u s  based competitor out of the market  something apple argues will hinder the development of the fifth generation of mobile communications  bloomberg adds corporate america set a record for stock repurchases last year  even as lawmakers proposed curtailing the practice companies bought back  806 4 billion worth of their own shares  according to s p dow jones indices  with  223 billion of that coming in the fourth quarter alone  the previous high was  589 1 billion  set in 2007 the biggest buyer was apple  which repurchased  101 billion of its stock the buyback boom was fueled by the trump tax cuts  with companies preferring to use their savings to repurchase shares and bolster their stock prices  rather than issue dividends or make new investments and it came despite opposition from congress  with lawmakers from senator bernie sanders to senator marco rubio arguing in favor of limits on the practice but a repeat is unlikely this year  as the sugar rush from the tax cuts wears off in 2013  google started an ambitious and flashy effort to create robots under the control of andy rubin  who later left the company amid accusations of sexual harassment  now  the company has overhauled the effort with more modest goals  but subtly advanced technology  cade metz of the nyt reports googles first robot push was all about advanced machines  and was built on a series of acquisitions  some of the companies that google bought relied on humanoid robots  but the tech giant failed to capitalize on them  and sold off or shut down the companies over time now the focus is on making robots smarter by injecting them with machine learning software  the company is developing ways for these robots to learn skills on their own  like sorting through a bin of unfamiliar objects or navigating a warehouse filled with unexpected obstacles  mr  metz writes google is tight lipped about how it hopes to deploy the technologies it is working on  mr  metz adds  thats probably because most researchers see robots being used in warehouses and distribution centers around the world  raising questions about how automation will erode jobs dealbook exclusive  the brunswick group plans to announce this morning that it has hired michael olooney

good tuesday   want this by email  sign up here  in the face of flagging iphone sales  apple unveiled an audacious plan yesterday to dominate the digital services that run on its devices  a new monthly subscription service for tv programming  video games and news  as well as a new credit card  but it failed to spell out why anyone should take the company up on its offer  apple tv plus will offer new original content  as well as programs from channels like hbo and showtime  reese witherspoon  steven spielberg and jennifer aniston took the stage to make the announcement  but details  even about fundamentals like pricing  were glaringly absent  apple news plus gives access to 300 magazines  including the new yorker and national geographic  as well as newspapers like the lat and the wsj for  9 99 a month  but its unclear whether youll get all the content  business stories and analysis will remain exclusive to full wsj subscribers  who pay  39 a month  for example  so its not quite as robust an offering as it first seems  apple arcade is a video game subscription service that will launch later this year  surprise  no details were given about how much it would cost  or which games would be included  apple card is the companys new credit card  which has been developed with goldman sachs  its meant to work mainly on the iphone  with users receiving 2 percent cash back on the same day if they make purchases through apple pay  some important questions you might have  such as credit limit and interest rate  werent answered the company is betting that consumers will be tempted by the convenience  and  presumably  slick experience  of having one company provide every scrap of content to them  but its success will rest on the quality of the content and the value on offer  and we still have little idea about either lobbyists for clients like uber and handy are pressing legislatures to keep workers from being deemed employees  noam scheiber of the nyt writes  in december  a texas regulator proposed that companies using a digital network to dispatch workers  as uber does with car drivers  could label them contractors rather than employees  thats a big deal for gig economy companies  who want to designate workers as contractors to avoid paying unemployment insurance and overtime  saving billions  this month  it came to light that tusk ventures  a venture capital and political strategy firm  appears to have been the primary author of the texas proposal  tusk was retained by the on demand cleaning and repairs company handy  and is run by bradley tusk  once a top political consultant for uber and a large shareholder who could make millions when the company goes public  tusk has also pursued similar efforts in other states  like illinois  worker advocacy groups say the goal is to chip away at classification rules in enough places to create pressure for a broad exemption nationally  mr  scheiber writes last year  michael avenatti became a celebrity for representing stormy daniels  the adult film star  in her fight against president trump  yesterday  he was arrested for what prosecutors said was an attempted shakedown of nike mr  avenatti threatened the sports giant  saying he would release evidence showing that its employees had given money to college recruits  unless he and an unnamed client were paid at least  22 5 million  prosecutors said the company will die  not die  but they are going to incur cut after cut after cut after cut  and thats whats going to happen as soon as this thing becomes public  mr  avenatti told nike lawyers in a meeting that was recorded the federal charges were announced around the time that mr  avenatti tweeted that he planned to hold a news conference to accuse nike of a major high school college basketball scandal when lawyers use their law licenses as weapons  as a guise to extort payments for themselves  they are no longer acting as attorneys  geoffrey berman  the u s  attorney in manhattan  said yesterday britains lawmakers grabbed control of the nations departure from the e u  yesterday  in a move that highlights the struggles of prime minister theresa may  stephen castle of the nyt reports parliament gave itself power to vote on alternative brexit plans  its attempt to take control of the process came as mrs  may prepared for a last ditch effort to persuade lawmakers to support her withdrawal plan  which has already been rejected twice by huge margins  mr  castle writes it will hold a series of votes tomorrow on alternatives to mrs  mays plan  these could include a so called soft brexit that would keep britain tied into european economic structures  a second referendum  revoking brexit completely  or leaving without any deal  mr  castle explains mrs  may said she could not commit to honoring the outcome of any of these nonbinding parliamentary votes  particularly if they contradicted the pro brexit stance in the conservative partys manifesto for the 2017 general election but the situation challenges britains political traditions  where the government normally controls the agenda in parliament  and could create a constitutional showdown  according to mr  castle the ride hailing giant said this morning that it will acquire careem  its main competitor in the region  for  3 1 billion  kate conger of the nyt reports the deal comes ahead of ubers i p o   and could give a boost to the companys financial prospects in the region by eliminating a rival  it also gives uber immediate access to several markets where it doesnt currently operate  including iraq  morocco and palestine the deal represents a change in strategy  since uber has largely sought to form joint ventures with international rivals like didi chuxing of china and yandex of russia but it could raise privacy concerns  ms  conger writes  careem will keep operating under its own name  but will eventually share some features with uber  though uber has declined to share user data with the egyptian government  careem was more open to doing so at the center of the college bribery scheme that ensnared celebrities and financiers is rick singer  a higher education guru who said he was able to get applicants into top schools  the wsj traced one way he operated  partnering with financial advisory firms  he was a regular on the financial speaking circuit  the wsj reports  which allowed mr  singer to move through elite circles in finance  tech and entertainment  his services often spread through word of mouth  mr  singer listed work with other financial services firms  including oppenheimer and morgan stanley  on his website and social media  employees at bond fund giant pacific investment management co   based in newport beach  calif   twice invited mr  singer to

gail collins  well  gee  bret  happy new year  how do you think 2019 has been going so far  i mean  except for the fact that the government is shut down  and donald trump is still president what do you thinks going to happen next bret stephens  and happy new year to you  gail  my predictions  as our readers know  are unfailingly accurate  i predict that democrats will fold over the shutdown  mexico will agree to pay for the wall  house republicans will vote for impeachment  the rams will win the super bowl and donald trump will win the nobel prize  for literature gail  not economics  for his pathbreaking work in demonstrating that governments dont need to be funded bret  the collected tweets of donald trump is surely a worthy successor to the work of william golding  the 1983 laureate and author of lord of the flies  in its depiction of adolescent cruelty  sorry  go on gail  i want to know what you think should happen next  presuming our president doesnt have a visit from an angel who tells him that instead of building a wall he should concentrate on building  oh  i dont know  a stairway to the stars  a re creation of the hanging gardens of babylon it looks like the current options  short of actually being rational  are declaring a national emergency  stealing money from the army corps of engineers or just going on like this forever  whats your pick bret  my guess is that hell declare a national emergency and allocate pentagon funds for the border wall  thats bad news for the country  precisely because it sets a precedent future presidents will abuse for their own partisan purposes  and it will alienate a lot of traditional republicans  like senator marco rubio  precisely for that reason but that wont stop trump  who isnt exactly the sort of guy to worry about institutional precedents  he understands that if he folds on wall funding  his presidency is effectively over  it means he will have failed a test of strength against the despised nancy pelosi while betraying his core political promise  as when george h w  bush broke his campaign promise and raised taxes in 1990 as part of the budget agreement  it will be his read my lips moment but could i be wrong  of course  predicting what trump will do is like trying to guess which way the goldfish swims next gail  since youre presuming the president behaves irrationally  hard to say youre wrong  my prediction would be that the whole thing winds up in court  creating endless litigation  screwing up the economy and making it impossible for congress to do anything about anything else one of the many  many problems here is that the democrats are just at the beginning of their presidential selection process  so youve got around 20 people waving their hands  none of whom have the stature to speak as the opposition  nancy pelosi and chuck schumer are both very good at their jobs  but the talents you need to get a bunch of legislators to work together on a party agenda are not the talents you need to rally the country itd be nice if we heard some republicans speak out  but all were getting is lindsey graham scrambling to win the best boy award from the white house  any signs of a more promising voice  im getting kinda tired of patting jeff flake on the back  really  hes gone bret  our new junior senator from utah  mitt romney  seemed like he might be volunteering for the post of semi courageous republican with that op ed he wrote for the washington post  im somewhat allergic to romney because hes such a transparently calculating politician  but i think he deserves support  the healthiest thing that can happen in 2020  other than donald trump losing the presidency  is a republican primary challenge to the president from someone like romney or john kasich  if only to serve as a reminder that not everyone on the political right has lost his mind  and  of course  we shouldnt discount the possibility that trump wont be on the ballot next year gail  deeply  deeply cynical as i am about mitt romney  i would never argue that he wouldnt be 10 times better a president  and while its true i once made fun of romneys dog  we have to remember that we now have the first president ever who has never had a pet in his entire life  that says something you know  were agreeing way too much  let me ask you something that might spark a divide  we just had a story about the veterans hospitals and the conservative desire to move all the veterans out of the old system and into private hospitals  what do you think bret  for it  the v a  system has been a scandal ridden mess for years  with endless stories about substandard medical and nursing care and scandals over hidden waiting lists  its one of the reasons americans should be wary of ever embracing government run health care as the norm  according to the timess own story  private care could mean shorter waits  more choices and fewer requirements for co pays  the whole purpose of a v a  system is to assure our vets the best possible care  not the worst i know there are arguments against it  including that it will threaten existing v a  hospitals and strain the private system  those arguments remind me a bit of the case against school choice  but the point is that we have these systems to help veterans  or students   and not to maintain the systems for their own sake  what do you think gail  in a way it really is like school choice  its great when you have a lot of good oversight and citizens are getting more quality options  but weve seen examples  betsy devoss michigan school privatization efforts come to mind  where all you do is replace deeply imperfect public schools with really terrible privately operated ones  which cost more and protect the public less when it comes to things like health and education  privatization only works when you have excellent government monitors  and i am absolutely certain this administration will never find them bret  im not against regulation  so long as its intended to prevent abuses rather than simply impose costs and restrict innovation  but i cant think of many areas where the private sector doesnt do a better job than government of providing a service  from delivering mail to running an airline to providing a better quality of education  this is a point i sometimes find myself making to park slope progressives who  for ideologically mysterious reasons  somehow wound up sending their kids to private schools like poly prep or st  anns instead of their local public schools gail  im generally fine with  say  giving parents the option of sending their kids to charter schools that have been carefully monitored for quality  but you need very serious oversight  there are too many examples of privatization leading to either lower quality or higher prices for me to be comfortable with just presuming that profit making services are better than the ones the government offers and  of course  im totally uncomfortable if the folks doing the privatization are reporting to donald trump  hey  i tried to find a non trumpian issue for us to discuss and he sneaked back in  is there any place we can go where he wont poke his orangy head bret  hmm  the former yugoslav republic of macedonia just voted to rename itself republic of north macedonia  maybe that  or  wait  the osiris rex space probe is now orbiting the asteroid bennu  surely trump doesnt have strong views about our space probes gail  bet he thinks the space force could have done it better bret  ha  it really is astonishing how completely trump infects everything  hes like that guy with a bad flu  coughing and sneezing on a packed subway car  i consider it a point of pride that my first four columns of 2019 mention him only glancingly  i think wed be serving our readers  and our profession  better if we resolved to try to write about him a lot less this year  otherwise  as frank bruni pointed out in his latest column  we run the risk of becoming his accomplices in amplifying his voice when we should be trying to diminish it gail  frank was so right  but boy this guy is hard to ignore bret  by the way  speaking of people who are sucking up a lot of media oxygen  can we discuss the freshman representative known to all by her initials  a o c   her habits of bending the truth to suit her ideological preconceptions and delight her base have an echo in you know who gail  alexandria ocasio cortez is somebody i was prepared to leave alone for a while  i mean really  shes 29  a neighborhood organizer who suddenly vaulted into congress by defeating a very senior and stale member of the democratic leadership  she deserves a little media vacuum while shes adjusting  but shes not going to get it and pretty clearly doesnt want it anyway still  i think youre underestimating her  she did make some factual errors about military spending and she did bristle when the fact checkers came after her  but then she figured the whole thing out pretty quickly  and thanked the fact checking community for their good work  thats the furthest thing from trumpian bret  fair point  and im mindful that shes a rookie politician whos bound to make rookie mistakes  though what mainly bothers me arent her misstatements of fact but rather the unworkability of her proposals  the last person to try a 70 percent plus tax on the rich was franois hollande  the one term former president of france  and it quickly proved an economic and political fiasco  is it too much to ask even a young politician to be aware of recent history this is a country that desperately needs to rediscover its center  republicans abandoned it when they went with trump  and i fear democrats might be tempted to do the same by embracing the proposals of people like ocasio cortez gail  well  it isnt as if shes proposing a coup  i say let all the democrats run their ideas up the flagpole and see what happens  no fair muttering anything about ideas that flap in the breeze .
washington  by the time a republican challenged representative steve king of iowa in the 2016 party primary  mr  king had already courted far right foreign leaders  proposed electric wiring atop a border wall to treat illegal immigrants like straying livestock  and said young migrants had calves the size of cantaloupes because theyre hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert but in that race mr  king had the help of fellow republicans like the then gov  terry branstad and senators charles grassley and joni ernst  each of those iowa republicans overlooked mr  kings history of racist remarks and divisive conduct  well before his recent comments about white supremacy  and backed mr  kings re election in the states most heavily conservative district mr  king won handily they didnt care too much about steve king  it was about the primary voters steve king represents  said the former state senator rick bertrand  the g o p  challenger in that race he described the support for mr  king as an act of self preservation by republican politicians who did not want to cross the hard line voters in western iowas conservative heartland  but now the reality is we may actually lose the seat  so steve has finally fired steve  mr  bertrand said one day after house g o p  leaders stripped mr  king of his committee assignments  representative liz cheney of wyoming  the third ranking republican  pushed him toward the exits  iowa republicans began a super pac aimed at unseating him in 2020 and ms  ernst said voters in iowa would make the correct choice moving forward about mr  king  it was becoming clear that the nine term lawmaker may finally be facing the ultimate political consequence for his remarks its racist  we do not support it or agree with it  and i think he should find another line of work  ms  cheney told reporters tuesday  going even further than the house minority leader  kevin mccarthy  about mr  kings comment to the times  white nationalist  white supremacist  western civilization  how did that language become offensive the house also voted nearly unanimously on tuesday to endorse a resolution that rejected white nationalism and white supremacy as hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people of the united states  even though it was aimed at the iowa republican  the broadly worded resolution was less than some lawmakers wanted to bring up  and even mr  king spoke in favor of it representative bobby rush  an illinois democrat  wanted to formally censure mr  king and drafted a measure to do just that my resolution lets steve king know if he continues this type of behavior  then the next level would be expulsion for him  said mr  rush  who was the only no vote the confluence of his closer than expected re election  the devastating losses house republicans suffered with educated and minority voters in november and the blunt force nature of what he does not deny saying has made mr  king toxic in his partys caucus yet even as it became clear that his fate may be sealed  many democrats and  more quietly  some republicans were wondering why he survived as long as he has given his 15 year record of making what were at a minimum racially provocative comments his drift toward nativism may have seemed of little consequence when he was a junior lawmaker in george w  bush era washington and republicans were more sympathetic to immigration but no other member of congress has so aggressively sought to develop relationships with white nationalist groups abroad  and those groups became empowered at about the same time the then candidate donald j  trump was making a hard line on immigration his signature issue as a result  mr  kings inflammatory remarks have gained more attention  both because of how they reflect on him and how they cast a brighter light on mr  trump and the republican party some congressional republicans saw the path mr  king was on  representative steve stivers of ohio  the chairman of the house campaign arm last year  surprised some in the party by speaking out against mr  king shortly before the election  mr  stivers called mr  kings conduct completely inappropriate and said we must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms still  for the most part  g o p  officials looked the other way or offered one off condemnations of mr  king as his flirtation with nationalist figures like geert wilders of the netherlands deepened and he made increasingly incendiary remarks about  for example  the impossibility of sustaining civilization with somebody elses babies the tolerance of mr  kings conduct  and he did seem emboldened by mr  trumps takeover of the party  stands in contrast to how an earlier generation of republicans addressed public displays of racial bigotry or racial insensitivity  bigots like the former ku klux klan leader david duke were shunned by party officials  and when the former senate majority leader trent lott used strom thurmonds 100th birthday party to seemingly praise segregation  it cost him his leadership post so why would republicans wait until mr  king flatly defended white supremacy to punish him i havent been following every utterance of congressman king  i certainly followed this one  and i think the house republican conference did the right thing  senator mitch mcconnell  the majority leader  told reporters tuesday asked the same question  mr  mccarthy shot back  have i been leader for years he said he had been the top house republican for only a short amount of time and was now in a position to take action but one former adviser to the last republican leader  the former speaker paul d  ryan  pointedly noted on tuesday that mr  mccarthy and steve scalise  his second in command  were not as vocal as mr  ryan when it came to mr  kings eruptions of course  mr  ryan never sought to punish mr  king as severely as mr  mccarthy did monday former aides to mr  ryan and john a  boehner  another former house speaker  said both admonished mr  king  but noted that he was a backbencher of little consequence in the capitol and argued that he had not said anything nearly as incendiary as what he did last week along with public pushback  paul admonished king directly several times about his behavior  said ashlee strong  who was a spokeswoman for mr  ryan  these latest comments warrant harsh consequences  and he believes mccarthy did the right thing by booting him david schnittger  a former aide to mr  boehner  recalled that his ex boss called mr  kings comments about young migrants smuggling marijuana deeply offensive and wrong and pointed out that the then speaker had privately used an obscenity to describe mr  king in the aftermath of those remarks another former aide to mr  boehner  michael steel  said mr  kings behavior had reached a tipping point but conceded that congressional republicans also face a political imperative if youre going to win back the majority by winning suburban districts in places like california and new jersey  its important to take a firm line against this sort of thing  mr  steel said but he said publicly what many republicans say privately  that excommunicating mr  king will matter little if mr  trump is the nominee in 2020 whatever we do on steve king is on the margins compared to what the president says and does  mr  steel said in iowa  mr  kings longtime supporters said they felt that he was unfairly treated by the media and that the warm and engaging lawmaker they saw in the largely rural district was nothing like the caricature they read about but after defeating a little known democrat by only just over three percentage points and increasingly shifting his attention from the soybean rows and hog processing plants around sioux city to the fringe nationalist politics in other countries  mr  kings defenders started to lose their patience who cares who the mayor of toronto is when youre from northwest iowa  said mark lundberg  the former chairman of the sioux county republican party  alluding to mr  kings endorsement last fall of faith goldy  a white nationalist candidate in canadas largest city  it was just a constant while calling mr  king a good guy  mr  lundberg said that he crossed a line with his comments on white supremacy and that it was time for the district to rally behind a candidate without all the controversy echoing mr  bertrand  mr  lundberg acknowledged that there was great concern in the party about how close mr  kings re election was  leaving little doubt that what is partly driving the calculation to nudge him out is that he may imperil the partys hold on what is otherwise a safe republican seat republicans there have created a super pac called iowa four  named after the district  to target mr  king  according to an iowa republican involved with the planning  and the conservative club for growth pac has made inquiries in the state about finding a potential alternative to the incumbent mr  king already has two republican opponents  and mr  bertrand did not rule out another bid the day of reckoning has come  and now it is just a matter of how the story ends  crowed nick ryan  an iowa republican strategist who has long sought to oust mr  king for the first time since 1899  mr  ryan noted  iowa does not have a member on the house agriculture committee and two of iowas largest newspapers  the des moines register and the sioux city journal  each published an editorial tuesday urging mr  king to resign but he has given no indication that he will resign  he said on the house floor tuesday that he understands and recognizes the gravity of this issue and insisted that he rejects white supremacy but his critics in iowa were already testing out their attacks  suggesting voters would not return a lawmaker to office who is too controversial to even serve on any committees he has been rendered impotent  mr  bertrand said  the national folks are forcing the local hand .
washington  president trump declared a national emergency on the border with mexico on friday in order to access billions of dollars that congress refused to give him to build a wall there  transforming a highly charged policy dispute into a confrontation over the separation of powers outlined in the constitution trying to regain momentum after losing a grinding two month battle with lawmakers over funding the wall  mr  trump asserted that the flow of drugs  criminals and illegal immigrants from mexico constituted a profound threat to national security that justified unilateral action were going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border  and were going to do it one way or the other  he said in a televised statement in the rose garden barely 13 hours after congress passed a spending measure without the money he had sought  its an invasion  he added  we have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country but with illegal border crossings already down and critics accusing him of manufacturing a crisis  he may have undercut his own argument that the border situation was so urgent that it required emergency action  i didnt need to do this  but id rather do it much faster  he said  i just want to get it done faster  thats all the presidents decision incited instant condemnation from democrats  who called it an unconstitutional abuse of his authority and vowed to try to overturn it with the support of republicans who also objected to the move this is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president  who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process  speaker nancy pelosi of california and senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  said in a joint statement mr  trumps announcement came during a freewheeling  50 minute appearance in which he ping ponged from topic to topic  touching on the economy  china trade talks and his coming summit meeting with north koreas leader  kim jong un  the president again suggested that he should win the nobel peace prize  and he reviewed which conservative commentators had been supportive of him  while dismissing ann coulter  who has not sounding alternately defensive and aggrieved  mr  trump explained his failure to secure wall funding during his first two years in office when republicans controlled both houses of congress by saying  i was a little new to the job  he blamed certain people  a particular one  for not having pushed this faster  a clear reference to former speaker paul d  ryan of wisconsin  a republican mr  trumps assertions were replete with misinformation and  when challenged by reporters  he refused to accept statistics produced by his own government that conflicted with his narrative the numbers that you gave are wrong  he told one reporter  its a fake question on point after point  the president insisted that he would be proved correct  people said  trump is crazy  he said at one point  discussing his outreach to mr  kim  and you know what it ended up being  a very good relationship  president trump declared a national emergency  what happens now  mr  trump acknowledged that his declaration of a national emergency would be litigated in the courts and even predicted a rough road for his side  look  i expect to be sued  he said  launching into a mocking riff about how he anticipated lower court rulings against him  and well win in the supreme court  he predicted indeed  public citizen  an advocacy group  filed suit by the end of the day on behalf of three texas landowners whose property might be taken for a barrier  california and new york likewise announced that they will sue over what gov  gavin newsom of california called the presidents vanity project  and a roster of other groups lined up to do the same  fortunately  donald trump is not the last word  said mr  newsom  a democrat  the courts will be the last word among those predicting a flurry of judicial decisions against mr  trump was george t  conway iii  a conservative lawyer and the husband of kellyanne conway  the presidents counselor  if he knows he is going to lose  mr  conway  a vocal critic of mr  trump  wrote on twitter  then he knows he is violating the constitution and laws he has sworn to uphold the house judiciary committee announced friday that it would investigate the presidents emergency claim  while house democrats plan to introduce legislation to block it  that measure could pass both houses of congress if it wins the votes of the half dozen republican senators who have criticized the declaration  forcing mr  trump to issue the first veto of his presidency the emergency declaration  according to white house officials  enables the president to divert  3 6 billion from military construction projects to the wall  mr  trump will also use more traditional presidential discretion to tap  2 5 billion from counternarcotics programs and  600 million from a treasury department asset forfeiture fund combined with  1 375 billion authorized for fencing in the spending package passed on thursday night  mr  trump would have about  8 billion in all for barriers  significantly more than the  5 7 billion he unsuccessfully demanded from congress the president opted not to tap hurricane relief money from texas or puerto rico  an idea that had generated angry complaints from republicans  but he expressed no concern that diverting military construction money would delay projects benefiting the troops like base housing  schools and gyms  it didnt sound too important to me  he said neither the white house nor the pentagon had yet identified which projects may be shelved as a result  but pentagon lawyers and other officials planned to work over the weekend to identify which construction funds would be diverted the declaration also provided that land may be transferred to the defense department from other federal agencies or from privately purchased or condemned land  the next step would be to secure those lands  where the pentagon would erect barriers  the declaration gives patrick shanahan  the acting defense secretary  broad latitude to carry out this process most americans oppose mr  trumps emergency declaration  according to polls  one released this week by fox news found 56 percent against it  including 20 percent of republicans mr  trumps desire for approval by fox and other conservative news outlets was on display when he identified various pundits as supporters  naming sean hannity  laura ingraham  tucker carlson and rush limbaugh  although he insisted that they dont decide policy but ms  coulter  who has viscerally attacked mr  trump for caving on the wall  has clearly gotten under his skin  i dont know her  he said before quickly correcting himself  i hardly know her  i havent spoken to her in way over a year  he noted  though  that she was an early predictor of his election victory  so i like her  but shes off the reservation  he said  but anybody that knows her understands that ms  coulter fired back shortly afterward  the only national emergency is that our president is an idiot  she said on kabc radio in los angeles white house officials rejected criticism from across the ideological spectrum that mr  trump was creating a precedent that future presidents could use to ignore the will of congress  republicans have expressed concern that a democratic commander in chief could cite mr  trumps move to declare a national emergency over gun violence or climate change without legislation from congress it actually creates zero precedent  mick mulvaney  the acting white house chief of staff  told reporters  this is authority given to the president in law already  its not as if he just didnt get what he wanted so hes waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money presidents have declared national emergencies under a 1970s era law about five dozen times  and 31 of those prior emergencies remain active  but most of them dealt with foreign crises and involved freezing property  blocking trade or exports or taking other actions against national adversaries  not redirecting money without explicit congressional authorization white house officials cited only two times that such emergency declarations were used by presidents to spend money without legislative approval  once by president george bush in 1990 during the run up to the persian gulf war  and again by his son  president george w  bush  in 2001 after the terrorist attacks in new york  washington and pennsylvania in both of those cases  the presidents were responding to new events  the iraqi invasion of kuwait and al qaedas assault on the united states  and were moving military funds around for a military purposes  neither was taking action specifically rejected by congress in mr  trumps case  he is defining a longstanding problem at the border as an emergency even though border apprehensions have actually fallen in recent years  to 400 000 in the last fiscal year from a peak of 1 6 million in the 2000 fiscal year  and unlike either of the bushes  he is taking action after failing to persuade lawmakers to go along with his plans through the regular appropriations process  read the first edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up for it here  the spending package passed thursday by congress included none of the  5 7 billion that mr  trump demanded for 234 miles of steel wall  instead  it provided  1 375 billion for about 55 miles of fencing  mr  trump signed the package into law on friday anyway to avoid a second government shutdown after the impasse over border wall funding closed the doors of many federal agencies for 35 days and left 800 000 workers without pay for weeks  republicans led by senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky urged mr  trump not to declare a national emergency  but the president opted to go ahead anyway to find a way out of the political corner he had put himself in with the failed effort to force congress to finance the wall mr  mcconnell privately told the president that he would support the move despite his own reservations  but warned mr  trump that he had about two weeks to win over critical republicans to avoid having congress vote to reject the declaration mr  trump was among those republicans who criticized president barack obama for using his executive authority to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation after failing to persuade congress to do so  repubs must not allow pres obama to subvert the constitution of the us for his own benefit   because he is unable to negotiate w  congress  mr  trump tweeted in 2014 but mr  trump sought to drive home the personal toll of illegal immigration  inviting to the rose garden several relatives of americans killed by people in the country without authorization  some of the relatives  known as angel moms  stood up holding pictures of loved ones who had died matthews death was preventable and should have been prevented  one of the women  maureen maloney  said in an interview after the event  her son matthew denice  23  was killed in 2011 in a motorcycle accident in massachusetts after colliding with an automobile driven by an undocumented immigrant  he should have never been here in the first place  she said  if he wasnt here  it wouldnt have happened .
good friday  want this by email  sign up here amazon yesterday canceled its plans to build a huge corporate campus in new york city  the decision was an abrupt turnabout after a yearlong search for a second headquarters  the tech giant ultimately decided to open two new sites  in queens and in virginia  each would have gained an estimated 25 000 jobs  but amazon faced a backlash in new york from lawmakers  activists and union leaders who said it didnt deserve nearly  3 billion in government incentives  the company made its decision late wednesday  after growing increasingly concerned that the backlash in new york showed no sign of abating and was tarnishing its image beyond the city  j  david goodman of the nyt writes  looking at the opposition and the timeline we decided we dont want to work in this environment in the long term  jodi seth  the head of policy communications for amazon  told nbc news this could be a turning point for corporate civic relations  it will surely change how companies think about doing business in certain states and cities  its also likely to make political leaders  especially in democratic regions  reconsider offering tax incentives to lure business   one big question here  should states and cities be allowed to offer subsidies to business in the first place  its also a clear sign that leftist views are gaining traction  the news is a short term win for progressive politicians like representative alexandria ocasio cortez  who are championing what they say are socialist messages   ms  ocasio cortez appeared to revel in the decision on twitter  saying that anything is possible   but in the longer term  those lawmakers may face a backlash if the loss of those 25 000 jobs in long island city hurts the local economy and it raises questions about the wider understanding of finance  n y c  wasnt handing cash to amazon  it was an incentive program based on job creation  producing tax revenue  andrew tweeted  there isnt a  3 billion pile of

city  real estate brokers are in despair  and tech could keep gaining ground in the city regardless president trump looks set to sign a bipartisan deal as soon as today to provide funding for border security and the federal government  but hes also expected to declare a national emergency to get more money to build his long promised border wall everything nearly fell apart yesterday  the president was frustrated after a briefing by homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen and others on details of the final deal to avoid a shutdown  the wapo reports  citing unnamed officials involved in the discussions  but assertions by the senate majority leader  mitch mcconnell  that the president had actually beaten democrats helped sway mr  trump by declaring a national emergency  mr  trump is hoping to gain access to billions more in federal funds  combined with the spending bill and other ways of diverting money  he expects to get about  8 billion   he originally asked for  5 7 billion from congress  there are huge concerns about the declaration  mr  trumps willingness to invoke emergency powers to circumvent congress is likely to go down as an extraordinary violation of constitutional norms  setting a precedent that future presidents of both parties may emulate to unilaterally achieve their own policy goals  charlie savage of the nyt writes what next  house democrats will probably try to terminate any declaration and the senate may follow suit  nicholas fandos of the nyt writes  but mr  trump would veto that legislation  and its unlikely that congress could override him  the white house could face legal battles over the declaration for years the social network is in talks with the federal trade commission to settle allegations of privacy violations  it could lead to a record multibillion dollar fine  cecilia kang of the nyt writes  the company and the f t c s consumer protection and enforcement staff have been in negotiations over a financial penalty for claims that facebook violated a 2011 privacy consent decree with the agency  the investigation began shortly after the cambridge analytica data scandal came to light in march 2018  some f t c  officials have pressed for maximum penalties because of several new reports of potential privacy breaches since the start of the investigation  the agency can seek up to  41 000 for each violation found by the agency  in the case of cambridge analytica  87 million people were affected  the current talks have not yet reached the f t c s five commissioners for a vote and it is unclear how close the two sides are to wrapping up the nearly 11 month investigation more facebook news  the social network reportedly uses its apps to track people that it believes are risks to its employees negotiators concluded talks today with no official announcement of an agreement  keith bradsher of the nyt reports  that leaves the state of the negotiations uncertain ahead of a deadline in two weeks  the two sides have been struggling with more than 100 issues raised by the united states in a lengthy statement given to chinese officials in may  expectations for the talks were low  though some progress was made in the prelude to this weeks discussions  for example  china agreed to disclose more of its government subsidies to the world trade organization  but big hurdles remained  mr  bradsher writes  including the trump administrations desire to put meaningful restrictions on chinas ability to keep investing enormous sums of money from the government  and from government affiliated financial institutions  in a wide range of advanced manufacturing sectors that compete with american industries  the united states had given china a march 2 deadline toward reaching a deal and threatened to raise tariffs on  200 billion worth of chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent  but mr  trump suggested this week that he could give china more time if the talks showed progress  its unclear whether the talks went far enough for that extension to be granted the british prime minister suffered an embarrassing defeat over britains exit from the european union last night  stephen castle of the nyt reports her current plan lacks support  by a margin of 303 to 258  lawmakers failed to support a motion endorsing the governments battered strategy  mr  castle writes  noting that a

good monday  want this by email  sign up here bipartisan negotiations to forge a border security deal broke down yesterday  potentially setting up the federal government for another shutdown ahead of a friday deadline what happened  the impasse appears to center on democratic demands for a limit on the number of unauthorized immigrants already in the country who could be detained by immigration and customs enforcement officers  according to aides familiar with the talks  according to the nyt  republicans wanted an exception to the cap for criminals  democrats said a proposed 16 500 bed cap left more than enough room for them whats at stake  the last shutdown  the longest in u s  history  cost the american economy  11 billion and tanked president trumps political standing with the public  another shutdown could cause more economic harm  hitting the i r s  just as tax season starts whats next  lawmakers could pass another short term spending bill  though many are reluctant to punt on a final budget agreement again  meanwhile  mr  trump is preparing to hold a rally for supporters in el paso   many in the city arent happy with that   but he really has only two choices  according to axios  shut down the government or declare a national emergency to get border wall money  and both options are horrible the amazon founder risked embarrassment by going public with what he said was an extortion attempt by the national enquirer  so far  hes scoring big points  saturday night live jokes aside  his disclosure has gotten results  federal prosecutors are reviewing his extortion claim  the nyt reports  citing unnamed sources  if the enquirers parent company broke the law  it would be in violation of a nonprosecution agreement over its paying hush money to help president trump in 2016   a lawyer for the publishers chairman said yesterday that the company committed no crime  and hes winning the p r  battle  at a time when billionaires are reviled  maureen dowd of the nyt writes  the richest dude on earth has managed to come through a traumatic week inspiring admiration   glenn greenwald of the intercept counters that it would be odd for mr  bezos to gain pity  given that amazon is a critical partner for the u s  government in building an ever more invasive  militarized and sprawling surveillance state  where did the enquirer go wrong  danny westneat of the seattle times points out that it picked a fight with the head of a company so powerful that it got seattle to change its tax policies and won  3 billion in tax incentives from new york for office space  you dont pressure amazon  it only goes the other way around  mr  westneat writes but mr  bezos could still lose  jon swartz of barrons notes that amazon shares fell 2 6 percent on friday  his hands on management is considered crucial to the success of the company and anything that pulls his attention away from day to day management is at least a concern for investors  mr  swartz writes fears that britains withdrawal from the e u  could roil economies have now officially spread across the atlantic wall street has been warned about brexits impact  with less than seven weeks to go before the u k  is due to leave the e u   several s p 500 groups have for the first time put wall street on formal notice of the risks should london and brussels fail to reach a divorce deal  the ft reports  companies like lockheed martin  mccormick  expedia and cadbury have all spoken out driving the concern are fears that a depressed pound could make american goods unaffordable in britain  while the costs of imported british goods could rise  theres also a fear about the broader effect of brexit on global political and economic stability american banks are also nervous  while u s  banks want britain to maintain the closest possible ties with the eu after brexit  u k  banks and insurers are anxious they dont become beholden to new laws made by brussels  bloomberg reports more brexit news  the e u s chief brexit negotiator  michel barnier  said that he will not reopen the existing brexit deal  but is open to reworking the political declaration that accompanies it  the british government is trying to secure an extra two weeks in which to win concessions from europe by promising lawmakers another vote on britains withdrawal options  and prime minister theresa may has also offered concessions to the opposing labour party to break the current impasse in parliament americans are getting a rude surprise  their refunds appear to be getting smaller  despite president trump and republicans passing a huge set of tax cuts over a year ago how big is the drop  the average refund of  1 865 was 8 4 percent smaller than the average refund in the period last year  reuters reports  citing figures from the i r s  heather long of the wapo adds that the number of people receiving a refund has fallen by nearly 25 percent so far   the i r s  warns not to read too much into the figures  because this is just part of the data  a result of delayed processing due to the government shutdown  why is this happening  its not actually a sign that americans are paying more in taxes  people generally got a piece of their tax cut last year gradually in the form of lower withholding on their paychecks  joseph rosenberg of the urban brookings tax policy center told the wapo people are angry nonetheless  the wapo reports  people have already taken to social media  using the hashtag  goptaxscam  to vent their anger  many blame president trump and the republicans for shrinking refunds  some on twitter even said they wouldnt vote for trump again after seeing their refunds slashed the last class of tech companies that gained valuations of over  1 billion  including uber and airbnb  remade entire industries  dont expect the next wave to be nearly as flashy  according to erin griffith of the nyt who are they  they have names like benchling  checkr and zola  and many create software for specific industries  including data analysis systems for farmers and background checks for gig workers why arent they as exciting as their predecessors  ms  griffith points out that uber  airbnb and their peers built global empires by simply taking existing businesses  like taxis  food delivery and hotels  and making them mobile  easy opportunities to disrupt traditional businesses have dried up  forcing new companies to find smaller niches but dont underestimate their potential  maybe its not as sexy as the companies in the first wave  the venture capitalist kirsten green conceded to the nyt  but anand sanwal of the data provider cb insights said they were still growing fast  adding  if you are one of those high momentum companies  investors are going to be beating down your door because there is so much interest in investing in the next big winner christine lagarde  the managing director of the international monetary fund  warned yesterday of a global economy that is growing more slowly than we had anticipated she sees four big risks  trade tensions and tariff escalations  financial tightening  uncertainty related to brexit outcome and spillover impact and an accelerated slowdown of the chinese economy are all clouds on the horizon  she told the world government summit in dubai and they could spell trouble  when there are too many clouds  she added  it

el paso  at a migrant shelter near the mexican border  three girls from guatemala  sisters aged 10  9 and 6  coughed and sniffled  one of them clung to both a teddy bear and a large bottle of pedialyte  to soothe her dehydration and flu the girls mother  nelcy  28  said her daughters got sick not during their long journey to the border in the back of a pickup truck  but during the 12 days they spent at two crowded government detention facilities before arriving at the privately run shelter in texas  it was very cold  especially for the children  said nelcy  who would only be identified by her first name  my children got sick  they gave us aluminum blankets  but it wasnt enough  president trump warned that he was considering declaring a national emergency to build the border wall  the shelter network here run by the nonprofit annunciation house is now receiving roughly 200 new migrants a day  the same number it saw in an entire week only a year ago  the number of migrants traveling as families crossing the border from mexico exceeded 25 000 in november  the highest numbers ever recorded like nelcy and her daughters  the new arrivals from central america are coming in much sicker  after being held far longer than ever before in bare bones government detention facilities never intended for children  asylum seekers bottled up in mexico are jumping fences and throwing rocks at officers  who are firing tear gas to push them away  hundreds of migrants have been released on city streets in recent weeks  uncertain of where to go  two sick migrant children have died while in custody a crisis of the kind president trump has long warned of is beginning to take shape along the countrys 1 900 mile border with mexico  a border security network built over a period of decades to handle large numbers of single men has in the past several years been inundated with women and children  and as the number of families has peaked in recent months  the system has increasingly been unable to accommodate all of them much of the growing chaos  say many of those who work along the border and in some of the governments own security agencies  is a result of a failed gamble on the part of the trump administration that a succession of ever harsher border policies would deter the flood of migrants coming from central america it has not  and the failure to spend money on expanding border processing facilities  better transportation and broader networks of cooperation with private charities  they say  has led to the current problems with overcrowding  health threats and uncontrolled releases of migrants in cities along the border its the complete  100 percent focus on harsher options that will deter the influx  with a disregard for managing whats happening  said a department of homeland security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of being fired  we have a lot more families  a lot more unaccompanied children  and the focus has just been on how can we deter  rather than how can we handle mr  trump has made it a priority to end what he calls the practice of catch and release  but the policy of holding large numbers of migrants in detention has led to capacity problems  the obama administration had a policy of releasing migrants who were considered safe and likely to appear in court in order to make room for others who were a higher priority for detention  but the trump administration has largely eliminated that practice the number of detainees at immigration and customs enforcement facilities has reached its highest point ever  according to figures provided by the agency  with an average daily population of 45 200 single adults and family units the result is the recent need to release large numbers of migrants  many simply dropped off at bus stations  about 600 migrants were dropped off with no advance planning in el paso during the last full week in december  similar releases have happened in recent days and weeks in arizona and california the homeland security official said the administration could have done more to improve the situation and avoid the recent mass drop offs  such as working more closely with nonprofit groups  they could have put more resources down there  either monetary or physical  the official said  there are things you could do to manage it so that its not just  were overwhelmed  were releasing them the administration blames congress and the courts for creating a system that encourages families who do not qualify for asylum to apply for the status anyway  often living in the country for months or years as their applications move through the courts  kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  has been critical of court rulings that make it difficult to hold migrants with children in detention for long periods  creating what officials say is a loophole that is encouraging migrants to bring their children on long  treacherous journeys from central america secretary nielsen has been saying for over a year to anyone who would listen  especially members of congress  that our frontline men and women dont have the adequate resources needed for the number of aliens we are apprehending  katie waldman  a spokeswoman for the homeland security department  said in a statement  this humanitarian crisis is driven by activist court rulings and poorly written laws that incentivize the smuggling of illegal immigrants under the age of 18 at the direction of the white house  the department of homeland security has churned out a series of aggressive initiatives aimed at discouraging migrants from coming  most of them have been quickly blocked by the courts last year  the government announced it would arrest close to 100 percent of all those who crossed the border illegally and separate them from their children  a measure that was blocked by the courts and rescinded  later  the administration tried to prevent migrants from applying for asylum anywhere but at legal border crossings  and then limited the number of migrants it would process each day at those border stations  that policy created logjams and escalating tensions at border stations from texas to california  though part of it  too  was enjoined by the courts some of those involved in the policymaking said that there was open acknowledgment within the government that the newest policies under development  a plan that would require asylum seekers to wait in mexico through the duration of their immigration cases  and one to build tent cities along the border to house more families  were either likely to face an immediate court injunction or were so costly that they could not be justified to taxpayers  but the officials said they were under orders from the white house to push forward its like  o k   why are we working on this if its just another lawsuit in the making  said a second homeland security official  who also spoke on the condition of anonymity  everybody knows that its going to be challenged in the courts and likely struck down  i dont think the people at the top feel like they have a choice  they just do what they are asked to do the situation has become more tense in recent weeks as ice authorities  who in the past were careful to coordinate with volunteer shelters when releasing migrants  have instead begun dropping them in large numbers in the streets in texas  arizona and california  forcing city officials and charity groups to scramble were dealing with the symptoms of the root cause  which is the lack of a rational immigration policy from washington  and both sides are culpable  said dee margo  the mayor of el paso city officials have been told that the government may soon increase the number of migrants released in el paso to 500 daily  that may be a killer  that may be a real challenge for us to be able to deal with  mr  margo said the government itself is dealing with some of the most acute problems  housing large numbers of families in border processing centers built to handle single men in yuma  ariz   87 percent of migrants apprehended in the current fiscal year were traveling as a family  and 50 percent of them were children  expenditures have shot up 600 percent since last year  with the money being spent on diapers  feminine care products  snacks and juice  said a border patrol official in the state who was not authorized to speak on the record while the yuma office was approved for some overtime funding and additional agents  requests for a modular facility to house children and families have been denied  the official said  the new building would add more showers to the current number  which is three  as well as add beds and play rooms for children the administrations aggressive focus on deterrence has built up the frustration of the migrants themselves  after trying to jump the fence at tijuana and fleeing a wave of tear gas on new years eve  fernando duarte  a 22 year old honduran  was among those hurling rocks at border patrol officers  he said he was determined to try again they are very wrong if they think tear gas will keep me from trying  mr  duarte said  i am trying to get a better future and a little gas wont stop me nowhere has the growing desperation of migrants been more apparent than in tijuana  the high volume of migrants from central america arriving there has collided with the trump administrations decision to ration the number of asylum requests processed each day  private shelters in tijuana managed by local christian and catholic groups are near capacity  pushing new migrants into tent cities and improvised shelters that lack proper sanitation the ones that are waiting for the door to open  theyre waiting three or four months  said victor clark alfaro  the director of the binational center for human rights in tijuana  others are getting desperate and prefer to try to cross illegally in november  municipal leaders in tijuana opened an improvised shelter at the benito juarez sports complex that turned  as mr  clark alfaro put it  into a central american ghetto  the conditions there grew increasingly dismal as winter brought cold weather and rain  and about 6 000 people were crowded into the stadium at one point  far beyond its capacity of roughly 2 000  the city shut down the shelter  as a replacement  the government opened a new shelter in el barretal on the east side of tijuana the barretal shelter is a large compound where hundreds of sleeping tents are lined up on the clean concrete floor  freshly laundered clothes hang from balconies and staircases inside  isabel lzaro daz  30  finished the meal she had waited in a long line for  grilled chicken  rice and beans on the way here  i regretted it a thousand times  she said of her decision to leave her native guatemala with her 5 year old son  adding of mr  trump  what he is doing is making us feel frustration and despair and putting us in a closed box with four closed walls  no entry or exit .
good monday   want this by email  sign up here  the future of boeings 737 max 8 plane is in question after an ethiopian airlines flight crashed yesterday  killing 157 people the ethiopian airlines flight was the second disaster involving the jet in five months  after a lion air crash in indonesia killed 189 people in october  its rare for two planes of the same model to be involved in accidents in such a short time span  the nyt reports the 737 max is core to boeings business  its the companys best selling model  list price   120 million   since its introduction in 2017  350 planes have been delivered  and 5 000 more are currently on order  chris bryant of bloomberg opinion notes that its success is why boeing shares are near a record high  though shares were down sharply in premarket trading china and indonesia have grounded the max 8 jets  chinas airlines had been enthusiastic customers of the new model  but as of this morning theyve been flying 737 800s instead concerns may give rivals a leg up  the 737 max was created to counter airbuss latest a320 variant  meanwhile  the chinese plane maker comac has been testing the c919  a rival of those jets  and has hoped to find buyers beyond china undeterred by a recent loss to democrats  president trump is expected to ask for  8 6 billion to finance a border wall in the next white house budget  which is to be sent to congress today  the proposal also includes  3 6 billion to replenish military construction funds that were diverted under a national emergency declaration  i would just say that the whole issue of the wall and border security is of paramount importance  said larry kudlow  the presidents top economic adviser  democrats rebuffed the proposal  congress refused to fund his wall  and he was forced to admit defeat  speaker nancy pelosi and senator chuck schumer said in a joint statement  the same thing will repeat itself if he tries this again the request is largely for show  as the nyt notes  the white house budget will serve more as a statement of values and a vehicle for political positioning than a plausible outline for how the government will actually raise and spend money dont expect the budget to be balanced  regardless of whether the wall funding is included  sign up for the dealbook newsletter and make sense of major business and policy headlines  in a push to strike a trade deal  the u s  may be at risk of signing a watered down agreement a potential compromise could enable a deal to be reached this spring  keith bradsher and ana swanson write  washington has been pushing beijing to agree to a so called enforcement mechanism that would allow the u s  to monitor chinas behavior and impose penalties for violations  wang shouwen  chinas vice minister of commerce for international trade negotiations  said on saturday that china would be amenable to an agreement that gave each side an equal right to take trade actions but chinas promises not to manipulate its currency dont seem to be particularly original  mr  bradsher writes  american negotiators want china to avoid devaluing its currency to achieve a competitive advantage for their exports  but currency provisions of the evolving trade agreement are essentially a reaffirmation of the statement that the g 20 economies  including china  issued in 2016 the bigger picture is a growing concern that  as the nyt editorial board points out  the trump administration may settle for an ephemeral victory at the expense of americas long term economic interests tomorrow  the british parliament is to vote on prime minister theresa mays deal for leaving the e u  right now  its chances for approval dont look good talks between britain and brussels are deadlocked  according to mrs  mays office  negotiators have been trying to secure last minute changes to win over british lawmakers  after a previous version of the agreement was overwhelmingly rejected by parliament some hard line brexiters say defeat is inevitable  and a former brexit secretary  david davis  has said that even a proposal for mrs  may to step down in exchange for support of her deal would not get the vote through meanwhile  those who want to stay in the e u  have wind in the sails  according to the british foreign secretary  jeremy hunt  who said over the weekend that there is a real risk of losing brexit  if mrs  mays deal is rejected  lawmakers would vote on whether to reject a no deal brexit and delay the withdrawal process  that could increase the chances of a second referendum more  brexit has reportedly spurred financial firms to move  1 2 trillion in assets and funds out of britain  and the bank of england has told some british lenders to triple holdings of easy to sell assets to weather a no deal brexit the fed chairman gave a rare interview to 60 minutes about the economy  future interest rate increases  and whether president trump could dismiss him on job security  heres the exchange between mr  powell and scott pelley of 60 minutes on the u s  economy  mr  powell said that america was in a good place  with a favorable outlook on inflation  the feds interest rate policy  he added  is appropriate   translation  dont be

washington  ebullient democrats assumed control of the house on thursday and elected representative nancy pelosi of california speaker  returning her to a historic distinction as the first woman to hold the post  they then moved to defy president trump and passed bills that would open government agencies shuttered by an impasse over his insistence on funding for a border wall  both measures are almost certain to die in the senate on the first day of divided government in a reordered washington  ms  pelosi  now second in line to the presidency  and mr  trump clashed from their respective ends of pennsylvania avenue almost from dawn until dusk the california democrat began her day by suggesting that a sitting president could be indicted  late in the day  mr  trump made an attention getting appearance in the white house briefing room with a belligerent demand for a wall on the border with mexico  drawing a rebuke from the newly installed house speaker  who said she would give no more than a dollar to fund what she branded an immorality in between  as the start of the new house showcased a younger and more diverse majority in the staid corridors of the capitol  ms  pelosi pledged to run a unifying congress that would bridge partisan divides and heal rifts in a polarized country our nation is at a historic moment  she declared  i pledge that this congress will be transparent  bipartisan and unifying  that we will seek to reach across the aisle in this country  and across divisions across our nation in ascending to the speakership  ms  pelosi finds herself at the fulcrum of a bitterly divided body politic  poised to do battle with and demand accountability from an increasingly combative mr  trump in ways that the republican congress of the past two years refused to  with mr  trump  his presidential campaign and his businesses all under federal and state investigations  ms  pelosis approach to confronting him  both through investigation and legislation  will probably define the 116th congress she wasted no time in doing so on thursday  hours after being sworn in  the late night  nearly party line votes on reopening the government began a pattern in an era of divided control  with a democratic house passing legislation that has no chance of being signed by the republican president  and the republican senate running interference to protect mr  trump  the white house had also issued an official statement threatening a veto lets not waste the time  said senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader mr  trump used his abrupt appearance in the white house briefing room  his first since taking office  to talk about the importance of the wall  he was flanked by border agents who echoed his message the president congratulated ms  pelosi on her election and said he had high aspirations for the new congress  but he turned immediately to making the case for a wall that democrats have uniformly rejected  saying  without a wall  you cannot have border security  mr  trump also used social media to press his message  posting on his instagram account a photograph of his face with the text the wall is coming  a take on an advertisement for the cable tv series game of thrones that bore the ominous slogan winter is coming as afternoon turned to evening and the votes to reopen the government approached  ms  pelosi told reporters sarcastically  in response to a question  that she would give him  1  but only that  for the wall were not doing a wall  ms  pelosi said sternly outside the house chamber  does anybody have any doubt that were not doing a wall  so thats that that capped a day that began with a warning shot to mr  trump  suggesting that a sitting president could be indicted i think that is an open discussion in terms of the law  ms  pelosi said in an interview on nbc in a statement that served as a two pronged warning  both to her left flank and to the president  she said that the house would not move quickly to impeach mr  trump  but would not shy away from doing so if it were warranted we have to wait and see what happens with the mueller report  ms  pelosi said  referring to the special counsel  robert s  mueller iii  who is investigating russias interference in the 2016 election  we shouldnt be impeaching for a political reason  and we shouldnt avoid impeachment for a political reason  so well just have to see how it comes  read here for all of the days events  by early afternoon  partisan politics were put aside  if only briefly  for a transition of power from republicans to democrats  as a majority of lawmakers rose in turn from their seats on the house floor to utter ms  pelosis name and formally award her the gavel she gave up in 2011 ms  pelosi ascended to the marble dais in the center of the house chamber with representative kevin mccarthy of california  the incoming republican leader  who handed her the wooden gavel to the speaker of the house  ms  pelosi  he said  i extend to you the gavel  the room erupted into applause as she held it aloft moments later  with a come on  kids  ms  pelosi invited the children and grandchildren of representatives on the floor of the house to surround her as she took the oath of office  becoming the first person since representative sam rayburn more than 60 years ago to reclaim the speakership after losing it i now call the house to order on behalf of all of americas children  ms  pelosi said after she was sworn in but even in its pledges of unity and a new bipartisan spirit  ms  pelosi managed some subtle swipes at the president and his party  at one point while discussing immigration  she quoted president ronald reagan he said  if we ever close the door to new americans  our leadership role in the world will soon be lost  ms  pelosi said  drawing a standing ovation from democrats in the well of the house  but grim faced silence from most of those seated on the republican side you dont applaud for ronald reagan  she scoffed the scene was strikingly different on the other side of the chamber  where some democrats wore the traditional clothing of their communities  a palestinian thobe  a muslim hijab or head scarf  a pueblo dress  it was a visual change in a chamber that has for centuries been overwhelmingly white and male as promised  democrats approved bills intended to reopen the government and to remake rules of the house  one of the spending bills would fund most shuttered departments and agencies through sept  30 and the other is a stopgap measure to restart the department of homeland security for a few weeks earlier  they approved a suite of new rules that will set the tone for their majority  including a measure  opposed by liberal members  to require that any policy mandating new funding be accompanied with corresponding tax increases or spending cuts  another change would automatically raise the statutory limit on the national debt when the house approves a budget  avoiding politically difficult votes each time the ceiling is reached  which dogged republicans and led to a series of fiscal cliffhangers during their years in the majority also included were revisions to ensure that bipartisan proposals could be more easily considered  pushed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers billing themselves the problem solvers caucus ms  pelosis election was not without dissent  having spent more than 15 years at the helm of her party and been demonized by republicans during the midterm congressional elections as the face of far left radicalism  ms  pelosi  78  spent the weeks after democrats won putting down a rebellion over her leadership in democratic ranks and consolidating support through a combination of deal cutting and cajoling she suffered more than a dozen defections  the freshman representatives anthony brindisi of new york  jason crow of colorado  joe cunningham of south carolina  ben mcadams of utah  max rose of new york  mikie sherrill of new jersey  elissa slotkin of michigan  abigail spanberger of virginia  jeff van drew of new jersey and jared golden of maine  as well as representatives jim cooper of tennessee  ron kind of wisconsin  conor lamb of pennsylvania  kurt schrader of oregon and kathleen rice of new york many of the newly elected members had campaigned calling for change in washington and for a new generation of leadership for their party  and had promised not to vote for ms  pelosi  as part of a final deal to shore up support  ms  pelosi agreed to limit her speakership to four years but two of the ringleaders of the squelched effort to depose ms  pelosi  representatives seth moulton of massachusetts and tim ryan of ohio  ultimately voted for her with her re election  the biggest republican super pac  and the one that arguably tried the hardest in 2018 to link democratic candidates to ms  pelosi  practically celebrated  democratic candidates spent the last two years promising voters that theyd be different  they wouldnt stand for the same old leadership and the same old way of doing business in washington  the super pac  the congressional leadership fund  said in a statement  yet with the very first chance they got  they broke their word and their bond with the voters who elected them the national republican congressional committee  the partys house campaign arm  wasted no time in targeting democrats in competitive districts who voted for ms  pelosi  sending voters in their districts texts immediately after the vote  saying that their representatives are once again ignoring your voice fight back now  the texts read the swift political broadsides drew condemnation from ms  pelosis team they threw everything but the kitchen sink at nancy pelosi  and her strategy powered by her fund raising turned 43 red seats blue  said drew hammill  her spokesman  they wasted tens of millions failing from coast to coast in a tired strategy that did nothing to save their majority but amid that partisan acrimony  the spirit of a new generation of democrats was in evidence in the well of the house  several lawmakers bounced or rocked infants as they cast their votes for speaker  while representative alexandria ocasio cortez of new york  at 29 the youngest person to be elected to the house  made a heart sign with her hands at loved ones in the gallery above  representative rashida tlaib  democrat of michigan  voted for ms  pelosi for the future of our children  she said  while her own two children dabbed beside her .
the weekend traffic in the center of athens was awful on the late january day i decided to visit the site of platos academy  each of the narrow  slightly dog legged streets in plaka  the old city  was completely jammed  because recent angry protests  some of them violent  had forced the closing of roads around syntagma  or constitution square still  pedestrians were out in impressive force  filling the streets  intent on enjoying their saturday shopping  athenians take their weekends very seriously  pantelis  my cabdriver  threaded his way delicately around people suddenly lurching  seemingly semi oblivious  into the street and the constant chorus of motorcycles appearing out of nowhere and disappearing noisily into the distance once past the clogged junction at monastiraki square  we pushed more easily along ermou street and headed northwest  we came to an area scattered with warehouses and former factories  the cab stopped by a huddle of abandoned buses  ahead of us was what looked like an open area of greenery  pantelis pointed and said  akadimia platonos  this must be the place  i thought platos academy is now a public park in a not particularly nice part of town  it is just next to colonus  sophocles birthplace and  according to the legend he helped to invent  the final resting place of oedipus  the day was cool and sunny  but the previous 48 hours had been filled with storms  strong winds and intense rain as i entered the park from the south  the ground was muddy with large puddles  my boots slipped and slid underfoot as i made my way past a man talking loudly on a cellphone in what i think was bengali  a couple were playing in the distance with their dog  there was an empty playground and a rather nice gravel area for playing ptanque  which is apparently popular with the locals  it was also deserted i oriented myself with notes and guidebooks and made my way to the ruins of gymnasium  which is thought to have been the main building of the academy  a large grassy hollow indicated the site of a former archaeological dig  i peered through some trees into the open  green area of the ruins  there was a solitary man standing  very reflectively  smoking a huge joint with what appeared to be a bottle of water at his feet  in fact  the only people i saw around the various ruins were doing exactly the same thing as this man  quietly getting wasted on a saturday lunchtime  i began to doubt whether the liquid was water or some kind of clear alcohol  as these men didnt have the appearance of compulsive brooklyn yoga hydrators  ah  the sacred groves of academe after a moments hesitation  i walked down into the ruins  exchanged a brief ya sass  hello  with the man  who didnt seem to care in the slightest that i was there  it was very quiet  and all around was a calming  low chatter of birds  no riots here i began to try to imagine the academy the school  founded by plato around 387 b c e   was named the hecademia and later academia after the nearby sanctuary dedicated to the hero hecademus  in platos time  the area occupied about 1 5 hectares  about 3 5 acres  and was reached by leaving the city of athens by the diplon gate and walking along a road flanked by a public cemetery  the gymnasium was a rectangular complex  approximately 200 feet long and 100 feet wide  standing in the ruins  the scale of the building felt larger than i had anticipated  the site was excavated in 1929 39 and a plan of the main building was published an open courtyard or atrium was surrounded on three sides by a single story  roofed colonnade or peristyle  which may have provided shelter for academicians engaged in reading and copying papyri or perhaps just passing the time  in the middle of the atrium stood a cistern  which supplied water  and farther north are the remains of a pedestal on which stood statues of the nine muses  the protectresses of the arts and letters the academy is literally a museum  a temple or a sacred space  an association that is continued in aristotles lyceum and on into the most famous library of the ancient world  the museum of alexandria  which contained its famous and famously destroyed library   founded by the ptolemies after 297 b c e behind the muses was the main building of the academy  divided into a number of rooms  we are not exactly sure of their function  but it is highly likely that they were used for teaching and were equipped with boards  writing materials  geometric instruments  globes and celestial spheres  but the center of the academy was the library  well stocked with texts  stacked papyri  possibly with labels  on which the titles were inscribed  the library was the first of its kind in athens to delve a little deeper  heres an intriguing question  what was on the shelves of platos library  what had he read and what did he give his students to read  we can only guess  but its likely there would have been writings on mathematics  geometry and medicine  volumes by homer and hesiod  from the evidence of the dialogues  it is clear that plato had read the long lost works of pre socratic thinkers like heraclitus  on nature  and anaxagoras  nous   and texts by the eleatic thinkers like parmenides  it is also said that plato made an extremely expensive purchase of three works by pythagoras  there would also have been works by the sophists  whom plato loathed  and possibly the widely read works of the atomists  like democritus  whom plato completely ignored  possibly out of envy in addition to the bookshelves storing these texts  there was possibly a wooden dais for the readings  lectures and discussions that took place daily  most intriguing perhaps in the design of the academy is the house of the reader  or anagnostes  it is said that a young aristotle served as reader or lector during his 20 years in the academy  apparently  he was nicknamed nous or mind by plato  which seems appropriate  it would appear that the agnostic reader was responsible for reading aloud every treatise submitted for publication in the academy what is striking is the wholly geometric nature of the design of the academy  which my new friend  mr  staikos  thinks was due to the influence of the pythagorean school that plato encountered on his trips to sicily and that had been revived by archytas of taras  a friend of platos and some say the model for the philosopher king described in the republic  legend has it that the motto of the academy  written over the entrance  was let no one ignorant of geometry enter  for the academy is not just a building  it is an idea  in accordance with platos theory of the forms  but also the pythagorean view that ultimate reality is expressed by number but the academy was also a privately funded research and teaching facility  situated outside the city  most of us have a rather whimsical idea of philosophy as a bunch of men in togas having a chat in the agora  and we think of socrates as a gadfly  philosophizing in the street and somehow speaking truth to power  its an attractive idea  but this is the literary conceit of philosophy  one that is still in circulation today  it is the fiction that plato wants his readers to believe behind that fiction stands the library  the editing and copying rooms  and the entire research engine of the academy  which was devoted to the careful production and dissemination of knowledge through texts and teaching  much as we may flinch at the idea  philosophy has always been academic and linked to the activity of schools since its inception at this point  a rather vulgar question comes to mind  who paid for the academy  according to mr  staikos  the cost of construction is estimated at 25 to 30 talents  as a wild modern day estimate  we could say that the academy cost a couple of hundred thousand dollars to build  how did plato get this money  we dont know  it is said that he was captured on his return trip from sicily in 387 and sold as a slave on the island of aegina  which athens was at war with at the time  according to one account  anniceris of cyrene paid a ransom of 30 minas  but he refused to be paid back after plato was returned to athens  and the money was used to pay for a plot of land where the academy was built although the splendidly unreliable diogenes laertius says that plato possessed no property other than what is mentioned in his will  he received a large sum of money from dionysius i  plato had a significant fund of money at his disposal  the exorbitant figure of 80 talents is mentioned   indeed  plato is also said to have had a banker called andromedes  in other words  plato was rich and had wealthy patrons and very probably wealthy students we are less attracted to the idea of the wealthy aristocratic philosopher sequestered in his research facility and making occasional overseas trips to visit foreign tyrants than the image of the poor  shoeless socrates causing trouble in the marketplace  refusing to be paid and getting killed by the city for his trouble  but our captivation with this image  once again  is overwhelmingly platos invention and behind his extraordinary inventiveness  plato performs a characteristic disappearing trick  truth to tell  we know very little about plato  according to plutarch  he was a lover of figs  big deal  plato is mentioned only a couple of times in the many dialogues that bear his name  he was present at socrates trial but  in a beautifully reflexive moment that he describes in the phaedo  absent from the moment of socrates death  because he was sick in fact  we dont even know that he was called plato  which might have been a nickname  laertius claims that he was actually called aristocles  after his grandfather  plato is close to the word broad in greek  like the broad leaves of the platanos or plane tree under which socrates and phaedrus sit and talk about eros  some think that plato was so called because he was broad shouldered because of his prowess in wrestling i began to ponder and wandered from the gymnasium  across the park and a street to the scant remains of another building in the academy complex  which is approximately 130 feet square  it has the typical dimensions of a palaestra  or wrestling school  in my minds eye  i saw an elderly plato sitting watching his academicians wrestle  occasionally offering coaching advice and encouragement sometimes the less we know  the more space is open to the imagination plato worked at the academy until his death in 347 b c e   interrupted only by two more extended trips to sicily  the academy survived for a few more centuries until it was destroyed by the roman general sulla in 87 b c e  during the sack of athens  the buildings were probably burned along with many other sanctuaries  and the trees from the grove of academe were felled to provide timber for his siege machines  so it goes  i thought a faint but clearly perceptible smell of urine hung in the air of the palaestra  on the corner as i looked up  two men were rummaging carefully and quietly through a baby blue refuse bin what was striking was how exposed and all these remains were  no fences  no border walls and no security cameras it was time to go  on the corner of hodos platonos  plato street  i noticed a bar unsurprisingly called platon  i thought about having a quick glass of red wine in platos honor  but lost courage  took two photos  and left .
good tuesday  want this by email  sign up here president trump plans to nominate david malpass  the under secretary of the treasury for international affairs  to head the world bank  according to administration officials hes likely to land the gig  the nomination must be ratified by the banks board  writes peter baker of the nyt  but by tradition  the united states  the largest shareholder  has long named its president  mr  trump is expected to announce his pick tomorrow and he could shake things up  like mr  trump  he has questioned the scope and mission of international institutions such as the world bank  saying they have grown more intrusive and need to be refocused  mr  baker writes  the larger trend toward multilateralism  he has said  has gone substantially too far that makes him a contentious choice  the prospect of such a steadfast critic of multilateral lenders leading the world bank has already sparked concern and dismay within the institution and among international and former u s  officials who deal with global finance and development  write james politi and sam fleming of the ft there were less controversial options  indra k  nooyi  the former c e

arent grounds for an indictment  mr  schatzker writes  if thats so  it raises a question about the broader u s  crackdown on huawei  is it based on hard evidence of wrongdoing or driven by a desperation to catch the chinese company doing something  anything  bad  but an indictment would show just how far and wide huawei is willing to go to steal american trade secrets more huawei news

bret stephens  gail  the word is that robert mueller may soon send his report to attorney general william barr  do you expect a bombshell  a dud  or just a lot more confusion  depending on what barr makes public and what congress chooses to do with its conclusions gail collins  well  weve already got indicted minions  as to trump himself  i feel very safe voting for a lot more confusion  just on general principles  the trump presidential campaign was knee deep in conflicts of interest  many of them involving russia  but given the mans general disorganization  i find it hard to imagine the report picking him out as the sinister  canny leader who was orchestrating everything behind the scenes still feeling that the real disaster for trump is going to come with the investigations into his business practices in new york  how about you bret  thats my guess  too  trumps  100 million inauguration committee looks like a giant pay to play scheme  i still think his alleged campaign finance violations in connection to the stormy daniels and karen mcdougal payoffs are criminal and impeachable  and who knows what else muellers investigation have dredged up about trump family values gail  the family that stays together preys together bret  and vice versa  that said  if mueller finds no clear and credible evidence of collusion or cooperation between the trump campaign and russia  it will be a major political victory for the president and a liability for his detractors  fairly or not  it will call all the other investigations into question  however credible or serious they may be thats one of the reasons ive been leery of investing too much political capital in wondering what trump might have done behind peoples backs  its what he does every day in plain sight that is much more concerning gail  even if the mueller investigation fails to produce  well still have a bunch of congressional committees digging up dirt  but i know thats not as satisfying for a conservative trump hater  youre right that theres plenty to investigate in his normal day to day life  which horrible things the president has done lately seem most appalling to you bret  well  that list is long  but let me start by praising trump on a couple of fronts  i think hes shown moral leadership on venezuela  by getting much of the world to recognize juan guaid as the legitimate president and drawing attention to the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding under the maduro regime  and im also glad hes partially reversed course and will keep at least some troops in syria  i hope he winds up withdrawing none of them so long as they can help protect our kurdish friends and deter our syrian  iranian  russian and turkish foes o k  now to the rest  his declaration of a national emergency over border wall funding is a threat to constitutional government and the separation of powers and sets a precedent that both sides will abuse if the supreme court doesnt stop it gail  no disagreement on the national emergency  the fact that you havent seen a major uprising of republicans over that is proof that theres no real republican party anymore  only trumpism and im looking forward to the next democratic president declaring that climate change is a national emergency bret  his unloading on the new york times as a true enemy of the people is an assault on the first amendment and the safety of journalists  including us  his hankering for a deal  any deal  with north koreas kim jong un so that he can win a nobel peace prize is a danger to peace and stability in asia gail  our publisher really called trump out on the danger he is creating for journalists  its perilous enough reporting from trouble spots around the globe without having the president of the united states cheerleading for the enemies of a free press bret  his desire to start another trade war with europe  this time over cars  is a threat to global growth and another nail in the coffin of trans atlantic unity  his nonstop lies and exaggerations and demagoguery about the purported evils of illegal immigration are an insult to our intelligence and devastating to the g o p s chances of ever again being a majority party gail  i love it when you get on a roll like this  keep going bret  and his overall comportment continues to be a foul stain on the office of the presidency  a moral embarrassment to a majority of americans  and a blot on the record of liberal democracy  how about you gail  well  youve kind of run the table  but id add his attempts to undermine womens reproductive rights  the assault on planned parenthood isnt just about abortion  its about the far rights hatred of anything that gives women the power to decide if and when they want to get pregnant  cant tell you what a deep irony it is to have this guy leading that crusade bret  id call it hypocrisy  not irony  but im being pedantic gail  and everything about guns and domestic violence  many people have taken note of the fact that the president tweeted out about the smollett scandal and the suit against the washington post by the kentucky high school student who was involved in that incident with a native american in washington  but not a twittery word about the white supremacist coast guard officer who has been accused of stockpiling weapons to murder newscasters and liberal politicians  when reporters asked him about it  all trump could come up with was  i think its a shame  thats the kind of thing you say when a politician gets caught cheating on his wife  not when youre talking about a self declared white supremacist intent on a politically inspired mass slaughter bret  the smollett and covington high stories are fascinating in a cultural sense  mostly for what they tell us about our current culture of victimhood and the assumptions too many people  including too many in our profession  make about who is the victim based on current stereotypes  but the case of the coast guard officer is genuinely terrifying given that it comes on the heels of the florida mail bomber  the pittsburgh mass killer and the california man charged last year with phoning in death threats to journalists  thats a terrifying reality of the culture war from which most of the right prefers to look away gail  not long before he announced that he was running for president  trump went to an n r a  convention and got a wild  massive reception  right then i knew he was going to be a huge gun rights supporter  no matter what he had believed before when he was running against hillary clinton i thought he was terrible  but not nearly as terrible as he turned out to be  kind of amazing  did you foresee all of this bret  partly  i wrote more than a dozen columns for the wall street journal during the last presidential campaign  denouncing his bigotry  lawlessness  ignorance and demagoguery  he vindicates my first impression with his every foul tweet  i think hes debasing our political culture in ways we will be living with  and suffering from  for at least a generation  and hes becoming a role model of sorts for other populist demagogues around the world  from brazil to italy gail  well  i wrote a lot about what a jerk hed been in new york for the last 30 odd years  i guess i didnt take him seriously enough because hed always behaved like such a fool bret  on the other hand  the world didnt end with his presidency  the economy is robust  we havent stumbled into a catastrophic war  yet   and democracy is still alive and well considering all the democrats planning to run against him  that isnt to say things might not still go horribly wrong  only that the habit of comparing trump to despots of yore is off the mark and undermines the case against him gail  right  hes our own special unique despot wannabe bret  but can i switch the subject  last week the times ran an eye opening story on senator amy klobuchar of minnesota  basically to the effect that she is a truly horrible boss  with some of the highest staff turnover in the senate  from a policy standpoint shes my favorite democrat in the race  but this is a serious issue for her candidacy  how do you think voters should factor that into their considerations gail  im playing the wait and see card  were undoubtedly going to find out unpleasant things about a lot of the candidates as we go along  but that story about her using her comb to eat a salad on an airplane and then giving it to her aide to wash is going to  resonate your position is that youll vote for whoever the democrats nominate  even if its a modern day attila the hun  right bret  definitely not  of course i cant vote for trump under any circumstance  but i would never vote for bernie sanders  who seems to think bread lines are a good thing because theyre egalitarian  i couldnt vote for elizabeth warren  either  shes too far to my left and her prevarications about her ancestry are morally insulting and intellectually embarrassing  i have personal reservations about cory booker  stemming from his deceits as mayor of newark  and kamala harris  stemming from her behavior as a prosecutor  if any of them is the nominee  i will probably write in bill weld or john kasich or larry hogan  middle of the road republicans or former republicans who know how to win over democrats and could govern from the center gail  ah  i remember many republicans who had those sentiments  trump was appalling and impossible to support  but hillary clinton was too far a bridge to cross  and so they voted for people like gary johnson  the libertarian  which meant they helped put trump in office bret  i voted for hillary clinton  even though i had plenty of reservations  but theres no way im going to follow democrats jumping off the cliff on the left because im angry at republicans for jumping off the cliff on the right gail  really  i have to warn you  if i hear any trump hater talking about writing in his mothers name or the green party name or howard schultz i immediately decide this is a person who would rather have four more years of donald trump than compromise his principles by voting for a deeply imperfect democrat bret  im already compromising many of my usual political principles by voting for centrist democrats  never mind the real lefties  i could vote for joe biden  though i doubt hell get the nomination  or senator michael bennet from colorado  our bosss brother   or any other middle of the road democrat  that category included klobuchar  but i have a problem with people who are horrible bosses and dont have the good sense to use their fingers to eat the way i do but lets talk about something our readers really care about  the oscars  did you watch  did your favorites win gail  i believe this is the first year ever that ive seen all the movies nominated for best picture  and best actress and best actor  and pretty much everything  this is all about avoiding donald trump  since hes been president ive instinctively organized my life around trying to forget about current events for at least a few hours a day  its the same reason ive been watching football for the first time in my life but about the winners  i like watching people be genuinely surprised  so i really enjoyed seeing olivia colman win for playing the dotty queen in the favourite  how about you bret  i saw only a few of the films  but i was thrilled with the win for free solo  the documentary about climber alex honnold that i wrote a column about last year  and i was deeply moved by roma  i grew up in mexico city  and the movie perfectly captured a world i know very  very well  nice to see that in this accelerated age of ours theres still appreciation for a film that takes it slow and goes deep gail  and while were talking about awards that made me happy  congratulations on winning the ellis island medal of honor  bret  im so glad your fight for immigrant rights is being recognized  you deserve it  and as a bonus  i cant think of anything that would irritate donald trump more bret  thanks  gail  of course ill be bringing my mom to the ceremony  this year will be her 69th as an immigrant in this country .

hi  welcome to on politics  your guide to the day in national politics  im lisa lerer  your host a lot has been made of the new democratic majority in the house  theyre young  female  diverse  outspoken all the focus on democrats made us curious about what being in the new congress looks like from the other side of the aisle representative dan crenshaw  a former navy seal with no prior experience in elected office  has emerged as one of the stars of the new republican class  he survived a crowded primary race and a runoff for the republican nomination last year  en route to winning his houston area district but real fame came shortly after the election  when mr  crenshaw  who wears an eye patch because of an injury he suffered in afghanistan  appeared on saturday night live to rebut the comedian pete davidson  who had mocked mr  crenshaw as looking like a hit man from a porno movie  the two offered a sincere plea for civility  and a political star was born since then  mr  crenshaws staunch support for president trumps border wall and his fiery presence on social media have some republicans calling him the conservative answer to alexandria ocasio cortez we recently talked with mr  crenshaw about the wall  social media and civility in politics  the interview was conducted before mr  trump agreed on a border deal  but we decided to leave in those parts of the conversation  because the debate over the wall isnt going away anytime soon  as usual  our interview has been edited and condensed for clarity lisa  you came into congress in the middle of the shutdown  was that frustrating  i mean  youre here to make a difference  presumably  and you enter in a stalemate  dan crenshaw  the frustrating part for me is why we were shut down  you cant just be mad at a shutdown  you do have to take a side  and in the end  this shutdown boils down to  5 billion over basically extending the authorizations weve had in the past  thats whats frustrating  that were actually arguing over that well  its about the wall  right  sure  to me  its frustrating that we cant come to a deal  i mean  the idea of a government shutdown  its a consequence of our system  the president is under no obligation to sign the spending bills that congress gives to him  and once that happens  once he says no  then youre supposed to negotiate  so the frustrating part was to see how the democrats refused to negotiate that didnt really make it out into the media very much because  i mean  we can say it all we want  but the media  generally speaking  the cnn pundits and the new york times  will generally call it the trump shutdown  because he owned it initially  i get that  but once he owned it  he asked to negotiate  and i think thats a pretty fair ask  he did not have anyone to negotiate with  so that was frustrating  to watch that play out from the inside now  it looks like maybe the deal will be less money for the wall  or some kind of fencing the semantics over wall versus fencing  first of all  are highly misleading  trumps plan has been what normal people would describe as fencing for a long time now  i get that he still calls it a wall  but thats because in our english language a normal person would go up to what we have on the border right now and say its a wall  or a fence  and theyd both be right what were actually talking about is steel bollard fencing  again  its a mass misinformation campaign by the other side on this  and thats been amplified by a lot of the media  is that were just talking about 2 000 miles of  like  concrete wall  its so unbelievably false i want like a giant reset button to be like  o k   lets start the debate over  because i wasnt here when we started the debate  now i am  id like us to be very honest about what were talking about sounds like youre describing a messaging problem for republicans  i dont have all the answers  but i think the way id describe the right way to message is to help people understand the why behind the what  its like  why do i believe we need extra fencing down the southern border  and in a deeper why than just  hey  its security and murders and crime  some of thats true  but it leads us into a debate about how much crime and how much drugs the why is  we enforce our laws  and because we believe in our own sovereignty  and i believe that illegal immigrants shouldnt be able to cut in front of legal immigrants  thats a better why traditionally in washington  there was an idea that as a new member you come in and keep a low profile  you  and other freshmen  are clearly taking a different approach  why  there was no  like  decision point  they listen to me because i just have a large following  and yeah  i got famous on national tv theres a sequence of events that drew us here  its like  you know  why is a o c   alexandria ocasio cortez  famous  its just that story of beating joe crowley  once that hooks people  and youve got that following  thats sort of self perpetuating  there isnt really a rule  necessarily  that the leadership tries to keep freshmen from talking youve used some of that platform to call for a return to civility  what does that look like for you  it just looks like  dont question the other peoples character you can be pretty sharp  particularly on twitter yeah  i can be sharp  but what i never say is  you know  let me give an example of what they do to us all the time  you cant say that because youre a white christian man  thats not civil  thats avoiding the debate of ideas and attacking a person because of who they are  thats not o k i will attack ideas very hard  i am not shy about that one bit  so i dont want people to think that because i had a call for civility that that means i shy away from debate and that im agreeable  thats not the case  what is the case is that i will not question who you are as a person you can say that your ideas are bad for america  and frankly un american  but dont say the person is a traitor  thats the line that we should aspire to  at least in the short term do you think the president crosses that line well  lets see  im trying to think of some examples lyin ted  liddle marco  horseface  i can keep going yeah  those are examples  sure so name calling  in general  is bad  and then what i see from the other side is like  if youre calling someone a racist  bigot  homophobe  and they have their list  right  and thats terrible  you know what  with everything happening in virginia right now  are we all on social media calling him a racist  no  actually  were saying you did something racist  see  thats the difference  to say someone is a racist  versus saying you did something or said something that could be perceived as racist you think theres a way to unwind this new tone just be part of the solution and not part of the problem  thats the only way  read the latest edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter from the times about life where the united states and

good tuesday  breaking  karl lagerfeld  the influential fashion designer and longtime creative director of chanel  has died at 85   want this by email  sign up here  as mckinsey   company advised some of the biggest companies in the world  the nyt reports  it may have had a vested interest in the outcome  through a little known in house hedge fund that holds stakes in some of the firms clients little about the fund  the mckinsey investment office  is public  a large part of its approximately  12 3 billion in holdings is concealed behind a tangle of shell companies in an island tax haven in the english channel  the nyt reports  as a result  any intersections between mckinseys consulting work and the funds investments are largely hidden the office took a stake in valeant  the drug maker that was advised by mckinsey and is accused of improperly raising pharmaceutical prices  it also invested in puerto rican bonds while the firm advised the island on how to deal with its debt mckinsey says theres no conflict of interest   it insists the office is run separately from its consulting operations  and that 90 percent of its funds are run by outside managers but it faces increasing skepticism about that from congress and in various lawsuits  a federal judge in virginia last month reopened a coal company bankruptcy case after learning that mckinsey had not disclosed  as required by law  that it was also among the companys secured creditors  through mio  the nyt reports a coalition of 16 states  including california and new york  sued the trump administration yesterday over his plan to use emergency powers to spend billions of dollars on a border wall  charlie savage and robert pear of the nyt report  the clash raises questions over congressional control of spending  the scope of emergency powers granted to the president  and how far the courts are willing to go to settle such a dispute  xavier becerra  the attorney general of california  said in an interview that the president himself had undercut his argument that there was an emergency on the border  the lawsuit  california et al  v  trump et al   says that the plaintiff states are going to court to protect their residents  natural resources and economic interests  plaintiffs will need to establish standing by showing that they are suffering some particular injury from what mr  trump is doing  several of the lawsuits involve people who own land or represent communities along the mexican border in texas  where mr  trump has put the focus of his emphasis on the need for more barriers after a series of discussions between america and china in beijing last week that president trump called very productive  negotiators reopen their conversations in washington this week whats happening  negotiations kick off today  then on thursday and friday  vice premier liu he of china will meet with the u s  trade representative  robert lighthizer  and treasury secretary steven mnuchin  according to bloomberg what to expect  the trump administration is racing to strike a deal that will result in long term reforms  according to the wsj  which notes that such a pact would prove that tariffs are an effective battering ram to open markets around the world but its not done yet  despite mr  trump tweeting that big progress being made on soooo many different fronts  in these trade negotiations so far  the wsj reports that people briefed on the negotiations said big outstanding differences remain more trade news  why mr  trump may want to keep car tariffs in his back pocket  hsbc says the u s  china trade war is why it missed its profit targets  with just over a week to go before a crucial vote  the british prime minister is facing shifting groupings in parliament and a difficult diplomatic mission to

reactions were largely unimpressed  the telegraph reports that their ranks could swell  and that some members of mrs  mays conservative party may also join and mrs  may is running out of time  there are nine days left until a parliamentary vote that could seize control of the brexit process from her  so this week  bloomberg reports  she is mounting a last ditch diplomatic push  the british prime minister is planning to meet european commission president jean claude juncker this week  foreign secretary jeremy hunt will travel to berlin  brussels and copenhagen  while brexit secretary steve

tuesday how the most contentious part of the brexit deal  the so called backstop plan for the irish border  could be changed but the e u  isnt budging yet  we are happy to revisit anything that would clarify the situation without reopening the withdrawal agreement  a spokesman for the european commission  margaritis schinas  said more brexit news  the japanese automaker honda plans to close its plant in swindon  england  which employs 3 500 people  though it didnt blame brexit  wall street banks are moving out of london  but not to any single european financial capital a british parliamentary committee issued a scathing report yesterday that accuses facebook of breaking data privacy and competition laws and calls for tighter regulations  adam satariano of the nyt reports  the parliamentary report recommends the creation of a british watchdog to oversee the technology industry  similar to the countrys approach to regulating media companies  companies like facebook should not be allowed to behave like digital gangsters in the online world  considering themselves to be ahead of and beyond the law  the report argues  mr  satariano also notes that the report suggested legally requiring facebook and other large internet platforms to remove what the government determines to be harmful content  or risk fines or other punishments  facebook may not be worried  the committee cant change regulations on its own  mr  satariano notes  while alex webb of bloomberg opinion points out that britains divorce from the european union could seriously impair its capacity to rein in the giants of u s  tech more facebook news  why its getting serious about building its own a i  chips  and why researchers are worried about how facebook promotes groups index funds  with low fees and broad exposure to the markets  are supposed to be one of the best ways to play the stock market  but robert jackson jr   an s e c  commissioner  and steven davidoff solomon of the university of california  berkeley  point out problems with those funds in an nyt op ed  the firms that devise these indexes face little regulatory scrutiny and can face significant conflicts of interest  which have the potential to harm american investors  there certainly exists potential for manipulation  index providers generally have wide leeway when choosing the individual companies that make up their indexes and how they are weighted  thats why were calling on the securities and exchange commission to study this issue and make recommendations  if necessary  to congress  lawmakers must take a more

washington  the meeting of president george bushs cabinet on jan  8  1991  was even more high stakes than usual  iraq had invaded kuwait  half a million american troops were deployed and ready to attack  but many lawmakers were demanding a vote before any war rejecting mainstream constitutional views  william p  barr  the deputy attorney general  told mr  bush that he wielded unfettered power to start a major land war on his own  not only without congressional permission  but even if congress voted against it mr  president  theres no doubt that you have the authority to launch an attack  mr  barr said  as he later recalled ultimately  mr  bush was cautious about invoking that maximalist theory of executive power and asked lawmakers for support anyway  a prudent step that mr  barr  whom mr  bush soon elevated to attorney general  also recommended  congresss vote ensured the persian gulf war was lawful nearly three decades later  president trump has nominated mr  barr to return as attorney general  but unlike the self restrained mr  bush  mr  trump revels in pushing limits  a temperament that  when combined with mr  barrs unusually permissive understanding of presidential power  could play out very differently for the rule of law than it did last time there are concerns about his independence  given his longstanding and expansive views of executive power  said senator dianne feinstein of california  the ranking democrat on the judiciary committee  which will hold mr  barrs confirmation hearing starting tuesday  so the question is  is he right for this time  and can he really be independent of this president and the white house mr  trump ousted his administrations first attorney general  jeff sessions  in november  after long excoriating him for having followed ethics officials advice that he recuse himself from overseeing what became the investigation led by the special counsel  robert s  mueller iii  mr  trump said that he needed an attorney general who would protect him and that he would not have appointed mr  sessions if he had known he would recuse himself  the two day hearing for mr  barr  68  will play out against the backdrop of swelling rule of law turmoil  from mr  trumps pressuring the justice department to curtail investigations into his associates and to open them into his opponents to his threat to invoke emergency powers to circumvent congress on border wall funds  to coming oversight fights with house democrats democrats have demanded that mr  barr protect mr  mueller as he completes the investigation into russias interference in the 2016 election  including whether mr  trump sought to obstruct the inquiry on behalf of moscow  democrats have also focused on whether mr  barr would turn over to congress any report mr  mueller compiles senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina and the new judiciary committee chairman  told reporters after meeting with mr  barr last week that the nominee had said he saw no reason to fire mr  mueller and had pledged to err on the side of transparency about any report  but neither statement addressed what he would do if mr  trump ordered him to act otherwise mr  barr is likely to be confirmed because republicans control the senate and because defeating him would leave in place the acting attorney general  matthew g  whitaker  a trump loyalist whose installation in that role democrats see as illegitimate and a threat to mr  mueller  ethics officials advised mr  whitaker to recuse himself from the russia case  but he refused but mr  barr has already drawn scrutiny over the revelation last month that he sent an apparently unsolicited 19 page memo to the trump legal team in june arguing that mr  mueller should not be permitted to investigate mr  trump for criminal obstruction of justice mr  barrs argument derived from his broad view of executive power  the constitution  he claimed  does not permit congress to make it a crime for the president to exercise his executive powers corruptly  even if he were to fire a subordinate  pardon someone or use what mr  barr termed his complete authority to start or stop a law enforcement proceeding to cover up crimes by himself or his associates the claim that the framers of the constitution empowered presidents to impede investigations for corrupt ends goes too far  many legal scholars say  but supreme court precedents offer few definitive guideposts  giving the attorney general broad latitude the interpretive approach of justice department lawyers to the constitution is very important because many separation of powers issues never wind up in court  said peter shane  an ohio state university law professor  barrs method is not uniquely his  but it does represent a particularly aggressive school of executive power thought mr  barr started his career as a c i a  analyst before becoming an agency legislative affairs official in the mid 1970s  during the post watergate and post vietnam war era when a congressional investigation dragged decades of intelligence abuses into the light over the executive branchs objections after going to law school  he joined the reagan white house and worked on domestic policy with c  boyden gray  the counsel to then vice president george bush  at the time  the administration was battling democrats in congress over its push for deregulation  the conflicts helped spur the reagan legal team to develop new executive power theories that would diminish the influence of congress their legal policy innovations intensified in mr  reagans second term  after mr  barr had returned to private practice and senior administration officials were caught steering aid to anti marxist militants in nicaragua despite a law forbidding such assistance  the scandal  known as iran contra  set off investigations by congress and an independent counsel amid the fallout  the reagan legal team called into question the legitimacy of both the law barring aid and one allowing for prosecutors the president could not fire  the presidents lawyers saw them as congressional encroachments on the presidents rightful powers  though the supreme court upheld the independent counsel law in 1988 the next year  when mr  barr returned to public service in the new bush administration  he took up the executive power mission as the head of the office of legal counsel  the powerful agency within the justice department that evaluates the legality of proposed executive branch actions  mr  gray  who had become white house counsel under mr  bush  was intent on getting someone in that position who believed in executive authority  mr  barr later recalled normally  the office of legal counsel waits to be asked a specific legal question about a particular dispute before weighing in  but among his first major acts was to write an apparently unsolicited 10 page memo to top lawyers across the executive branch  urging vigilance against any attempts by congress to limit presidential power only by consistently and forcefully resisting such congressional incursions can executive branch prerogatives be preserved  he wrote mr  barr denounced lawmakers pursuit of sensitive administration information for oversight investigations and the creation of legal limits on the presidents power to fire certain officials in order to give them a degree of independence  the power to remove is the power to control  he wrote as mr  bushs term progressed  mr  barr not only argued that the president could unilaterally launch the gulf war without congress  echoing a move by president harry s  truman  to enduring legal controversy  in the korean war four decades earlier  but also sought to push the boundaries of presidential flexibility in many other ways  large and small in 1990  for example  mr  barr asserted that the bush administration could lawfully choose to disregard a law in which congress  as a condition of funding a diplomatic delegation  required that a representative from a congressional panel be included  arguing that congress had no authority in the area of foreign affairs  he asserted that it was therefore self evidently true that lawmakers could not enact a law influencing the presidents choices of diplomatic agents that same year  he argued more broadly in a panel discussion that even with the power of the purse  lawmakers lack the authority to influence policy by placing conditions on appropriations for government activities that fall under the presidents executive powers  ultimately  congress only has the power to provide a lump sum to the president in those cases  he said after mr  bush lost the 1992 election and before he left office  he pardoned half a dozen officials caught up in the iran contra affair just before one  caspar weinberger  was about to go to trial  foreshadowing the controversy over mr  trumps dangling of potential pardons in the russia investigation  the prosecutor accused mr  bush of a cover up that could have implicated his own conduct  mr  barr later said that he had personally urged mr  bush to pardon the officials because he thought they had been unjustly treated in the years after the bush administration ended  mr  barr became a top lawyer for the telecommunications company that evolved into verizon  working mainly on business and regulatory issues  but he also continued to play a role in legal policy debates over executive power and national security  especially after the sept  11 attacks after congress enacted the usa patriot act to loosen restrictions on government surveillance that grew out of the 1970s oversight investigations  he testified that the new statute had been a good first step but did not go far enough in 2005  after the george w  bush administrations detainee abuses started coming to light  he defended mr  bushs power to declare that prisoners in the war on terror were not protected by the geneva conventions and so could be lawfully subjected to coercive questioning generally  under the laws of war  absent treaty  there is nothing wrong with coercive interrogation  applying pain  discomfort and other things to make people talk  he said  pausing  then adding  as long as it doesnt cross the line and involve the gratuitous barbarity thats involved in torture later that year  congress tightened laws against treating detainees in cruel or degrading ways  but mr  bush claimed he had constitutional power to do so anyway  in 2006  the supreme court ruled that the geneva conventions did require humane treatment of terrorism detainees  contrary to the bush legal team theories that mr  barr had echoed mr  barr also repeatedly defended mr  bushs decision to create the ill fated system of military commissions instead of civilian courts to prosecute terrorism suspects  in fact  it was mr  barr who privately suggested to the bush white house that it create a tribunals system  an idea he had considered as attorney general during the investigation of the 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103  two libyan suspects were indicted in civilian court in 1991 mr  barr has recounted a story about that case that may resonate with democrats expressed concerns about whether he will maintain justice department independence against political interference by mr  trump  when prosecutors were preparing to indict the pan am 103 suspects  mr  bush cautiously asked his attorney general would it be o k  to brief the national security council on the situation  taken aback at mr  bushs hands off attitude  mr  barr made clear that he saw the president as excessively deferential  and invoked the notion  popular among executive power maximalists  that the president  not the attorney general  is the prosecutor in chief would it be o k   well  i work for you  youre the top law enforcement officer  of course its o k   mr  barr recalled marveling  the attitude was  you have to be very careful with pending matters of justice .

good friday   want this by email  sign up here  a fight has broken out between tpg and bill mcglashan  the senior executive caught up in a huge college bribery scandal  over how he left the  103 billion investment giant  michael de la merced of dealbook reports mr  mcglashan had initially been put on leave by tpg after being accused of collaborating with william singer  who ran the college preparatory business at the center of the scandal  prosecutors say that mr  singer advised the financier to claim that his son had learning disabilities  and that mr  mcglashan paid  50 000 to mr  singers charity tpg said it fired him for cause yesterday  we believe the behavior described to be inexcusable and antithetical to the values of our entire organization  the firm said in a statement tpg told employees and partners that it learned about the accusations against mr  mcglashan only after prosecutors unsealed their case  according to an internal note reviewed by dealbook but mr  mcglashan said that he had already resigned  i am deeply sorry this very difficult situation may interfere with the work to which i have devoted my life  he wrote in a note emails between mr  mcglashan and top tpg executives  provided by his spokesman  appear to confirm that  mr  mcglashan emailed his resignation at 1 02 p m  yesterday  according to the correspondence  at 2 03 p m   jon winkelried  one of tpgs co c e o s  replied  acknowledging receipt of the resignation  but he also included a notice of termination at 2 20 p m   mr  mcglashan responded  i am perplexed by your attempt to terminate me because  as you acknowledged in your email  you had already received my resignation its unclear what is at stake financially for mr  mcglashan in terms of his tpg severance  in his email  mr  winkelried wrote to mr  mcglashan  we will be in touch to advise you of the economic consequences of the termination of your employment a spokesman for tpg declined to comment on the

sensible deals and shareholder activists are continuing to push companies into transactions but there is no doubt that we are in a much less bullish environment for m    a  than a year ago  mr  shafir said  among the pressures on deal making  there are fears about a potential recession  the ongoing trade wars and the persistent worry that the stock market will suffer like it did late last year  regulators are a big issue too  especially the concern that they could be used as political cudgels  one of the big topics at the conference was the growing importance of overseers like cfius  the american government panel that reviews cross border deals for national security concerns  and then theres the natural cycle of deal making  booms tend to be followed by big drops in volumes  and this

for the families argued that advertising campaigns for guns appeared to be courting troubled young men  like adam lanza  who carried out the sandy hook shooting  in a 4 3 ruling  justices found that the sweeping federal protections did not prevent the families from bringing a lawsuit based on wrongful marketing claims  mr  rojas and ms  hussey write the decision represents a significant development in the long running battle between gun control advocates and the gun lobby  mr  rojas and ms  hussey add  and it could chart a possible legal road map for victims relatives and survivors

washington  there was a brief moment in nancy pelosis life when she worried she had too much power  she had so many titles in the california democratic party  including chairwoman  that she told lindy boggs  a louisiana congresswoman  that she was thinking of giving some up that was in 1984  and ms  boggs said  darlin  no man would ever think that  dont you give anything up  ms  pelosi said in a recent interview  leaning forward as she mimicked ms  boggss southern accent  and then she said  know thy power more than three decades later  ms  pelosi is all but assured on thursday of reclaiming her former title as speaker of the house  the first lawmaker in more than half a century to hold the office twice  with the gavel in hand  she will cement her status as the highest ranking and most powerful elected woman in american political history the story of her rise  from the well mannered daughter of a baltimore mayor to a savvy legislator and prolific fund raiser who is as much feared within her caucus as she is admired  is  in some ways  the story of the womens movement itself  it is also a comeback story  after losing the speakership eight years ago  she will now usher in a new era of divided government in washington and in the era of  metoo  ms  pelosi  a mother of five and grandmother of nine  will be the public face of the opposition to a president who won the white house after disparaging women  and paying hush money to a playboy model and a pornographic film actress who said they had extramarital affairs with him but ms  pelosi  78  long a target of republicans who have demonized her as a san francisco liberal  is also coming to the speakership with self imposed constraints  to quell an uprising among democrats who wanted a younger generation of leaders  she has agreed to limit her term to four years  some say that could weaken her  a notion she dismissed im used to  shall we say  enthusiasms from all elements of the party  i can roll with that  she said republicans do not underestimate her  she is a skilled adversary and a master at keeping all democrats in line  said representative mark meadows of north carolina  the chairman of the conservative house freedom caucus ms  pelosi knows that this speakership will be defined by how she handles president trump  the last time she was speaker  from 2007 to 2011  legislative accomplishments made her reputation  she muscled through bills that bailed out wall street and helped arrest an economic free fall  allowed gays to serve in the military  overhauled the nations banking laws and expanded access to health care for an estimated 17 million people  many say passage of the affordable care act is her signature achievement but divided government  an unpopular president and wide ranging  possibly criminal investigations into mr  trump  his presidential campaign and his businesses have changed her role drastically this is legacy building time  said jennifer lawless  an expert on women in politics at the university of virginia  if she can be the person who is remembered for holding trump accountable  or not letting him put forward facts that are not facts  if she can be the one who just calmly sits there and hold his feet to the fire  in a lot of ways  thats just as important as anything else she does on a recent saturday morning  ms  pelosi ducked into a closet in her office and retrieved a t shirt that a colleague had given her  bearing the quote that she used to smack down mr  trump during a televised oval office meeting on his border wall  dont characterize the strength that i bring you know  its really sad  nothing he said was true  nothing  ms  pelosi said of that december meeting her power stride out of the white house that day  in dark sunglasses and an orange coat  turned ms  pelosi into a fashion trendsetter  ever mindful of the messages she sends  she frets that she needs to retire the coat  if i show up with that coat  doesnt it look a little like  hey  look at me ms  pelosi has long governed with a touch of gender consciousness  when she became speaker the first time  she surrounded herself with her grandchildren and the children of other lawmakers on the podium inside the house chamber  a woman was in charge this time ms  pelosi seems to be casting off maternal imagery  i put on a suit of armor  eat nails for breakfast  cnn quoted her as saying one good friend  former senator barbara boxer of california  said ms  pelosi seemed very liberated after surviving the challenge to her speakership  and coming off the meeting with mr  trump  they tried to kick her down  and i dont think she ever got down  ms  boxer said a generation of young feminists is taking notice shes unapologetic about her ambition  shes insulting trumps manhood and storming out of the white house in orange coat and sunglasses  said amanda litman  28  and a founder of run for something  which recruits and supports young liberal candidates  its very authentically her in a way that im not sure she was able to do in past decades most accounts of ms  pelosis rise begin with her father  thomas dalesandro jr   an old machine politician who doled out favors from their living room in baltimores little italy  but her mother  annunciata  was an equally powerful role model big nancy  as she was known  was a strategist  an organizer of democratic women and the keeper of what the family called the favor file  from her  ms  pelosi learned the power of social networking and the personal approach to give and take in negotiations nancy knows how to listen  she learned that from her mother  said former senator barbara a  mikulski  a baltimore native who was a few years ahead of ms  pelosi in their all girls catholic high school young nancy dalesandro had dreams of becoming a lawyer  but by the time the womens liberation movement was in full swing  she was married to her husband  paul  and raising children we missed the burning bra  said rita meyer  a college roommate and close friend  we missed the marijuana even when she was pushing strollers  ms  pelosi said  she was active in democratic politics and pushing her own children to get involved  with her husband growing ever more successful in business  they opened their large home on one of san franciscos most exclusive streets for democratic events a turning point for ms  pelosi came in 1976  when she got behind the presidential campaign of gov  jerry brown of california  she persuaded him to compete in the maryland democratic primary  drawing on her ties  her brother tommy had also been baltimore mayor  to help engineer his victory  a setback for jimmy carter i had no direct knowledge of anybody or anything in maryland  mr  brown  wrapping up his second stint as governor  said in an interview  it was her idea  just to think of that is a bold move ms  pelosi then was chairwoman of the california democratic party and helped organize its 1984 convention  then  in 1987  sala burton  the incumbent congresswoman from san francisco who was dying of cancer  summoned ms  pelosi to her bedside and asked her to run to fill her seat there were 23 women in the house  12 democrats and 11 republicans  when ms  pelosi arrived  ms  boxer  who was then serving in the house  recalled an event where a colleague  she could not recall who  introduced his fellow members he goes through everybody  and then he gets to us and he said  and then theres nancy and barbara  ms  boxer recalled  she and i never forgot it ms  pelosi carved out a niche as an advocate for human rights  particularly in china  and for aids patients  a significant part of her san francisco constituency  she sought  and eventually landed  a seat on the powerful appropriations committee and a national security post on the intelligence committee she was forceful about her ideas  said george miller  a retired congressman and close friend  adding  i dont know that leadership was all that excited to hear them  at a democratic retreat after the party lost the majority in 1994  ms  pelosi planned a presentation on how democrats in california picked up seats  almost nobody came she said  these boys just dont know how to win  mr  miller remembered in 2001  ms  pelosi was elected democratic whip  beating her longtime rival  representative steny d  hoyer of maryland  to become the first woman to hold that post  the next year she was elected democratic leader  the first woman to lead a party in congress  at her swearing in  she distributed buttons that read  weve waited more than 200 years for this day ms  pelosi was swept into power as speaker in 2007 on a wave of revulsion over president george w  bush and the war in iraq  but she proved that she could work with mr  bush when needed  as the country faced economic collapse in 2008  she delivered the necessary votes to pass a wall street bailout plan  after mr  bushs treasury secretary  henry m  paulson jr   got down on one knee and begged   i didnt know you were catholic  she wryly said to him  she was relentless in gathering votes  even when it put her members in jeopardy  if her own pressure campaigns and horse trading did not work  she would call in outsiders  henry a  waxman  a former california congressman  recalled ms  pelosis effort to win over a nervous young member  zack space  on a climate change bill that had almost no prospects in the senate  mr  space had greek roots she had a woman  a leader in the national greek community  talk to him  mr  waxman said  and then this woman came and sat in the front row while the vote was taking place  mr  space got the message  voted yes  then lost his re election but she is most remembered for passage of the affordable care act  without a single republican vote  norman j  ornstein  who has studied congress for decades at the american enterprise institute  called it as masterful a piece of legislating as i have ever seen it may have been matched only by her remarkable talent for raising money  ms  pelosi has raised  728 3 million for democrats since 2002  her office said now  after an election that ushered a record number of women into congress  ms  pelosi is determined not to let another history making moment pass  she is marking her return to power with a string of events  including a womens tea  a dinner at the italian embassy featuring the singer tony bennett and a town hall style meeting  televised on msnbc asked if she considers herself mr  trumps equal  she replied  the constitution does  she frowned at the memory of a dinner at the white house last year when men talked over her  and she asked  doesnt anybody listen to a woman in the room hopefully that will become a thing of the past now that we have so many women in congress  and with the gavel  ms  pelosi said  the gavel makes a big difference .
good thursday  want this by email  sign up here american and chinese officials have reportedly begun to hash out documents that could form the basis of a trade deal  but there are growing concerns that leaders of both nations are softening on key demands  more on the progress from bloomberg  citing an unidentified source  several memorandums of understanding would cover areas including agriculture  non tariff barriers  services  technology transfer and intellectual property  said the person  the enforcement mechanism remains unclear  but would likely be a threat that tariffs would be reimposed if conditions arent met  the person said  no breakthrough is expected during this weeks talks  though an extension to a march 1 deadline is still a possibility but theres a new fear surrounding the deal  according to lingling wei and bob davis of the wsj  there are growing concerns on the home front in both america and china that their leaders  and president trump in particular  are going to cave in to the other side  some officials reportedly believe mr  trump is tiring of the trade dispute and is poised to cut a deal that wont lead to fundamental changes by china  american enterprise institute china scholar derek scissors said that u s  trade representative robert lighthizer  a china hawk  holds significant leverage over mr  trump to keep to a hard line  including  potentially  the threat of resigning if the deal falls short more trade news  mr  trump reportedly continues to consider e u  car tariffs  levies that volkswagen says could cost it billions of euros per year  and is the clothes maker american giant  which makes all its products in the u s   a model for mr  trumps ambitions hedge funds and investment banks think theyve found a big new moneymaker  according to matt goldstein and jim tankersley of the nyt  so called opportunity funds  part of president trumps tax package to steer money to poor areas by offering large tax breaks  more than 80 of the funds have sprung up since january 2018  even though the trump administration has not finalized regulations governing them  the pitch to potential investors  outsize returns while fighting poverty  the provision that created opportunity funds lowers capital gains taxes  potentially dramatically  for investors who finance projects in about 8 700 so called opportunity zones spread across the 50 states  the district of columbia and puerto rico  the financial benefit  an investor who keeps money in such a fund for 10 years is able to exclude 15 percent of the original capital gain from taxation  and  potentially much more lucratively  the investor would not owe taxes on any gains that accrued if the investment increased in value in that time  skeptics worry that the funds will mostly target real estate and other projects that probably would have attracted investment even without the tax break  and may not deliver the returns being dangled the british prime minister was in brussels yesterday to press for changes that could save her brexit deal  she may finally be making some headway  though she still needs to convince lawmakers of any changes to her plan she made her case to the e u  in discussions with the european commissions president  jean claude juncker  she pressed for legally binding changes to her existing deal that she hopes will make it palatable to british lawmakers  britains attorney general  geoffrey cox  and brexit secretary  steve barclay  are expected to propose wordings for those legal tweaks today some progress may have been made  a brexit agreement is already being hammered out in brussels  according to spains foreign minister  as the bloc seeks reassuring language that can convince british members of parliament to back the deal  bloomberg explains but the e u  may demand that any changes are first approved in britain  the e u  doesnt want to call leaders for a summit to sign off on changes that are then rejected by the u k  parliament  bloomberg reports  adding that once theres an agreement  it should be tested in parliament  and only after that will leaders be asked to sign off on it at a summit  and it is far from clear that lawmakers would approve more brexit news  nine more conservative party lawmakers have reportedly said that they could resign from the party in the event of a no deal brexit  the credit agency fitch may downgrade britains double a rating over concerns about brexit  the white house has spent the last year trying to convince europe that the chinese telecommunications giant huawei is a national security threat and shouldnt be given any role in developing new wireless networks  so far  that plan doesnt appear to be working british officials dont seem to agree with the white house  ciaran martin  who leads britains national cyber security center  expressed confidence at a conference in brussels that any security risks huawei posed could be managed  adam satariano of the nyt reports nor do those in germany  the news follows a wsj report yesterday that said the german government is leaning toward letting huawei technologies co  participate in building the nations high speed internet infrastructure if britain does not ban huawei  it would be a defeat for the white house  mr  satariano writes  because britain belongs to the five eyes intelligence sharing alliance

good tuesday morning   was this email forwarded to you  sign up here  silicon valley is captivated by a new concept that could eliminate student debt  andrew writes in his column students were saddled with  1 5 trillion in debt last year  a record high  an idea called income share agreements has been talked about for years as a way to alleviate that burden  under this system  tuition is free  but students agree to pay back a percentage of their income for several years if they get good jobs after graduation lambda school  an online learning start up founded in 2017 with the backing of y combinator  has  30 million in funding today from venture capitalists to make the concept a reality andrew writes the lambda model is being closely watched  its meant to treat students as investments rather than cash cows  and potentially lift their crippling debt load but it also comes with risks programs seeking safe investments might reverse the strides made in expanding educational opportunities for higher risk students  and institutions might move away from degrees that lead to noble  but lower compensated  professions                             todays dealbook briefing was

malaysia offered lucrative stakes in railway and pipeline projects  the infrastructure deals made malaysia the second biggest recipient of one belt  one road funding after pakistan softbank is increasing its stake in wework  a bet on continued growth in co working  but the investment is smaller than the one originally considered the news  softbank is planning to invest  2 billion in wework  the leading co working company  the nyts david gelles reports  the money comes from the conglomerate itself  not from its nearly  100 billion vision fund  it values wework at  47 billion  and brings softbanks total investment in the company to about  10 5 billion what could have been  under one possibility  softbank would have spent  10 billion to buy out all of weworks other investors and injected  6 billion more in the company  several factors led to a smaller deal  including market volatility and the reluctance of investors to sell shares to softbank the back story  softbank  one of weworks biggest boosters  has made multiple investments in the company  much of its capital in wework is from the vision fund  which is largely backed by the public investment fund of saudi arabia  but the relationship between softbank and wework is under growing scrutiny carlos ghosn  in his first public appearance since being arrested in november  declared today that he was innocent of the

american workers in 2015  up from 10 7 percent a decade earlier but yesterday  mr  krueger and mr  katz walked back their estimate  saying that the nontraditional slice of the labor market probably went up only one or two percentage points  and such work still takes a back seat to the standard single employer job  according to more recent evidence  including a study from the labor department released last year why the disparity  mr  krueger and mr  katz say that  after the recession  the labor market was on shaky ground  workers needed odd jobs to stay afloat  but rather than shifting

mcallen  tex   it was dark in the stash house where they kept her  the windows covered so no one could see inside  at first  the smugglers had her cook for the other migrants who had recently crossed illegally into the united states  then they took her to a room upstairs  locked the door and began taking turns with her it was the summer of 2014  and melvin  a 36 year old mother of three  had just completed the journey from her native guatemala  crossing the rio grande on a raft before being led to the house in the texas border city of mcallen for weeks in that locked room  the men she had paid to get her safely to the united states drugged her with pills and cocaine  refusing to let her out even to bathe  i think that since they put me in that room  they killed me  she said  they raped us so many times they didnt see us as human beings anymore on americas southern border  migrant women and girls are the victims of sexual assaults that most often go unreported  uninvestigated and unprosecuted  even as women around the world are speaking out against sexual misconduct  migrant women on the border live in the shadows of the  metoo movement  read  in a border courtroom  a migrant woman confronts her biggest fear the stories are many  and yet all too similar  undocumented women making their way into american border towns have been beaten for disobeying smugglers  impregnated by strangers  coerced into prostitution  shackled to beds and trees and  in at least a handful of cases  bound with duct tape  rope or handcuffs the new york times found dozens of documented cases through interviews with law enforcement officials  prosecutors  federal judges and immigrant advocates around the country  and a review of police reports and court records in texas  new mexico  arizona and california  the review showed more than 100 documented reports of sexual assault of undocumented women along the border in the past two decades  a number that most likely only skims the surface  law enforcement officials and advocates say in addition  interviews with migrant women and those working with them along the border point to large numbers of cases that are either unreported or unexamined  suggesting that sexual violence has become an inescapable part of the collective migrant journey  read the newsletter  yes  there was duct tape  the harrowing journeys of migrants across the border  sign up for crossing the border here president trump has used the threat faced by migrant women to make his case for a border wall  one in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through mexico  he said in january  an estimate that appears to have originated from some limited surveys  one of them by doctors without borders  of women traveling through mexico but less understood is that the violence that befalls migrant women happens not just during the perilous journey through mexico  much of it happens after women reach the supposed safety of the united states in july  a 23 year old honduran woman told the authorities that she was sexually assaulted in a bedroom closet by a smuggler who had helped her and her sister cross into the south texas city of mission  the following month  a sheriffs deputy in san antonio was charged with sexually assaulting the 4 year old daughter of an undocumented guatemalan woman and threatening to have her deported if she reported the abuse  in 2017  a guide leading a group of migrants through the tohono oodham nations reservation in arizona raped a woman from el salvador twice during a seven day desert hike  threatening to leave her stranded if she resisted  i hope i leave you pregnant so you have one of my kids  he said  the woman told the authorities in 2016  a migrant woman fled a stash house in the south texas city of edinburg  where she said she had been raped by a smuggler who brandished a machete  in west texas that same year  two teenage girls reported that they had been sexually assaulted by a customs and border protection officer  who they said forced them to strip  fondled them  then tried to get them to stop crying by offering chocolates  potato chips and a blanket  in an unusual turn  the girls filed legal claims against the federal government  which settled the case in 2018 for  125 000 at least five of the women who were assaulted  in one case  bound with duct tape  raped and stabbed  were attacked not by migrant smugglers  who are often the perpetrators  but by on duty border patrol agents and customs officers experts say the actual number of sexual assaults is almost certainly much higher than those documented by prosecutors and the police  because most attacks are never reported  and such attacks dont end at the border  women have reported being assaulted in immigration detention facilities  and the federal government over a recent four year period has received more than 4 500 complaints about the sexual abuse of immigrant children at government funded detention facilities the times interviewed eight migrant women from central america who were sexually assaulted between 2013 and 2016  women still struggling with nightmares  depression and in some cases  thoughts of suicide  one reported that she was attacked in mexico  six said they were assaulted in south texas  one said she was attacked in both mexico and south texas  the oldest victims were in their early 40s when they were attacked  the two youngest were 14 most of their attackers were never prosecuted or identified  and the times was not able to independently verify the womens accounts  but all eight women either gave sworn testimony or submitted statements under penalty of perjury to the federal government in order to qualify for visas  and cooperated with the police in the investigation of their cases they described a netherworld of fear that coexists with the bustling life of american cities up and down the border  one woman told of being held prisoner in a house that had been turned into a makeshift brothel in mcallen  a city of 143 000 in the rio grande valley  nueva carne  new meat  the smugglers said as she and other migrant women were led into the house  said the woman  lucy  45  a migrant from honduras who  like others interviewed  did not want her last name used she said a series of men came into the house over the next several days and raped her  because i didnt want to let them  they tied my feet together and my hands behind my back  lucy said gladys  45  a mother of four from guatemala  said she was kidnapped by armed smugglers after crossing the border and jumped out of a car to escape  but was captured again  for days  she was held prisoner at a stash house in mcallen and forced to have sex with six men  i thought it would be better if i died when i fell from the car  she said law enforcement officials on the border said they had made arrests in many of the cases brought to them and would pursue more if they could  but the majority of women who have been assaulted do not report it  often because their attackers threaten to expose their immigration status  or worse  if they do  one woman  raped repeatedly at gunpoint in a stash house in phoenix in 2005  said her attacker threatened to sell her 3 year old daughter if she reported him  those who do go to the authorities may not know the names of their attackers  or even where the assault occurred  smugglers make sure their clients are unsure of their whereabouts  if they are detained by border patrol  they wont be able to pinpoint where they were held  read  open wounds  head injuries  fever  ailing migrants suffer at the border the women are powerless by almost any measure  most of the eight interviewed now live in the united states after receiving the victim related visas  they work in stores  restaurants and factories  most barely making a living  their english is limited  many of them have not even told their families what happened they dont have many defenses  said jesus r  romo vejar  an arizona lawyer who has represented many migrant women victimized by sexual assault  undocumented women and children are the most unprotected of human beings here are some of their stories lucy  45  was raped while being forced to work at makeshift brothels  first in mexico and then in mcallen  when we got to the house  there were many women  it was a big house  i couldnt see everybodys face  but there were different women in different rooms for prostitution  i wanted to flee but i was afraid they were going to kill me  they just told us  you guys dont have money  so you have to pay with your body when we crossed the river  there was a man waiting  a white guy with tattoos  he was in a truck  we got into the truck  he brought us into a house in mcallen  when we got there  the guy started talking and he said that i was new meat when they wanted to have sex with me they had to tie me up because i wasnt cooperative  they tied my feet together and my hands behind my back and then theyd have sex with me from behind before  i could not talk about this  i would have panic  really serious panic  i didnt want to leave the house  i didnt want to talk to anybody  i thought that everyone in the world saw me as a prostitute  i come from a poor family but a very decent family it has affected me  yes  but not anymore  im kind of enraged  those guys have mothers and daughters  what they did to us is what they did to women melvin  36  was raped and forced into prostitution in a locked room at a stash house in mcallen i lost count of how long i was there for  it wasnt me anymore  i think that since they put me in that room  they killed me  they have no mercy  they dont care that youre a mother  that you have family  they see someone who doesnt matter to them and i still remember while i was with them there  it was my birthday  and i didnt want to  not that day  and i remember that he grabbed me and at one point bit me  and when i arrived at the detention center  i still had the bite marks  i told them that it was my birthday  and according to them  the rape that day was for my birthday i tried to commit suicide three times  because you cant live with all of that  and every time i closed my eyes  the men would appear  youd shower  youd close your eyes  they were there  i didnt want to live with that in my head anymore  but here i am j e   19  and two other migrants were kidnapped in south texas by a border patrol agent  esteban manzanares  when j e  was 14  he raped her in his apartment in mission  tex   and later committed suicide he took me and tied me up to a tree  he said he would come back  i was thinking about my little brother  whos in honduras  and id never see him again  he was about 10  i think  it was hours he undid me from the tree and put me in the car  in the apartment  there were two beds on top of the other  childrens bunk beds  and ropes there  too  they were shoelaces  for my wrists and my feet my mind was blank  i was trying to understand everything  i didnt know what to do  my feet were tied up  i would look at him and he had a gun  and that frightened me  i asked him why  and he answered me that he was doing this to me because i was the prettiest one of the three there are people who sort of discard you when they know what happened to you  but the majority of my girlfriends do know so they can understand what i went through  and they support me v e m l   39  was raped in the south texas brush by a smuggling guide  she was apprehended  detained at the hutto detention center in taylor  tex   and later deported i knew that they were the ones who were going to take me across  so i knew that i had to stay with them  i never learned his name  i felt nervous about him  he was very strange  i wasnt sure if he was on drugs  he always stood up and sat down  and stood up and sat down the older one walked ahead  the younger one said  come with me i said  where are we going  and he said  were going to catch up with them ahead he bit my mouth so i could not cry out  i was scared that it might occur to him to kill me afterwards  he told me to hurry up or he would leave me there on the ground  the guys in the group start saying  immigration  immigration  i ran toward immigration  i wanted to get away  but then when they took me and put me in the car  i felt frustrated and alone  i just felt like i couldnt stop crying  they were all men agents  they kept asking me why i was crying and i couldnt explain when they brought me to laredo  i told a doctor what happened  he said  dont feel like youre the only one that this happened to  this has happened to many other women cindy  26  and her son samuel stayed at a stash house in mexico while waiting to cross the border  she and another woman were raped by a smuggler  and she learned after being apprehended by border patrol that she was pregnant  samuel is now 8  his little brother  to whom cindy gave the biblical name of adonai  is 2 when he entered the room  he had the gun  he took the children out  he had the gun and he pointed the gun at my head when he was attacking us  first he abused me and then he abused her  were in his power and we feel like were disposable  we cant do anything because its like they tell us  they can kill us and nobody will say anything it wasnt until that test that i knew i was pregnant  in that moment  it was like i had been marked  i had been marked because of what had happened to me  that violation i wanted to kill myself  going to the psychologist  thats what helped me heal  she told me that we had to talk about it  we had to think about it  and we had to learn to live with our lives moving forward  even with what happened my son  i realized he was an innocent bystander in this situation and that it wasnt his fault  my motivation to keep going in life are my two kids  i thank god because everything that i suffered  theyre the happiness that came out of that .

as the luncheon dishes were placed down  the master of ceremonies kicked off a boisterous round of lindsey graham trivia  what is the senators middle name  she asked the ballroom of meatloaf eating republicans in greenville  s c  whats the name of the bar the senators family owned for those of you playing along at home  lindsey olin graham grew up around his parents beer and pool joint  the sanitary cafe  in working class central  s c   where he played the child mascot to the regulars  i was conscious  he wrote in his 2015 memoir  that i was giving a performance when it came grahams time to speak  he started out in this long ingrained lounge act mode  im from the federal government  im here to help  he said  a ronald reagan joke that has been grahams preferred icebreaker for years  but after a few minutes of breezy repartee  his tone assumed an edge  to every republican  if you dont stand behind this president  were not going to stand behind you  he said  as the room fell silent  grahams voice grew soft  even grave  this is the defining moment of his presidency  he said  its not just about a wall  its about him being treated different than any other president he continued  this is a fight between the people who are so smart and the rest of us  heads bobbed over unfinished plates of function room meat drowned in barbecue sauce  the continuing debate over the border wall  he went on  was not just over funding for a barrier  in the same way that the brawl over brett kavanaugh  whose supreme court appointment had been delayed over allegations of sexual assault  was not merely about a judge nothing of late has enhanced the senators standing as a trump loyalist  or disgust with him among former democratic collaborators  more than his showstopping speech at the september hearing where christine blasey ford  a high school acquaintance of kavanaughs  accused the future justice of sexually assaulting her at a party  what you want to do is destroy this guys life  graham exploded at senate democrats  many of whom he had worked with closely for years  senator chris coons  the delaware democrat  told me that his longtime colleague is hysterically funny and personally engaging  but the personal nature of grahams outburst at the hearing left him stunned  it was unprecedented  coons said  adding that he and graham did not speak for several weeks afterward  i am still struggling to renew my working relationship with senator graham  he added in greenville  graham framed the kavanaugh melee as a proxy battle over president trump  and placed himself on the trumpian side of an us versus them divide  the democrats and the national news media  he said  are engaged in a singular mission to thwart the president  why  cause they hate him  graham said of trump  they hate us  he added  and repeated the call  they hate us it can be jarring to watch graham enact  in real time  the broader shift the republican party has undergone under trump  the conversions tend to fall into a few basic categories  there are the elected republicans who once had little use for trump but would prefer to keep their heads down and hope that their trump loving constituents forget the terrible things they said about the future president during the 2016 campaign  there are the republican leaders  like mitch mcconnell  the senate majority leader  and until recently paul ryan  the former speaker of the house  who might have little use for the president in private but cant risk alienating him  and there are once dubious republicans who have not only come around to supporting trump but who have also caked their about faces in ostentatious heaps of flattery for my president and then there is graham  who would seem to occupy his own distinct category of trump era contortionist  certainly he embodies elements of the other groups  a desire to carve out his own parallel universe of work on certain issues that have always been important to him  especially on foreign policy  an instinct to avoid the distraction of weighing in on every trump offense  dont chase every barking dog  he says   and a personal library of readily surfaceable aggressions from the 2016 campaign  in which graham called the future president a kook  crazy and unfit for office  among other things  and which are easily juxtaposed today with grahams sycophantic raves about the presidents stellar golf game and reminders that trump beat me like a dog in the 2016 presidential primary  no doubt delighting trump with his nod to the presidents canine themed pejoratives  grahams rush to trumps side is particularly baffling because not long ago  he was best known for his bipartisan deal making on issues like climate change and immigration  he subscribed  at least theoretically  to the country over party credo of his departed senate co conspirator john mccain  mccains diagnosis of brain cancer and eventual death coincided approximately with grahams emergence as trumps most prominent senate defender and whisperer  this combination of factors gave rise to the what happened to lindsey graham  question  which has become synonymous enough with the south carolinians national political identity that he felt compelled to own it on the stump what happened to me  graham asked in greenville  not a damn thing  the crowd gave him a standing ovation what did happen to lindsey graham  i raised the question directly to him the following afternoon in his senate office in washington  graham was collapsed behind a cluttered desk  sipping a coke zero and complaining of exhaustion well  o k   from my point of view  if you know anything about me  itd be odd not to do this  he said i asked what this was  this  graham said  is to try to be relevant  politics  he explained  was the art of what works and what brings desired outcomes  ive got an opportunity up here working with the president to get some really good outcomes for the country  he told me an outcome of particular interest to graham  at the moment  is getting re elected to a fourth senate term in south carolina  where trump owns commanding approval numbers  especially among the hard core republicans who in the past questioned grahams devotion to their conservative cause  sure  graham allowed  you might emphasize some things more than others when youre trying to appeal to the party base  you just showcase your issues  right  he said  during his last re election campaign  in 2014  graham asserted his base bona fides by railing against president barack obamas white house scumbags and warning that the world is literally about to blow up  he has always been conservative  he emphasized  but in our business  youre not defined by the 80 percent agreement  youre defined by the 20 percent that the base might object to   his relatively liberal position on immigration once led rush limbaugh to dub him lindsey grahamnesty  graham reminded me that when mccain was facing re election in 2010  he turned himself into the most conservative member of the u s  senate  that was the race in which mccain claimed that he never embraced the maverick label  and people were asking  what happened to john mccain  graham chuckled at the memory in acknowledging this  graham was speaking to me as a fellow creature of washington  fully versed in the election year showcasing he is now engaged in  one of the people who are so smart that he derided the day before  if you dont want to get re elected  youre in the wrong business  he said graham would shortly head over to the capitol for trumps state of the union address  about which the president called him a few hours earlier  seeking input  should i go conciliatory or to hell with it  trump asked him  according to graham  what kind of tone should i take  in recounting this latest exchange  graham shook his head and half shrugged  i have never been called this much by a president in my life  he told me  his tone reflected a mixture of amazement and amusement  with perhaps a dash of awe  its weird  and its flattering  and it creates some opportunity  it also creates some pressure graham has always gravitated toward larger than life figures  he worshiped his father and followed him everywhere  i came along late in my dads life  and he made the most of our time together  graham wrote in his memoir  my story  whatever he did  he did it with me grahams parents died when he was in his early 20s  and he legally adopted his younger sister  darline  he never married or had children of his own  which has forced him throughout his career to deflect the inevitable insinuations that arise about a 63 year old bachelor in the united states senate  graham says he has dated numerous women over the years  but he usually lands on some variation of the married to my job explanation for his lack of a partner  in the same way that he described the regulars of the sanitary cafe as members of his extended family growing up  graham has relied on the senate as a kind of surrogate brood in his adulthood grahams senate colleagues sometimes describe him as a kind of sitcom sidekick with a knack for finding himself in goofy situations  it struck many people who know him as particularly apt that trump  as a presidential candidate in 2015  would decide to yell out grahams cellphone number at a campaign event after graham called trump a jackass  kelly ayotte  the former republican senator from new hampshire  recalls grahams tagging along around this time to see despicable me with her and her son  jacob  who was 8  as they entered the theater  graham handed his constantly buzzing phone over to jacob for screening  he said to the callers  who are you  why are you calling him  ayotte told me  graham would later make a video dramatizing all the ways to destroy a cellphone  after their eventual dtente  he told trump that the entire episode was the highlight of my campaign nearly every graham story of the last two decades involves mccain  when you enter the waiting area at nbcs meet the press  there is a framed photo of mccain and graham sitting together on the set  like a portrait of the extended family of the washington green room  they were inseparable  susan collins  the republican senator from maine  told me  johns death really left a hole in his heart  it seemed like lindsey had lost a father graham  who served in the united states air force and the south carolina air national guard  likens mccain less to a father figure than to an older brother  or perhaps commanding officer  what i miss was the collaboration  graham said  it was a political marriage i asked graham if his collaboration with trump  such as it was  was in any way akin to a political marriage  oh  gosh  no  he said  i personally like him  we play golf  hes very nice to me grahams contempt for trump in the 2016 campaign was such that he could not bring himself to support the republican nominee  i voted for evan  whatever the guys name is  graham said  referring to the third party candidate evan mcmullin  who wound up winning 0 54 percent of the popular vote  but after trump became president  graham said  forging a relationship with him served his conjoined interests of staying relevant in washington and getting re elected in south carolina  graham told me that mccain understood his willingness to make peace with trump  though the extent of grahams ingratiation bothered him a bit  especially grahams over the top praise for trumps golfing abilities but mccain  more than anyone  knew the value of reconciliation  like graham  he was a mostly reliable republican vote in the senate and supported trumps agenda on most issues besides repealing the affordable care act  aside from mccain  graham said  i never met anyone in my whole life that could hold a grudge and move on at the same time  and mccain  he said  understood better than anyone that few things are more potent in politics than having access to a president  regardless of which one relevance  graham said  returning to the word as if it were a mantra  that was john mccains word the price of relevance  for graham  has been a willingness to defend the president on television and speak out on issues that he knows might be of minor consequence in the scheme of things but clearly animate trump  in recent weeks  for instance  graham  in his capacity as chairman of the senate judiciary committee  has demanded a briefing on such fox news snack food as whether the f b i  acted with too heavy a hand in its arrest of the longtime trump political adviser roger stone  graham also vowed to investigate a claim made by andrew mccabe  the former deputy director of the f b i   that top department of justice officials had discussed circumstances in which trump could be removed from office via the 25th amendment  an administrative coup  graham said ominously on cbss face the nation when i asked graham whether he ever worried about being seen as a toady to trump  his voice assumed a slightly clipped edge  no  heres what i worry about  he told me  that were going to get it wrong in syria and afghanistan  i worry more about the policy stuff  and i have more influence than ive ever had graham credits his relationship with trump with the presidents slowing down his decision to withdraw from syria  he noted that trump asked him whether the united states should use force in venezuela  graham said that he preached caution and that trump became exasperated  or pretended to be  he said to me  you want to invade everywhere except where i want to invade  graham said  laughing  and trump  he insisted  knew where he stood on the special counsels russia investigation  i told the president that if you colluded with the russians  if your campaign sat down and worked with foreign intelligence operatives to manipulate the results of the election  thatd be the end of us   graham said graham says he has achieved graduating levels of relevance with trump  i went from  o k   hes president to how can i get to be in his orbit  orbit is another favorite graham word  to how can i have a say in whats going to happen today  tomorrow and next week  he told me i asked graham if he considered himself part of the wider trump orbit or the more select one  well  im getting into the smaller orbit now  he said  i asked him who else was in that precinct of the trump solar system  he mentioned melania  ivanka  jared  hes got a bunch of old friends that still have a say  new york types  graham said  but the circle is small trump is an entertainer and an agitator  which graham says he can relate to  in a way  the point with trump is  hes in on the joke  graham said  i asked graham if he is in on the joke  too  oh  100 percent  100 percent  he laughed  oh  people have no idea  i asked him to explain the joke to me  if you could go to dinner with us    he said  shaking his head at the end of our second interview  in mid february  i asked graham if he trusted trump  grahams eyes seemed to bulge for a split second  he sat back in his chair and paused  thats a good question  he told me he paused some more  do i trust him  he said at last  i trust the president to want to be successful  he said  the presidents mercurialness  he acknowledged  could be a problem  he will change his mind in a new york minute  graham said  you never know where hell be  i mean  i woke up one day  and were pulling out of syria but to this point  he and trump have been able to work together  hes asked me to do some things  and ive asked him to do some things in return  graham said  then  as if looking wistfully over his shoulder at his old maverick sidekick days  he offered  theres sort of a don quixote aspect to this  it was an odd thing for a man who was espousing the median republican circa 2019 position to say at the intersection of all this theater is that he wants to be a successful president  graham said of trump  and i want him to be successful under terms that i think are good for the country  understood  but unspoken  was that these terms would also be good for lindsey graham .
on a sunday morning at beth israel worship center in wayne  n j   a bearded pastor named jonathan cahn stood on an elevated platform  gazing over a full house  stage lights shifted from blue to white as the backing band played a drifting melody  two men hoisted curled rams horns and let out long blasts some of you have been saying you want to live in biblical times  mr  cahn said  pacing behind a lectern  then he spread his hands wide  well  you are sitting at the end of a sleepy drive an hour from manhattan  beth israel may look like any common suburban church  but the center has a highly unusual draw  every weekend  some 1 000 congregants gather for the idiosyncratic teachings of the churchs celebrity pastor  an entrepreneurial doomsday prophet who claims that president trumps rise to power was foretold in the bible mr  cahn is tapping into a belief more popular than may appear a recent fox news poll found one in four americans believe god wanted donald trump to become president  celebrities like the televangelist paula white and franklin graham have boosted the idea  the presidents own press secretary suggested as much in a january interview  and on the opening day of the conservative political action conference this month  the millionaire businessman michael lindell took to the stage and declared president trump chosen by god mr  cahn was ahead of the curve he has dedicated an entire book to this very thesis  an insight he claims to have received from god  the paradigm  the ancient blueprint that holds the mystery of our times  in fact  is only the most recent installment of a best selling series dealing with the supposed mystical meaning behind all manner of current events  in it  mr  cahn likens mr  trump to the biblical king jehu  who led the ancient nation of israel away from idolatry with his growing stature  mr  cahn is also a rising figure in some quarters of conservative politics  in an email to congregants  mr  cahn shared his latest good news  this weekend he is making his first trip to the presidents vacation retreat  mar a lago  he is set to address a small gathering of activists and advisers after worship on a recent sunday  in a roped off section flanked by security guards  mr  cahn signed piles of his books before a small crowd  at 59  mr  cahn cultivates a refined demeanor  rarely appearing without a signature all black suit and tie  he laid his hands gently on one mans shoulders and offered quiet counsel  be patient  he said  keep praying for breakthrough gail greenholtz  an elder member  stood near the end of the line  many of us consider him a prophet of our time  she said  a visionary michael cooney  58  had driven an hour to hear the pastor teach on politics and prophecy  its all relevant for this moment  he said  he shows us that trump was actually in the bible central to beth israels story is the unlikely rise of its pastor  a liberal jew transformed into an end times evangelist  the tale is also a step into a controversial and burgeoning layer of american religion  where commerce  supernatural belief and patriotism blend freely  daniel silliman  a valparaiso university professor of religion  called beth israel and its pastor part of a long tradition of americans looking to prophecy as a way to absorb the chaos of current events  it can make someone feel that god is working through human history  he said  transforming anxiety into a sense of fullness the son of a holocaust refugee  mr  cahn was raised in a nominally jewish family in the new york suburbs  but from an early age  he was drawn to the more esoteric corners of belief he devoured the writings of nostradamus  the virginia psychic edgar cayce and far out conspiracy theories about ancient astronauts  mr  cahn soon stumbled on the late great planet earth  the 1970s best seller that argued doomsday prophecies of the bible were playing out with events like the cold war and israels six day war  mr  cahn bought the book thinking it was about ufos  instead he was given a crash course in christian eschatology i was just floored  mr  cahn said  on his 20th birthday  after a near death experience  and to the dismay of his jewish father  he became a christian by the 1980s  mr  cahn was leading outreach for a hippy style church in new jersey  his hair and beard grown shaggy  he led services with a guitar slung around his neck  mr  cahn later broke off to lead an independent congregation  beth israel  and built his following through a slot on christian radio  where his messages took on an end times flavor after the 2001 terrorist attacks struck manhattan  mr  cahn adopted a sharp  even more apocalyptic focus in sermons  he began comparing the attacks to the ancient warnings of the bible  drawing largely from the book of isaiah  where god vows to punish the disobedient nation of israel mr  cahn said abortion  gay rights and the perceived retreat of religion in the public square were all troubling signs that america  like ancient israel  had lost its way once rolling with this comparison  mr  cahn began seeing patterns everywhere  as the israelites turned away from their god  they were attacked by assyrians  america  in modern times  was also attacked by a foreign army from the east  al qaeda terrorists  after the ancient siege  the israelites vowed to replant a destroyed sycamore grove with new trees  near ground zero  a huge sycamore tree was also destroyed  as the towers fell the supposed connections go on  tenuous as they may seem  mr  cahn saw the links as compelling  his flock did too  god revealed patterns  he said  i called it the download process mr  cahn eventually turned his thesis into a full length book  the harbinger  in 2012  put out by the publishing arm of the powerhouse charisma media  a christian multimedia company that also runs a daily news site  the book climbed up best seller lists and hovered there for months  alongside blockbusters like fifty shades of grey  he followed his debut with a companion edition and three other titles  all embellishing on the same theme of prophecies replaying today none of us knew it would be so successful  mr  cahn said  it was the lords hand  i believe that a charismatic preacher inveighing against imminent devastation is nothing new  america has long been fertile ground for would be doomsday prophets  stretching back centuries matthew sutton  a professor of history at washington state university and the author of american apocalypse  said mr  cahn fits a unique american mold  in key historical moments  religious figures like this find a way to step in  mr  sutton said  they draw from apocalyptic theology and say  we have this secret knowledge and can explain whats going on  it fosters this sense that gods judgment is hanging over your head among several of mr  cahns recent predecessors of this ilk would be televangelists like the christians united for israel founder john hagee  whose books include can america survive  and jim bakker  the controversy prone preacher who now hosts an end times tv program and sells disaster survival products mr  cahn brings the tradition fully into the social media age  many of his fans first saw him on facebook  hundreds of posts and reposts of his sermons are uploaded on youtube  slipped into the corners of the web where esoteric religion and conspiracy theories overlap into this mix came mr  cahns latest book  the paradigm  which could be his most polarizing  tying his prophetic work to the election of donald trump the book  published in the months after trumps win  again likens america to the ancient nation of israel  two peoples  mr  cahn says  who have a unique relationship with god  he then argues that all sorts of figures in contemporary politics have biblical counterparts  bill clinton and hillary clinton  for example  are the modern day analogues to wicked ahab and jezebel  trump is the warrior king jehu  who took control of the nation and cast idols out of the capital  jehu also sought to drain the swamp  mr  cahn said  trump  like his ancient predecessor  mr  cahn writes in his book  was a flawed vessel being used by god  the unlikely and controversial warrior was destined to become the new ruler of the land  mr  cahn goes on  the template would ordain that donald trump would become the next president pointing to trumps possible rollback of abortion rights  appointment of conservative supreme court judges and the move of the american embassy to jerusalem  mr  cahn casts trump as a heroic figure  trump is offering us a window for revival  a window to return to god  mr  cahn said  what happened in the election was not about trump but about something much higher  the purposes of god mr  cahn promotes his work aggressively in christian media  appearing regularly on the jim bakker show  sid roths its supernatural  and the 700 club  where he draws upon his jewish background  using the title of rabbi or wrapping himself in a prayer shawl emblazoned with the beth israel logo he also has political aspirations  mr  cahn speaks at events in washington alongside conservative standard bearers like michele bachmann and james dobson  where his portrayal of america as a cultural battleground falls on sympathetic ears  in 2016  he even addressed a united nations gathering  mike huckabee  the fox news commentator and former governor of arkansas  once introduced mr  cahn as soul stirring and stunning  spellbinding mr  cahn likes to say he is surprised by his own success  preferring supernatural explanations  when speaking  he begins slowly but picks up pace  almost falling over his words with excitement  he also has a flair for the theatrical tale  lounging in a back office at the church  surrounded by framed paintings of biblical landscapes  he sprinkled enchanted anecdotes in conversation how did he raise money for his first church  a mysterious american indian appeared with a check for  150 000  they called him wahoo  god instructed him to come to me how were his books received  with the first book  a hurricane flooded our building  for the release day of the new one  my appendix exploded  people called it spiritual warfare he even presents his family life in magical terms  he has three children and describes his relationship to his brazilian wife  renata  as a supernatural love story  as mr  cahns star was rising  beth israel also mushroomed in size  the congregation more than tripled over the years and outgrew its humble perch in bergen county in 2008  beth israel moved to a cavernous old department store a half hour away and remodeled the building to resemble the white stoned city of ancient jerusalem  recasting the drab industrial structure as a mystical suburban barracks  in the parking lot  massive israeli and american flags billow in the breeze beth israel draws from the charismatic movement  which has roots in pentecostalism  and also incorporates elements of messianic judaism  congregants alternate between calling mr  cahn their pastor or rabbi  and their place of worship a church or synagogue services are also held on friday evenings  at the start of the jewish sabbath  and mr  cahn arrives to the building just moments before worship begins  by the time he bursts on stage with a headset microphone  the crowd is fully primed  a dance troupe of women  dressed in red and waving scarfs  prance nearby as the crowd sways in song during a recent evening service  some 500 congregants gathered as helpers lit traditional shabbat candles near the foot of the stage  mr  cahn dropped hebrew into his sermon  and at times  the crowd haltingly joined in to pronounce the foreign words themselves  in a middle row  one elderly woman pulled out a worn bible with stickered pages  the margins filled with notes from previous lectures there are prophecies around us  mr  cahn intoned from the pulpit  were in deep and were going deeper  open your mind  brace yourself perhaps not surprisingly  as the churchs growth may have been swift  controversies around the pastor and his flock have also swelled progressive groups  like the website right wing watch  have been tracking mr  cahns rise for years  others have raised questions about whether his messages about trump veer from protected religious expression to political endorsement  churches are unable to participate in political campaigns on behalf of  or in opposition to  candidates  if they do so  they risk losing their tax exempt status mr  cahn shrugs at the charge  i dont tell anyone how to vote  he said  i say  you need to consult god  and this is what god says on the issues after a beat  he added  they can read between the lines others object to his claims to divine insight  in particular  mr  cahn has attracted the attention of a network of christian critics who see him as part of a growing stream of over the top supernaturalism in the church tensions came to a climax in 2015  when mr  cahn suggested in a book and during several tv appearances that an imminent cataclysm was on the horizon leaning on arcane readings of the early books of the bible  mr  cahn said that just as god visited judgments on the wayward israelites according to a particular seven year pattern  something called the shemitah  modern catastrophes might follow a similar pattern  in 2001 came terrorist attacks  in 2008 there was an economic crash  mr  cahn asked  could 2015 bring another disaster but months passed  and the doomsday date came and went  he was dismissed as a grifter one critic likened mr  cahns prophecy project to a fragile house of cards  set to tumble down  a christian polemics site called pulpit   pen denounced mr  cahn in several posts  j d  hall  the sites founder  called mr  cahn the most prominent and successful omen huckster working today  pastors should warn people away from cahn  mr  hall said recently  mr  cahn actually grows embarrassed discussing the doomsday fiasco  he insists he has always included disclaimers on his work and never set exact dates  rather  mr  cahn wanted to warn that a cataclysm could happen  not that it would  i always say  you cant put god in a box still  he appears to have learned from the brouhaha  growing even more cautious about making prognostications that could fall through his latest book  for example  was released only after trump had taken the white house and is largely backward looking  giving biblical explanations to current events only after the fact he also declined to weigh in on trumps 2020 chances  the bible doesnt say one or two terms  mr  cahn demurred meanwhile  mr  cahns success has come at a private cost he seldom discusses  though not estranged  his jewish family never fully knew what to make of his dramatic pastoral turn  they rarely  if ever  visit the church  and he remains troubled by the idea they will not be spiritually saved  i dont know where their hearts are at now  he said  its not something we talk about at times  mr  cahn appears to be a star in a show that has grown out of his control  fans may take his project more seriously than he does himself  his debut book was originally billed as a work of fiction  for example  a nuance lost on most readers at first  people started to call me a prophet  and i would stop them and say  no  no  he said  but it always made for an awkward moment instead  he stopped correcting them  it was just easier  so  sometimes  i dont say anything  mr  cahn said  i let it be still  his book series marches on  the latest installment  titled the oracle  is due in september  like the others  it concerns biblical prophecies  with trump again making an appearance on a friday evening this winter  deep into the government shutdown over the border wall  beth israel was packed  even though a snowstorm had been forecast  one man plucked a plaintive tune on a guitar as mr  cahn wound up the service  inviting the crowd to bow their heads  he guided the them in a soothing prayer close your eyes  he said  if you havent been born again  today is your day there were murmurs through the room  mr  cahn concluded and then gently reminded the crowd about the booths in the back  congregants could buy shawls  jewelry and apocalypse themed calendars  books were for sale  he said  new members could even get a gift copy  signed free of charge after worship  congregants gathered near the canteen  where steam rose from platters of rice  beans and soup several worshipers described how they once attended other  more mainline churches before discovering beth israel  some still have a home church elsewhere but come here for a supplemental dose of mysticism  bob keene  a 68 year old school bus driver  described the appeal  learning about prophecy puts me at ease  he said  the problems im having  the things im going through  those are also part of gods plan roxanne mangal  a middle aged woman in a flowery blouse  joined the table  she said the pastor had healed her of a terrible illness  joining beth israel also brought wealth  my income tripled  she said  it quadrupled now she wanted to show mr  keene a more recent miracle shed seen  captured on a cellphone photo  no less  after president trump had moved the united states embassy to jerusalem  the subject of great excitement at the church  she believed she saw the new york skyline light up in heavenly sparks  god did that  she said  thrusting the phone forward hmm  mr  keene said  looking at the photo politely  i thought it was a sunset at first .
late night television comedy used to be exactly that  comedy  sure  it was topical  obviously  it dabbled in politics  but it wasnt a running commentary  a gaping  keening  raging one  on the nations political life  it wasnt a main crucible for americans political angst  the election of donald trump changed that  the president gave americans more angst to work out he also gave hosts like seth meyers material and a challenge  how do you make fun of often grave events without making light of them  late night with seth meyers  which recently celebrated its fifth anniversary  does this distinctively and brilliantly  by folding barbed one liners into more shapely structures  including a closer look  which is essentially a spoken essay  about 10 minutes long  that hews tightly to a discrete theme  one from mid december mulled the tandem hooey of trumps philanthropy and his proposed border wall  and that meyers does every few days  each weeknights broadcast takes a similarly cerebral approach that extends to his selection of guests  which often includes writers and politicians meyers  45  has a long history with trump  who hosted saturday night live for the first of two times in 2004  the other was in 2015   back when the comic was in his third season as a writer and cast member on the show  meyers was also the featured performer at the 2011 white house correspondents association dinner where he and president barack obama separately roasted trump  who was in the audience  some political observers have suggested that trumps presidential ambitions were fueled by his anger after that evening  when he sat stone faced as meyers made jokes like  donald trump has been saying that he will run for president as a republican  which is surprising  since i just assumed he was running as a joke meyers lives in manhattan  where late night is taped  with his wife  alexi  a lawyer  and their two sons  ashe and axel  who are both under 3 years old  we spoke in early january at his studio at 30 rockefeller plaza and in a phone call a few weeks later  frank bruni  a colleague of mine at the times who has spent more time with trump than i have was just saying that when youre in his presence  there is a charisma that helps explain how this all happened  do you agree seth meyers  yes  its interesting  because when he hosted s n l   in 2004   i didnt find him to be particularly charismatic  now  that was not him at his best  hosting a comedy show  my takeaway was that he was not unfriendly but he wasnt particularly friendly either  his reaction to most of the comedy was that he liked it if it worked  it didnt strike me that he had a taste for it fb  so the audience is the arbiter of everything  thats consistent with the trump who went on to run for president sm  we did this sketch called donald trumps house of wings  as in chicken wings  im as proud of it as almost anything that i was a part of  there was a line of sketches that had been on the show about bad restaurants  there was  the baseball player  derek jeters taco hole   the rev   al sharptons casa de sushi  in donald trumps house of wings  it was him in a yellow suit with a yellow tie talking about having a chicken wing restaurant  and the song was jump  for my love  by the pointer sisters  1983   but it was to trump  and there was me and amy poehler  kenan thompson and maya rudolph dressed as chicks in eggs we danced next to him  and theres actually a moment when its crushing with the audience and hes surprised  because he hadnt liked the sketch the whole week  he does a thing that he does now all the time during rallies where he has no poker face  he just takes it in  oh  look at that  a hit  and then he starts to dance and enjoy it  hes very good in the sketch fb  that is such a perfect harbinger and illustration of his outsourcing of his judgment to whatever gets him applause  like  im going to build a wall and mexico will pay for it sm  the difference is that he didnt actually have to open the house of wings  the other thing i remember is that he had cut out a page of variety  just the column of the ratings  and he carried it around in his breast pocket and would show you how well the apprentice had done looking back at that week  i want to make clear  it was fascinating to be around what was at the time this new york icon  i remember him saying  where are you from  do you like working here  have you seen the ratings of the apprentice  it was almost as though  ill ask two personal questions and then  having done that part of humanity  ill drop this interesting tidbit fb  i have to ask  do we have you to blame for trumps presidential campaign sm  i blame obama   laughs   i think obama was too rough on him  at the correspondents dinner   what are you going to do  run for president to show me up  seems like a waste of time  i saw trump a couple of days after that  roast  and went over to thank him for being a good sport  it was at the met ball  i think  he told me that my jokes were too rough  but i think that he thought it was pretty cool that he had been on the presidents radar enough that obama poked fun at him fb  i think your show and others like it play a distinct and important psychological role in the nations processing of this presidency sm  i have personally found it cathartic to do this show  i hope it provides some catharsis for the audience as well  there is a sense now  certainly more than when we started the show in 2014  that we are all going through something together  at the end of the day  i dont think that we are agents of change at late night  but i do hope were making this moment more pleasant to go through fb  arent there some americans in this balkanized information environment who get as much news from your show as from any other source sm  i dont know  im aware of the possibility  and if thats the case  we try very hard to be fair  although i do want to qualify that when i mean fair  i dont mean one joke about them  one joke about them  we try not to say things that are untrue  if somebody should make what i believe is probably not the safest choice to get their news from us  we dont want to lead them astray fb  do you see what you do as a form of journalism sm  no  if you watch a closer look  we use so many clips of actual journalists to make our point  most journalists dont just show clips of other journalists  they actually go out and do journalism fb  on a recent episode  you said  the president is incompetent and unhinged  hes virtually incapable of uttering a truthful or coherent thought about almost anything  nuanced  do you believe every word of that sm  yeah  i remember doing an interview with someone who said  you called him a liar  thats a big word  its actually not a big word to call somebody a liar  the definition is really simple  when somebody tells a bunch of lies  thats the perfect word for it  maybe you can say  wow  your definition of unhinged is pretty severe  but ive got to be honest  i dont think that was a crazy thing to say  he has shown us something about us that will be hard to forget fb  what has he shown us sm  that we will allow this to happen  enough of us will say  this is o k fb  what have we deemed o k  sm  vulgarity  crassness  mendacity  just the litany of lies that you would have thought would be disqualifying for anybody else fb  is he racist sm  i think he is racist  i think he could be friends with a black person  but he doesnt think well of black people fb  is he amoral sm  oh  hes amoral  thats the easiest fb  are there things in the news that you feel you cant joke about sm  its case by case  we dont have some overarching idea  but i will say that when youre doing a show the day after charlottesville or the day after a school shooting  those were cases where we spoke of it earnestly  there are other times  like the day after the  2016  election  when youre honest about where youre at but also trying to have jokes in there fb  your opening monologue right after the election was heartfelt and personal  you mentioned being a father  you noted that some parents out there would see their daughter become the first female president  how did those remarks come together sm  there were just a few times on the show when i was lucky to be able to sit and talk off the top of my head  not off a script fb  that was impromptu  so it could feel and be more direct sm  i wrote it out  but it wasnt on cue cards  the way a monologue usually is fb  i also noticed that while you didnt mask your being upset about the outcome  you extended a hand to  and spoke kindly of  trump voters sm  i never pretended that i wasnt shocked by the outcome  but at that moment  i really did want to give the benefit of the doubt to everyone  there are people in other parts of the country that are not manhattan who have a different set of fears than i would have fb  what other subject matter  besides shootings  feels worth approaching with special care sm  when you do stuff about the opioid crisis  its a lot harder to get comic traction  but i think weve managed  those segments have been less of a laugh riot  but were lucky that we have an audience thats willing to forgive the lack of jokes if they realize that the topic is serious fb  what kind of joke about the opioid crisis does work sm  when you can frame it in the absurdity of the fact that there was a town in west virginia that filled enough prescriptions for painkillers to treat the entire eastern seaboard  you can make a joke off that  you can separate that from the real world impact  this is something thats absurd  its absurd that we allowed that to happen fb  so absurdity is humors saving grace sm  yeah fb  what do you worry most about in terms of the lasting damage of trumps presidency sm  when i think of my kids  i worry the most  it feels clichd to say  about climate change  i also want to stress that no matter who was president right now  i think that would still be a very scary thing  i dont want to put that on trumps doorstep  also  i want to live in a world where you can be kind to people and they can be kind to you if you have different political views  i do charity events every now and then  and there will be people who come up to me and say they voted for trump  and we will have a nice conversation  i hope thats not unique to me fb  i have relatives who voted for trump sm  can you still be kind to them and can they be kind to you fb  i love them  and they help me not to see this in really reductive ways  so when people say  everybody who voted for donald trump is a racist  i know that not to be true  everyone who voted for donald trump perhaps averted their gaze from racism  and we can make moral judgments about that sm  i agree with that 100 percent fb  do you ever worry  whether its your show or the times  that because were seen as creatures of the coast  our criticisms and focus on trump actually embolden his supporters sm  i think he does a great job of framing himself as a victim  but i also think he would have done that no matter what  i dont know how we dont make fun of him based on the standards we had for making fun of people before he came to office  you cant reframe the standards of what is deserving of mockery based on this three dimensional chess game of is this actually helping him  because ultimately you want these standards  of what is mocked  to survive him certainly there are people on the right who will say that comics were easy on obama  but i dont think its a one for one because its not like obama ever behaved like this  also  i think trumps supporters are pretty emboldened to begin with  i dont think they need any extra help to feel like hes under siege fb  how do you do justice to what is  frankly  the horror of trumps presidency without tearing at the fabric of the country so violently that it doesnt repair sm  we try very hard not to make fun of people who voted for donald trump  in the first months or so  i remember  we would have jokes like  so im guessing if youre a coal miner from virginia  you must be thrilled  we realized that it felt a little gross  were trying hard not to say that everyone who voted for donald trump is the same as donald trump fb  has the consumption of media and culture in this country become so fractured  in the way we set up our social media feeds and such  that the idea of a changed mind is an anachronism at this point sm  that worries me a ton  i try to follow conservative news sources as well  because i want to hear what theyre saying  i dont know that my mind is changed fb  i do feel like a healthy measure of humility is gained  though  have you had many conservative writers on the show sm  weve had people like shepard smith from fox news   the author of hillbilly elegy  2016   j d  vance and  the nebraska senator  ben sasse fb  what is your own consumption of culture like sm  i try to read the fiction of all the authors on the show fb  is there a risk with fiction writers in holding the audiences attention sm  we really have found not fb  did you decide from the start to include authors sm  we thought that would be fun early on  i remember saying  were going to have politicians and authors  and in the end  authors have turned out to be so much better than politicians  so much better authors are genuinely great storytellers  there is still something a little magical to an audience about people who can write a book  most people  the longest thing they ever wrote was a paper in high school  and they had to mess with the margins just to get it to 10 pages  and i just think that people like to hear authors talk  whereas what ive found with politicians  and this is bipartisan  theyre just gonna answer the question they wish youd asked and theyre going to say it the way they practiced it  and oftentimes its something theyve said a bunch  so theres the lack of the crackle you want during an interview fb  at the photo shoot for this article  you told me you had just finished  under duress from your wife  initially  binge watching all the seasons of hbos sex and the city sm  i underestimated it  my wife used to watch it when it aired last decade  and id often catch the last two minutes  and its very unfair to judge a show based on the narrative wrap up  the voice over of carrie bradshaw explaining the episode  but its wonderful  really great  three dimensional characters that i felt very deeply about the longer the show went on  i thought it was just fascinating to see a show where the characters aged as they went through different parts of their lives i also loved girls  i should say my wife is part of four friends  very close  there were parts of girls that really reminded me of them  and parts of sex and the city fb  so you know what question i then have to ask  which character in each is your wife sm  well  my wife  i would say  is a carrie miranda hybrid fb  and if were using the girls characters sm  shes allison williams  was it marnie fb  you realize you may not be paying her a compliment to call her marnie sm  she knows  were friends with allison  and ive watched them talk about how many things that marnie did were true to her fb  what has most surprised you about fatherhood sm  i had really high hopes for it  its matched them  i was so close to my father as a child  and i hoped it to be true for me and my boys  and it has been so far  im uncommonly close with my parents  they were and continue to be as close friends as i have heres the thing  this was always my dream  beyond my dream  to be where i am now  i wanted to have a job in comedy  i wanted to have a job writing  and my favorite show as a kid was saturday night live  im so much farther beyond what i had ever hoped for myself professionally  and yet  when i leave for work in the morning  my son gives me a running hug  so i walk out the door and even though i have this whole wonderful day ahead of me  i know for a fact that ive already had the best part of my day  and that  i guess  is kind of surprising this interview has been edited and condensed .
early on the afternoon of dec  11  about an hour after an oval office meeting between president trump  the senate minority leader chuck schumer and the incoming house speaker nancy pelosi devolved on live tv into a shouting match  a tinkle contest with a skunk  in pelosis postgame grandiloquence  i pulled up to a mcmansion in a gated community outside las vegas  i presented my id and pre issued bar code pass to a security guard  another guard emerged from a sedan in the driveway  instructed me to leave my rental car across the street and pointed me to the front door i put this out here because i knew you were coming  harry reid  the former senate leader  said  pointing to a large gold menorah on his desk  it was not clear whether reid had someone buy the menorah especially for my visit or just keeps one lying around in case some reporter of  nominal  jewish identity happens to drop by around hanukkah   reids wife  landra  was raised in a jewish household in los angeles before she and reid converted to mormonism together  after they married   either way  reid seemed both amused and pleased with himself  as if he could see that i was not quite sure how to receive this odd duck gesture  during his time in office  he always got a kick out of embracing the awkward panders of political life  even if  especially if  they mocked the refinements of smoother politicians than him reid  who is 79  does not have long to live  i hate to be so abrupt about this  but reid probably would not mind  in may  he went in for a colonoscopy  the results of which caused concern among his doctors  this led to an m r i  that turned up a lesion on reids pancreas  cancer  reids subdued and slightly cold manner  and aggressive anticharisma  have always made him an admirably blunt assessor of situations  including  now  his own  as soon as you discover you have something on your pancreas  youre dead i had planned to visit reid  who had not granted an interview since his cancer diagnosis  in november  but he put me off  saying he felt too weak  people close to him were saying that he had months left  if not weeks  valedictories were planned  and lifetime awards were bestowed  efforts were underway to rename the las vegas airport in his honor  preferably before his own time of departure  reid refuses to believe that this honor will ever happen  when i practiced law  i did a lot of personal injury work  and i never spent one penny until that check was cashed  he explained to me when i went to see him in december  he was confined to a desk near the front door of the house  unable to move without the aid of a walker that rested behind him  still  he looked better than i thought he would  the last time i saw reid  during the 2016 presidential campaign  he was wearing dark glasses and was still bruised from a freakish exercise session mishap in early 2015  when an elastic band apparently snapped and propelled him into some cabinets  breaking ribs and bones in his face and blinding him in his right eye  the visible damage from this incident had abated at last  wearing a tan sweater over a dress shirt  he looked about how he did a decade ago  roughly his current age  in other words reids health  even before the cancer diagnosis  was a factor in opting not to seek re election for a sixth senate term in 2016  over the last few months  he has had chemotherapy and two back surgeries and has suffered a range of other ordeals  some related to the accident  for which trump delighted in mocking him  i think he should go back and start working out again with his rubber workout pieces  trump said in an interview with the washington post in september 2016 in fairness  reid had dismissed trump as a spoiled brat  a con man and a human leech  as senate majority leader  reid was essential to passing president barack obamas legislative agenda  but his dead eyed realism and morose tones always hung in contrast to the hope and change intoxications of those years  his den is adorned with a bright painted portrait of the rev  martin luther king jr   one of his heroes  whose view that the arc of the moral universe is long  but it bends toward justice was often echoed by obama  but reid himself always seemed more predisposed to believing that the arc of the universe bent toward an ornery brawl reid once called the federal reserve chairman alan greenspan a political hack  justice clarence thomas an embarrassment and president george w  bush a loser  for which he later apologized  and a liar  for which he did not   in 2016  he dismissed trump as a big fat guy who didnt win many fights  reid himself was more than ready to fight  and fight dirty  i was always willing to do things that others were not willing to do  he told me during the 2012 presidential campaign  he claimed  with no proof  that mitt romney had not paid any taxes over the past decade  romney released tax returns showing that he did  after the election  reid told cnn by way of self justification  romney didnt win  did he  reid took rightful criticism over this  still  in retrospect  theres something almost quaint about the outrage over the episode  trump routinely surpasses reids unscrupulousness with a few tweets before breakfast leaving washington on the eve of trumps takeover  reid insisted that he was happy to be escaping  maybe  he allowed  it would have been different if hillary clinton had won  but with this  no  he told new york magazine at the time  im not going to miss it and yet  two years later  it was easy to sense him pining for not just the political action but also the particular political action of trumps washington  no one would enjoy the fight with trump like harry reid would  said senator claire mccaskill  the missouri democrat who lost her re election race in november  the president is an inherently weak man  she said  harry would smell the weakness and say  damn the consequences in some ways  washington  under trump  has devolved into the feral state that reid  in his misanthropic heart  always knew it could become under the right conditions  politicians are always claiming to be eternal optimists  reid is no optimist  i figure  if youre pessimistic  youre never disappointed  he told me reid has decided to live out his last years in henderson  a fast growing and transient las vegas suburb  his house is in the upscale anthem neighborhood  a fortified village of beige dwellings of various sizes and otherwise indistinguishable appearances  there is a witness protection program vibe to the place  accentuated by the security detail reid attended high school in henderson  hitchhiking 45 miles each way from his hometown  searchlight  a drive through smudge of a town between las vegas and needles  calif   which  in his youth  boasted at least a half dozen brothels and not a single church  his acidic outlook was informed by his childhood  during which he endured extreme poverty and dysfunction and substance abuse in his family  he took up boxing in high school and put himself through george washington university law school by working as a capitol police officer  back in nevada  he was schooled in the piranha bowl of las vegas politics  this education included a stint as nevadas gaming chairman in the 1970s  which placed him in the cross hairs of the las vegas mob   some of the plot of the film casino was based loosely on reids experiences   there were numerous threats to his life and at least one actual attempt  a bomb discovered under the hood of his family car  the former f b i  director james comey  after he was fired by trump  compared trump to the head of a mafia family  with its codes of silence and loyalty  its fear based leadership style and fealty to a single godfather  its not about anything else except the boss  comey said in a recent interview at the 92nd street y in new york  others have drawn the same parallel  and i asked reid if  given his unusually relevant professional experience in this area  it rang true  reid expelled a quick and dismissive chuckle  organized crime is a business  he told me  and they are really good with what they do  but they are better off when things are predictable  in my opinion  they do not do well with chaos  and thats what we have going with trump still  reid added  trump is an interesting person  he is not immoral but is amoral  amoral is when you shoot someone in the head  it doesnt make a difference  no conscience  there was a hint of grudging respect in reids tone  which he seemed to catch and correct  i think he is without question the worst president weve ever had  he said  weve had some bad ones  and theres not even a close second to him  he added  hell lie  hell cheat  you cant reason with him  once more  a hint of wonder crept into his voice  as if he was describing a rogue beast on the loose in a jungle that reid knows well the trump era and reids illness have occasioned an inevitable reconsideration of reids legacy and all its contradictions  the affordable care act  which reid managed to navigate past the oppositional tactics of his persistent nemesis  the republican senate leader  and now majority leader   mitch mcconnell  has so far withstood mcconnell and trumps efforts to dismantle the legislation  reid was also prescient in urging the obama administration and congressional republicans to go public about the investigation into russian meddling in the 2016 election  the letter that republican leaders agreed to co sign weeks after they were briefed on the investigation did not identify russia by name  they did nothing  or nothing that im aware of  reid said but mcconnells and trumps own most substantial accomplishment to date  the appointment to the federal bench of an unprecedented number of conservative judges  including two supreme court justices who might well end up hearing a challenge to the affordable care act  was made vastly easier by reids decision  in 2013  to get rid of the filibuster for judicial appointments  reid remains unrepentant about this  they can say what they want  he told me  we had over 100 judges that we couldnt get approved  so i had no choice  either obamas presidency would be a joke or obamas presidency would be one of fruition still  a certain nostalgia for the senate leader has set in among democrats  even those who had their disagreements with him  mccaskill was critical of reid during their tenure together and did not back him for caucus leader in 2014  there are two major components of a senate leaders job  she said  one is to make the trains run on time and getting things done that his caucus believes in  mccaskill told me  but the trains need to be bright and shiny while theyre running  she added  referring to the communication and messaging part of the job that she said reid was less well suited to mccaskill told reid at the time that she did not plan to vote for him and explained her reasons to him  he replied that she was the only one of his nonsupporters who had the nerve to tell him directly  oh  no  why would i  reid told me when i asked him if he felt betrayed  and i won  didnt i reids successor is chuck schumer  his former caucus deputy who engineered much of the senate democrats communications and campaign strategy during reids tenure  they had been close during reids 12 years as democratic leader  reid serving as the arid desert yin to schumers bombastic brooklyn yang  when we spoke  reid told me he did not wish to be seen as second guessing schumer  my personal feeling should have nothing to do with it  he said  but clearly reid has more than a few of those personal feelings  he has told confidants that he felt schumer was too eager to assume his job before reid was ready to leave  reid has also criticized  privately  schumers instinct for accommodation with both mcconnell and trump in our conversation  reid seemed incapable of not constantly reminding me that he did not wish to talk about schumer  as if this itself was something he wanted me to emphasize  i do not call schumer  he told me  then  i call him once in a while  not weekly  lets say monthly i may call him  this sounded straightforward enough until he added  i talk to nancy often  i love nancy pelosi  we did so many good things  and we still talk about that  and just the day before  he said  he called richard durbin  the illinois democrat who  along with schumer  was reids top lieutenant in the senate and is now schumers democratic whip  we came to the house together in 1982  reid said of durbin  we had wonderful conversations   schumer declined to be interviewed  his spokesman said in a statement that schumer and reid have different styles but they complemented each other well  they are still good friends and talk regularly  in fairness  theres little that any democratic leader can do at a time when the opposing party controls the presidency and both houses of congress  as republicans did until this month  durbin told me that he has sat with schumer and trump together at the white house  they are discussing things at a new york level that most of us on the outside dont understand  durbin said  with chuck  its his grandfather who had some business with trumps father or some darned thing  its a totally different ballgame i asked durbin whether this approach had yielded any results  the obvious answer  he conceded  is it hasnt worked very well so far david krone  reids former chief of staff  is of the view that leaving washington saved reids life  he wouldnt be alive today if he had pancreatic cancer and he was still the senate leader  he told me  he would not have made it  still  krone said  i think he misses it  definitely when he was in washington  reid used to spend an inordinate amount of time on the senate floor  i was always afraid that i would miss something  reid used to say and told me again in nevada  in retirement  he said  for me to sit here and say i dont follow politics  you wouldnt believe me  o k  on the friday afternoon before christmas  just hours before the government shut down over trumps demands for more funding for a border wall  i called reid to see how closely he was following this latest brinkmanship  landra and i have been watching the news  we have it on now  reid told me  the shutdown  he allowed  was interesting  reid takes an anthropological interest in the changes that trump has wrought on his old institution  you cant legislate when you have a chief executive whos weird  for lack of a better description  he told me  he said he could never understand how his former senate colleague jeff sessions allowed himself to be so abused and humiliated by the president  why in the hell didnt sessions leave  he said  same with kelly  referring to the departing chief of staff  john kelly  id say  go screw yourself  i could not look my children in the eye i asked him if he could identify at all with trumps dark worldview  i disagree that trump is a pessimist  reid said  as if to allow him that mantle would be paying him an undeserved compliment  i think hes a person who is oblivious to the real world one of reids assets as a leader  when he was in office  was his willingness to feed the egos of his colleagues before his own  he was happy to yield credit  attention and tv appearances  yet when i visited reid in nevada  i detected a whiff of  if not neediness per se  maybe a need to remind me that he has not been forgotten  he told me that he received a lovely call that morning from barbara boxer  the former democratic senator from california  he gets calls from his former colleagues all the time  he said  and they tell reid he is missed  he had a final conversation with john mccain over the summer  just before mccain died  punctuated with i love yous reading reid can be difficult  is he playing a game or working an angle or even laughing at a private joke he just told himself  when speaking of his final goodbye with mccain  he broke into a strange little grin  his lips pressed upward as if he could have been stifling either amusement or tears  it occurred to me that reid  typically as self aware as he is unsentimental  could have been engaged in a gentle playacting of how two old senate combatants of a fast vanishing era are supposed to say goodbye to each other for posterity reid seemed to recognize my puzzlement and shrugged  as has been written since i left  he told me  i was kind of a strange guy .
san francisco  kamala harris was three months into her tenure as san francisco district attorney in 2004 when a gang member killed a police officer with a hail of bullets from an ak 47  her announcement within three days of the murder that she would not seek the death penalty set off protests from her fellow democrats as well as from the police senator dianne feinstein stood in front of thousands of mourners at the officers funeral at st  marys cathedral and urged her to change her mind  jerry brown  the once and future governor  was among those standing in ovation  the state attorney general threatened to take over the case  and senator barbara boxer asked the justice department to prosecute it ms  harris  the first person of color elected as this citys district attorney  declared her decision a matter of principle  the death penalty  she believed  discriminated against poor and black people and would not deter more killing but death penalty opponents wondered a decade later where that principle had gone when as californias attorney general ms  harris appealed a judges decision declaring the states death penalty law unconstitutional  she said it was a matter of upholding the law  her critics asked whether she would have similarly defended segregation and statutes against interracial marriage now ms  harris is running for president as a progressive prosecutor  she says she sees no contradiction in the term  arguing that a tough prosecutor can also be a force for reforming the criminal justice system  but already  mere weeks into her candidacy  she is facing a chorus of skepticism  especially from the left  the death penalty episode shows the tricky crosscurrents that she has had to weather  and that are likely to intensify as she tries to square that circle in a dozen years as the top law enforcement official of the city and then the state  ms  harris was as much politician as prosecutor  appearing to try to be all things to all constituencies  more practical than ideological  she was defined most by resisting easy definition she impressed californians with her commanding presence  offering a preview of the senator the country would see pointedly questioning republican nominees during confirmation hearings  but she developed a reputation for caution  protecting the status quo and shrinking from decisions on contentious issues years before ending mass incarceration became a bipartisan cause  she started programs to steer low level drug offenders away from prison and into school and jobs  at the same time  she touted her success in increasing conviction rates  and as attorney general remained largely on the sidelines as california scrambled to meet a federal court order to reduce its swollen prison populations  she also repeatedly sided with prosecutors accused of misconduct  challenging judges who ruled against them and while she summoned righteous anger toward the bank fraud that helped set off the great recession  holding out for more money for california homeowners in the national mortgage settlement  she said little when the governor diverted some of it to fill holes in his budget she played it very careful  said laurie levenson  a professor at loyola law school in los angeles who served on an independent panel that investigated one of the cases of prosecutorial misconduct while ms  harris was attorney general  she had her sights set on what her future might be  and she realized every day she was navigating a minefield  because she had law enforcement to deal with  she had the public to deal with  the minority community to deal with  i think she was trying to be very careful not to alienate she has also had to navigate the shifting politics of crime and race  and the expectations they bring with them ms  harris began her career at a time when many african american law enforcement officials were joining  even amplifying  law and order calls for stricter prosecution  to stop the drugs and violence victimizing their communities  when she became attorney general in 2011  crime was falling and the debate was evolving  now  in the era of black lives matter  many in the black community argue that the biggest law enforcement problem is law enforcement itself  and her record is being assessed against calls for a wholesale reimagination of the criminal justice system  who should go to prison and for how long  indeed  should any but the most heinous criminals go to prison at all at the other end of the political spectrum  president trump has sought to frame the immigration debate around fear of rising crime  teeing it up as a campaign issue for 2020  in the waning days of the partial government shutdown over his demand for a border wall  he tweeted what he called a new republican theme for the next two years  build a wall   crime will fall ms  harris scorns what she calls false choices  and says her critics are imposing them on her record  those who have worked for her call her disciplined  a characterization she prefers to cautious  she describes her thinking  about criminal justice  but also about the other issues animating her presidential candidacy  like health care and economic inequality  as scientific  its a hypothesis  this is how we can do things better  she said in a recent interview  you have to inform it with  wheres the empirical evidence  where is the data  where is the detail she does not like to be boxed in the thing that drives kamala harris crazy above all other things is to get reduced to a demographic archetype  said sean clegg  a longtime strategist for ms  harris and other california democrats  you are xyz because you are a black woman  you are xyz because youre from san francisco  shes a complex person like all of us  shes also been the first  thats a lot more difficult than it looks ms  harris  now 54  confounded expectations just by becoming a prosecutor she is the daughter of immigrants  her mother from india  her father from jamaica  who met as civil rights activists in graduate school at berkeley and gave ms  harris what she calls a strollers eye view of the demonstrations of the 1960s most of her law school peers went into civil rights work  recalled jeff adachi  who was a tutor in ms  harriss program at the university of californias hastings college of the law and later faced off against her as san franciscos elected public defender you didnt have a lot of minorities who were wanting to be part of law enforcement  he said she had to explain to family and friends before taking her first job out of law school  as a prosecutor in oakland in 1990  as she described it in the recent interview  when we want to reform systems  it shouldnt and it cant only be from the outside on bended knee or trying to break down the door she added  lets try and do it from the inside and understand that those people are going to stand in a courtroom and ask for guilty verdicts for people who do harm to the community  and thats consistent with all progressive values she earned a reputation as a sharp trial lawyer  and in 1998 became the managing attorney in charge of the career criminal unit in the san francisco district attorneys office  but she left within two years  frustrated by what she saw as the dysfunction of that office  which had the states lowest conviction rate and lacked basics like email and enough phones she worked for the city attorney  and she prepared to run against her former boss  terence hallinan  in 2003 ms  harris had made political and social connections  dating willie brown  the powerful speaker of the california house  and serving on the board of the citys museum of modern art  but her polls showed she was a relative unknown mr  hallinan  a former defense lawyer and a son of a progressive party presidential candidate  had infuriated the police department by winning indictments of top brass in a scandal involving the assistant chiefs son  ms  harris campaigned between mr  hallinan and a more law and order candidate  on a platform that ran the gamut  professionalizing the office and improving relations with the police  opposing the death penalty and creating programs to steer first time nonviolent offenders away from crime she brought a rare perspective  elected district attorneys are more typically white men  a 2015 study by the women donors network found that just 1 percent are women of color  communities of color  she argued  wanted tougher treatment for the drug dealers victimizing them  what they didnt want from the police was excessive force almost immediately  her decision on the death penalty in the officers killing inflamed tensions with the police  but it was pragmatic as well as principled  she knew that san francisco jurors rarely if ever returned death sentences  and despite the protests  polling showed that the public supported her some contend that the episode spooked her  that she spent the rest of her tenure trying to make amends with the police  ms  harris scoffs at the idea  pointing to her diversion program that allowed young low level offenders to avoid incarceration if they enrolled in school full time and kept a job  you think law enforcement was supportive of that  she said that  program was relatively small  with only about 300 graduates over eight years  mr  adachi and others complained that it took only the offenders most likely to succeed  but its recidivism rate was remarkably low  less than 10 percent  compared with 53 percent statewide arguing that students who skip school are the ones who end up in the criminal justice system  ms  harris also started an anti truancy program  she described it as carrot and stick  it threatened prosecution for parents whose children were chronically absent  but also helped them with health care problems and other hurdles to getting their children to school critics  though  said it was more stick than carrot  and failed to grapple with the depths of the social problems parents were struggling against either way  the program reflected ms  harriss approach to her job fierce  said lateefah simon  a onetime teenage shoplifter who became executive director of a center that helps lift young women out of lives of crime  ms  harris recruited her to work in the district attorneys office  instructed her to lose the pumas and track pants  bought her a suit and told her she needed to understand the penal code  ms  harris herself kept an immaculate desk  with little more than a notepad and a keyboard at her fingertips ms  simon called ms  harris the 1999 version of olivia pope  the impeccably tailored  steely in a crisis hero of televisions scandal shes not easy  ms  simon said  if you beat up a woman in front of her children  you are going to jail  at the heart  she is a prosecutor  she wants to hold people accountable suzy loftus  who started working for ms  harris as a campaign volunteer in 2003 and is now running for district attorney  recalls ms  harriss instruction as she swore her in as a prosecutor  when you go into court tomorrow  she told her  you look the judge in the eye and say  suzy loftus  for the people   for the people is now the slogan for ms  harriss presidential campaign  its professional and its about dignity  ms  loftus said  but its also about giving dignity to people who are most impacted by the system but it was ms  harriss success in increasing conviction rates that became a central boast of her campaign for attorney general in 2010 an article in san francisco weekly that year challenged the numbers  noting that most of the convictions had come from plea deals  and that the conviction rate for cases that went to trial was lower than mr  hallinans  and had dropped over the previous two years  assistant prosecutors were quoted saying that ms  harris had pressured them to take weak cases to trial in an attempt to look tough on crime as she prepared to run beyond the liberal city her office defended her by noting that she had won stiffer sentences than her predecessors  by demanding prison time instead of probation for crimes including robbery and home burglary ms  simon  who was awarded a macarthur genius grant in 2003 for her leadership on juvenile justice and now leads the akonadi foundation  a racial justice organization in oakland  says she fights with her radical friends who think ms  harris was not progressive enough on crime  i say  id love to see you run for d a  and run a better office ms  harris  she said  had to contend with expectations from all sides she instinctually but also strategically had to think about the way people saw her  ms  simon said  the expectations not just of a black woman elected  but with black folks  they expected so much of her to go and revolutionize the system in four to eight years  which is impossible ms  harris ran unopposed in 2007 for her second term  the only san francisco district attorney to have done so in nearly two decades  and she became increasingly well known nationally  publishing her first book  smart on crime  a career prosecutors plan to make us safer  as she prepared to run for attorney general in 2010 she took office at the ideal moment for a prosecutor who wanted to rethink the criminal justice system a panel of federal judges had ruled that overcrowding in california prisons amounted to cruel and unusual punishment  prisoners were stacked in triple bunk beds in gymnasiums and dying for lack of medical care  and ordered the state to reduce the population by about 40 000 the debate over prison crowding had been long running and contentious  with victims rights groups and law enforcement officials opposing the idea of prisoner release  ms  harris stayed above the fray  as she would on a range of issues throughout her tenure  seeing herself less as a decision maker than as a lawyer serving a client she had campaigned to the right of her republican opponent on the question of easing the states tough three strikes law  once in office  she declined to take positions on ultimately successful ballot initiatives intended to reduce prison populations  one expanding opportunities for parole  the other reducing many nonviolent felonies to misdemeanors she argued that because she was tasked with writing the descriptions of the initiatives that would appear on the ballot any public statements on the proposals might create the impression that she had a finger on the scale  this departed  though  from the practice of previous attorneys general after the supreme court upheld the judges overcrowding order  the state promised to promptly release a significant number of nonviolent prisoners  giving credit for time served  a delay in meeting that promise drew a judicial scolding in 2014  the states response proved embarrassing  and unsuccessful  reducing the prison population  ms  harriss office maintained  would hurt californias ability to fight wildfires by shrinking the pool of forced labor she really was a sideline player in all the decarceration efforts  said robert weisberg  a law professor and co director of the criminal law center at stanford  she didnt stake out a strong position on what to do other than  lets promote re entry and anti recidivism programs the california attorney generals office is large  about 5 000 lawyers  and ms  harris said she was unaware of the brief arguing for cheap prison labor  a previous a g  said to me  you are going to inherit an office of 5 000 mistakes waiting for you every day  she said in the interview  i have always owned that responsibility that was also her response to criticism that she had resisted appeals for dna testing from kevin cooper  a death row inmate whose case had been taken up by groups including the american bar association and the american civil liberties union  ms  harris said she learned of the case in a new york times column last year  after which she urged testing beginning in the summer of 2014  the nation  and with it  californias attorney general  was thrust into a debate over police brutality  by the deaths of black men in confrontations with the police in ferguson  mo   baltimore  and other cities ms  harris won praise for releasing statewide data in a way that informed rather than inflamed the brutality debate  it included numbers on the use of police force but also on use of force against officers  she instituted body cameras for police agents who worked in her office  and offered implicit bias training for police statewide but she declined to support statewide regulations for the use of body cameras  agreeing with local departments that they should set their own standards  and she did not support a bill that would have required the attorney general to investigate police shootings her office was also forced to confront an uproar over prosecutorial misconduct  with judges disciplining local prosecutors for lying and tampering with evidence  it was an issue she had faced as district attorney in a scandal involving drug testing at the san francisco police department crime lab a technician had been skimming drugs to feed her own habit  and ms  harriss chief drug prosecutor had warned that she was sabotaging evidence  ms  harris said she only learned of the problem several months later  when it was revealed publicly a judge then ruled that the district attorneys office had violated constitutional protections requiring prosecutors to turn over any information that might damage witnesses credibility  and criticized the office for failing to tell defense lawyers about crimes or misconduct on at least 60 police officers records ms  harris responded by accusing the judge of a conflict of interest because she was married to a defense attorney who had handled a case involving the lab   a court rejected her motion  as attorney general  ms  harris defended prosecutors by appealing judges rulings  dropping one appeal  during her senate campaign  only after a video of judges criticizing her office went viral in a case in orange county  a public defender had discovered that the district attorneys office was strategically placing jailhouse informants  offering them leniency if they could coax confessions from fellow inmates  a judge found that the district attorneys office had lied to him about the use of informants and withheld potentially favorable evidence from defense lawyers when the judge disqualified the entire office from a death penalty case  ms  harris appealed  accusing the judge of abusing his discretion  while she opened an inquiry into the case at hand  she rejected repeated calls for a broad investigation of the prosecutors office in the recent interview  ms  harris said her decision reflected her experience when others had tried to disqualify her from the san francisco death penalty case  it was up to voters  not the attorney general  she said  to remove elected prosecutors  i knew misconduct had occurred  clearly it had  she said  and it was being handled at the local level frustrated by her refusal to investigate  erwin chemerinsky  then the law school dean at the university of california  irvine  joined with a former attorney general to ask the justice department to examine what they believed was a pattern of civil rights violations in the prosecutors office  their letter was signed by 25 prominent law professors  prosecutors and defense lawyers twice kamala harris called on my cell and said she was on top of it and looking into it  he said  to my knowledge  the california a g  never did anything with regard to the scandal professor chemerinsky emphasized that he admired ms  harriss work as a senator  but  he said  her offices decisions on orange county were outrageous their reaction ranged from silence to criticizing the judge who found the misconduct  he said  never did they attempt to be a force for reform in september 2011  ms  harris announced that she would not sign the national mortgage settlement  negotiated by the obama administration with the banks at the center of the foreclosure crisis  what happened next  ms  harris and her supporters say  illustrates her agility in balancing competing interests the proposed settlement essentially gave the banks amnesty against further prosecution  ms  harris wanted to leave open the possibility of investigation and lawsuits  and promised californians to lock up the bankers responsible for the fraud as the top prosecutor for the state with the bulk of foreclosures  she had the power to determine the fate of the deal  the lobbying was intense  from housing groups  from homeowners  from the obama administration  it was a constant tension between speeding the relief quickly in the middle of the crisis or taking the time to go through this investigation  which could take years  while people were losing their homes every day  said brian nelson  a deputy who helped ms  harris negotiate the deal she did not kill the settlement  she emerged with a better one  the banks agreed to  18 billion in debt reduction that ms  harris said would allow california homeowners to stay in their homes  and the national agreement included  2 5 billion for a fund to provide educational counseling and other services for those in danger of foreclosure but critics  especially on the left  have long said that the settlement was no grand bargain  it did not require banks to pay much out of pocket   4 7 billion of the  18 billion in relief came from forgiving second mortgages  many of which the banks would have written off anyway because they were so severely underwater  and  9 billion came from homeowners selling their homes for less than the value of their mortgages  meaning that homeowners did not stay in their homes ms  harris retained the right to investigate and pursue claims against the banks  winning  921 million against five institutions  but no one went to prison  she explained to voters that she was frustrated  too  but the state could go only where the evidence took us and most of the  410 million california got to help at risk homeowners never made it to them  a judge found that governor brown diverted  331 million to plug budget holes  ms  harris recused herself from defending the governor because of her role in the settlement  she rebuffed housing advocates requests to meet with her  offering little more than a brief statement that the money should go to homeowners her decision to fight the ruling that had struck down californias capital punishment law in 2015 created similar disappointment among those who had applauded her refusal to call for the death penalty in san francisco this was not a situation where they were compelled to respond  said hadar aviram  a law professor at hastings who started a petition against appealing  they could have done nothing the public  however  had three years earlier rejected a ballot initiative that would have abolished the death penalty in california in the interview  ms  harris said that as attorney general she had had to represent her client  the governor  who supported the death penalty appeal  even so  she had cited her discretion in deciding which cases to pursue when she declined requests to defend proposition 8  a successful ballot initiative defining marriage as between a man and a woman  in federal courts once again  she said  her critics were framing a false choice  she could defend the death penalty for a client and still be opposed to it personally just as a prosecutor can be tough but also progressive one human being kills another human being  a woman is raped  a child is molested  are we really saying there should be no consequence and accountability  she said  i believe it is consistent with knowing that there is bias in the system  knowing that there are deep flaws in the system  knowing that there has to be reform of the system she added  are we really saying that youre either that  or you believe that there should be serious consequences for people who commit serious crimes  i am both .

lost screen time  paul greenberg writes that  in 2018  americans who owned mobile devices spent a total of  1 380 and 1 460 hours on them  he wonders  if we were to forgo our smartphones in 2019  what else could we do with that money and time we posed the question to students  would they go a year without their phones  could they  commenters estimated that they spent anywhere from 30 minutes to 7 hours on their phones each day  some said they would gladly give up staring at their screens all the time  others  though  werent so sure it could be done my phone is part of my lifei honestly could not go a year without my smartphone  even though i wish i could  i hate my phone and what it does to my work ethic  it causes way too many distractions  causing me to either not do my work or forget about it a main reason i could not go without my phone is because of communication  my parents like to use an app called life360 that tracks where i am  so i need my phone with me at all times i would be fine without social media  it would be good for all of us  but it is one of the only ways i keep track of my friends that go to different schools  make new friends  and make plans homework is also why i could not go without my phone for a year  sometimes i dont always have my laptop with me  and so i do my work on my phone  i watch the videos we have to watch for math on my phone rather than on my laptop because i find that i pay attention better since my phone isnt sitting off to the side i believe no one in todays time could go without their phone for a year because now  smartphones are apart of everyones lives  jobs  schools  and parents all have apps for everything  evan barefoot  hoggard high schoolon the average i spend about 7 hours a day on my phone  i will text friends  play games and check my social media  could i go a year without my phone  no  not at all  i wouldnt know whats going on  i wont be able to text my friends  my phone is what i use to talk to people because its hard for me to talk to someone about my feelings face to face  when i want to hangout with my friends i use my phone  when im done doing my chores i go on my phone  i use my phone for music on the bus  when im playing my ps3  when im doing the dishes  and many more stuff  my phone is part of my life  kiara2019  silvertoni should spend less time on my phone  but  personally id say i spend about 1 2 hours on my phone everyday  the majority of the time spent on my phone is on social media and music apps  i think if i wasnt exposed to social media  and had another was of listening to music  i could go a year without a smartphone i do think this article persuades me to give up my phone for a year because it showed me all the good i could do for myself and the world  the best examples given were the plant  purify  save  and heal  if i didnt have a smartphone for a year  i would probably spend most of my time reading and growing my knowledge to do better in school and in life and going on adventures around the world  krystian30  silvertonthe benefits that my phone has on my life is that i can easily get in touch with my friends and i can keep up with whats going on with the world and other peoples lifes  yes i think my phone does have a negative impact on my life  i am a very stressful person and i have heard that your stress levels go up when you use your smartphone  also no amount of light hitting your eyeballs 1 foot away is good for eyes or your brain  i also tend to get really bad headaches from looking at my phone took much and thats a major problem  lastly i love my phone and the connection i can get with my friends over it  but i do think i need to spend less time on my phone and enjoy another persons company  leialoha  silverton23i spend lots of time on my phone  on average maybe 30 40 hours per week  i am trying to cut down on the usage because i know i have more important stuff to do then just staring at my phone  when i heard what we could do to change this  i knew i needed to follow these the benefits to not having a phone   from my experience  is that you are in a better mood  you do more stuff with people and do more things that are active and healthy for you  i think its good to drop your phone once in a while to be more open  open to the world  open to more activities  you are happier when not staring at your phone  and you are more talkative to a person  i think in general we should drop our phones for a week  and just experiment with the fun  madison2019  silvertona year without a phone  i could do it the benefits my phone has for my life is that i can stay connected with a lot of my peers around oregon or my friends at my school  my phone keeps me entertained and helps me contact anyone at any time if its crucial or really important  it also keeps me in reach with my parents so that they know where i am at all times but  the negative affects my phone has in my life is that it draws my attention so that whenever i have homework or something really important to do i dont do it because im so focused on my phone  i make excuses that i dont have time  but usually i roughly have 2 hours of free time to get all my homework done but instead i just go on my phone  also  i do many sports and i always use the excuse that school is to hard or that sports are making it difficult but it really is just me choosing that my phone is more important than my education so  yes i do think that i could go a year without my cellphone and that it would benefit me to get all the things i need to get done so that i can be successful as i get higher and higher at school  melia  silverton23i probably could go a year without my smartphone because i dont use it that much  it benefits me because if my parents need to contact me or i want to reach my friend  i can with the smartphone  the disadvantages with it are mainly that i dont pay attention to my surroundings when focused on the screen  if i were to spend a year without my phone i wouldnt really miss it  considering most of my electronics time is spent on my laptop or console  rather then my phone  if i didnt spend any time on electronics however i would probably spend more time with family  clayton  silvertoni only spend around 30 minutes on my phone on a daily basis so most of the things said in the article dont really matter as much to me i could go a year without my phone because i dont really use it for anything but texting and if i needed i could just talk to people in person  if i didnt have a phone i guess the positive side would be that i wouldnt be tempted to look at a screen constantly  ashton  silverton23          in does it pay to be a writer  concepcin de len reports that professional writing pays far less than it used to  barring many aspiring writers from pursuing their dream job  this sad news inspired us to ask students how important money is in their own career aspirations the question revealed a deep philosophical

school  wilmington  n c our modern marketplace makes it very difficult to pursue certain careers  and insight like just do what you love teaches nothing but how out of touch a lot of us still are about these issues  vanessa ellis  danvers  mass i would not choose to go in a career if it did not pay well  no matter how much i was interested in it  ultimately  the most efficient way to promote physical and mental well being is to have money   not in abundance  but a liveable salary is something hard to live without  i feel like the hassle of playing catch up with bills  payments  etc   would spoil the fun of the interest anyways  since it attracts so many hardships  when thinking about a career  the advice i would give is to think practically  career advice typically includes something around following your passion or your interests  but  interests change drastically through time  emily whalen  massachusettsdo what you lovea job should not just be for a source of income  your career should give you a sense of fulfillment in what you are doing for the world  i know what i want to do and i am willing to put in my everything to get there  are you willing  madison kelley  danvers  mass in todays world  not many adults really enjoy their occupation as a part of their lifestyle or even hobbie  most of the time  these people are seen walking around miserably on the weekdays  as they are solely focused on reaching the weekend however  making not a lot of money comes with sacrifices  i would not be able to live as luxuriously as maybe preferred  i might not be able to have my dream car  or dream house  or dream vacations  nevertheless  all of these things bought with large amounts of money can only take you so far in life  a dream car can take you all the same places a mediocre car could  and a dream house is the same four walls and a roof that a mediocre house could provide  also  a dream vacation only lasts for so long  until you must return home  my goal is to have my weekdays be as enjoyable as my weekends because we only live for so long  if that means not making a huge amount of money  so be it  gabriela ferullo  danvers  mass you dont need money to be happy in life  you just need to do something that makes you happy  thats why people work lower paying careers despite having opportunity to easily make more money  teachers are another prime example  no one would become a high school teacher based on the amount of money theyre going to make  yet there are still enough people who want to be teachers in the world that schools can actually function  this is because people want to be teachers because theyre passionate about teaching  if i were offered two jobsa job that i would love to do for low pay  and a job that i would absolutely hate for higher payi would take the former  jack murray  danvers  mass waking up everyday to go to an average 9 5 job that i hate would be a death sentence  im only 17 years old  and i am a junior in high school  i really havent thought about money much in my life  so maybe its a little premature to say that i do not care about it much  however as i sit here an right this  i want to do what i love  and love what i do  tom walfield  danvers  mass i would rather live in a little hut on the water with only what i needed to live  go to work everyday that is something i love to do  and then go back to my little hut and surf  dan rossitto  danvers  mass i look at people who sit behind desks from 8 6  five days a week  counting other peoples money  or creating advertisements  looking at a computer screen all day long  and some of them are happy  and like their job  but if i were offered a job like that  even if it were for triple my original salary  i would have to turn it down  we sit behind desks for sixteen or so years  why would anyone want to do that for the rest of their lives if im not doing something i love  i dont try as hard  madeline butler  danvers  mass cant you have both in my family  my single mother used to search endlessly for a job to provide for my sibling and i  her current job wasnt what she attended university for  but it would be enough for our home and necessities  looking back at those times  i hope to find a career i love  but within reason  i have a wider scope of understanding that money needs to be made  but i have hopes that the field of journalism is still alive by the time i graduate  i fully intend to pursue what i love and is interesting to me  journalism  by reading this article i am faced with the reality that not everyone makes it into the new york times or uncovers a scandal like the spotlight team in 2001  there is still hope that i can write about the major stories of our society and support myself and a future family  grace donahue  danvers  mass i hope to go to college to become a pediatric nurse  the salary of this job was an important part in deciding this career choice  working with children is something i am passionate about  but the nursing field was chosen based on the salary  i want to be able to support myself and my potential family without struggle  casey masterson  danvers  mass ever since i first started thinking about what i wanted my job to be when i get out of college  it was always a mixture between what i want to do and how much i get paid for doing it from an early age ive wanted to go into the medical field and as i got older my sights have been more focused on physical therapy  i knew that i wanted to be able to help people one way or another and physical therapy had seemed like the perfect fit for me  i want to be able to have a sustainable life while also being able to enjoy it at the same time  overall  i dont really think that there is a perfect job out there  but i do think that if you choose something that youre good at  enjoy doing  and has a good salary thats fit for you  then youll be able to lead a good and happy life  kathleen dawe  massachusetts          in our most popular picture prompt of the week  facing rejection  we asked students to look at the illustration above and reflect on a time they were rejected or failed at something they had worked hard for  how did they handle it  like the person in the picture  or with a little more frustration they told us stories of heartbreak  humiliation and  ultimately  resilience  read on to see what advice they have for their future selves and others on how to deal with rejection turn failure into fuelwhen i was ten years old i fell in love with soccer  i worked hard and would look forward to every practice  when i was ten though  during tryouts the top ten girls would make an early travel team  this of course  became my big goal  i went to all three days and worked very hard  yet there was some girls who only showed up to two  one  and some who didnt even go  the coaches in the end  picked them  i was the eleventh pick  when my father told me this the day after thanksgiving i was heartbroken  i had worked so hard and tried my best  how could girls who didnt even come to tryouts get in  and not me this was when i learned just how strong rejection can make you  i ended up working even harder the next few years to prove that i should not have been the eleventh pick  getting rejected when i was young helped me become determined and pushed me to be a better player  a leader  and a better person  to my future self  turn the negative into fuel to do good things and become better  do not beat yourself up if you dont have your best race  or your best test  prove to others and to yourself that you are better than what others may believe  gabrielle sherrick  danvers  mass i have faced rejection before  i was a little league baseball player when i was younger and wanted to really badly make the all star team  sadly  i wasnt accepted to the team and i grew angry because i thought that i was going to make the team for sure  it turns out that this rejection made me realize that hard work and dedication is what you need to put into something that you love to be good at it a piece of advice that i would give somebody because of this would be if you think you are the best you could be then push yourself even harder because you can be better than you are already are it will just take commitment  i have told myself many times when i feel like i reached my max potential that i just feel like this  but i could still push myself harder and make it so i am even better than i thought i could be  it changed the way i look at things and how i act in my life  jacob stone  united statesdont take it personallyas an aspiring actress  i have learned that rejection is a part of life  i have been rejected from theaters so many times that it is hard to count at this point  but i feel as if that has built me up to the person i am  when i was younger  i would respond to rejection by going up to my room  locking the door  and just crying for hours straight  i really just wanted to give up  at that age  you truly almost cant control it  even when i wasnt auditioning  i would still go through these phases when i just felt hopeless for me  trying to look at what i can improve on helps  but even so  there are so many factors that go into casting  from not being the right height to not having the right vocal range  so many things that go into it  and for me  learning to not take it personally is one of the most important things anyone can learn  sophia buonanduci  beverly  mass as a kid who plays three sports  ive been told no and been criticized a lot in my life  when i was younger i was always offended by the answer no and i saw it as a sign of negativity  i did and still do hold very high standards for myself  the only thing thats changed is how i take the criticism  whether or not its delivered nicely with a warm and cozy feeling when i get the answer no  get criticized  or get a bad grade  i look back on the test i failed or the moment on the field in which i messed up and i do some self reflection  i try to first identify the problem then decide how i can work on and fix that problem  as a matter of fact  now that i know how to take criticizm and no for an answer  i like to have friends and coaches who criticize me more so that i can continue endlessly working and self improving  ian  beverly  mass learn to move onthis situation may not seem like much  but i recall when i was about 8 years old  i had a lego set that i got for christmas  it was a star wars set that i had to build by following the instructions  and every time that i got to this one step  the whole thing would fall apart  it was really frustrating going through this process over and over again just to fail repeatedly  obviously  being only 8 years old  i did not take this well  i would get angry and maybe even throw some of the pieces across the room looking back on it now  i can see that it was silly to be upset over legos  but i think i did learn how to control my anger  after all of these failures  i started to ease into getting less and less frustrated i was able to understand that if you get too frustrated from failure  you will never succeed  for the next time i face rejection  i would tell my future self to pull it together  not to get upset  and move on from that rejection so it doesnt stick with you and drag you down  dillon mcdermott  danvers

we know teenagers have opinions about everything  thats why our writing prompts touch on both the serious  should anyone have  1 billion   and the not so serious  how do you like your pizza   but some of our favorite questions to ask are about issues that directly affect people this age  like what are the most important things students should learn in school  and should parents use smart devices to spy on their children most of the times articles we draw from are written by adults  so were happy that our prompts give students a space to share their experiences  they often provide sharp insights that add nuance to an authors argument and personal stories that give a human face to the reporting  and always  they give us a deeper understanding of what its like to be a teenager today weve gathered the responses to three such prompts below  this week  teenagers told us what its really like to grow up in a culture of online public shaming  shared how technology has shaped the ways they apologize  and wrote short stories and poems about what they imagine the future will look like and though we dont round up the responses to our article of the day and film club features here  we also want to acknowledge the many comments we received on an article and short film we featured honoring the feb  14 anniversary of the parkland shooting  there  students shared their support for the victims and survivors of parkland  as well as their own fears and anxieties about being a part of the mass shooting generation finally  thank you to the many new classes who added their voices to the conversation this week from  booker high school  burnt hills ballston lake in new york  clymer  n y   etna  calif   fairfield  calif   nhrhs  n j   north hunterdon high school  oak grove  oceanside high school  south carolina  wilmington  mass   and voice charter school please note  all student comments have been lightly edited for length  but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted           outrage erupted online after esquire magazine released their march 2019 cover story earlier this month  portraying the quintessential american boy a white  middle class boy  people ridiculed not only the magazine  but also the subject of the story  17 year old ryan morgan  in a related op ed  robyn kanner argues that online public shaming like this prevents people  especially teenagers  from being able to learn  grow and change in this student opinion question  we asked students if they agreed with ms  kanner  they shared with us what its like to grow up in a culture of digital shaming  and the way it has both opened their eyes and scared them into silence should teenagers be held to the same standards as adults as a very average teenager i believe that it is very unfair to judge someone for their thoughts and actions as a teenager  we often say without thinking and simply think what our peers think  we go with what everyone else is doing and that is why often times a lot of teens make bad decisions  we are pressured to do what everyone else is doing without even realizing the pressure is there  thomas  silverton30teenagers are not oblivious and blind  they know their actions  and infantilizing and pitying them to avoid addressing their genuinely problematic actions is part of the problem  not checking these actions in formative years paves the way for them to do the same as adults  while public shaming and dogpiling is extreme  you cant brush over bad things by saying he was just a kid  being a kid doesnt change that you have to check and change problematic behavior  faye  chicagoour legal guardians influence us more than we realize  however adolescents should not be held to the same standard because we have more people around us during the day that shove their thoughts and beliefs on us  therefore  we havent had a chance to figure out our own thoughts because we constantly have other peoples words impacting us when we dont realize  it is unfair for us to compare adolescents to the standards of adults because of the countless influences adults dont face  and we unrightly judge our peers because our society has justified it as a way of life  brooklyn waller  bryant high school  arkansasi cannot say that all teenagers shouldnt be judged or criticized by there actions and opinions  although people can change  we cannot excuse harmful behavior or opinions at any age  caroline  northbrookadolescence is a time for us teenagers to be exploring the world around us and developing our worldview  and throughout this process of growing up  i have witnessed the ideologies of my peers and i develop in nuance and maturity  knowing the severity of digital shaming and the potential of teenagers to change  i do not believe it is fair to hold teenagers online statements to the same level of scrutiny as adults as criticism online has a greater danger of hurting a teenager or promoting dogmatism instead of fostering growth  rachel sweningson  bryant  arkansasit is commonly said that teenagers are young and dumb and are just exploring their values and beliefs  but at what point does that turn from exploration to being disrespectful without having to be held accountable for ones actions  i do believe that people should be held accountable for rude actions as a teenager  because those actions do not go away or change  they are just there  sitting in the past  lainey broussard  houston  texasto be a teenager in the modern era is still like being a teenager  youre awkward  scared  and harassed for doing something different  the key difference is that now complete and total strangers are harassing teens now too  all thanks to the internet  i do fear being shunned for what i believe  as would any human  as such  i do try to be more thoughtful toward others  i worry so much that i might offend someone to the point i may just not talk  ben smith  hoggard high school  wilmington  n c  the good and the bad of call out cultureim sure youve heard the saying if at first you dont succeed  try  try again  think about all the times youve made mistakes  and how youve learned from those mistakes  what if you never got the chance to try  try  again  if the first time you made a mistake that was the only impression people had of you and you didnt get the chance to learn and grow  that is what public shaming is doing to us since we iive our lives so publicly  impulsively tweeting and posting whatever comes to our mind  a lot of our mistakes and not so proud moments are out there for the world to seeforever  then our mistakes become the only view people have of us  an out of context snapshot that provides an incomplete  biased view of our character  even if what we say doesnt go viral  its just a google search of our name away  we dont get the chance to explain ourselves  to grow and change as a person  or to develop our views and opinions because people will judge us before weve had the chance  gillian konko  houston  texascriticism is a big part of online culture  and for a very good reason  people will almost always want to say something about everything  and the allure of doing so without giving away your identity is often too strong to resist  criticism  therefore  is very important  and i believe all people have the right to criticize and to be criticized  however  i believe that all criticism should be nuanced  thomas d   j t  hoggard high schooli am definitely more careful about what i post online because i know that it could offend or upset other people  which i dont want to do  i think if people were kinder online in their critiques  then the teenager who posted something would be able to learn from it  however  usually the shaming is a complete bash of the person which could deter them from ever sharing again  this doesnt help them learn anything  it just hurts them and makes them fearful  kinder critiques and proper guidance for people would help them learn and change to become better people  maddy chen  northbrook  ilif we obsess over peoples past then its possible they will be afraid to ever express themselves for fear of it coming back to haunt them  i purposefully dont put anything controversial online because i know it will be permanent  and in case i change as a person later in my life i dont want to have to worry about that  i think that its good for people to know that things they say on the internet can come back for them  but i also think its dangerous to have a culture where we immediately condemn people for parts of their past we find  dylan thiessen  hoggard high school  wilmington  nci believe that the best way to counteract this problem is to simply work to persuade others rather than persecute them  theres always a chance that someone could change  like kanner did  and come to see your point of view  but forcing ideas upon others  even if theyre right  can mar your argument in the eyes of someone else  making all debate pointless  in conclusion  while it may seem that our rage based internet culture is working to make progress  it might be hurting more than helping  ashley anderson  hoggard high school  ncpublic shaming forces an artificial change in people who want to avoid being the subject of constant harassment  for example  look at how arguments for trumps border wall play out  if you argue for the wall  youre publicly shamed and called a racist bigot  so  to avoid that outcome  people  specifically teenagers  who are generally more worried about their public image  stay silent  silence may feel good at the time  but silence doesnt solve problems digital public shaming not only stunts the growth of the teenage mind and ideas  it also stunts the growth of fruitful and equal discourse on emotionally charged issues  overall  i dont want to live in a culture where ideas can be moderated through public harassment via social media  regardless of what i agree and disagree with  no one should have to be afraid to share their opinion to the general public  alex mohler  bryant high school as a teenager growing up in a society like this  i agree that it restricts growth in a lot of ways  ever since seeing hate comments left on videos as an eleven year old  ive had a lingering fear of having any social media presence  to avoid confrontation for a post i made or a comment i left  due to this  i believe some part of my growth has been stunted  im often too scared to put myself out in the world because i believe backlash will be inevitable  im scared that i will upset someone  somehow  if im always worrying about pleasing everyone  when will i ever learn what i believe is right or wrong  michelle lamas  hoggard high school  wilmington  nci believe that people can change  because i know that my views on multiple topics have changed over the course of months or years just based on the fact that i have become more knowledgeable on those topics  a large part of changing your views and even developing new ideas come from listening to what other people have to say and communicating your ideas with those people  matthew miller  hoggard high school  wilmington nc          in how we apologize now  lindsey weber writes about the growing phenomenon of digital apologies from celebrities  this inspired us to ask students about how they apologize now that we live in a world where we spend much more time connecting with people online than we do face to face their responses were mixed  some said an apology is meaningful only if its made in person  while others argued that  in todays digital world  an apology is an apology  no matter how you do it  they also shared helpful dos and donts for saying youre sorry a sincere and meaningful apology should be made in personi believe new technologies have made apologies less significant now too  a sincere apology should be given in person  if you are really sorry you should go look the person in the eye  admit to your mistake  and tell them you will try to change or not repeat the hurtful action  i believe digital apologies just dont get the point across  the offended person will still be hurt and the offender cant seen the persons emotions that they have hurt  anonymous  siskiyou countyone thing that makes an apology sincere  is when it comes straight from the person mouth who is giving the apology  in my opinion apologizing over a screen is like breaking up with someone over text message  disrespectful and insincere  although i can understand were each famous person is coming from when they are trying to apologize to millions  a video  or a live chat would be better then a caption or a screenshot from ones notes  because apologies determine the trust we are receiving from a person  and how strong our relationship is  i would never sacrifice a strong relationship  because i wrote the apology over notes  isabella clucas  hoggard high school   wilmington nchonestly  i think digital apologies take away the point of and apology  an apology is to show sincerity in how sorry you are that something happened  its supposed to be from the heart  showing you actually care about the subject ive received plenty of digital apologies  but i havent accepted many  it just tells me you dont care enough about me to come to me in real life and exclaim your sorrow  fixing a friendship  to me  is worth more effort than a text that took ten seconds to type and send  alexandra pechlivanidis  hoggard high schooli have received many digital apologies over the years and personally  for me  changed my view of the person who was apologizing to me  i am a very shy introverted person  so talking to people in person is hard for me  so  when i see someone taking their time to come up and apologize to me in person  i have a little more respect for them and i acknowledge the fact that they stepped out of their comfort zone  it makes me feel good about myself because it shows that this person obviously cares about me  this is not only benefiting you but also the person that is apologizing to you  they feel a sense of satisfaction that they wouldnt receive when shooting an apology through text  with todays society  it is getting so much harder for people to communicate face to face  by apologizing in person i believe this will make our generation stronger  and bring us all closer together  shelby  etna  cadigital apologies are acceptable  most of the timeof course  little apologies like  im sorry i ripped your paper or i didnt mean to step on your foot are reasonable ones to be digital  but big apologies like  im sorry i yelled at you earlier or i shouldnt have lied should be genuine  and therefore given in person  i feel like in this world  more often than not  apologies are being digitally normalized  but i think we can all agree thats not a great thing to normalize  sierra  etnapersonally  i have given my friends many digital apologies  i have a problem with confrontation and i can never find the confidence to speak to my friends about problems face on  i can definitely say its pretty obvious this way to tell when someone isnt actually sorry  face to face apologies are always best  but the start with a digital apology is a good way to begin  abigail billings  hoggard high school  wilmington  nci personally apologize digitally because when im apologizing  im normally apologizing to one of my friends in my age group  and we understand each other better digitally  i do tend to use emojis as well when i apologize to show my regretness or whatever  but when im apologizing to someone like my parents  then i apologize face to face  in certain situations other alternatives could be taken  personally apologizing digitally is more easier and better  oscar  floridain the past  ive both given and received digital apologize  as most people nowadays have  it is not right and not just to call these apologies wrong  or worse than any other form like a face to face one  at the end of the day  its all just preference and overthinking whether or not someone is going to think that you are scared of facing your wrong and apologizing  but you are not  youve done it  and got the same message across in a more convenient way for the both of you  or at least thats what most people believe in today  and do every single day  a good apology needs to face the wrong that you have done  and state how you are going to improve from here on out  becoming a better person each day  bogdan taran  northbrook  ilthe best apologies are heartfelt and well thought out such as the ones in the article  these noticeably took time  editing and most importantly sincerity  more people should write apology letters in a notes app  this is a great starting place for developing apologies  creating more well defined and concise messages due to the revision process  like mentioned in the article  taylor swift  drake  and pete davidson are the celebrities that use notes app but didnt screenshot a picture  they used the app as a starting point and then created the apology with clear thoughts and intentions  kathryn meehan  hoggard high school  wilmington  nchiding behind a screenlike so many listed  i have to admit that i am guilty of this  i think that most apologies that are delivered digitally arent done so because they arent genuine  but because its so much easier to ask for forgiveness from the comfort of your couch  hiding behind a screen  when youre face to face with that person  you either get too embarrassed to admit your mistake  or youre too scared that it wont be accepted  somehow  whether it be to an offer of forgiveness or a dating request  people fear a corporal rejection more than a digital one  which encourages them to send these messages from a screen  diya jain  new jerseysorry  receiving that from a bubble over text has never relieved me from whatever situation led to it  ive always preferred an in person apology  but i very rarely get those now  living in the social media age has taken such a toll on the quality of our conversations that many are uncomfortable having in person conversations  these awkward feelings towards face to face convos cause us to resort to typed characters on a screen to let out our thoughts and feelings  however  this method of communication is very dangerous our minds receiving that text can pick apart every detail  why did he capitalize that  she put a period  shes obviously mad  while the person on the other end may have had no intentions to send off negative vibes  then  the argument begins  why are you mad at me so many arguments can be prevented with a phone call  talking face to face allows for optimum communication  if i ever got into a situation with a person that ended in them having to apologize  i would 100  prefer a phone call or to be apologized to in person because one  its way more personal  and two  it gives me the peace of mind that they are being genuine  emma coleman  hoggard high school  wilmington  ncthe only struggle with apologizing face to face is sometimes it can be very nerve racking  and for some people who are not very social it can seem almost impossible to do  i think that is why so many apologies are sent through text  but i also think that for some people it is tough to face the truth  most of the kids in our generation now do everything through their phone so that they can hide  they dont want to feel the agony of being wrong so they apologize through text or phone call  but like i said earlier  the most genuine and most heartfelt way to apologize in my opinion is in person  and then after just shoot them a text just to tell them how sorry you are  trey clucas  hoggard high schoolthe dos and donts of saying youre sorry i think admitting that you made a mistake and then explaining what you are going to do to not make it again  really leaves no room for the apologizee  forgive my phrasing  to be mad  at least at the apology in short  if you want an effective apology  start by acknowledging what you did wrong  explain what you will do to never do this again  and finish by passive aggressively insulting the one you are apologizing to for being so sensitive  the last part has  mixed results  justin pfeifer  hoggard highschool wilmington  nci think that the best apologies are when the offender realizes what they have said has caused offense and they are genuinely sorry for being insensitive  with the observance of their offence  they now know not to do or say whatever it is they did that caused a negative reaction  a lot of people dont care if they offend people  their apologies are in genuine and they continue offending others  making no changes  dana mormando  hoggard high school  wilmington ncan apology should consist of recognition of wrongdoing  and an expression of remorse for the event  bad apologies are not sincere and often take the approach of blaming anything but self  many times the wrongdoer will even guilt the recipient to make themselves feel better apologies are of importance because they can build and strengthen a relationship when an individual can take responsibility for their shortcoming or mistakes  it shows the love and respect one has for another when they can admit to their flaws  and hopefully aim to improve themselves  it can be corrosive  though  if one is only giving excuses or continuously having the same problem  promise to change  and producing no growth  hannah jade  etna  caon one school trip  a certain classmate of mine relished in taking every opportunity to make jokes at my expense or insult me  in addition  all the boys had to collectively sleep in the same area  including me and him  after dark  he would talk and talk about how stupid or how uncapable i was without relenting for all the others to hear  it was probably the worst couple days of my life fortunately  the counselors overheard him and asked him to stop  after a few days  the kid walked up to me and handed me a crumpled piece of paper silently  it read  without punctuation  something along the lines of  i am sorry that you didnt feel like you were at the center of your friend group its not like i was trying to make you feel bad or anything  he then reverted to  the age old tendency  of getting  defensive  blowing out what should be a simple sorry into a long and winding tale of excuses  weber   for me  it was an insult to receive that apology  it was fairly obvious that he had been forced to write it by the counselors and in his own way  he rebelled by making it as emotionally and grammatically inept as possible  andrei mistreanu  hoggard high school  wilmington  nci think the best apologies are shown through actions rather than words and thats why voicing your plans to change for the better make apologies better  if a celebrity says their going to educate themselves after making a racist remark  for example  they should actually do it  and not just for show  marie  south carolinaapologizing for something youve done wrong  is very vital to a good relationship  whenever i verbally hurt one of my friends  usually due to stress or carelessness  i try my hardest to let them know i didnt mean what i said  most of the time i say something wrong to my friends  its usually because i am stressed out and dont think that what i say and how i say it will affect anyone  we all have our bad days and sometimes when things arent going our way  we resort to taking it out on people we are closest to  thats why it is important to make right what youve done wrong and apologize  mikhaila floyd  hoggard high school  wilmington  nc          our most popular picture prompt of the week  tech gadgets  invited students to use their imaginations to begin a short story or poem inspired by the above illustration many played off the same theme  the future  from a poem about how the future is made to tales of time travel  apocalypse and robots  each of these creative pieces left us wanting to know what would happen next what the future might bethe projections of what the future might be  are only based on our current reality  the future is made not by one view  but is an evolution of ideas all rolled into one  so the image you hold inside of your head  of the gadgets  widgets or thingy mibobs  are merely a potential fragment of what will become  julia

it becomes reality  my boss was really insistent on getting this project finished  even more so than usual  he must be excited for the things he can create  i know he has some blueprints already ready to go  i got up off the generator and packed up my tools into my bag  khanaki 1  guard the camp until i return i say to my robodog  slinging my bag over my shoulder and picking up the cube gingerly  the metal dog gets up from his resting place and starts pacing the perimeter of my camp  watching over my generator and other possesions  good boy  i say with a grin  he works perfectly i head out to my bosses camp which isnt too far  i see he has guests so i enter his huge office quietly  knowing he will want to know of this immediately   should be done any day now  once we have the master cube we can simply give it the blueprint and it will generate our nuclear weapon arsenal to tenfold what it is now  no one will ever stand up to us again  i overhear my boss say as i walk in  i suddenly want to turn around and walk right back out of this room  but i couldnt  they had seen me  ah  rikki  so nice of you to join us  and with the cube no less  is it finished  my boss had turned to me

incidentit had been a while since shana had any type of human interaction  she was left behind in the wreckage of the city that was built mainly of technology  but did that really matter now  shana was ten when the incident happened  but as the years progressed  she lost track of her age  it was almost like the days before technology  except for one thing  her robot dog  robotus he was the only thing left  her family  who knew what happened to them  the only memory shana had of her previous life was living in the outskirts of the advanced city  barely living off of whatever scraps her poor parents brought back every other night  for such an advanced society  it seemed that shanas family was always left behind  and finally  when the incident happened  escape shuttles only rescued the wealthiest of society  royals  if you will  and everyone that was related to important people of important blood the rest were left to fend for themselves  like shana and her family  while her parents were out searching for food that night  the night of the accident  shana tried to escape  and she managed to escape unscathed  but her parents  she never saw them again  the remains of the city appeared like a wasteland  and many pieces of technology were left behind  shana felt in her heart her parents werent completely gone  and thats why instead of counting the days until death  she would slowly build a vehicle to escape  and  possibly rescue her parents  if they were alive  ryley  oak groverobothaley was looking along the wreckage  the year was 3083  the year that a nuclear war broke

at sunrise  there it was  a red tailed hawk  its gyre widening over the united states capitol building in the creamsicle colored light  like the worlds least subtle literary reference  it was still there by midafternoon  drifting on the thermals over the mostly depopulated national mall  wheeling occasionally past the window in the hallway outside the office where the senate majority leader  mitch mcconnell  sat on the 20th day of what would soon become the longest government shutdown in american history that morning  jan  10  washingtons principal chaos agent  the president of the united states  had given a typically accusatory and free associative news conference on the white house lawn  reiterating his demand for  5 billion in funding for a wall along the mexican border and his intention to continue the shutdown without it  then he decamped to the border for some photo ops with customs and border protection officials  republican senators spent the lunch hour shuttling back and forth between vice president mike pence and mcconnell  sequestered in different quarters on the capitols second floor  now the last speeches of the day were being made  the reporters had mostly gone and mcconnell sat in his office  reciting an unfamiliar tale  that of his own powerlessness ive been in the meetings  mcconnell  dressed in a pinstripe suit and a banker collar  said  its just that i dont have the votes that can consummate the deal  those votes could come only at the behest of trump or the new house speaker  nancy pelosi  he insisted  and  mcconnell continued  it seems to me the principals  the only people who can make this deal  as of the moment were having this discussion  seem to both think they have a winning hand mcconnell went through the motions of fully blaming pelosi  as he did on the senate floor that morning  displaying a poster with two identical pictures of a southern border wall  one labeled pres  obama and the other pres  trump  under a legend reading  what border fencing do democrats support  but he knew as well as anyone that he had in fact negotiated at least a temporary escape from the looming shutdown with paul ryan  then the house speaker  in december  which would have funded the government through february  before the president  lets just say  changed his mind  ryan told me this month  laughing ruefully  i spoke to him and tried to get the plan back on track  but that just wasnt in the cards  and here we are or here mcconnell was  at least  marooned in a newly divided congress  trying hard to stay out of the light  hes been very quiet  dick durbin  the democratic minority whip  who was in recent shutdown negotiation meetings with mcconnell and the democratic senate leadership  told me that afternoon  and has said repeatedly that hes not going to call any bill that the president doesnt approve of  and that has basically been the sum and substance of his contribution mcconnell  who has represented kentucky in the senate for 34 years and  as of last june  is the longest serving republican leader in senate history  is one of washingtons most famously inexpressive creatures  youve got to see the gears turning behind the eyes  because the mouth isnt moving very much  ryan told me  still  his statements about trump during the 2016 campaign  as the future president gradually cowed into submission the party to which mcconnell had dedicated his entire adult life  managed to simultaneously leave everything and nothing to the imagination  when mcconnell endorsed trump in may 2016  after the last of his plausible challengers collapsed  he did it with a terse written statement in which the gritting of teeth was practically audible  i have committed to supporting the nominee chosen by republican voters  it read  and donald trump  the presumptive nominee  is now on the verge of clinching that nomination  speaking to a reporter from usa today later that month  the most enthusiastic vision mcconnell would allow of a trump presidency was that it would be fine it would be hard to find two people by personality  or any inclination  that are more diametrically opposed than the president and senator mcconnell  says roy blunt  the missouri senator who heads the senate republicans policy committee  senator mcconnell  very careful and thoughtful about what he says  deeply studied in the history of the country and how the federal government works  the president would not be offended if he heard somebody say he did not spend his time becoming that well versed in those things  when i asked elaine chao  who is trumps secretary of transportation and mcconnells wife of 26 years  if trump and mcconnell liked each other  she was silent for a full four seconds before replying  youll have to ask the president that  and youll have to ask the leader that  when i did ask mcconnell  all he said was  yeah  we get along fine  6 takeaways from this mitch mcconnell profile  all of this made it more remarkable that  by the fall of last year  mcconnell had emerged as one of the few unambiguous winners of the trump presidency to date  when i first spoke with him  this past november  he talked of the preceding two years with a faint air of mystified amusement at his own fortune  as if a minor meteor had streaked through the window of the majority leaders office  narrowly missing his head before exploding against the two century old marble fireplace  and then also turned out to be filled with candy and hundred dollar bills  i think even though were pretty different in every way you can think of  he told me  clearing his throat  weve had a good sort of team effort here to accomplish as much as we can he was the trump administrations indispensable partner in seating two supreme court justices and 83 lower court judges  a generational remaking of the courts that has made mcconnell  in my view  the most consequential majority leader  certainly  in modern history  says leonard leo  the conservative legal activist who serves as executive vice president of the federalist society and as an adviser to the trump administration on the court appointments  shortly after the midterm elections  mcconnells longtime adviser j  scott jennings described to me how mcconnell had taken on this role as the principal enabler of the trump agenda  and he meant it as a compliment  there had been an improbable synergy between the two men  the president who covets power but has little sense or discipline in wielding it  and the legislator who has often seemed to consider the skillful exercise of power an end unto itself two and a half months later  however  the bargain mcconnell made stood in somewhat bleaker relief  trump had fired his attorney general  jeff sessions  his secretary of defense  james mattis  had resigned over disagreements with his foreign policy  his chief of staff  john kelly  was now gone  too  for weeks there had been an accelerating drumbeat of russia related guilty pleas and filings from the special prosecutor robert mueller the shutdown distilled the essence of mcconnells position in trumps washington  a man of institutions and establishments whose own legacy was now tied to that of a president who seems hellbent on burning both to the ground  on jan  9  he stood stone faced alongside trump in a senate hallway as the president suggested he would get his wall money by declaring a national emergency  i dont think much of that idea  mcconnell told me the following day  i hope he doesnt go down that path  still  he admitted  im perplexed as to how this ends when brett kavanaugh was confirmed to the supreme court on oct  6  after mcconnell played a key role in ushering him through a month of arguments over and investigations into allegations of sexual assault  the scope of the majority leaders influence on american governance snapped into focus  before mcconnell  the small handful of towering senate majority leaders left their legacies behind in the legal code  lyndon johnson passed the first two modern civil rights acts in 1957 and 1960  mike mansfield oversaw the third in 1964  and the construction of johnsons great society  howard baker passed reagans tax overhauls that shaped future debates about financing government  all of these accomplishments contained within them a heroic  idealized image of the senate itself  a chamber where men and women rose from their centuries old desks to debate the very idea of america  negotiating their way to laws of sweeping import to the country mcconnell is the first majority leader whose career has been built on the assumption that the senate that could produce the great legislative works of his predecessors is a thing of the past  a fact that itself owes a great deal to mcconnell  as minority and then majority leader during barack obamas presidency  he fashioned himself as the essential impediment to obamas vision of a sequel to the great society  using tactics that were once the province of senate factions as a strategic blueprint for the entire republican caucus democrats  under the current minority leader  chuck schumer  have tried to use mcconnells own playbook against him and trump  but to lesser effect  this is in part because mcconnell has expended less time and effort than previous senate leaders on the legislative process that so bogged down obamas agenda and more on the senates comparatively difficult to obstruct business of approving executive appointments  the unprecedented number of conservative approved judicial nominees mcconnell has waved through the senate  a process for which he laid the groundwork before trump was elected  stands to shift much of the burden of conservative policymaking away from an increasingly paralyzed senate  in the coming years  battles over voting rights  health care  abortion  regulation and campaign finance  among other areas  are less likely to be decided in congress than in the nations courthouses  in effect  mcconnell has become a master of the senate by figuring out how to route the republican agenda around it when i first approached mcconnells office about interviewing him to discuss this legacy  shortly after the kavanaugh confirmation  he agreed quickly  eventually obliging with several hours of conversations over the course of two months  he also encouraged a couple of dozen friends  colleagues  conservative pundits and members of trumps white house staff and cabinet to talk to me  the ways in which a subject tries to shape the reporting of his or her story  as canny subjects do  are revealing in their own right  during the interviews  there were the recurrent phrases  mcconnell can very quickly read the last page in the book  he was a listener by nature  and in virtually every mcconnell authorized conversation  it was said that he was a student of history he is  and also of his place in it  mcconnell is atypically unconcerned  among senators  with his public profile  even friends who attest to his dry wit and well concealed sentimentality acknowledge a man without qualities aspect to him  he isnt a jokester  says slade gorton  the former republican senator from washington state and an old friend of mcconnells  he isnt a party guy  hes just  there  hes just a fact of life  like a spy or a pinto bean  mcconnell has used this blankness to his advantage  made it a carrier for designs greater than himself  his ascent in republican politics came through his willingness to be the face of party prerogatives  fighting against campaign finance reform during the clinton and bush presidencies  impeding a then popular presidents agenda during obamas  that were distasteful to the general public  his shrugging willingness to play a villain when a villain was required but beneath this unconcern is a different kind of self regard  a sense of himself as a historical figure in waiting  in his first senate race  his campaign paid for a rare two minute tv commercial tracing the arc of his life and work at a time when his elected career consisted of two terms as the judge executive  a county level mayor  essentially  of jefferson county  kentucky  when he was named senate majority leader in 2014  and the louisville courier journal described him as the third from kentucky  his staff called the paper  insisting he was the second and demanding a correction   earle clements only filled in briefly for lyndon johnson after his heart attack   at the mcconnell center that mcconnell founded at the university of louisville  his alma mater  there is an exact replica of the mahogany desk mcconnell used as a junior senator  which was once occupied by henry clay  a fellow kentuckian and one of the heroes of the 19th century senate  who engineered the missouri compromise  there is a bronze statue of clay standing at the desk  but the brass nameplate on the desktop says mr  mcconnell but the particular way in which mcconnell has always conceived of his own historicity is significant and unusual among contemporary republicans  the tea partyers have their mel gibson movie fantasies  the trumpists their pinochet meets die hard pastiches  but mcconnell aspires to be not the bloody and maybe tragic hero in a revolutionary drama but one among a short list of undisputed masters of the machinery of american government  both essential to and dwarfed by the history of this machinery  notably  the political philosopher he cites to the near exclusion of all others is edmund burke  the 18th century irish writer and whig politician who essayed trenchantly against the french revolution  and whose influence on 21st century republican politics you would have to squint very hard to make out this vision is also unmistakably senatorial  mcconnell recognized his future in politics by high school and narrowed his ambitions to the upper chamber by the time he graduated from college  on his law school applications  according to his authorized biographer  john david dyche  one of his professors wrote that mcconnell will be a u s  senator  i was running for the senate in 84 from the moment i was sworn in as county judge on jan  1  1978  mcconnell once said  and he has never aspired to anything outside it  i think most senators look in the mirror and think they hear hail to the chief in the background  terry carmack  who has worked for mcconnell on and off since his first senate campaign  told me  but he always wanted to be in the senate  and from early in his senate career  mcconnell later wrote  i wanted to one day hold a leadership position in my party  helping to call the plays and not just run them the senate majority leader wields an elusive kind of power  the position  which dates back to the 1920s  is as paradoxical as the institution  which is given the authority to make great changes but also given as many tools to impede those changes as to enact them  to the senates defenders  this is the cooling saucer of george washingtons probably apocryphal explanation  to its detractors  it is more like an unreleasable parking brake on progress  never truly succeeding at holding back the future but ensuring that the countrys arrival at it will be as delayed and frictional as possible  at the turn of the 20th century  the senate proved ineffectual in regulating railroads and banking  it failed to grasp the severity of the depression until americans had endured its hardships for years  offering only the meekest of remedies until franklin d  roosevelt forced lawmakers to do otherwise  isolationists in the chamber impeded efforts to check adolf hitlers advance in europe  southern conservatives were effective enough at delaying legislative action on civil rights to prompt the oft quoted observation of william s  white  the timess congressional correspondent in the 1950s  that the senate was the souths unending revenge upon the north for gettysburg this began to change under the leadership of lyndon johnson in the late 1950s  but especially under mike mansfield  the montana democrat who served as majority leader from 1961 to 1977  longer than anyone before or since  though he enjoys a lesser profile than johnson  mansfield is more admired within the senate by democrats and republicans alike  as a magnanimous and gentlemanly conductor of the upper chambers fractious orchestra  he treated everyone alike  without regard to politics or seniority  ted stevens  the republican senator from alaska  once said  it was on mansfields watch that the senate passed the civil rights act of 1964  enacted medicare  forced the resignation of nixon without conviction and passed an array of post watergate reforms to the government and the senate itself  senators talk about mansfield the way jazz musicians talk about charlie parker  he is the figure whose accomplishments they are doomed to be judged against forever  even as the context in which those accomplishments were possible recedes irretrievably into the past mcconnell first arrived in the senate in what was arguably the most momentous year of the mansfield era  1964  as an intern for john sherman cooper  a moderate to liberal republican  cooper was then helping round up republican votes for what would become the civil rights act  mcconnell  who supported civil rights as a college student  has spoken reverently of attending the signing ceremony for the voting rights act in the capitol rotunda  at coopers invitation  the following year  in his telling  it remains the platonic ideal of legislation  passed with the support of majorities of both parties i greatly admired mansfield  mcconnell told me  mansfield did have a big advantage  however  a massive majority of his own party  the montana senator presided at the peak of a remarkable run of democratic hegemony in the senate  which the party had by then controlled for all but four years since the depression  it was also an age of emerging liberalism within the democratic ranks  the southern conservatives who had been the gravitational center of the party  blocking anti lynching and civil rights legislation in the senate since the 1920s  were in retreat  a diminished force in the democratic senate caucus and not yet at home among the republicans in 1976  mansfields last year in the senate  ronald reagan ran for president for the second time  losing the nomination to the sitting president  gerald ford  but ford lost to jimmy carter in november  and by then the conservatives who favored reagans candidacy had begun claiming the commanding heights of the republican party  they had also begun drawing in the white voters and politicians in the south and the northern suburbs who  post civil rights  were increasingly alienated from the democratic party  in 1980  reagan won on the strength of these votes  and republicans  for the first time since eisenhower  captured the senate  neither party has held it for more than eight consecutive years since in her 2016 book  insecure majorities  the university of maryland political scientist frances e  lee argues that the political trends that came to a head in the 1980 election changed the political calculations of members of congress in a fundamental way  in the old  asymmetrical senate  republicans had an incentive to behave as john sherman cooper did  stuck in a terminal minority party  their only hope of influence was to work with democrats to make policy  once every election came to promise the prospect of a change in power  however  everything lawmakers did came to be seen through the lens of the next election  and the ascendant congressional figures of the era  like newt gingrich  were necessarily the ones who most unwaveringly saw it that way  after 1980  lee writes  forces favoring more confrontation steadily gained advantage i think theres a lot to that  mcconnell said  when i described lees thesis  he had himself invoked the good old days of mansfields senate when he took over as majority leader in 2015  but most of the good old days that are referred to  he told me  are days of democratic dominance  with largely democratic outcomes  people only tend to get offended when conservatism rises and you start getting different outcomes mcconnell was elected to the senate in 1984  to the seat that had once been coopers  he was still struggling to distinguish himself midway through his first term when the democratic senators robert byrd of west virginia and david boren of oklahoma proposed a bill that would impose contribution and spending limits on political campaigns  mcconnell had briefly advocated for campaign finance reform at the outset of his career but soon reversed himself on the issue  eventually adopting a position that blended a constitutional free speech argument with a frank acknowledgment of practical expediency  i never would have been able to win my race  he later wrote of his first senate election  as a near unknown running in a majority democratic state  if there had been a limit on the amount of money i could raise and spend mcconnell proposed his own bill that would ban direct contributions from political action committees to congressional candidates  a deliberately limited reform that would give republicans cover to oppose the more sweeping changes byrd and boren were proposing  the democratic bill died in the face of republican opposition three months later for more than a decade  mcconnell fought one campaign finance bill after another  once the wisconsin democrat russ feingold and the arizona republican john mccain began their effort  in the mid 1990s  to pass the bipartisan legislation limiting the role of soft money in politics that now informally bears their name  mcconnell became the primary strategist in the fight against it  in which he had the tacit support of most of the republican senate conference  it was the formative legislative battle of his career ive rarely seen a more determined and skilled tactician  feingold told me  mcconnell was vilified by the major newspaper opinion pages and leaned into the role  becoming a regular presence on the sunday morning talk show circuit  when reform advocates started referring to him as darth vader  he appeared at a news conference with a toy light saber  when he was in the hospital in 2003  recovering from triple heart bypass surgery  feingold sent him a note that read  i miss my darth vader from the outset  mcconnell understood two essential aspects of the campaign finance reform debate  the first was that senators  certainly his republican colleagues and  more quietly  many democrats  were more interested in being seen as supporting campaign finance reform than actually enacting it  the second was that the popularity of the reform proposals among the public  while real  was also shallow  unlikely to factor in many constituents votes  for a junior senator like mcconnell  volunteering to play spear catcher  as he put it  on campaign finance was likely to cost him little more than bad press and earn him the gratitude of his caucus and political capital within it  i dont know whether they will ever build a monument to the senator from kentucky  mcconnells colleague phil gramm  the texas republican  later said in a floor speech  but he is already memorialized in my heart  i will never forget the fight he has made the campaign finance battle taught mcconnell the tactics that would make him a virtuoso obstructionist during the obama years  his point of view was that  first of all  were going to have to filibuster this  we dont have democrats who are going to help us  says steven law  the president and chief executive of the senate leadership fund super pac and a member of mcconnells staff at the time  and if at all possible  we need to hold every member of the caucus together  if theres any crack in it  it will give license for others to jump ship  mcconnell and law consulted senate parliamentarians on obscure procedural maneuvers that could expand mcconnells opportunities to block legislation with the filibuster  the ability of even a single senator to delay a vote as long as he or she can physically continue speaking on the senate floor  which he did in september 1994  killing a major campaign finance bill co sponsored by george mitchell  then the democratic majority leader tom foley  the democratic house speaker at the time  called it the worst case of obstruction by filibuster by any party that ive ever seen in my 30 years in congress  mitchell condemned mcconnell and his allies on the senate floor  the very people who want to keep this system which brings the institution of congress into such disrepute are trying to be the beneficiaries of that disrepute  he said  to tear down the institution so that we can inherit the rubble if theres any power in this job  really  mcconnell likes to say  its the power to schedule  to decide what youre going to do or not do  the converse of this  mcconnell learned even before becoming minority leader in 2007  is also true  the greatest leverage the minority has is the ability to complicate the schedule  drawing out deliberations can cripple the senate  which is in session for only 34 weeks or so each year  most of which  in practice  are only four working days the bluntest instrument senators in the minority have to wield to this end is the filibuster or  more often  the threat of it  to measure this kind of obstruction  political scientists often use cloture filings  which are the formal procedures for cutting off senate debate to end or preclude a filibuster  when people try to quantify mcconnells influence as minority leader in the obama years  when his command of obstructive techniques made him arguably the most important republican in washington  they often point to the spike in cloture filings  the number of such filings  which had gradually crept upward beginning in the 1970s  jumped significantly in mcconnells first congress as minority leader in 2007 and 2008  to 112  nearly twice the highest previous number  they remained historically high throughout obamas first term and then nearly doubled again by the end of 2014 but mcconnell also slowed down the process in more subtle ways  particularly in his yearlong effort to derail the affordable care act  which made him once again the public face of a particularly unapologetic form of republican intransigence  he said  our strategy is to delay this sucker as long as we possibly can  and the longer we delay it the worse the president looks  why cant he get it done  hes got 60 votes  bob bennett  the late utah republican senator and a friend of mcconnells  said in alec macgilliss 2014 mcconnell biography  the cynic  senate committee democrats would negotiate policy particulars for months with their republican colleagues only to see the republicans votes evaporate at the end of the process  mcconnells staff  meanwhile  battered the bill relentlessly in public  publicizing the sweetheart accommodations democratic senators were receiving for their votes  by the time obamacare passed in march 2010  according to a cnn poll  only 39 percent of the country viewed it favorably  and mcconnell had mostly run out the clock  there were less than eight months left  by then  until the midterm elections in which republicans would take the house legislation is one of the senates core responsibilities  the other is confirming executive branch appointments  such as administration officials and judges  by custom  the senate had previously approved district court judge nominations in groups  in the interest of efficiency  under mcconnells leadership  republicans insisted on confirming obamas nominations individually  drawing out the process enough that  by the summer of 2010  there were 99 vacancies on the federal bench and 40 judicial emergencies had been declared by overburdened courts when senate republicans are blamed for obstruction  they are quick to point out that democrats  when they were in the minority during most of george w  bushs presidency  filibustered judicial nominees  too  less frequently than mcconnell  but often enough that republicans had considered the nuclear option  getting rid of the filibuster for judicial matters  which would allow judges to be confirmed on a simple majority vote  but as mcconnell escalated the use of filibusters  it was harry reid  then the majority leader  who finally decided to get rid of them for lower court appointees in 2013 mcconnell was furious  facing reid on the senate floor  he declared that our friend the majority leader is going to be remembered as the worst leader here ever  mcconnell used other procedural moves to gum up obamas subsequent executive nominations  and by august 2014  the backlog stretched to more than 100 appointees  after mcconnell became majority leader  following that novembers elections  judicial nominations all but ground to a halt  with mcconnell confirming barely a quarter of obamas court picks  i believe that mitch mcconnell has ruined the senate  reid  who retired in 2017  now says  i do not believe the senate  for the next generation or two  will be the senate i was there for  its gone  the old senate is gone theyve always sort of made the argument that somehow i started all this  mcconnell told me  we didnt  still  when mcconnell inveighs now against schumers efforts to block trumps executive branch appointments  it is with the barely suppressed pride of an artist looking upon what seems to him a pale imitation of his finest work  far be it from me to complain about obstruction  he told me  permitting himself a chuckle  but generally  when ive been involved in obstruction  there was a point to it on jan  30  2016  mcconnell was at the capital hilton  attending the alfalfa clubs annual dinner  when he found himself sitting next to anthony kennedy  the supreme court justice  we were talking about collegiality  mcconnell recalls  i always say  to students in particular  i know you all think we all hate each other  but we havent had a single incident where a congressman from south carolina came over to the senate and almost beat to death a senator from massachusetts  an allusion to the infamous may 1856 episode in which the pro slavery democratic congressman preston brooks stormed across the capitol and badly beat charles sumner  an abolitionist republican senator  with a walking cane  a nation dividing scandal that presaged the civil war as it happened  kennedy had just been reading the caning  stephen puleos 2012 book about the incident  the following week  he sent a copy to mcconnell  with a letter enclosed  there are times  kennedy wrote in the letter  when an isolated episode is a portent of an event which will change the course of history  in this case  that episode took place on the floor of the senate a week and a half later  kennedys colleague antonin scalia was on a quail hunting trip in texas when he died in his sleep  very sad about losing nino  as im sure you are  mcconnell later wrote back to kennedy  news of scalias death first reached him on his iphone at the airport in st  thomas  in the virgin islands  where he and chao had just begun a vacation  at the hotel  chao recalls  mcconnell sat quietly and watched the news on the tv  within an hour  he had come to a decision  he would use his power as majority leader to block president obama from filling scalias seat a flurry of phone calls ensued  leonard leo  of the federalist society  whose advice on judicial matters wields unparalleled influence among republican politicians  told mcconnell that he was already hearing from some of the half dozen republican presidential candidates wondering what to say at the televised debate that night  josh holmes  a campaign strategist close to mcconnell  warned him that ted cruz  the senator from texas  was likely to seize the issue of blockading scalias seat in the debate  which he feared would make it harder to rally support for the idea  cruz is unpopular with many of his republican colleagues  including mcconnell  and if the first idea of it came from ted cruz  holmes told me  it was an assurance that you were going to lose half your conference about an hour after scalias death was confirmed  mcconnells office issued a statement  the american people should have a voice in the selection of their next supreme court justice  therefore  this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president  the decision was regarded  by mcconnells allies and enemies alike  as the summation of his lifes work  encapsulating what they most admire or despise about him  a final  crowning act of audacious obstruction  i felt that merrick garland deserved a hearing  a debate  a floor vote  and if republicans felt he should be voted down  they could do so  susan collins  the republican senator from maine  told me  but virtually every other republican senator supported the decision at the presidential debate that night  when the moderator  cbss john dickerson  raised the question of what should be done with the scalia seat  one candidate gave a curiously specific answer  we could have a diane sykes  or you could have a bill pryor  we have some fantastic people  donald trump said  these names were a pleasant surprise to conservative legal activists  who had long considered both sykes and pryor to be ideal choices for the supreme court  the names were less of a surprise to trumps campaign counsel  donald f  mcgahn ii  who spoke to trump earlier that day mcgahn was a specialist in election law  an expertise that had placed him on the same side of the previous decades campaign finance battles as mcconnell  even as mcconnell was fighting against mccain feingold on the senate floor  the senator was making contingency plans to continue his fight by other means if necessary  by the time the law passed  in 2002  he had already assembled a legal team to challenge it in the supreme court  when the court ruled against him late the following year  his attention shifted to the federal election commission  the government agency tasked with enforcing campaign finance laws  according to meredith mcgehee  a veteran campaign finance reform lobbyist who is now executive director of the bipartisan campaign finance reform advocacy group issue one  mcconnell understood pretty quickly  faster than other folks  that you can have the best laws on the books  but if theres no law enforcement  it doesnt matter the federal election commissions six commissioners  three republicans and three democrats  are typically picked by the senate party leaders  holmes  who was mcconnells chief of staff  told me that of all the government agencies for which mcconnell  as the senate republican leader  selected and vetted potential appointees  the one that i know of where mcconnell himself interviewed every single person was the f e c  when mcgahn  who  as general counsel for the national republican congressional committee  fought against mccain feingold  was nominated to the commission in 2008  mcgahn told me  mcconnell was very supportive every step of the way mcgahn proved to be a transformative figure at the commission  there had been other commissioners who were ideologically aligned with mcconnell  mcgehee said  but mcgahn was not just an ideologue  he was a skilled knife fighter  during mcgahns tenure  which ended in 2013  enforcement at the f e c  notably declined  according to an analysis by the center for public integrity  fines assessed by the f e c  fell to less than  1 million in 2012 from more than  6 7 million in 2006 when mcgahns services were recommended to trump by his deputy campaign manager  david bossie  it was ostensibly for his election law experience  but mcgahn  a dedicated member of the federalist society  saw another opportunity in the campaign  shortly after news of scalias death surfaced  trump called him on the phone to discuss what he should say at that nights debate  watching the candidate rattle off names he had given him earlier that day  mcgahn recalled in a speech at a federalist society dinner last year  was really the beginning of the idea of a list the list of federalist society approved judges that trump would consider appointing to the supreme court  which mcgahn and leo drafted  would be one of trumps principal selling points to conservatives and also to mcconnell  who had by then not only held open scalias supreme court seat  but also 88 district and 17 circuit court seats  in hopes that a republican president would be in office in 2017  leonard leo recalls speaking with mcconnell shortly before the senator met with trump in the spring on 2016  mcconnell  leo told me  said he was going to stress with him that the judges enterprise was extremely important from august onward  mcconnell and mcgahn talked periodically  the conversations were around judges  one of mcconnells senior staff members told me  how do we handle them  how do we prioritize them  beyond the supreme court  in the circuits  how do we get a number of them into the system early  and how can we start to process them early by that month  the central intelligence agency had discovered evidence that russia had interfered in the presidential campaign  apparently with the aim of disrupting hillary clintons candidacy  and had possibly made contact with representatives of the trump campaign  the agency approached congressional leaders to discuss the findings  according to denis mcdonough  obamas chief of staff at the time  harry reid urged the obama administration to go public with the information  but the administration  chary of appearing to politicize intelligence  refused to do so unless both congressional republican leaders consented  in early september  mcconnell and reid along with ryan and pelosi were briefed at the white house and asked by obama to issue a joint statement to state election officials ryan and his chief of staff at the time wrote and circulated a statement  we thought it was really a good sign that the speaker took the pen and drafted the statement  mcdonough told me  what happened then was  everybody signed off except senator mcconnell  mcconnell has said his concerns had to do with wording regarding election infrastructure  mcdonough says there were other substantial disagreements but declined to elaborate on what they were  ryan says he took mcconnells side in the dispute  the process of drafting the statement was drawn out for several weeks  to the consternation and frustration of everybody  to include the speaker of the house  mcdonough says  at the time  the speaker evinced to me considerable frustration on sept  28  all four congressional leaders released a letter warning state election officials of potential interference from foreign actors  which avoided specific mention of russias role  both ryan and mcconnell have said they were not asked to mention russia  several obama administration officials  however  including mcdonough and james r  clapper jr   obamas director of national intelligence  have retrospectively blamed mcconnell  and sometimes ryan  for watering down  as mcdonough put it in an nbc interview  the warning  to their everlasting shame  the leaders  mcconnell  ryan  refused to make more information public  james comey  the former f b i  director  said in an interview at the 92nd street y in december  i think theyre going to have a hard time explaining that to history when i repeated comeys statement to mcconnell  he bristled  well  the obama administration screwed up the election and then started pointing the finger at everybody else  he said  i reminded him that comey  like mcdonough and clapper  had blamed him very specifically  they were trying to blame everybody else but themselves  he said again  ryan and i did what we thought was appropriate on oct  7  2016  the department of homeland security and clappers office put out a joint statement  acknowledging for the first time that the intelligence community was confident that the russian government directed the recent compromises of emails from u s  persons and institutions  including from u s  political organizations  but within hours  the news was swamped by the publication by the washington post of a video of trump on the set of access hollywood  in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women  after the tape was released  ryan released a statement saying he was sickened by trumps comments  canceled a campaign appearance with him and told his fellow republican house candidates on a conference call that he would no longer defend trump but mcconnell hesitated  i talked to him at the time  holmes  the strategist  told me  and he said  do you see any evidence that it would make any difference for candidates to distance themselves  mcconnell called several members of his caucus who were in tight re election races  among them roy blunt of missouri  i said  look  im doing all kinds of events today  blunt recalls  im not hearing that voters  at least who speak to me  are willing to abandon our nominee over this clip  so im sticking right where i am mcconnell put out a statement saying these comments are repugnant  and unacceptable in any circumstance and calling on trump to apologize  but he did nothing to separate his partys senate candidates from trump  early in the campaign  the times reported  he had planned for a worst case scenario in which mcconnell and his senate candidates  colleagues recalled him saying at the time  would drop him like a hot rock  but in the last weeks of the campaign  he had come to think that severing red state candidates from the partys nominee could hurt them on election day he sat up that night at the national republican senatorial committee headquarters  watching the news  awaiting confirmation of what he imagined would be his fate  the end of a brief tenure in the majority leader perch he had worked so long to reach  i thought we were going to lose the senate  mcconnell told me  by 11 oclock  wed held the senate  and i thought  no chance trumps going to get it  no chance  and by 1 or 2 oclock in the morning  my god but however unexpected trumps victory might have been to mcconnell at the time  he has retrospectively  and plausibly  claimed credit for it  he was quick to point out that trump won nearly as many registered republicans as mitt romney did in 2012  and one exit poll showed that the single biggest issue bringing them home  he said  was the supreme court seat he had held open  it was a real masterstroke  in my opinion  to keep that seat open in 2016  tom cotton  the republican senator from arkansas  told me  i doubt donald trump would have won if that seat was not open the seat  which would be filled a year later by trumps nominee  neil gorsuch  would be the centerpiece of mcconnells broader court remaking project  a bridge from his obstructionist past to his next act  a day or two after the election  i was in the car with him  brian mcguire  at the time mcconnells chief of staff  told me  and he said  we are going to move judges like they are on a conveyor belt a week after the election  mcconnell called mcgahn to begin strategizing  they would centralize the judicial appointments process in mcgahns office  a departure from normal white house practice  it was really impressive to watch him in action  mcgahn said of mcconnell  his knowledge of the senate  its history and its role  it helped crystallize my thinking on the best approach to not just nominating but getting people confirmed mcconnell  who had kept so many of obamas nominations from the bench  was busy mapping out a strategy to avoid the fate he had so recently meted out  he would take advantage of harry reids decision to eliminate the filibuster for lower court judicial nominees and  when senate democrats tried to block neil gorsuchs appointment  would lead republicans in voting to extend it to the supreme court  mcconnell instructed chuck grassley  the chairman of the judiciary committee  that they were going to diminish the weight they assigned to blue slips  a procedural formality that allowed home state senators  even from the minority party  an opportunity to say whether or not a judicial nominee should receive a hearing on the judiciary committee  under recent committee chairpeople  this had been treated as an informal veto power  one that mcconnells republicans had used to great effect in the minority in the obama years  under the new interpretation  that would no longer be the case for circuit court judges  and mcconnell would prioritize judicial nominations before other kinds of nominations on the senate schedule and fill the more influential circuit courts first it was a sort of skunk works  running with the ostensible blessing of a president who only rarely seemed to remember that it was running at all  i think that years from now  people will look back and say that the transformation of the judicial branch was one of this administrations greatest achievements  marc short  who was trumps legislative director at the time  told me  but i candidly dont feel like thats still fully felt internally  trump and his high profile advisers  like stephen k  bannon  an avowed nemesis of mcconnell  whom he viewed as the personification of the republican establishment  preferred to speak of grand legislative visions  none of which would come to pass  a trillion dollar infrastructure bill  the repeal of obamacare and its replacement with something great  a government gutting budget  the long promised border wall when the republicans seven year crusade to dismantle obamacare effectively ran aground in the senate the following july  it was mcconnell whom trump blamed for the bills failure  after mcconnell  speaking at a rotary club event in kentucky  chided trump for his inexperience and high hopes  i think he had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process  mcconnell said  trump called him in a rage  then took to twitter  can you believe that mitch mcconnell  who has screamed repeal   replace for 7 years  couldnt get it done  a reporter asked trump that day if mcconnell should step down  if he doesnt get repeal and replace done  the president replied  and if he doesnt get taxes done  meaning cuts and reform  and if he doesnt get a very easy one to get done  infrastructure  if he doesnt get that done  then you can ask me that question the abuse continued intermittently throughout the senates august recess  in which mcconnell also criticized trumps statements in the wake of the charlottesville white supremacist rally  there are no good neo nazis  mcconnell said in a statement  finally  in october  mcconnell and trump sat down over lunch to clear the air  i was trying to remind him of the significance of some of the things that had been happening  mcconnell told me  because he was in a real downer over the loss of obamacare  and we all were  i understood that  but i think he was concluding  too soon  that it wasnt going to be a good congress mcconnell walked trump through the judicial appointments that he and mcgahn had been moving through the senate  as they were speaking  sarah huckabee sanders  trumps spokeswoman  came in to tell trump that he was due at a news conference in the rose garden the news conference marked trumps first acknowledgment of what mcconnell and mcgahn had been quietly doing for months  an achievement that seemed to just then dawn on him  something that people arent talking about is how many judges weve had approved  whether it be the court of appeals  circuit judges  whether it be district judges  trump said mcconnell seemed to realize something  too  that his spare communication style was not the best way of dealing with this particular president  he now speaks to trump several times a week  i think that one of the things that the leader has done a better job of over time  billy piper  mcconnells chief of staff until 2011  told me  is understanding that thats an important part of a positive relationship with the president  direct and frequent communications  so that the president  you know  is hearing directly whats going on and how his agendas being advanced  as opposed to getting it through third parties or news reports  he added  thats probably not mcconnells intuitive nature the day before the midterm elections  mcconnell spoke at a local republican party event in the rolling hill country on the periphery of bowling green  ky  he arrived dressed like a retiree on a birding cruise  a fleece vest over a plaid shirt  baggy jeans and brown suede rockports  he made his way to the front of the room  as ryan quarles  a former intern of mcconnells who is now the agriculture commissioner of kentucky  bounded onto the low stage and took the microphone  two years ago  this country changed  quarles said  and i have a question for you  are you better off than you were two years ago  standing on stage right  mcconnell  who was better off than he was two years ago  smiled almost imperceptibly  and as the crowd cheered  he allowed himself a couple of gentle golf claps you watched the mother of all fights last month  mcconnell told the crowd when it was his turn to speak  brett kavanaugh is going to be a great supreme court justice for a very long time  they tried everything in the book  but i think we proved two things  my friends  presumption of innocence still applies in america  and the republican senate is not going to be intimidated by an angry mob  mcconnell proceeded to offer a summary of his last two years in office  the judges appointed  the taxes cut  the regulations rolled back  it was only later  after rand paul  the other senator from kentucky  delivered a spirited tribute to the president  that i realized mcconnell had barely mentioned him  uttering the name trump just once in his nine minute speech its a statement of the obvious that donald trump and i are very different  he told me several weeks later  after the election  still  he said  i think weve both focused on the things we agree on and not some of our personality differences  he went on  when there have been policy areas that i think require some reinforcement  ive done it  for example  his skepticism about nato  and other issues  on a whole lot of other things that the president likes to talk about  i just choose not to engage in that  i dont think its my job to  again  im going to do everything i can to maximize chances of success during this opportunity weve been given  which comes to an end in a month  because  you know  when pelosi and i talked to each other  we were both kind of struggling to think of things we might work on together  he laughed  i mean  its just sort of not a natural thing the remaking of the judiciary is one of the few aspects of the republican agenda that is unlikely to be slowed down by novembers congressional elections  which gave the democrats a decisive majority in the house of representatives  but also expanded the republican majority that mcconnell leads in the senate by two seats  this means less time wasted on quixotic legislative efforts  like the obamacare repeal effort  and more time for appointments one of the bittersweet facts of the senate majority leaders job is that their legacies are rarely perceived by the broader public as their own  mike mansfield may have played a central role in negotiating the passage of the civil rights act  but most people who are not senate history buffs  that is  most people  remember it as lyndon johnsons triumph  harry reid may have seen the affordable care act through the senate  but nobody calls the law reidcare  mcconnells portrait no doubt will hang somewhere in the capitol  perhaps he will get his name on a room like mansfield  a balcony like bob dole  but for everyone outside the tribe of the senate  it is likely that when mcconnells remaking of the judiciary is remembered  he will be a figure off to the side  perhaps slightly out of focus  in a photograph of donald trump when i asked mcconnell how he felt about his legacy and trumps being so closely linked  he rejected the premise  i dont think so  he said  i think the most consequential call i made was before president trump came to office  i asked what he meant  the decision not to fill the scalia vacancy  he said  i think thats the most consequential thing ive ever done but what about the judicial appointments  i asked  surely those would be remembered as a partnership between him and trump well  thats fine  mcconnell said  because hes done what i thought ought to be done  judges  regulations  taxes  if marco rubio had been president  wed have done it  if jeb bush had been president  wed have done it  i say that not to take anything away from president trump  but he took good advice on all three of those areas that are  he slowed down for emphasis  traditional  republican  positions after the kavanaugh confirmation  christopher r  browning  the eminent historian of nazi germany  wrote an essay for the new york review of books revisiting the story of paul von hindenburg  the feckless german president of the weimar era  in an effort to shore up his faltering conservative coalition  and contain the german left  hindenburg allied with and installed as chancellor adolf hitler  a man he considered a lunatic but a manageable one  if the u s  has someone whom historians will look back on as the gravedigger of american democracy as von hindenburg was to the weimar republic  browning wrote  it is mitch mcconnell      like hitlers conservative allies  mcconnell and the republicans have prided themselves on the early returns on their investment in trump  it was the eternal pragmatists delusion  the assumption that politics ultimately belongs to them  and not to the demagogues and revolutionaries who so often pull them along in their wake i think to expect republican elected officials not to try to achieve as much as they possibly can  that theyve always been for  out of pique over presidential behavior  is nonsense  mcconnell said when i read him what browning had written  he got elected  and weve been able  as a result of that  to achieve things like tax reform  it had been sitting there undone for 30 years  weve discussed ad nauseam the courts  a lot of deregulatory activity that we think has contributed to a robust economy  so critics like that expect us all to just join them in a huff and do nothing  really  i think my responsibility as the majority leader of the senate  in a republican administration  is to achieve as much as i can for the american people along the lines that ive believed in my entire life that  of course  had been brownings point  setting aside the particulars of the comparison  i asked  do you ever worry that with the record of success that youve had  that youre strengthening the hand of a president who does seem  in some ways  very much inclined to do damage to institutions of american governance well  i mean  the ultimate check against any of this is the ballot box  mcconnell replied  and one could argue  at least with regard to the house of representatives last year  that there were plenty of people who wanted a midcourse correction  the results of the election did not seem to surprise him  the party has to be bigger than white men who didnt graduate from college  he told me late last year  and you look at what happened to the house of representatives  look at the suburbs  its no secret  its right there to look at  we were losing women  a chronic problem for the republican party  he acknowledged  and thats not a sustainable position  politically  if you want to be a competitive party it was a statement of gloom that  if you scratched off its outer layer  revealed a sort of sanguine optimism  a belief that the system was  ultimately  self correcting  whatever trump had unleashed in the republican party  its damages would be visited upon the party  not the country  and they would be temporary  the demagogues would burn themselves out  and the pragmatists would rebuild upon the ashes shortly after he left office in january  i asked paul ryan if he and mcconnell ever commiserated about having to deal with trump  ryan let out a long sigh  boy  i really want to answer that question  he said  george will  the washington post columnist  who has known mcconnell for decades  told me  he has never said anything in my hearing about mr  trump  it is  however  a safe inference that he knows he is dealing with a child  in his recent public speaking appearances  mcconnell has often recommended the soul of america  a book published last year by jon meacham  a tour of the political responses to social crises in american history and a reminder that periods of public dispiritedness are not new and a reassurance that they are survivable in one of our conversations  i brought up the book  what do you see as your role  the majority leaders role  in a time of crisis  i asked mcconnell well  mcconnell replied  i think what i have to do  my goal  and depending upon what the numbers are  and whats achievable  is always to get as right of center an outcome as possible  he brought up the example of the budget control act of 2011  which we had been discussing  a bill produced from a high stakes negotiation between the white house and congressional republicans in which mcconnell  breaking with newly elected tea party hard liners in the house  played deal maker  providing the democrats with bipartisan cover for a necessary debt limit increase while also securing cuts that republicans had sought i mean  at the risk of sounding like im patting myself on the back  who would have ever thought with barack obama in the white house you could get something like the budget control act in august of 2011  which actually drove down government spending for two years in a row  mcconnell said  to me  given the numbers  and if you prefer america right of center  thats my definition of success  i was startled not just by his frankness but by the type of crisis that mcconnells mind had gone to  which was not exactly the kind of worst case scenario that was foremost on many minds during trumps presidency later  i put the same question to paul ryan  what did he think his role  and mcconnells  was in a crisis  first of all  i think the countrys strong and is going to be fine  ryan said  sounding very much like the youth basketball coach he now is  reassuring the parent of a 12 year old who was lying at half court clutching his knee  and i think it is to preserve the institutions  the way i described it to my staff these last two years  when we had unified government  was  our job is to build the countrys resilience and its antibodies  so that it is stronger and better prepared for whatever comes its way  and then make sure that those institutional guardrails are upheld  mueller wasnt fired  there wasnt a constitutional crisis i noticed that ryan was speaking in the past tense now  as if this were already an era of american politics safely mothballed away in the closet of history  theres a lot of chatter  theres a lot of tweeting  theres a lot of all that  he went on  but institutionally  everythings fine  you know  we didnt impeach rod rosenstein  you know  we didnt do things like that  a lot of chatter about it  but the institutions are there  theyre standing does trump share your view  and mcconnells view  of institutions  i asked no  ryan said the day after the midterm elections  trump fired jeff sessions  the attorney general whose decision to recuse himself in the matter of appointing a special prosecutor to investigate russian involvement in the 2016 election had always infuriated him  the following day  the arizona republican senator jeff flake co sponsored a bill with chris coons  the democratic senator from delaware  protecting robert muellers investigation from presidential interference  mcconnell has repeatedly avowed his support for muellers investigation  but he refused to bring the bill up for a vote  and when i went to see him later that month  i asked him why its a futile gesture  he told me  which  in the tightly controlled vocabulary of mcconnells politics  is the gravest of insults  even if this bill were to pass the senate  he went on  it wouldnt pass the house  if it passed the house  it wouldnt be signed by the president  i dont have time for that kind of futile gesture  particularly when theres no threat  its not going to happen when i spoke with ryan  i asked if he and mcconnell had planned for a scenario in which trump decided to fire robert mueller yes  ryan replied unhesitatingly what was the plan  i asked ill just leave it at that  he said  did we discuss it  yes  we discussed it  yes  we were prepared if that actually would have happened  a minute later  he added  i can answer that with a question  has the guy been fired  no  hes continuing on  these were the proverbial adults in the room  they had this but the problem was that the adults kept leaving the room  on dec  20  james mattis  the defense secretary  quit after trump abruptly announced that he was pulling outthe 2 000 united states troops deployed in syria and 7 000 troops from afghanistan  my views on treating allies with respect and also being cleareyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held  he wrote to trump in his public resignation letter  because you have the right to have a secretary of defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects  i believe it is right for me to step down from my position interested in what mcconnell would have to say about this  i texted his press secretary  david popp  asking to speak with him that afternoon  popp wrote back to say it was unlikely  they were in the thick of negotiations to stave off the government shutdown that was then looming six days later  i got a phone call from a virginia area code  hello  said the voice on the other end  this is jim mattis  mitch mcconnell called and said youre interested in talking to me  what can i do for you mattis was genial and relaxed  distractingly so  given the circumstances  im just kind of hanging out  said the man who in three working days would be handing over the keys to the most lethal war making apparatus on the planet  on the orders of a president with whom he had voiced irreconcilable differences about americas place in the world  you know  doing the usual stuff i had a lot of questions for mattis  what was it about the syria and afghanistan withdrawals  among all of trumps foreign policy and national security decisions  that prompted his resignation  was he concerned about trump outsourcing the war in afghanistan to erik prince and blackwater  as trump had reportedly considered  id prefer not to talk about those  he said of the troop withdrawals  lets keep it focused on senator mcconnell and his leadership  which i  as you can tell  i leave washington deeply appreciative of what he did for our military and for our families  and for our strategy going forward i asked if  in his opinion  there was a divergence in foreign policy values between republicans in congress and the white house  well  id leave that for you to determine  he said  before allowing himself what seemed like a hint  certainly  when foreign ministers of defense or foreign leaders visited and they asked who they should talk with  i always spoke about leader mcconnell  because he could reassure them i had been told to expect the call  but still  as we spoke  i was preoccupied with the question of why it was occurring  i hadnt asked to speak with mattis  specifically  a couple of weeks earlier  i asked popp if there was anyone in the administration who might be able to shed light on mcconnells relationship with trump  the sort of request that usually yields a legislative affairs director  maybe a deputy chief of staff the weekend after mattis tendered his resignation  trump abruptly praised mcconnell on twitter  for only the second time that year and sixth time since becoming president  mitch mcconnell just told a group of people  and me  that he has been in the u s  senate for 32 years and the last two have been by far the best   most productive of his career  tax   regulation cuts  va choice  farm bill  criminal justice reform  judgeships   much more  great  and mcconnell  instead of pointing me to someone who would testify to his harmonious partnership with the president over these two best and most productive of years  had picked the man who had just entered an emphatic no confidence vote in trumps presidency and who was  at the moment  telling me about a hunting trip he took to wyoming a couple of years ago  that area from gillette  all the way across cody and over to jackson  god  i tell you  thats heaven on earth  isnt it  mattis said i agreed that it was all right  you take care  charlie  mattis said  ive got to run a few weeks later  popp texted me a cellphone number for john kelly  who until a week before had been trumps chief of staff  a retired marine corps general  kelly had been assumed to be  like mattis  a load bearing wall restraining the trump presidency from a collapse into truly dangerous chaos  and yet kelly testified unwaveringly to mcconnells close relationship with the president  he and the president spoke frequently  you know  on every topic you could imagine  he told me  they were compadres  so to speak why  i asked kelly  did he think that mcconnell had exclusively referred me to people  himself  mattis  don mcgahn  who were widely understood to be keeping trump in line  and were all  by now  gone from the administration  you know  i know you dont mean it this way  kelly replied  but you almost come across like it was some type of conspiracy  and it wasnt on jan  8  popp  emailing in advance of my last interview with mcconnell  sent me a couple of pages from the congressional record for april 18  1985  the leader wanted me to make sure you saw this before thursday  he wrote  it was mcconnells maiden floor speech  a celebrated rite of passage for new senators and an occasion that mcconnell had used to stand up to the policies of a popular president of his own party  speaking in support of a bill imposing sanctions on the apartheid government of south africa  which the reagan administration considered an ally i am a new member of the u s  senate  the worlds greatest deliberative body  and in my first few months here i have witnessed what the senate can do  when it wants to  the 43 year old mcconnell  practically a teenager by senate standards  began  he exhorted his colleagues to join in a unified effort to correct one of the most abhorrent and criminal examples of injustice evident in the world as much of a fan as all of us were of reagan  mcconnell told me two days later  i ended up actually voting for the bill and in favor of overriding his veto  the bill passed earlier in the conversation  i asked him whether  if a hypothetical shutdown ending compromise landed on his desk that would command a veto proof majority in both his senate and pelosis house  ending the standoff over the protests of trump but without need of his signature  he would bring it up for a vote  no  he said  what you need in order to make a law is the presidential signature  this was not entirely true  and in the coming days  some of his republican senate colleagues  growing weary of the shutdown  would begin hinting that he was not as powerless as he presented himself to be  its hard for one person to fix anything around here  lisa murkowski  the alaska senator  told politico  unless youre the president  or the speaker  or the majority leader  mcconnell  the master of using the senate to thwart presidential ambitions  had become his partys most prominent defender of the idea that this was impossible the apartheid speech  the mattis and kelly testimonials  the self portrait they suggested  of a man on the right side of a historical record that might judge the current president more harshly  was clear enough  even if mcconnell would not have permitted himself to describe it so directly  in one of our interviews  i had asked him about the statement he issued after charlottesville  a forceful denunciation of trumps words that carefully stopped short of criticizing trump himself by name  when i asked mcconnell why  he offered only a tautology  the way i expressed myself was the way i thought i ought to express myself  he has always wanted the mantle of principle but also the agenda  the question is whether his attempt to have both will be remembered as shrewd politics or as an act of moral compromise  or both the thing is  the apartheid speech he wanted me to know he had made  it was good  conservatives and liberals  republicans and democrats  can and should act in unison  mcconnell  standing for the first time at henry clays desk  the eyes of his new colleagues and history upon him  had said  and we should act now .
