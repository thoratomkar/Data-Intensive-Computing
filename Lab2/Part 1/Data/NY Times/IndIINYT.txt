washington  president trump said on friday that he withdrew his nominee to run immigration and customs enforcement because he wanted the agency to go in a tougher direction  a surprise decision before the presidents trip to the southwestern border ronald d  vitiello  who was nominated last summer by mr  trump to run ice  the agency that arrests  detains and deports people who are in the united states illegally  has been serving as the agencys acting director since last june  he had planned to accompany the president on his trip to california  but was left behind rons a good man  but were going in a tougher direction  mr  trump said to reporters as he left the white house en route to calexico  calif mr  vitiellos nomination had been awaiting approval by a second senate committee and confirmation by the full chamber  in an email to ice employees on friday afternoon  he signaled that he planned to remain at the immigration agency  no replacement has yet been named while i will not become the permanent director of ice  i look forward to working alongside you in serving the american public with integrity  courage and excellence  mr  vitiello said in the email  which was read to the new york times by an ice employee on the condition of anonymity one person familiar with the presidents thinking said that mr  trump believed that mr  vitiello did not favor closing the border  as the president had proposed before backing off that threat this week another person said that stephen miller  the presidents chief policy adviser and a supporter of curtailing legal and illegal immigration  did not support mr  vitiellos nomination  the two people familiar with the presidents thinking both spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the internal white house decisions the presidents abrupt decision came at a time when his administration considers the united states border with mexico to be in crisis because of the flow of people trying to get into the country  making it a priority to have a confirmed appointee leading the agency to carry out the administrations policies  but some senators  including republicans  had concerns that mr  vitiello was not the right person for this job mr  trump  who has continued to push for stronger deportation rules  had also expressed concern about whether a career civil servant  like mr  vitiello  would be up to the task  ice has been led by acting directors since january 2017 mr  vitiello had recently been more outspoken about overflowing immigration facilities and strapped resources at the border  but that did little to assuage the national ice council  a union representing agency employees  which in february told the senate it opposed mr  vitiellos nomination over what was described as his controversial posts on social media and his treatment of some ice agents the request to withdraw mr  vitiellos nomination surprised officials on the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee  even some department of homeland security officials questioned whether it was sent in error .
as thousands of families fleeing violence  poverty and oppression in central america arrive at the american border  the trump administration has responded by separating children and parents and cracking down on asylum claims a more humane  and effective  response would be to address the sources of the desperation that propelled these people north  president trump chose on monday to reaffirm his punitive bent  complaining about the exodus of migrants and saying he told the leaders of el salvador  guatemala and honduras  whose countries receive millions of dollars in annual aid  were not sending it anymore  but what if the united states truly prioritized helping these nations plagued by corruption  violence and gang terror  el salvador  guatemala and honduras need stronger and more honest judges and police officers  better schools and economic development  elites control much of the land and avoid taxes  even at some of the lowest tax rates in latin america  bribery is rampant  and too often leaders lack the interest  competence or will to manage such problems  over the years  the united states has contributed to instability by supporting autocrats in civil wars and tolerating corruption that has bred criminality  in 2017  washington recognized the results of the honduran presidential election days after the organization of american states called for new elections because of voting irregularities the united states has also invested in latin america for decades to promote democracy and economic and social development  but the trump administration has begun to place more emphasis on preventing illegal immigration  combating transnational crime and generating export and investment opportunities for u s  businesses  according to a report last month by the congressional research service  which does nonpartisan research for congress while the administration has tried to scale back aid  congress has resisted  appropriating  2 1 billion for the region from 2016 to 2018  roughly double what had previously been allocated results are mixed  while murder rates in el salvador  guatemala and honduras declined in 2018  they are still very high  fueled by the trafficking of 90 percent of the cocaine bound for the united states  economic growth has been steady since 2014  but poverty rates are relatively unchanged  while officials have pursued criminal cases involving presidents and other leaders  opposition from political and economic interests threatens to upend their work but there are reasons for hope  a 2014 study found that community based programs to reduce crime and violence in central america  run by the united states agency for international development  reported 19 percent fewer robberies and 51 percent fewer murders  other programs  also funded mainly through u s a i d  and the state department  help vet police officers  get them to work more closely with communities  identify youth prone to violence and work to change their behavior  prosecutors and judges are being given training and technical assistance on managing cases and gathering evidence  journalists  activists and civil society groups are being counseled in how to protect themselves from threats  other programs seek to make the civil service more professional  help subsistence farmers diversify their crops and increase yields and connect regional electric grids  eradicating gangs  which drive much of the northward migration  is especially difficult  the international crisis group has warned that mass deportations from the united states risk fueling gang violence unless accompanied by serious economic investment in impoverished communities  just subjecting gang members to harsh prisons and branding them terrorists has backfired  the group said in the end  it is central american leaders who must carry out reforms  they are more apt to do that with international support  but america can slow the exodus of the desperate by investing in democracy  judicial reform and economic growth  so far  mr  trump has shown little interest .

when federal immigration agents carried out a workplace raid at an electronics repair company in texas this week  they handed out color coded bracelets  people whom they deemed authorized to work in the united states received green wristbands  those suspected of being undocumented wore yellow it was an emotional scene punctuated by the arrests of more than 280 employees who were detained on immigration violations  the biggest single workplace sweep since 2008  officials said  and the largest since president trump took office with a pledge to crack down on illegal immigration the operation on wednesday in allen  a suburb of dallas  evoked strong reactions  as families rushed to the site of the raid  protesters gathered outside an immigrations and customs enforcement office in dallas  and immigrant advocacy groups condemned the operation for throwing families lives into turmoil in a matter of hours the employees arrested  who were predominantly women  hailed from 15 countries  including el salvador  honduras  mexico  nigeria and venezuela  according to ice  the agency said more than half of the workers had been released with orders to appear before a federal immigration judge  but 110 people remained in custody as of thursday katrina w  berger  who leads the agencys homeland security investigations unit in dallas  said its focus was on a criminal investigation into the company  cve technology group  but she said the authorities could not turn a blind eye to the unauthorized workers who were found there the authorities executed a criminal search warrant at the company  which refurbishes and repairs cellphones and other technology equipment  after getting many tips that the business was hiring workers who were using fraudulent documents  ms  berger said businesses that knowingly hire illegal aliens create an unfair advantage over their competing businesses  ms  berger said at a news conference after the raid  they take jobs away from u s  citizens and legal residents  and they create an atmosphere poised for exploiting an illegal work force by thursday  frantic families were seeking help from raices  a texas based organization that offers free and low cost legal services to immigrants and refugees  said felix villalobos  a lawyer in the organizations dallas office  he said the group had been inundated with requests  as many employees remained detained united we dream texas  an organization led by young immigrants  condemned ice in a statement for targeting black and brown immigrant workers  within hours  the lives of hundreds have spiraled into turmoil and anxiety  the group said  these workers are now in the hands of an agency that is abusive and negligent towards the physical and mental well being of the people they target in an email on thursday  edward cho  the chief executive of cve technology group  said the company has a strong history of complying with federal immigration and employment laws we are cooperating with the authorities and intend to continue doing so  he said  we are also focused on providing support to impacted employees and their families  for whom this is a profoundly upsetting development workplace raids have become more common under mr  trump  whose strict enforcement agenda has pushed the population of detained immigrants to the highest levels in history  homeland security investigations opened about 6 850 workplace investigations last year  a jump from about 1 700 the year before  officials also made nearly 800 criminal arrests  up from about 140 in 2017  according to figures released by ice in december the operations recall the high profile immigration raids that made headlines during the presidency of george w  bush  one of the biggest workplace raids  in may 2008  resulted in the detention of nearly 400 undocumented immigrants  including several children  at an iowa meatpacking plant the obama administration took a more hands off approach to enforcement  auditing employers compliance in documenting their workers status without conducting many on site investigations about eight million of the nearly 11 million immigrants unlawfully in the united states participate in the labor force  they account for about 5 percent of all workers  according to the pew research center experts say that workplace raids primarily serve as a deterrent for employees  dissuading workers who are in the country illegally from showing up at their jobs and warning prospective undocumented immigrants that  even if they make it across the border  they may be captured at work while the raids may also make employers think twice  it has traditionally been difficult for the government to take criminal action against businesses that hire unauthorized immigrants a handful of employers faced prominent criminal cases in recent years  last year  after federal agents rounded up about 100 workers at a meatpacking plant in tennessee  the owner of the company pleaded guilty in federal court to fraud and employing unauthorized immigrants but many companies avoid serious charges because it is often impossible to prove that they knew someone was unauthorized to work kathleen campbell walker  who is on the board of the american immigration lawyers association  said unauthorized immigrants seeking work may present fake documents  and it is up to employers to verify that the paperwork is legitimate in some cases  she said  businesses are hiring and recruiting undocumented workers to try to cut costs and stay competitive  but there are other situations in which businesses dont properly assess the documents  or get fooled by realistic fakes  many employers dont have a clue to be able to spot something that is fake  she said the law requires only that employers ensure that documents appear to be valid  and federal law prohibits them from requiring specific types of identification from workers the standard is  to a reasonable employer  on their face  do they appear to be valid  ms  campbell walker said immigration officials said cve technology group had knowingly hired unauthorized immigrants  after an audit earlier this year found numerous hiring irregularities  officials executed a criminal search warrant on wednesday the vast and complex operation involved more than 200 law enforcement officials who arrested people suspected of being undocumented while also working to identify the sole caregivers of children and others who should be released quickly on humanitarian grounds  ms  berger said mr  villalobos of raices said his group was working to independently confirm what had happened and to quell a panic that was rippling among immigrants locally and beyond  even if they live nowhere near that city  he said  an operation like this can scare families into changing their habits  including their driving patterns the families who rushed to the site of the raid on wednesday were pretty emotional  he said  some were left waiting for hours or more for their loved ones to be released one man told a local television station  wfaa  that his fiance had been detained  they were planning to get married in may  he said  but he feared she now would face deportation .

the last government shutdown ended because democrats stood firm against president trumps border wall  but funding will soon run out again  talks between democrats and republicans are in crisis  and mr  trump remains committed  the wall will get built one way or the other  he tweeted on saturday the senates minority leader  chuck schumer  has made it clear that mr  trump wont get his way  democrats are against the wall  house speaker nancy pelosi  who has admirably enforced party discipline  has called the wall immoral yet at the same time  ms  pelosi has emphasized that democrats are committed to border security  she has critiqued the wall on the narrow grounds that government should instead employ evidence based knowledge about how we best secure our border  james clyburn  the majority whip  fleshed out what that might look like  a smart wall  including more border patrol agents  this  too  is immoral its also bad politics  democrats should follow their voters  who increasingly want more open borders  and reframe the immigration debate by rejecting the very notion that the border needs more security and making it clear that the real problem is the denial of migrants rights  the time has come for the democratic party to push for concrete policies to make the border more open there is plainly no need for more security on the border  illegal entries to the united states  as measured by border patrol apprehensions  which the government has long used as a proxy  began to fall at the turn of the century  and have plummeted since 2006  they remain at historic lows today  those who are coming to the country are often central americans fleeing violence that united states policy in the region helped foment and when it comes to drugs  a favorite justification of mr  trumps for his wall  evidence shows that more border security does not stop trafficking  from the 1970s on  every crackdown on a drug smuggling route  whether it was heroin via the french connection or cocaine through the caribbean  has only led to new innovations in the trade that have empowered murderous mexican cartels  some scholars even argue that the rise of fentanyl can be traced to drug interdiction then why  if there isnt truly a crisis on the border  do the democrats continue to invoke the need for more border security  largely because the conversation about the border and immigration has moved so far to the right over the past 30 years  as the linguist george lakoff and sam ferguson  his student at the time  wrote more than a decade ago  the narrow framing of the immigration debate has shaped its politics  defining what count as problems and  as a result  constrains the solutions needed to address that problem  when the problem is defined as illegal immigration  it becomes about the illegal act of crossing the border without papers  and so the logical response to the wave of illegal immigration becomes border security since bill clintons presidency  the border patrol has grown from 4 100 agents in fiscal year 1992 to more than 19 000 today  the united states has built hundreds of miles of border fencing since the 2006 secure fence act  which barack obama  joe biden and hillary clinton voted for  well  i voted for border security  and some of it was a fence  mrs  clinton feebly said in 2016 when pressed about the 2006 vote that within a decade had become controversial democrats have for far too long let their political opponents define the terms of debate  now theyre doing it again  house democrats proposal heading into the negotiations with republicans didnt include funding for new physical barriers or additional border patrol agents  but it did offer significantly increased funding for border security technology thats not only bad for immigrants who  as a result of militarized borders are more likely to be kidnapped  violently assaulted and driven to cross via the lethal desert  its also bad for democrats  who are handing ammunition to the nativist right at a time when republicans are on the back foot and polls show that democratic voters are moving decidedly leftward on immigration and the border  sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  voters used to overwhelmingly favor less immigration  but opinions have changed fast amid an immigrant rights movement that took off in 2006 and partisan polarization driven by aggressive enforcement  in 1994  just 32 percent of democrats and democratic leaning americans and 30 percent of republicans agreed that immigrants strengthened the country  according to the pew research center  but by 2016  the share of democrats who said so had skyrocketed to 78 percent  in 2006  37 percent of democrats said that immigration levels should be decreased  while only 20 percent said that it should be increased  in 2018  40 percent said that it should be increased  with just 16 percent calling for restriction  the same trend has held on border politics  in 2010  47 percent of democrats said that they equally prioritized legalizing undocumented immigrants and better border security and stronger enforcement of immigration laws  while just 29 percent prioritized legalization alone  by 2018  the number prioritizing legalization alone skyrocketed to 51 percent under president trump  polarization has accelerated  and thats a good thing  the vanishing bipartisan consensus orchestrated mammoth deportations and militarized the border in the quixotic hope of placating the nativist right and winning it over to supporting immigration reform  this strategy only inflamed the rights paranoiac ravings and helped move the goal posts to new extremes  which is why we find ourselves  in 2019  with the possibility of beginning a second government shutdown over the wall so  what should the democrats pursue instead  a break with a failed bipartisan consensus representatives alexandria ocasio cortez  ilhan omar  ayanna pressley and rashida tlaib  all democrats who are new to the house  have drafted a letter urging opposition to any deal that increases department of homeland security funding in any form  thats a good start the border must be demilitarized  which would include demolishing the already existing wall and dramatically downsizing the border patrol  criminal sanctions on illegal entry and re entry must be repealed  opportunities for legal immigration  particularly from mexico and central america  must be expanded  the right to asylum must be honored  and citizenship for those who reside here must be a stand alone cause  unencumbered by compromises that are not only distasteful but also politically ineffectual  and that today would provoke opposition from the nativist right and the grass roots left  if democrats stick to the center on immigration  they will find themselves fighting on two fronts  a fight against republicans  with the left at their back  will be far easier to win  and a more noble victory simple realism dictates that no legislation to grant citizenship to the millions of undocumented americans who deserve it will be passed until the republicans are defeated  theres no use trying to appease them  the bipartisan consensus supporting harsh immigration and border enforcement has fractured  democratic elected officials need to catch up .

the trump organization said late tuesday that it was implementing a system to weed out undocumented immigrants who try to get jobs at its properties  the move followed reports in the new york times last month that the presidents company was employing people at its flagship golf club in new jersey who are in the country illegally we are actively engaged in uniforming this process across our properties and will institute e verify at any property not currently utilizing this system  eric trump  an executive vice president of the company  said in a statement  as a company we take this obligation very seriously and when faced with a situation in which an employee has presented false and fraudulent documentation  we will take appropriate action thousands of employers have enrolled voluntarily in the governments e verify electronic system  which checks documents provided by new hires against social security administration and department of homeland security records  a mismatch suggests that the person is unauthorized to work all federal contractors must use e verify  and 22 states require at least some private and public employers to do so  the federal e verify database suggested that the trump organization did not use heightened employment document verification procedures at several of its properties  meaning that the chances of employing undocumented workers was high the new york times reported in december that undocumented immigrants had been employed for years at the trump national golf club in bedminster  n j   as housekeepers  landscapers and kitchen staff they were kept on the payroll despite the fact that management was aware that they had used phony documents to secure employment  as is common among undocumented immigrants victorina morales  an undocumented immigrant from guatemala  said that a manager at bedminster helped her secure a new fake social security number and legal permanent residency card after telling her that those on file had expired since the articles were published  about a dozen workers deemed ineligible to work in the united states because they lacked legal immigration status have been terminated at the bedminster club  according to people familiar with the matter another dozen were fired at the trump national golf club in westchester earlier this month  a development first reported by the washington post i must say  for me personally  this whole thing is truly heartbreaking  mr  trump said in the statement on tuesday  our employees are like family but when presented with fake documents  an employer has little choice he said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the trump organization  and that it demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately the trump organization said last month that it would immediately terminate those who were not authorized to work in the united states  but for several weeks it failed to respond to questions about what measures it was taking to rectify the situation president trump has made border security and protecting jobs for americans cornerstones of his presidency  from the border wall he has pledged to build  it recently resulted in the partial government shutdown  to the workplace raids and payroll audits that his administration has carried out mr  trump launched his bid for the g o p  presidential nomination in june 2015  declaring that the united states had become a dumping ground for everybody elses problems  mexico was sending people to commit crimes and bring drugs  theyre rapists  and some  i assume  are good people  he said in a speech in arizona shortly after  he deemed illegal immigration a major  major problem in this country  vowing to erect a wall along the southwest border in august 2015  mr  trump told the times that his companies employed only people with legal work papers when the trump international hotel opened for business in washington  the president boasted that he had used e verify to ensure that only those legally entitled to work were hired we didnt have one illegal immigrant on the job  mr  trump said then about 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the united states and about eight million of them are in the labor force  according to the pew research center  a nonpartisan think tank  it is an open secret that many businesses  especially in the service sector  employ them to deter illegal hiring  immigration and customs enforcement conducts audits of businesses  having slapped tens of millions of dollars in administrative and criminal penalties on those found to employ undocumented workers since the early 2000s  these inspections have intensified under the trump administration from oct  1  2017  through july 20  2018  ice opened 6 093 work site investigations and made 675 criminal and 984 administrative work site related arrests  several times more than in the entire 2017 fiscal year from oct  1  2016 to sept  30  2017 employers who use e verify contend that they struggle to attract enough workers to perform menial  physically onerous jobs  the vast majority of businesses simply require applicants to fill out a federal form  the i 9  and present identification and social security card  which they assume are genuine .
president trumps family business has employed undocumented workers more broadly than it was previously believed  with multiple workers losing their jobs last month at a trump golf club in southern new jersey the club in pine hill  n j   known as the trump national golf club philadelphia  was the third trump property where undocumented workers have been fired since the new york times reported in december that the trump club in bedminster  n j   for years employed immigrants who were in the country unlawfully the presidents company terminated about a dozen undocumented workers at the bedminster property after the article was published  as well as a dozen workers at the trump national golf club westchester  in briarcliff manor  n y people familiar with the terminations at pine hill said that about five workers at that property were fired or told not to report to work again  including two seasonal employees who were not scheduled to work until the spring  one of the people familiar with the matter said that many other seasonal workers expected to be told not to return in the coming weeks the revelations about the undocumented workers has been an embarrassment for the trump organization  coming to light as mr  trump has railed against illegal immigration  blamed undocumented immigrants for crime and pledged to build a wall along the mexican border to keep more people from entering the country unlawfully the company has said it was duped by employees who used false identification to get their jobs  but some of the workers in bedminster told the times they were kept on the payroll despite the fact that management was aware of the false documents a spokesperson for the company declined to comment on friday the workers at the pine hill property said their terminations  which occurred in january  came abruptly just like that  i got fired  said victor reyes  who is from mexico and worked in the kitchen alongside the chef the manager called me and asked  victor  are you legal  i said  no  i am not legal  it surprised me because i knew he knew that i was illegal  i have worked for him 16 years and then he asks me  said mr  reyes  who added that it was his first job since crossing the border mr  reyes had worked up from a dishwasher to grilling steaks and preparing a la carte orders  he said  and acquired many cooking skills along the way the firings at the pine hill golf club were the result of a broader audit that the trump organization is conducting at its properties across the country  according to people briefed on the review  although the organization has conducted similar reviews in prior years  this is the largest effort yet to ensure that the companys employees are authorized to work in the country the review has presented yet another legal and public relations headache for company executives who are trying to contain the fallout from the revelations  it comes as the trump organization is facing wider scrutiny from congressional democrats examining the companys business practices at this point in the review  the issues appear to have been largely concentrated in the bedminster and westchester golf clubs  the people said  though the discovery of undocumented workers at the southern new jersey property show that the matter is more widespread than initially believed  the terminations at the westchester club were first reported by the washington post the trump organization announced on tuesday that it was using a system  known as e verify  to prevent undocumented workers from getting jobs at its properties  for the last several years  the company had utilized that system in many of its hotel properties  though it did not adopt it at most of the golf courses i must say  for me personally  this whole thing is truly heartbreaking  eric trump  an executive vice president with the trump organization  said in a statement on tuesday  our employees are like family  but when presented with fake documents  an employer has little choice he said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the trump organization  and that it demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately about eight million undocumented workers participate in the united states labor force  and it is an open secret that they use fake documents to get hired  typically made up social security numbers and permanent residency cards the pine hill club has an 18 hole golf course surrounded by maple and pine trees on 365 acres  members enjoy putting greens and a 43 000 square foot clubhouse where weddings and other events take place  sitting atop a hill  it boasts a view of the philadelphia skyline the golf club employs 100 to 200 people  many of them in seasonal jobs  immigrants employed there were charged with watering  mowing and manicuring the greens  the upkeep of the banquet hall  which has a 300 person capacity  and preparing food in the clubs restaurant because the workers do not have lawyers and remain in the country illegally  two of those who described the firings  as well as their family members  declined to be named workers said that those who were terminated were summoned to a meeting with eric quinn  the general manager  and a human resources executive who they believed was from the trump organization  each was told that their documents did not pass inspection after an audit and that they should leave the premises immediately  leaving some of the workers who lacked drivers licenses to scramble to find rides home people were getting fired on the spot  no warning  no nothing  no time to find a job  said one worker  who declined to be named the worker said that the immigrants had been treated well by the clubs management and that some of them had broken down when they were fired  its not easy to find a job if you dont have papers  after you worked there  the worker said  the general manager  according to several accounts  was said to have lamented the terminations executives at the pine hill club declined to comment the problem of undocumented workers at trump properties came to light in december  when the times wrote about victorina morales of guatemala  a housekeeper at the bedminster property who made the presidents bed  washed his clothes and dusted his golf trophies for five years  after mr  trump was elected  a manager told her that her fake documents had expired and helped her acquire new ones ms  morales said that on the advice of her lawyer  she stopped going to work on dec  4  two days before the times article was published  the lawyer  anibal romero  has said that neither he nor his client had been notified that she was fired  and that her employment status was not clear ms  morales  who is protected from deportation because she applied for asylum  was invited by her democratic congresswoman  bonnie watson coleman  to attend the state of the union address on tuesday  also attending will be sandra diaz  a native of costa rica and a legal resident of the united states who said she was undocumented when she worked at the trump resort  she will be the guest of representative jimmy gomez  a california democrat another undocumented worker  emma torres  told the times that someone in human resources at the bedminster club had removed her name and other undocumented workers names from a list of employees submitted to the secret service in 2017  ms  torres quit shortly after on her own volition at pine hill  mr  reyes said that he was treated well by mr  quinn  the general manager  and expressed gratitude for the opportunity to grow professionally during his years at the golf club  where his hard work was recognized  he said  over the years  on the job his repertoire of dishes grew and he learned english i had too many raises  said the immigrant from puebla  who said that he earned  18 an hour  the money enabled him to pay his rent and send money to his family back in mexico he received his first bonus in all his years working at the club  he said  in late december  in hindsight  mr  reyes wonders whether that was because management knew that he would not be welcome back after the winter hiatus now  he said  he is seething with a sense of betrayal i loved my job  i learned to cook everything  they helped me grow  he said  erupting in tears  now i feel bad  i dont trust nobody mr  trump  who during his campaign called mexicans rapists and criminals  has made border security and protecting jobs for americans cornerstones of his presidency  his commitment to erecting a border wall resulted in the recent partial government shutdown he has deemed illegal immigration a major  major problem  and his administration has intensified workplace raids and payroll audits at companies suspected of employing undocumented workers .
washington  the trump administration plans to aggressively push for tougher screening of asylum seekers that will make it vastly more difficult for migrants fleeing persecution in their home countries to win protection in the united states  a senior administration official told reporters on tuesday the official said that president trump ordered a shake up of his top immigration officials in recent days because they were moving too slowly  or even actively obstructing  the presidents desire to confront the surge of migrants at the southwestern border  the asylum changes are among many policies the president wants to put into effect with a new team in place  the official said mr  trump denied on tuesday that one of those changes would be to restart his policy of separating migrant families at the border  though he said that the act of taking children from their parents  which drew global condemnation before he abandoned it last summer  was effective now ill tell you something  once you dont have it  thats why you see many more people coming  mr  trump said  they are coming like its a picnic  because  lets go to disneyland the administration official  who spoke on the condition of anonymity even as mr  trump was making his remarks  said a modified version of family separation  in which parents are given a choice of whether to be separated or to accept indefinite detention alongside their children  continues to be under consideration but the so called binary choice proposal is not ripe for white house consideration right now  he insisted  because the government does not currently have the detention space to hold families if the policy were put in place the asylum changes being envisioned could drastically alter the role that the united states plays as a refuge for people fleeing poverty  violence and war  american and international laws require it to allow migrants to request asylum once they come to the country but the official said that an initial assessment of the basis for a request for asylum  known as a credible fear screening  too often accepts the claim that the migrant was persecuted  the official also said that many more asylum seekers should be rejected during that first step out of 97 728 completed interviews with migrants in the fiscal year that ended on sept  30  2018  the united states citizenship and immigration services confirmed a credible fear of persecution 74 677 times  according to an agency official changes in the screening process could drastically lower those findings by requiring more proof from asylum seekers that they would be persecuted in their home countries  screeners could also try to verify migrant claims by using state department assessments of the threats that exist in those countries immigrant rights advocates have feared for months that the administration would try to change the standards by which asylum seekers are judged in an effort to prevent more of them from coming into the united states the administration official blamed the delay in that effort on deep state bureaucrats at the department of homeland security and even the presidents own political appointees in the department  whom the official described as lacking the management skills to push mr  trumps agenda the official declined to name specific administration officials who have failed  but he made thinly veiled references to two top officials at the department of homeland security  john mitnick  the departments general counsel  and l  francis cissna  the head of united states citizenship and immigration services he said there was clearly a track record in which the presidents policies have not been advanced in his remarks on tuesday  mr  trump falsely said that president barack obama had embraced the same policy of routinely separating migrant children from their parents at the border president obama had child separation  mr  trump said during brief remarks in the oval office  where he was meeting with president abdel fattah el sisi of egypt  im the one that stopped it under mr  obama and president george w  bush  immigration officials sometimes separated families when they had reason to question parentage or when there was evidence of child abuse  the trump administration instituted a policy in which all families who crossed the border illegally were separated in order to allow the parents to be prosecuted under the administrations zero tolerance policy  more than 2 700 children were separated from their parents at the border before mr  trump ended the policy in june 2018  fact check  family separation at the border the presidents comments come after he shook up the senior ranks of the department of homeland security  forcing the resignation of the secretary  kirstjen nielsen  and top immigration officials in a move that signaled a pending shift in immigration policies also on tuesday  the acting deputy secretary of homeland security  claire grady  who was next in line by law to become the acting secretary  submitted her resignation  according to a twitter post by ms  nielsen  ms  gradys resignation paves the way for kevin mcaleenan  the commissioner of customs and border protection  to take the role customs and border protection officials this week underscored mr  trumps concern about illegal immigration by announcing that more than 103 000 migrants crossed the southwestern border in march without authorization  an increase from the more than 76 000 migrants who crossed in february just last month  we saw record numbers of family units and unaccompanied juvenile apprehensions in february  and unfortunately  march apprehension numbers are again record setting and cause dire concerns for us  said brian hastings  the chief of law enforcement operations for the border patrol most of the migrants  92 000 of the 103 000  were apprehended by border patrol agents  meaning they crossed in between the ports of entry more than 53 000 of those migrants were members of a family  mr  hastings said  and most of those families were from honduras  guatemala or el salvador in the first half of fiscal year 2019  border patrol agents apprehended more than 385 000 migrants on the border  more than double those apprehended during the same time last year mr  hastings said the border patrol can generally maintain 4 500 people in its custody  but it recently counted 13 000 migrants in its facilities  and he said the overflow has led to the release of families into cities along the border backups have resulted in individuals spending additional time in border patrol custody in increasingly crowded conditions  mr  hastings said on tuesday  white house officials announced that the president would appeal a judges ruling that blocked the administrations migrant protection protocols  which require some asylum seekers to remain in mexico while they wait for their court cases mr  trump has recently commended mexico for doing more to stem migration to the border  but the officials said they have not seen any effect on the number of people crossing it  the numbers arent declining  in fact  were still seeing 3 000 apprehensions per day  mr  hastings said officials also revealed that among the tens of thousands of family members approaching the border each month  just 3 100 people who said they were traveling with relatives were found to have a fraudulent claim  those people either said they had a child when the individual was over 18 or the groups members were not really related .
las cruces  n m   in a vast congressional district of fluted mountain ranges  chile crops and oil and gas wells on the countrys southern border  new mexico democrats in november broke the republican hold on a house seat that had endured for 37 years  except for a two year break xochitl torres small  a 34 year old water rights lawyer  won by carefully calibrating her message as a problem solver  like several other moderate democrats who flipped house seats nationwide last year  though the region is 55 percent hispanic  she did not harp on president trumps border wall or his incitement of fears of immigrants bringing crime and drugs she did not need to in new mexico  we experience the positions of this president a little more intimately than a lot of people  said jeff steinborn  a democratic state lawmaker from las cruces  the race baiting  divisive border politics has a very human face in our community as mr  trump agreed on friday to end the longest government shutdown on record  in the face of  some of his lowest approval ratings ever  he backed down at least temporarily from his campaign promise of a border wall  doing so could come at a political price with his supporters but at the same time  there already has been a toll to his party for his insistence on hundreds of miles of new border barriers nowhere is that clearer than in the southwest  where growing diversity and mr  trumps demeaning rhetoric about latino migrants are pulling parts of the region from the once firm grip of republicans in addition to ms  torres smalls district  democrats flipped a house seat in the midterms on the southern border in arizona and four seats in rapidly diversifying orange county in southern california in arizona  kyrsten sinema  a democrat  captured a republican held senate seat  while in texas the democratic senate nominee  beto orourke  came closer to winning a major statewide race than any other democrat in 20 years  ms  sinema won 69 percent of latino voters and mr  orourke 64 percent  according to exit polls each of the nine house members whose districts touch the border from california to texas opposes a wall as the wrong solution for border security the irony of the wall is it works best the further you are from the border  said senator martin heinrich  democrat of new mexico  the state with the highest share of hispanics while mr  heinrich glided to re election in november  some democrats from nearly all white states farther north went down to defeat  it was a huge issue in north dakota and montana in the senate races  mr  heinrich said this constant picture painted by the president of this dangerous borderlands region is so incongruous with daily life  he added republican analysts play down the role of immigration and the border in the recent democratic advances in the southwest  stan barnes  a former arizona state lawmaker and current republican lobbyist in phoenix  said the positions of ms  sinema on the border were nearly identical to those of her trump hugging opponent  martha mcsally kyrsten sinema  you couldnt tell the difference between her and martha mcsally on matters of the border  he said  she did not run as a democrat  she ran as an independent or an arizonan  and did not concede one bit of being tough on illegal immigration to martha mcsally demographers have long predicted the growing share of latinos in texas and arizona would turn those republican leaning states a shade of purple or blue  democrats expectations of awakening the sleeping giant of latino voters have been repeatedly thwarted but 2018 may have moved them a step closer to the future  more than one in four latino voters said they cast a ballot in a midterm election for the first time  versus 12 percent for whites  according to the pew research center  in congressional races across the country  about 69 percent voted for the democrat immigration is the big deal breaker in not voting republican  said joseph garcia  director of the latino public policy center at arizona state university because latinos are much younger on average than whites  and many are just forming a partisan preference  mr  garcia predicted that mr  trumps policies and language about immigrants would sour them on republicans in federal elections for years to come it wasnt just the wall  it was the rhetoric over three years demonizing latinos in general  he said  that has a longer lasting effect than just this administration the die has been cast in that arizonas future is largely latino  he added  and theyre all u s  citizens because they were born here  the median age of latinos in arizona is 26  and for non hispanic whites  43 to james kolbe  a republican who in the 1990s and 2000s represented the arizona congressional seat that flipped in the midterms  south and east of tucson  the presidents rhetoric about illegal immigrants was reminiscent of the white hot anger he heard at town hall events in the mid 2000s  but that talk is out of date  he said  because the reality on the southern border is far different with illegal immigration near a 50 year low  more mexicans are leaving the united states than entering  meanwhile  there is a spike in families and children from central america turning themselves in to border agents critics of the trump administration say the actual border crisis is one of its own making because it has failed to allocate resources to process asylum seekers and humanely house children and families in the race for mr  kolbes old district  which has swung between the parties  the losing republican supported mr  trumps wall  while the democratic victor  ann kirkpatrick  opposed new border barriers and called for a path to citizenship for dreamers  the immigrants brought to the united states illegally as children while the districts overall population since 2000 has grown by 14 5 percent  its latino population soared 53 percent  according to a new york times analysis of census data back in new mexico  ms  torres small won a narrow victory in the second district thanks to a voter surge in democratic leaning las cruces  the states second largest city turnout in the city and surrounding doa ana county was up 4 percent over 2010  while in lea county  a republican stronghold  turnout fell more than 7 percent  starkly showing the contrast between democratic and republican enthusiasm  which many observers trace to mr  trump on saturday  chants of no wall  no wall  broke out as ms  torres small spoke at the local womens march about the need to compromise with the president on the shutdown we have to make sure that people who live on the border have a voice for what we want our border to look like  ms  torres small said  according to the las cruces sun news meanwhile  at a street market downtown where farmers sold honey and chile wreaths  shoppers said they had no sense of a crisis on the border  which is 40 miles south and buffered by scrubland of juniper and yucca last year the border patrol replaced 20 miles of low fencing meant to stop vehicles with a column style barrier  18 to 30 feet tall  which one shopper called a jurassic park wall i really dont think about it very much at all  said patricia mihok  who was selling childrens books she had written about wildlife of the chihuahuan desert  which straddles the international border  she worried that a border wall would threaten migrating species rory richardson  70  a retired airline pilot  called a wall a waste of money  he blamed the president for falsely accusing immigrants of crimes unsupported by statistics he brings out the very worst in this society  mr  richardson said  hes talking to the people who supported him from day 1  that dont care about the truth  theyve made up their minds and dont confuse me with the facts but henry diaz  85  a retired sheriff of doa ana county  who was strolling with his wife after a breakfast of huevos rancheros at rosies cafe  said a border wall was needed everybody has a fence around their house  he said  why do you have that  you need the privacy new mexico  which last voted for a republican for president in 2004  was once more of a political battleground than it is today  democrats made sweeping gains in the midterms  winning not just the second district but also the governors race and enlarging their majorities in the legislature last week  democratic lawmakers in santa fe introduced bills to make new mexico a sanctuary state  which would bar state agencies from helping federal immigration authorities who seek to deport undocumented immigrants i think its important that new mexico not help donald trump enact basically racist immigration policies  mr  steinborn  the las cruces lawmaker  said .
washington  before it became the chief sticking point in a government shutdown drama that threatens to consume his presidency at a critical moment  president trumps promise to build a wall on the southwestern border was a memory trick for an undisciplined candidate as mr  trump began exploring a presidential run in 2014  his political advisers landed on the idea of a border wall as a mnemonic device of sorts  a way to make sure their candidate  who hated reading from a script but loved boasting about himself and his talents as a builder  would remember to talk about getting tough on immigration  which was to be a signature issue in his nascent campaign how do we get him to continue to talk about immigration  sam nunberg  one of mr  trumps early political advisers  recalled telling roger j  stone jr   another adviser  were going to get him to talk about hes going to build a wall talk mr  trump did  and the line drew rapturous cheers from conservative audiences  thrilling the candidate and soon becoming a staple of campaign speeches  chants of build the wall  echoed through arenas throughout the country now  mr  trumps fixation with a border wall  the material embodiment of his keep them out immigration agenda  has run headlong into the new realities of divided government  pitting him against democrats who reject the idea out of hand  the impasse is particularly remarkable given that even some immigration hard liners do not regard the wall as their highest priority and fear that mr  trumps preoccupation with it will prompt him to cut a deal that trades a relatively ineffectual measure for major concessions on immigration ive always thought it created a danger that he would trade almost anything in order to get the wall  i think thats still a potential danger  said mark krikorian  the executive director of the center for immigration studies  a group that argues for less immigration  im still worried about that now that fear has been realized at times when mr  trump has explored a deal with democrats on granting permanent legal status for undocumented immigrants brought to the united states as children  known as dreamers  the president has always walked away at the last moment from committing to preserving the deferred action for childhood arrivals program  known as daca  but on friday  fair  an anti immigration group  warned him again that it would be a mistake to many conservative activists who have pressed for decades for sharp reductions in both illegal and legal immigration  and some of the republican lawmakers who are allied with them  a physical barrier on the border with mexico is barely relevant  little more than a footnote to a long list of policy changes they believe are needed to fix a broken system the disconnect is at the heart of the dilemma facing mr  trump as he labors to find a way out of an impasse that has shuttered large parts of the government and cost 800 000 federal employees their pay  having spent more than four years  first as a candidate and then as president  whipping his core supporters into a frenzy over the idea of building a border wall  mr  trump finds himself in a political box of his own making in transforming the wall into a powerful emblem of his anti immigration message  mr  trump has made the proposal politically untouchable for democrats  who have steadfastly refused to fund it  complicating the chances of any compromise as a messaging strategy  it was pretty successful  mr  krikorian said  the problem is  you got elected  now what do you do  having made it his signature issue  trump handed the democrats a weapon against him the dynamic has been on vivid display this past week as mr  trump has argued that there can be no deal to reopen the government unless his wall is paid for  while democrats  now in control of the house  have refused in ever sharper terms a wall is an immorality  its not who we are as a nation  speaker nancy pelosi said on thursday  this is not a wall between mexico and the united states that the president is creating here  its a wall between reality and his constituents  his supporters last month  in private comments to democratic lawmakers after an oval office confrontation with mr  trump  ms  pelosi said the wall was like a manhood thing for him yet it has also become an outsize symbol in the other direction for democrats  many of whom supported at least some sort of barrier along the border in the past but now cast mr  trumps wall as a travesty  sixty four democrats in the house and 26 in the senate voted in 2006 for the secure fence act  which provided for hundreds of miles of fencing along the border  among them were senators barack obama  hillary clinton  joseph r  biden jr  and chuck schumer the only things that have changed is the situation at the border is worse and donald trump got elected  said kellyanne conway  the presidents counselor ms  conway said mr  trump had become so committed to a wall because it would not only prevent the entry of many illegal immigrants and stem the flow of drugs  but also discourage migrants from coming in the first place the reason hes focused on the wall is he thinks you need a very robust physical barrier at the border that you cant climb over  slide under  drive through or walk around  she said  he believes its got to be something thats a deterrent that stops people from taking these perilous journeys beyond the symbolism  democrats now argue that a wall is an expensive and ineffective means of curbing illegal immigration  the majority of undocumented immigrants are people who overstay visas  not people who sneak across the border  a report released in march by democrats on the senate homeland security committee found that border patrol agents on the front lines said they needed more technology and additional personnel to curb illegal immigration and drug traffic  with less than one half of one percent mentioning a wall mr  schumer  now the senate democratic leader  has insisted for two years that any spending agreements contain language barring federal money for mr  trumps wall  republican leaders went along each time  even as the president became increasingly irate  once coming close to vetoing a spending package on the day of the white house signing ceremony while most republicans refuse to say so publicly for fear of angering mr  trump  many share the view that the wall is only a piece  and nowhere near the most important one  of a broader set of actions needed to overhaul the immigration system  including cuts to legal immigration  tighter standards for granting asylum and better enforcement mick mulvaney  mr  trumps acting chief of staff  gave voice to that position in 2015  when he was a congressman from south carolina  telling a local radio station that mr  trump  at the time a presidential candidate  had an overly simplistic view of tackling immigration the fence is an easy thing to sell politically  mr  mulvaney said then  its an easy thing for someone who doesnt follow the issue very closely to say  oh  well  that will just solve everything  build the fence  the fence doesnt solve the problem just to say build the darn fence and have that be the end of an immigration discussion is absurd and almost childish  mr  mulvaney said john f  kelly  mr  trumps former chief of staff  enraged mr  trump last year when he privately told a group of democratic lawmakers that the president had not been fully informed when he proposed a border wall during his campaign  and had since evolved under mr  kellys tutelage  the wall is the wall  the president responded in an angry tweet contradicting his top aide to be honest  its not a wall  mr  kelly said in an interview with the los angeles times last month as he prepared to leave the white house  adding that the administration had abandoned the idea of a solid concrete wall early on  his comments prompted another irate tweet from mr  trump  an all concrete wall was never abandoned  he wrote mr  trump himself has at other times said he is not necessarily wedded to a concrete wall but open to different forms of barriers at different points along the border  including steel slats  i never said  im going to build a concrete wall  he said on friday  rewriting history  i said im going to build a wall numbersusa  another conservative group that presses for stricter immigration policies  circulated an article last month suggesting that mr  trump drop his wall demand in favor of a plan to mandate that all employers use e verify  an electronic system that checks immigration status for prospective employees the wall has sucked political capital from the pursuit of other  and arguably better  means to deter illegal immigrants  wrote heather mac donald of the manhattan institute yet mr  trump has tethered himself to the wall and shows no sign of letting go ann coulter  who along with rush limbaugh  matt drudge and other conservative commentators has pressed mr  trump to live up to his campaign promise  said the focus on the wall was not to be to the exclusion of other policies aimed at stemming illegal immigration we want that stuff too  but we also want a wall  she said in an email on friday  the chant at every campaign rally wasnt  enforce e verify  tax remittances  she added  referring to a proposal to tax cash payments sent by immigrants to their families in mexico and central america advisers said the president became absorbed by the idea of a wall because it was the most memorable and tangible promise he made while stumping for the white house in 2016 he wants to call it a wall because thats what he campaigned on  said christopher ruddy  the chief executive of newsmax and a friend of mr  trumps  hes very obsessed about carrying out his campaign promises  i think to a degree thats unhealthy  but thats important to him  and thats not a bad thing mr  ruddy and some other advisers argue that mr  trump has more room to maneuver than he thinks  because his base would accept his word that some form of additional security along the border was the equivalent of a wall in terms of effectiveness listening to rush limbaugh and ann coulter on this is a mistake  mr  ruddy said  i dont think the presidents base moves even one inch from him even if he doesnt get a wall  they know where his heart is  they know where his mind is michael dantonio  a biographer of mr  trump  said the wall appealed to the builder and brander in him  i think he hears the beep  beep  beep of a cement truck backing up and the product being poured and the wall rising  mr  dantonio said  he can grasp that stuff  he loves it it would be a presidential legacy that future generations could see and touch  an accomplishment that would last for ages  i think hed like it being called the great wall of trump  mr  dantonio said  with a plaque to the president who built it every mile or so the simplicity of the concept made it a powerful sales pitch on the campaign trail  its a four letter thing  mr  dantonio said  its an idea that can be expressed in a single word  and i think that has great appeal to him as a marketer  its sort of crooked hillary or lock her up  but its even better .
the federal government wants to issue more visas for foreign workers to take temporary jobs in housekeeping  landscaping and other fields  even as president trump seeks to seal off the border with mexico  where most of those workers come from the departments of homeland security and labor said they planned to issue up to 30 000 additional h 2b visas through sept  30  the end of the federal fiscal year  congress has generally capped the number of visas  which businesses compete for  at 66 000  divided evenly between summer and winter seasons only workers who had previously secured the visas would be eligible for the proposed additional ones the visas provide legal status for immigrants in temporary nonfarm jobs with landscaping companies  restaurants  hotels and amusement parks  among other industries last fiscal year  about 75 percent of these visas were issued to workers from mexico  according to state department data  visas were also issued to  among others  jamaicans  guatemalans and south africans business groups regularly push lawmakers to raise or eliminate the cap on the number of visas issued  a demand that has increased as unemployment has dropped and domestic workers have become more scarce the governments move to expand the h 2b program appeared inconsistent with the trump administrations repeated message about a crisis on the southwestern border of the united states  on saturday  mr  trump told a gathering of the republican jewish coalition that our countrys full what can we do  we cant handle any more  he said  our countrys full  you cant come in  im sorry alex nowrasteh  a senior immigration analyst with the cato institute  a libertarian think tank  said there were a lot of contradictions within the governments proposals on one hand  we need more people because the economy is booming  he said  then on the other hand  to say  the country is full  go back  its impossible to reconcile those the h 2b visa program  which started in the mid 20th century  has been a feature of a persistent debate over using foreign workers for seasonal labor unions and immigration opponents argue that hiring h 2b workers suppresses wages and deprives americans of jobs  advocacy groups say foreign workers are often exploited  and employers say the cap encourages businesses to hire undocumented workers andrea palermo  a spokeswoman for the department of homeland security  did not directly answer questions about what was behind the plan for additional h 2b visas  she also did not address questions about the apparent contradiction in the administrations positions congress  not d h s   should be responsible for determining whether the annual numerical limitations for h 2b workers set by congress need to be modified  and by how much  and for setting parameters to ensure that enough workers are available to meet employers temporary needs throughout the year  she said the white house did not immediately respond to requests for comment on sunday mr  nowrasteh said he favored the h 2b program  i think the economic benefits from the h 2b visa are very large  the benefits to the workers are huge  he said because businesses are required to show that no american workers want the jobs  the cap makes no sense  he said if they try to hire americans  and americans dont want to do that job  then there should be no cap  he said mr  nowrasteh said he believed that h 2b visas for mexican workers have helped drive down illegal immigration  he said expanding the program or eliminating the cap could also help reduce the number of undocumented immigrants from central american countries last month a bipartisan group of senators  led by susan m  collins and angus s  king of maine  asked the department of homeland security to increase the number of visas as a way to support small businesses in a tight labor market  especially those preparing for the summer season in the short run  many areas of our country simply lack the working age population needed to meet the demand for seasonal jobs  the senators wrote in a letter signed by 11 lawmakers  in some industries  particularly tourism  we fear that the demand for workers so far outstrips the available supply that businesses could be forced to curtail operations  putting at risk the jobs of american workers who fill year round positions at these establishments but mark krikorian  the executive director of the center for immigration studies  which supports curbs on immigration  was critical of the program and said it enabled businesses to avoid hiring people theyd rather not hire a nation with a third of a billion spanning an entire continent  with 50 million working age people not in the labor force  doesnt need to be importing labor  he said mr  krikorian said the proposed expansion of the program was not backtracking or flip flopping by the administration the president has always been a big fan of these guest worker visas  said mr  krikorian  who noted that mr  trumps properties  such as mar a lago  use this visa program to hire workers .

tijuana  mexico  the government of mexico said friday that it disagreed with the trump administrations decision to roll out a policy that forces asylum seekers to wait in mexico while they pursue their cases in the united states  but said it would take in some of the asylum seekers anyway in a statement  the mexican government said that it does not agree with this unilateral measure implemented by the government of the united states and outlined the conditions that it had negotiated since the department of homeland security announced the plan a month ago roberto velasco  a spokesman for mexicos foreign ministry  said it was trying to respond to u s  policy with respect to the nations own immigration policy  were making a sovereign decision to allow some people into mexico with very clear limits based on what our laws and international commitments allow  he said the policy  which the trump administration said thursday it would begin to implement  marks an escalation in the administrations attempt to rein in illegal immigration and a dramatic reversal of the decades long practice of allowing applicants to request protection from within the united states or at official ports of entry  and to remain in the country while their cases wind through immigration courts if applied to a majority of asylum applicants  it could potentially flood mexican border towns like tijuana with thousands more people seeking protection in the united states currently  most migrants who request asylum at the border are released within days with a notice to appear at an immigration court in the interior of the country for their proceedings  a practice that president trump has derided as catch and release  it takes years for cases to advance through the courts  only 20 percent of all asylum applicants ultimately win the right to remain permanently in the country  that figure is even lower  10 percent  for central americans  who account for most of those requesting asylum at the border mexican officials said on friday that they had held three meetings to discuss the proposal with their counterparts in the united states since it was first announced on dec  20  but that ultimately the department of homeland security decided unilaterally to send the first returnees still  president andrs manuel lpez obrador of mexico has said he would welcome migrants and promised to respect human rights while affording them economic opportunities here in mexico  the migrants would be granted yearlong humanitarian visas to live and work in mexico while they await court hearings on the american side  those court hearings would have to be scheduled within the year  officials said the trump administration said the measure would curtail illegal immigration while remaining faithful to international law for far too long  our immigration system has been exploited by smugglers  traffickers and those with no legal right to be in the united states  said kirstjen nielsen  the secretary of homeland security  on thursday the department of homeland security said that the claims for those returned would be adjudicated within a year  with an initial hearing held within 45 days  but immigration courts are already clogged with 800 0000 pending cases  raising questions about whether this timetable can be achieved  experts said the policy would apply both to some asylum seekers who try to enter the united states at border crossings and to those apprehended by the authorities after illegally touching united states soil historically  undocumented single men have represented the bulk of those arrested and subsequently removed from the county  but since 2013  unaccompanied children and families have arrived in ever larger numbers that influx of people was cited by a department of homeland security fact sheet as justification for the policy  children cannot be detained for more than 72 hours in border holding facilities  prompting the authorities to release their adult parents with them  and the fact sheet referred to a shift in the profile of immigrants reaching the border  from a demographic who could be quickly removed when they had no legal right to stay to one that cannot be detained and timely removed analysts and lawyers raised other questions about the program human rights groups questioned the ethics of sending people fleeing in search of safety back into mexico  which itself is experiencing horrific violence  politically  some have asked why mexicos new president would essentially agree to turn his country into a waiting room for american asylum seekers the mexican government has cautioned that the details of who would be returned and when were still unclear  but in its statement  the government said that it would not accept unaccompanied children or people suffering from health problems  mexico has yet to agree to accept families  but opened the door for future discussions also unclear were the logistics of how the asylum seekers would be taken back into the united states for hearings  or how they might obtain legal counsel while waiting in mexico lawsuits challenging the policy  which may expand to other border areas  are widely expected immigrant advocates criticized the administration for what they regard as a denial of due process to asylum seekers fleeing extreme violence or persecution in their home countries and making a harrowing trek to reach the united states once again  the trump administration is doing everything they can to sabotage the asylum process and harm those who come to us in need of protection  said betsy fisher  policy director for the international refugee assistance project in new york they cautioned that the policy will imperil the lives of immigrants  including many families with children  stuck in encampments and shelters in mexico  already  asylum seekers are waiting months  during which some sleep outdoors  to put in their applications whether in shelters or not  the families are sitting ducks for criminal organizations  said lee gelernt  an attorney with the american civil liberties union who fought in federal court to reunite migrant parents and children who were separated during a border crackdown last year  family separations were officially suspended in late june csar palencia  who is in charge of migrant affairs for the city of tijuana  said that the city had received no information from the mexican government about the plan and was not ready to receive more migrants tijuana did not have the space to accommodate them or resources to incorporate them  and did not want to convert itself into a kind of shelter for these returned migrants  he said the border city is already overwhelmed with mexicans deported from the united states  who arrive at the rate of 120 people each day  as well as with migrants from central america and other countries who have come seeking entry into the united states tijuana is still dealing with the aftermath of the last big caravan of central american migrants  of some 7 000 people who arrived in november  between 1 500 and 2 000 remained in tijuana  he said  another caravan of between 10 000 and 12 000 migrants is heading north from southern mexico  many likely toward tijuana about 1 200 people are on a list awaiting an interview with united states immigration authorities to seek asylum  their stay could extend to at least one year if they are returned to tijuana to wait for a court decision after making a claim .

it was never like this before the migrants come now in the middle of the night or in the bright light of day  men and women arrive by the hundreds  caked with dirt  with teens and toddlers in tow  they jump the small fences in remote parts of texas  and they gather on the hot pavement at the main border crossing in california  tired and fearful  they look for the one thing that they pray will allow them to stay in the united states  at least for a while  a border patrol agent gone are the days when young  strong men waited on the tijuana river levees for their chance to wade across the water  evade capture and find work for the summer  these days  thousands of people a day simply walk up to the border and surrender  most of them are from central america  seeking to escape from gang violence  sexual abuse  death threats and persistent poverty  the smugglers have told them they will be quickly released  as long as they bring a child  and that they will be allowed to remain in the united states for years while they pursue their asylum cases the very nature of immigration to america changed after 2014  when families first began showing up in large numbers  the resulting crisis has overwhelmed a system unable to detain  care for and quickly decide the fate of tens of thousands of people who claim to be fleeing for their lives  for years  both political parties have tried  and failed  to overhaul the nations immigration laws  mindful that someday the government would reach a breaking point that moment has arrived  the country is now unable to provide either the necessary humanitarian relief for desperate migrants or even basic controls on the number and nature of who is entering the united states the immigration courts now have more than 800 000 pending cases  each one takes an average of 700 days to process  and because laws and court rulings aimed at protecting children prohibit jailing young people for more than 20 days  families are often simply released  they are dropped off at downtown bus stations in places like brownsville  tex   where dozens last week sat on gray metal benches  most without money or even laces on their shoes  heading for destinations across the united states at the current pace of nearly 100 000 migrants each month  officials say more than a million people will have tried to cross the border in a 12 month period  some of those arriving today will have a strong legal case to stay under international refugee treaties and federal asylum laws  but most wont have a formal asylum hearing until 2021 the flow of migrant families has reached record levels  with february totals 560 percent above those for the same period last year  as many as 27 000 children are expected to cross the border and enter the immigration enforcement system in april alone  so crowded are border facilities that some of the nearly 3 500 migrants in custody in el paso were herded earlier this month under a bridge  behind razor wire in recent days  officials have grasped for ever more dire ways to describe the situation  operational emergency  unsustainable  systemwide meltdown one top official said simply  the system is on fire for president trump  the situation at the border has generated red hot fury  it erupted again on sunday as he abruptly forced out kirstjen nielsen  his long embattled homeland security secretary  for what he considered her failure to put an end to the surge of migrants in recent days  the president has landed on a dark new message that  if taken literally  could mean an end to all immigration  legal and illegal  across the mexican border  the system is full  the president said in california on friday  standing in front of the rusting iron slats of the border wall that he wants to expand for hundreds of miles across the countrys southern border  whether its asylum  whether its anything you want  its illegal immigration  we cant take you anymore yet  perversely  the presidents own anti immigrant rhetoric has helped supercharge the pipeline of migrants from honduras  guatemala and el salvador  smugglers lately have been buying radio ads in central america  warning that mr  trump is about to shut down all immigration  if you ever want to go to the united states  they say  go now  they said they would take us by bus  we would be safe  said jeremias pascoal  16  who crossed into texas earlier this month after paying  3 200 for a guide who showed his group to a road where he said they could surrender to the border patrol  experts say the president is not wrong when he says that legal loopholes in americas immigration system are partly responsible for encouraging migrants to bring children like jeremias on a dangerous journey that in some cases ends in tragedy  in december  two migrant children died in customs and border protection custody after becoming gravely ill during their trip  officials warn that more deaths are likely christopher cabrera  a vice president of the local union of border patrol agents in the rio grande valley in south texas  pulled out his phone last week and scrolled through dozens of pictures he has taken out in the field  groups of more than 100 people turning themselves in at night  seriously ill children huddled on the ground  being given medical aid the majority of our agents get sick  infectious disease is everywhere  mr  cabrera said  including in the border patrols migrant processing center  theres always scabies in there  usually we have chickenpox  we have tuberculosis in there  you name it  its probably been through that building  so its dangerous  its dangerous for our agents  its dangerous for the detainees that dont have anything but the president has not chosen to prioritize a surge of new resources to the border  which could help ease the overcrowding and suffering that have gripped the migrants and the border communities where they arrive  instead  mr  trump has insisted on simply trying to stop people from getting into the country in the first place  a policy of deterrence that not only has failed but has made the problem worse in an effort to send a youre not welcome message  the administration has tried a series of strategies  prosecuting everyone who crosses illegally  taking their children from them  tightening asylum standards  slowing down the number of people allowed to apply for asylum each day  forcing asylum applicants to remain in mexico while they wait for court dates  in some cases  this approach has proved too cruel for the american public to tolerate and has run up against the protections enshrined in the constitution  which the courts have decided protect migrants as well as citizens  some of the presidents agenda has been blocked by congress or the courts  none of it has fixed the problem to the contrary  these policies have forced migrants to divert from well staffed border stations like the one in san ysidro  calif   where agents deliberately slowed down the number of migrants they would allow to cross each day  toward remote areas of west texas and new mexico  where the two migrant children died in december and the administration has done little to speed up the immigration courts  though that could be just the deterrent the president has sought the backlog has been allowed to build to the point of a crisis  said doris meissner  the immigration commissioner in the clinton administration and now a fellow at the migration policy institute  they do not accept the basic proposition that this is a population where there are people qualified for protection and that enabling the systems we have is an answer in a series of international human rights agreements  beginning with the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees  nations agreed to allow anyone to seek asylum  even if they entered a country illegally  the agreements defined a refugee as someone with a well founded fear of persecution based on race  religion  nationality  membership in a particular social group  or political opinion  determining whether an applicant receives asylum was left up to individual nations  but in the united states  the international obligations and the standards for asylum were largely incorporated into american immigration law beginning with the refugee act of 1980 only about 20 percent of asylum seekers ultimately win the right to live and work in the united states by proving that they would face persecution in their home countries  just wanting a better job doesnt qualify  applicants have the burden to show evidence of past persecution or compelling testimony that establishes the well founded fear that they would face danger if they return home some have won asylum  for example  by proving that their membership in a religious minority singles them out for harassment or threats  in the past  women suffering domestic abuse have qualified  as have some victims targeted by gangs  generalized fear of violence does not qualify  neither does poverty the asylum process begins with a credible fear screening to see if an applicant is likely to succeed in the first place out of nearly 100 000 credible fear interviews during the year that ended in september of 2018  an asylum officer confirmed a credible fear 74 677 times  a nearly 75 percent approval rate  a senior trump administration official vowed on tuesday to dramatically reduce that rate by making the standards tougher  but it is what happens after the credible fear interview that is at the heart of americas bitter immigration debate in 2017  11 292 immigrants who had been released on bond or on their own recognizance were ordered deported because they failed to show up for their immigration proceedings  a 26 percent increase over the previous year  according to justice department data  blanca vasquez  who fled honduras after gangs killed her husband and torched their home  passed a credible fear interview at the border in 2013  she was released and settled in northern texas  where she got a janitorial job and waited for her day in court  about a year later  she said  she unintentionally missed her first hearing and was most likely ordered deported for failing to appear shes not sure  because she stopped going to court at all  i got confused  she said  i ask god to look after me  there are too many problems in my country  i want to stay here maria perez  a honduran who joined a caravan with her 8 year old son  yunior  in november  waited two months in tijuana for the chance to apply for asylum after her sons father was killed by a man who continued to threaten her family  when her number  1 506  was finally called  she and her son were soon released to await their court hearings under the juvenile protection laws  she lives now with a friend in northern california  but she does not have a lawyer and isnt sure how to proceed with her case i am very worried  i dont know what to do  she said families like ms  perez and her son are the biggest targets of mr  trumps fury  the president and his aides blame the nations immigration laws  the president derisively calls them democrat laws  for creating an incentive for migrants to bring a child with them to improve their chances of getting into the united states  one of them is the trafficking victims protection reauthorization act  a 2008 bill signed into law by president george w  bush that requires immigration authorities to treat migrant children differently than they do adults  the other is a 1997 legal settlement in a case known as flores  which prevents the government from holding children or families in secure detention facilities for longer than 20 days it was trying to get around those legal limits that prompted the administration last spring to begin forcibly separating migrant children from their parents  detaining parents indefinitely while sending children to shelters and foster care  the fierce political backlash forced mr  trump to abandon that approach the presidents most recent initiative was the one calling for many migrants to remain in mexico for the months or years it could take for an american judge to hear their case  that policy  too  ran afoul of the courts when a federal judge in california blocked its implementation  for some migrants  the policy effectively meant no asylum case at all miguel aquino  29  who fled el salvador in a caravan in october after being shot in the leg and hand by ms 13 gang members  waited for weeks in tijuana to apply for asylum at the sprawling san ysidro port  the biggest on the border  he was interviewed and sent back to mexico to wait for a court date in march  when he arrived for a preliminary hearing without an attorney  the judge gave him more time to find one  and sent him back to mexico to wait  mr  aquino said he has called eight lawyers  and they all said they couldnt represent him because he is in tijuana  at this point  he is tired of waiting the next time  if i dont go with a lawyer and they dont give a clear answer  he said  im going to look for another way to get in  mr  trump often says he plans to build a wall on the border with mexico to halt illegal immigration  but when the standoff over funding for the wall led to a 35 day government shutdown in december and january  it actually made things worse  many immigration judges were furloughed  and tens of thousands of deportation and asylum cases were delayed  in some cases for years  there is another problem with the wall  slowing the exodus of migrants from central america would need to start in those countries first central americas economies are still weak  and residents face drug and gang violence at levels largely unseen in other countries  many are subject to deep poverty  a situation that recently reached a crisis with the collapse of coffee  corn and maize crops  m c   a 23 year old guatemalan woman who asked to be identified by her initials for safety reasons  received an anonymous letter recently in her hometown  san marcos  warning her that she would be killed if she did not give the letter writers 65 000 guatemalan quetzals  nearly  8 500 m c   who is three and a half months pregnant  went to the police in san marcos  then she got a second letter  warning her to never go to the police again  after she received a third letter  she made the decision to leave for the united states i didnt want to come here at first  but then i think its the best thing for the baby  m c  said as she sat in a migrant shelter in the south texas border city of brownsville  here  hes going to grow without crime  he can go to school american diplomats say the best way to confront that kind of lawlessness is with the hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid that has been flowing to guatemala  el salvador and honduras for several years  designed to bolster the rule of law and improve the economy last week  mr  trump abruptly abandoned those efforts  ordering the state department to scrap about  500 million in aid to the three countries  mr  trumps decision has been criticized by members of both parties  who call it shortsighted likewise  critics say that mr  trumps repeated denigration of mexico over the years  including his insistence on building a border wall  risks undermining mexicos willingness to help to keep central american migrants from traveling to the united states this is the first mexican administration that has even been oriented toward doing that  ms  meissner  the clinton administration immigration commissioner  said  but blaming other countries and painting those coming across the border from mexico as a national security threat has never failed to animate mr  trumps core supporters  the ones who helped deliver him the white house in 2016 its an invasion  mr  trump declared in february  after congress denied him money to build a wall  we have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country in fact  the migrants are mostly victims of the broken immigration system  they are not  by and large  killers  rapists or gang members  most do not carry drugs  they have learned how to make asylum claims  just as the law allows them to do  and nearly all of them are scared  of being shipped off to mexico  separated from their children  sent to prison  scared  especially  of going home zolan

welcome to a special edition of crossing the border  a limited run weekly newsletter from the new york times  like what you see  send this to a friend  if someone forwarded it to you  sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox the surge in central americans seeking asylum in the united states is straining facilities across the southwest border  with border patrol processing facilities this week handling thousands of people in excess of the systems capacity  president trump threatened to close the border next week if mexico did not halt all illegal immigration into the united states el paso  the texas border city where the president held a rally in february calling for his wall with mexico  is emerging as a flash point  border patrol agents in the city have begun holding migrant families in an area under a bridge  surrounded by fencing and razor wire photos of the conditions drew attention this week on social media and in news reports  heres a look at where the migrants came from  and how they came to be detained under the bridge agents are apprehending about 570 migrants a day in the el paso metropolitan area  up from about 100 a day five months ago  on some days last year  there were no apprehensions at all in the entire el paso sector  which stretches across new mexico and a swath of west texas the increase translates into a lack of space at processing facilities  so officials put up a large military tent under the paso del norte international bridge in what they describe as a temporary measure  the tent has bathrooms  blankets  water and food  but people appear to be miserable nonetheless stays in the encampment are said to vary from several hours to a couple of days  depending on the flow of migrants across the border  some migrants are sleeping in cots inside the government tent  while others prefer to sleep on the ground outside kevin mcaleenan  the commissioner of customs and border protection  said at a news conference on wednesday near the encampment that the countrys immigration enforcement system is at a breaking point political and business leaders in el paso are expressing criticism over the trump administrations handling of the new influx  many in the city  a democratic bastion  had already disputed the presidents assertion that border fencing had cut crime in el paso in a news conference in el paso on wednesday  mr  mcaleenan announced that c b p  was temporarily reassigning up to 750 officers to places on the border that are grappling with the increased flow of migrants  but some of those in el paso say the overall response has been haphazard a sticking point is the trump administrations plan to spend  192 million on a new immigrant processing center in the city  officials chose an old 400 000 square foot hoover vacuum plant for the site but business leaders are questioning whether the manufacturing facility is the best place to process migrants in a humane way  others claim that federal officials chose the site despite concerns over its proximity to schools  businesses and residential areas in any case  the new center wont be open until at least june mr  trump has lashed out at mexicos government  claiming on twitter that it was doing nothing to stop unauthorized migrants from reaching the united states but the view in mexico is more nuanced  in fact  mexican president andrs manuel lpez obrador has already given in to some of mr  trumps demands  breaking with decades of asylum practices in mexico   read more about that here  mexican authorities have been blocking groups of migrants at some border towns  intercepting unaccompanied minors before they reach american soil and allowing the trump administration to send more than 120 migrants to tijuana to await decisions on asylum requests now mr  lpez obradors efforts to avoid a confrontation with mr  trump over the issue seem to be waning  the mexican president said on thursday that while he respected mr  trumps position  the problem largely involved the united states and central american countries i just emphasize that migration flows of mexicans to the united states are very low  mr  lpez obrador told reporters in mexico city the mexican is no longer seeking work in the united states  he said  the majority are inhabitants of our fellow central american countries border patrol apprehensions remain well below their peak of 1 6 million in 2000  but apprehensions climbed to 467 000 in 2018  the highest level in six years  mr  mcaleenan said at his news conference on wednesday that there were more than 12 000 migrants in united states custody at the beginning of the week  as of this morning  that number was 13 400  a high number for us is 4 000  a crisis level is 6 000  13 000 is unprecedented  he said the important thing to understand is that migration patterns from latin america have undergone a big shift standing in contrast to previous migration surges  the latest one involves few single men from mexico  instead  as more mexicans actually leave the united states than arrive as migrants  central american families now account for the large majority of new arrivals whereas the border patrol could easily deport undocumented mexicans  deporting central americans is more challenging  most are arriving as family units applying for asylum  a process that can take months or years to evaluate  the federal government is letting many migrants go free each week because it lacks enough beds to hold them in family detention centers the situation has changed dramatically  and were responding to it the best we can  said ramiro cordero  a border patrol spokesman in el paso  more migrants are crossing the border this year  read more about whats changed  read

detained under the bridge in el paso hide their faces in their hands  shielding themselves from the blowing dust  behind the razor wire  families sit on gravel littered with paper cups  potato chip bags and torn mylar blankets this place looks like a concentration camp and were not supposed to have that in america  said david casillas  44  a disabled veteran who tried to donate baby food on friday to the hundreds of migrant families peering out through the fence  border patrol agents turned him away the makeshift encampment under the bridge  where immigration officials are detaining hundreds of migrants in a military tent with little hot food  was set up last week after the main border processing center in el paso reached up to 400 percent of its capacity in the largest influx of migrants to the united states in years similar scenes are unfolding at border stations across the 1 900 mile frontier  where kevin mcaleenan  the commissioner of customs and border protection  said last week that facilities had reached a breaking point in mcallen  tex   the border patrols processing center was holding 2 200 migrants on a recent day  well over the facilitys capacity of 1 500  were the conditions horrible  beauty is in the eye of the beholder  i guess  senator jon tester  a democrat from montana  said after visiting the center last week  i dont think they were horrible  but by the same token it was gut wrenching to see mothers and children sitting there in cages the border patrol has been facing a record influx of migrant families since fall  but in recent weeks the numbers have begun to escalate substantially  thanks to the annual surge before the arrival of the deadly summer heat for months  the federal authorities knew that this spring was likely to set records  but only now is it becoming apparent how big the numbers will be  apprehensions already dwarf the numbers of five years ago and echo those of the spring of 2014  when the arrival of the first migrant families from central america transformed the nature of immigration along the southern border the current surge was totally predictable and the trump administration chose not to prepare for it  instead it launched a raft of harsh deterrence measures that were totally ineffective  said wayne cornelius  a migration scholar at the university of california  san diego he and other critics said the administration had focused on measures to discourage migrants  including restricting their entry at border stations and requiring some asylum applicants to wait in mexico while their cases are processed  instead of planning humane border reception facilities and working seriously to diminish the violence and poverty in central america that is driving the migrations the influx has stretched every government agency on the front lines  from the border patrol  whose agents encounter migrants after they cross  to immigration and customs enforcement  whose officers normally process them for detention or release  as well as the health and human services department  charged with the care of children who come across the border without families in response to the surge  hundreds of agents are being diverted from ports of entry  where they facilitate international trade  to help process migrants  immigration officers are being redeployed to the border from duties in the interior  and the government is trying to quickly expand capacity at shelters that take in migrant children kirstjen nielsen  the department of homeland security secretary  said on friday that the agency is setting up a crisis response effort the system is in free fall  d h s  is doing everything possible to respond to a growing humanitarian catastrophe while also securing our borders  but we have reached peak capacity and are now forced to pull from other missions to respond to the emergency  she said president trump threatened on friday to close the southern border next week  a day after he criticized mexico and several central american countries for not stanching the exodus if mexico doesnt immediately stop all illegal immigration coming into the united states through our southern border  i will be closing the border  or large sections of the border  next week  the president said on twitter last week mr  mcaleenan reported that on monday and tuesday  the agency started the day with more than 12 000 migrants in custody  by wednesday  that number had climbed to 13 400 a high number for us is 4 000  a crisis level is 6 000  thirteen thousand is unprecedented  mr  mcaleenan told reporters in el paso in the 2018 fiscal year  which ended sept  30  nearly 400 000 migrants were apprehended at the border  a low figure compared with the peak of 1 6 million in 2000  but experts predict that arrivals this fiscal year could hit one million  a level not seen since the record numbers in the 1990s and early 2000s this month alone  more than 100 000 migrants are expected to be apprehended at the border  it is absolutely a crisis  said henry lucero  the ice field director for arizona  we dont have the resources to deal with all these individuals once a rare occurrence  encounters with groups of 100 or more migrants are now routine for immigration agents  who must round them up and transport them to a border station even as rising temperatures make crossings in the sonoran desert more perilous  border agents intercepted 400 migrants traveling in families on a single day in yuma  ariz   recently  an additional 300 turned themselves in south of nogales  ariz mr  lucero said that the agency has had to redeploy agents from fugitive operations  who normally track down immigrants inside the country who have committed serious crimes  to assist at the border meanwhile  released migrants are spilling onto city streets  federal authorities have been dropping them off by the hundreds every day in mcallen  with city officials desperately trying to find them temporary accommodation its one thing to find a place for 300 people to sleep and its another thing to find a place for 1 100 people to sleep  said kevin pagan  the citys emergency management coordinator  its like you take an average high school football game down here and ask everyone to come over to your house after but no city has been as stretched by the crush of arrivals in recent weeks as el paso  where a new migrant processing center designed to accommodate families and children is unlikely to open before june on friday  the men  women and children packed in a pen beneath the international bridge that connects the united states to mexico squatted on the ground  munching on sandwiches out of clear plastic bags while breathing in fumes from the cars above ive never witnessed people kept under such conditions  said eusebio ruiz  59  a construction worker from midland  tex   who stopped briefly while crossing the bridge to peer at the migrants below  it gives me no pleasure to see this customs and border protection officers wore blue surgical gloves and cloth face masks while standing on the perimeter of the fenced area where dozens of immigrants stood waiting to be processed the agencys officials have said that migrants are spending 24 hours or less under the paso del norte bridge awaiting transfer to a more formal detention facility but officials at annunciation house  a local nonprofit that assists released migrants  said they were consistently hearing from families that they spent four or five days being processed by customs and border protection the longest that i heard was five days under the bridge  with a 9 year old daughter  another woman who had four days under the bridge with her 4 year old  and she just broke down crying talking about how horrible she felt sitting in the dirt and rocks with her  said taylor levy  the legal coordinator for annunciation house the significant change in the composition of the migrants  from single mexican men to central american families and unaccompanied children has created unique challenges unlike mexicans  they cannot  by law  be swiftly deported to their home country  and families also cannot be indefinitely detained because of rules limiting the incarceration of children to 20 days border infrastructure  largely designed for single males  has not adjusted to the demographic shift  the border patrol bolstered medical screenings after two children died in december  it has also received  30 million to upgrade the south texas processing center and funding to construct the facility in el paso ms  nielsen  the homeland security secretary  sent a letter to congress on thursday describing the border crisis and measures to address it  she said that she intended to request emergency resources and the authority to deport unaccompanied children to their home countries  which is currently only legal for minors from mexico because that country has a contiguous border with the united states authorities are working as quickly as possible to bolster capacity for migrant children  she said  but warned that a potential overflow of children in d h s  custody represents our most acute humanitarian risk after closing down a desert encampment erected last year in tornillo  tex   which drew fierce criticism from human rights activists  the government began to expand a temporary shelter in homestead  fla   which now houses more than 1 700 minors  up from 1 200 in january the volume of vulnerable populations is unsustainable  ms  nielsen warned in her letter  our system has been able to cope with high numbers in the past  but the composition of todays flows makes them virtually unmanageable .
president trump delivered an address to the nation on tuesday night from the oval office to make a broad based public push for border wall funding after his speech  speaker nancy pelosi of california and senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leaders  delivered a response from capitol hill  read our live analysis and fact checks of the remarks here  the following are transcripts of both mr  trumps speech and the democratic rebuttal  as prepared by the new york times           president trump  my fellow americans  tonight im speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border every day  customs and border protection agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country  we are out of space to hold them  and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country  america proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation  but all americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration it strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages  among those hardest hit are african americans and hispanic americans  our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs including meth  heroin  cocaine  and fentanyl  every week  300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone  ninety percent of which floods across from our southern border  more americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire vietnam war in the last two years  ice officers made 266 000 arrests of aliens with criminal records including those charged or convicted of 100 000 assaults  30 000 sex crimes  and 4 000 violent killings  over the years  thousands of americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we dont act right now this is a humanitarian crisis  a crisis of the heart  and a crisis of the soul  last month  20 000 migrant children were illegally brought into the united states  a dramatic increase  these children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs  one in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through mexico  women and children are the biggest victims  by far  of our broken system this is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border  this is the cycle of human suffering that i am determined to end  my administration has presented congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs  drug smugglers  and human traffickers  its a tremendous problem our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the department of homeland security  these are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep america safe  in fact  safer than ever before the proposal from homeland security includes cutting edge technology for detecting drugs  weapons  illegal contraband and many other things  we have requested more agents  immigration judges to process the sharp rise of unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support  furthermore  we have asked congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home finally  as part of an overall approach to border security  law enforcement professionals have requested  5 7 billion for a physical barrier  at the request of democrats it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall  this barrier is absolutely critical to border security  its also what our professionals at the border want and need  this is just common sense the border wall would very quickly pay for itself  the cost of illegal drugs exceeds  500 billion a year  vastly more than the  5 7 billion we have requested from congress  the wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with mexico senator chuck schumer  who you will be hearing from later tonight  has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other democrats  they changed their mind only after i was elected president democrats in congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis and they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation the federal government remains shut down for one reason  and one reason only  because democrats will not fund border security  my administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation  but the only solution is for democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government this situation could be solved in a 45 minute meeting  i have invited congressional leadership to the white house tomorrow to get this done  hopefully we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security some have suggested a barrier is immoral  then why do wealthy politicians build walls  fences  and gates around their homes  they dont build walls because they hate the people on the outside but because they love the people on the inside  the only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized americas heart broke the day after christmas when a young police officer in california was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien  just came across the border  the life of an american hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country  day after day  precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders in california  an air force veteran was raped  murdered  and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history  in georgia  an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing  beheading  and dismembering his neighbor  in maryland  ms 13 gang members who arrived in the united states as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16 year old girl over the last several years i have met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration  i have held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief stricken fathers  so sad  so terrible  i will never forget the pain in their eyes  the tremble in their voices  and the sadness gripping their souls  how much more american blood must we shed before congress does its job to those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security  i would ask  imagine if it was your child  your husband  or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken  to every member of congress  pass a bill that ends this crisis  to every citizen  call congress  and tell them to finally  after all of these decades  secure our border this is a choice between right and wrong  justice and injustice  this is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the american citizens we serve  when i took the oath of office  i swore to protect our country and that is what i will always do so help me god thank you and good night           speaker nancy pelosi  good evening i appreciate the opportunity to speak directly to the american people tonight about how we can end this shutdown and meet the needs of the american people  sadly much of what we heard from president trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice  the president has chosen fear  we want to start with the facts the fact is on the very first day of this congress  house democrats passed senate republican legislation to reopen government and fund smart  effective border security solutions  but the president is rejecting these bipartisan bills which would reopen government over his obsession with forcing american taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective wall  a wall he always promised mexico would pay for the fact is  president trump has chosen to hold hostage critical services for the health  safety  and well being of the american people  and withhold the paychecks of 800 000 innocent workers across the nation  many of them veterans he promised to keep the government shutdown for months or years  no matter whom it hurts  thats just plain wrong  the fact is  we all agree we need to secure our borders while honoring our values  we can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry  we can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation  we can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border  we can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings the fact is  the women and children at the border are not a security threat  they are a humanitarian challenge  a challenge that president trumps own cruel and counterproductive policies have only deepened  and the fact is  president trump must stop holding the american people hostage and stop manufacturing a crisis  and must reopen the government thank you  leader schumer senator chuck schumer  thank you  speaker pelosi my fellow americans  we address you tonight for one reason only  the president of the united states  having failed to get mexico to pay for his ineffective  unnecessary border wall  and unable to convince the congress or the american people to foot the bill  has shut down the government american democracy doesnt work that way  we dont govern by temper tantrum  no president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down  hurting millions of americans who are treated as leverage tonight  and throughout this debate and throughout his presidency  president trump has appealed to fear  not facts  division  not unity  make no mistake  democrats and the president both want stronger border security  however  we sharply disagree with the president about the most effective way to do it so  how do we untangle this mess  well  theres an obvious solution  separate the shutdown from arguments over border security  there is bipartisan legislation supported by democrats and republicans to reopen government while allowing debate over border security to continue there is no excuse for hurting millions of americans over a policy difference  federal workers are about to miss a paycheck  some families cant get a mortgage to buy a new home  farmers and small businesses wont get loans they desperately need most presidents have used oval office addresses for noble purposes  this president just used the backdrop of the oval office to manufacture a crisis  stoke fear  and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration my fellow americans  there is no challenge so great that our nation cannot rise to meet it  we can reopen the government and continue to work through disagreements over policy  we can secure our border without an ineffective  expensive wall  and we can welcome legal immigrants and refugees without compromising safety and security the symbol of america should be the statue of liberty  not a 30 foot wall  so our suggestion is a simple one  mr  president  reopen the government  and we can work to resolve our differences over border security  but end this shutdown now thank you .
the struggle in the abortion debate is  in many ways  a struggle over language for example  i am pro life  i strongly support rights and protections for mothers and children  including prenatal children  and other vulnerable populations  i want to see the laws of this country protect these people as well  in my view  this makes me pro life  thats why i use the phrase prenatal child where other people would say fetus in the view of those people  and of mainstream news outlets  i am not pro life  i am anti abortion  this language allows critics to dismiss me and fellow pro lifers as single issue obsessives  which we are not in recent years abortion rights supporters moved from using neutral language like autonomy and choice toward using positive  stigma defying language  groups like planned parenthood now speak about abortion care  oprah profiled activists who urge people to  shoutyourabortion  billboards erected by abortion rights supporters proudly say that abortion is a family value defying stigma is one thing  but the stakes of this debate are never higher than when we decide on language to describe the object of abortion the new york times editorial board  for instance  recently used the phrase clusters of cells that have not yet developed into viable human beings  in a discussion of rights being extended to a fetus in the womb  or what i call a prenatal child language like this ignores the fact that each of us once existed as clusters of cells that have not yet developed into viable human beings  it seeks to hide the fact that by the time most surgical abortions take place  a prenatal child has electrical activity in the brain and a beating heart other words and phrases used in the discussion about abortion seek to obscure this reality as well  tissue  part of the mother  parasite  potential life  even the term fetus is dehumanizing  outside of an abortion context  an obstetrician gynecologist doesnt generally speak to a mother about her fetus  she talks to her about her baby  family and friends organize baby showers  not fetus showers  a mother to be has a baby bump  not a fetus bump  she is with child  not with fetus  it is not unusual for major news outlets  such as the bbc  to use the phrase unborn babies when they report on new prenatal surgical techniques we have shifted our language in ways that hide the dignity of the vulnerable  in this instance and on issues far from the abortion debate as well  this is part of what pope francis calls throwaway culture  what he is describing is often connected with the excesses of consumerism  a culture in which human beings whose dignity is most inconvenient are discarded as mere objects  such a culture requires the use of language that deadens ones capacity to show concern for those who need it most pope francis has saved some of his strongest language for condemning abortion  but he consistently applies his concern about throwaway culture to other populations  rehumanize international  a pro life group  has done research on how this culture affects different populations  including racial minorities  people with disabilities  older people  immigrants and refugees  enemy combatants and prisoners  the research has found tragic patterns in which marginalized populations are referred to as sub humans  defective humans  parasites  and in the process become thought of as objects  things and products the trump administrations forced separation of immigrant children from their parents is a classic example of using people as objects  the administrations ill conceived attempt to use the profound suffering of children to deter illegal immigration failed to respect these children as human beings deserving of care and respect  not objects to be used as a means to an end as bishop daniel e  flores of the diocese of brownsville  tex   noted when the policy was first underway  children are not instruments of deterrence  they are children throwaway culture has infected our attitude toward undocumented immigrants generally  we hire migrants for low wage jobs  paying them less than minimum wage and refusing to pay overtime rates and standard benefits  while at the same time refusing them the basic dignity of human equality  dehumanizing language gets us to this point  political leaders and others dismiss migrants as illegals  or as swarms of undesirables and parasites  some even dismiss this population as rapists and animals a genuine concern for justice for the most vulnerable  one directed at something other than advancing a particular political agenda  must resist throwaway culture across issues that transcend our crumbling right left politics  people who are committed to justice for the most vulnerable will be on the alert for dehumanizing language intended to confirm biases and serve the interests of those who hold power over the weak doing so is particularly important at this moment  we are likely to see a newly intense debate over abortion at our newly constituted supreme court  if we are to avoid the hopelessly stale culture war debates of the 1970s  then we must refuse the false choice between supporting vulnerable women and protecting vulnerable prenatal children  it will mean genuinely wrestling with the complexity of doing both  and it will mean engaging the arguments of our perceived opponents in good faith .
calexico  calif   the barbed wire overhead evokes danger and violence  but maritza hurtado cannot take it seriously  when the sharp coils were placed on top of the old border fence several months ago  running right along the main boulevard  she chalked it up to political propaganda from a white house that does not understand life along the southwest frontier this is not a war zone  ms  hurtado said from her tax and immigration consulting office in downtown calexico  from which she can peer into mexico  ive had a business here for 30 years and weve never needed the barbed wire  why now  to me  it feels as if im enclosed for nearly a year  president trump has pointed with pride to a renovation project replacing two miles of border fencing in calexico  he hailed it as the start of our southern border wall   to the great consternation of many of the towns residents  who are wary of becoming the public face of a hard line immigration policy that most here do not agree with  the attention the presidents tweet brought was surreal  in part because the construction replaced an unsightly stretch of steel fencing that was already there nationally  partisans and journalists began to debate whether the 30 foot tall steel slats that make up the replacement barrier should be called a wall like the one mr  trump promised during his campaign  others said it was just a fence  a distinction that has taken on great importance in washington lost amid the battle over credit and semantics was how calexico residents themselves felt about becoming characters in trump era political theater  for many  a sense of apprehension turned to anger when the military installed barbed wire on top of older border fencing  which runs through downtown this community is basically being used for political purposes  said ms  hurtado  who served as the towns mayor until december  and its happening throughout these border cities that are just like ours  she tried to remain diplomatic when television news crews asked her for comment about the barrier last spring  she said  to avoid making more drama for this community that has nothing to do with the national problem but she said she felt incredulous over the administrations insistence that the replacement fence is part of the wall  before we started this project here to do the replacement  border patrol came to visit us about three times to ask us to please participate in avoiding the drama  they came to say  three times  you guys  just so you know  were starting this project  and its not the wall  recounted ms  hurtado  a democrat who did not vote for the president  and then here comes trump and says  its the wall  read more about how the people who live on the border feel about the wall   we have other problems here that need fixing   the town has received a steady dose of attention from trump administration officials since last spring  vice president mike pence visited the barrier in april and said the administration was committed to seeing the construction of a border wall  in october  the homeland security secretary  kirstjen nielsen  visited to unveil a plaque crediting the president with the barrier this month  the president tweeted again  the fake news media keeps saying we havent built any new wall  he wrote  apparently in reference to the barrier in calexico  below is a section just completed on the border  anti climbing feature included  very high  strong and beautiful  also  many miles already renovated and in service amid a continuing national debate about the border  which has resulted in the longest government shutdown in history  many in this town of 40 000 have struggled to reconcile ominous warnings they see projected from the white house about life on the border with their own experiences living in the quiet agricultural community 120 miles east of san diego calexico has long celebrated its interdependent relationship with mexicali  its sister city directly across the line  the two cities downtowns are bisected by pillars where the border lies  shoppers from urban mexicali  which has a population of about 1 million  are vital to calexicos small town economy and cross to shop at large outlet stores on the american side  americans head to the mexican side on weekends for cheap health care  entertainment and concerts were right up against each other  each city depends on the other  said hildy carrillo  the executive director of the calexico chamber of commerce  who like ms  hurtado did not vote for mr  trump  the families are on both sides of the border  the businesses are on both sides of the border  and the education  the entertainment and the culture are on both sides of the border  punto  read about how charities are stepping in to help released migrants  rather than a border wall  residents here express enthusiasm for modernizing the calexico west port of entry  which they hope will expedite traffic and allow for a fluid flow of business between the two sides  the number of legal northbound crossers each day  leading to hourslong lines  is astounding  about 20 000 pedestrians and up to 20 000 vehicles  according to the general services administration ground was broken in 2015 on the first stage of the renovation  a  121 9 million project completed in september 2018  town officials are hopeful the second phase will be funded by congress we have been waiting for that funding  for years  for our port of entry  ms  hurtado said  thats been our struggle  we dont need a wall  weve been struggling to get the money for the door  the presidents previous threats to shut down the border had also concerned her  were depressed and youre going to kill us if you shut things down  its like  help us by knowing us  you know after mr  trumps tweet about the border wall  ms  hurtado had t shirts made and distributed  they read  its not a wall the high volume of legal traffic does not mean that illegal border crossings do not happen here  the risk those migrants pose  however  and the characterization of the numbers who jump the fence is enormously overstated  ms  carrillo said the real danger  many here said  lies in drug trafficking conducted through sophisticated tunnel systems built by cartels during a drive through downtown calexico  victor carrillo  ms  carrillos cousin and a former city council member  mayor and county supervisor  pointed to a house where federal authorities found an expansive underground tunnel in 2016 that ran from the united states to mexico  as he drove  mr  carrillo and a friend pointed to other areas where tunnels were found  where sink holes formed because of attempted burrowing and where the authorities suspect there could be new tunnels theyre everywhere  every new apartment complex you see go up  you figure there might be a tunnel there  mr  carrillo said a wall  he pointed out  does not even begin to address that problem the politics of the imperial valley are generally not with the president  the county gave hillary clinton 68 percent of the vote in 2016 compared with 27 percent for mr  trump  the 51st congressional district  which runs along the southern border from the arizona border to san diego  supported the incumbent democrat  representative juan vargas  with 71 percent of the vote versus 29 percent for his republican challenger  eighty four percent of imperial county residents are latino  according to 2018 data by the united states census bureau that is not to say that there are not people here and in the broader imperial valley  which is a large agricultural region  who support the presidents policies  but in calexico  it seems  few like to speak about it publicly  and even some of those who lean conservative have reservations about the presidents talk on immigration john renison  70  an army veteran and longtime calexico resident who is a former city council member and county supervisor  began his political career here in the 1990s as a republican but is reluctant to identify with either party today  but he said the barbed wire running through calexico is a distasteful statement  as is  he said  the presidents general rhetoric about immigration we do not have a crisis on the border  we are not in fear of being invaded like he said  mr  renison said  whats really laughable is you think youre going to stop illegal immigration by constructing walls and fences .
across the decade that preceded donald trumps election  american politicians of both parties consistently tried to pass big  sweeping immigration bills that would legalize most of the countrys illegal population and increase immigration overall  these bills failed because of populist opposition  at first bipartisan  the resistance of a certain socialist senator from vermont helped doom the 2007 effort  but increasingly simply conservative  and over time the conservative opposition developed a well founded suspicion of republican elites  whose plans on immigration always seemed to require ignoring their own base this sense of betrayal was fertile ground for trump  who used bigotry and bluster to sell himself to immigration hawks as a republican who wouldnt  indeed couldnt  sell them out  you could trust him more than the bushes and rubios because he was willing to be disreputable  willing to give the finger to elite opinion  willing to play not only the tough guy but the bad guy  and you had to trust him  some hawks argued  because the democrats had been radicalized on the issue and the hour was late  it was either trump or a californian future  in which waves of immigration transformed the entire united states into a one party  democratic governed state but the irony was that the populist resistance had already itself been reasonably effective in achieving some of the goals that trump promised to pursue  over the years when bipartisan elites were seeking the grail of comprehensive reform  they tried to appease skeptics with various forms of border security spending  and this spending really did gradually harden the united states mexico border and make it much more difficult to simply slip across  combine this with economic and demographic change in latin america  and by the time trump took office  border crossings had fallen by two thirds since the presidency of george w  bush in this sense trump was a lagging  not a leading  indicator  he represented the political triumph of an attitude that had already changed policy  albeit in piecemeal and only half intentionally  and partially sealed the porous borders of 15 years before  and his chief proposal  the famous wall  would have been a  literal  extension of the existing border security project rather than a radical addition  sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  this reality created an interesting opening  especially in trumps first year  for a different kind of comprehensive deal  between restrictionists feeling a little more secure in their position and immigration advocates feeling chastened by populist backlash  and there was even some evidence that the white house might be groping in this direction  toward reforms that would seek stability more than radical change  tilting the entire system away from low skilled immigration and toward recruitment  and compromising between restrictionists and enthusiasts by trying to keep the overall immigration rate about the same but that possibility has evaporated because of the second irony of immigration in the trump era  having inherited a border situation that was somewhat better than his rhetoric of crisis suggested  trump has now been handed an actual crisis  a wave of central american families claiming asylum  which has returned monthly crossings to their highest levels in a decade and overwhelmed the system for handling new arrivals there is a sense in which this crisis vindicates immigration hawks  who warned from the late obama era onward that the immigration decline wasnt necessarily permanent  that there could easily be another wave  that united states policy  particularly the obama precedent of a tacit amnesty for child migrants  created specific incentives for families and children to come north but those same hawks ended up electing a president whose signature immigration policy  more walls to deter border crossers  has proved largely ineffective in dealing with an immigration crisis created by people surrendering to border patrol officers and asking for asylum nor does that president have the capacity to devise a more effective response  it seems  since any policy solution would require two negotiations  first  negotiation with congress  to change asylum law to override the court decisions currently tying up the trump white houses attempts at deterrence  like the attempt to make central american asylum petitioners wait out the process in mexico  second  negotiation with the mexican government  to get more help discouraging migration on its side of the border  for a different president these tasks would be challenging  for trump  they seem impossible hence the flailing on display this week  with the president purging his entire homeland security apparatus  in the hopes of finding somebody with the requisite toughness to succeed where the present staff has failed  since toughness apparently means one of two things  returning to the cruelty of child separation or ordering border patrol agents to simply ignore asylum law themselves  its doubtful that this purge will produce anything except more unpopularity for trump s policies  and more unsuccessful collisions with the courts the flailing also absolves the democratic party  currently torn between radicalism and evasion on immigration  from actually having to propose a coherent alternative to the white houses approach  if this sort of crisis were happening on president hillary clintons watch  it would create all kinds of political problems for the democrats  as it stands  they can point at the man who once boasted of washington that i alone can fix it and say  well  why dont you there is still some political peril here for liberals  who may be inclined to confuse the publics distaste for trump with a consensus for an open door  though that vermont socialist is still willing to swat down calls for open borders   but the greater peril by far is for conservative immigration skeptics  for whom the trump presidency is at risk of turning into a policy disaster the attempts to increase deportation have been real enough  but they will be evanescent should trump lose in 2020  the attempt to legislate sustained legal immigration cuts has conspicuously failed  someone in the administration is making deals behind the scenes to increase visas for low skilled guest workers  one of the policies that hawks resisted for years in comprehensive bills  and the longer the current border crisis goes on  the more this white houses most important legacy may be offering evidence that even donald trump  even donald trump  cant really stop illegal immigration when enough people get the idea to bring their kids and come for every conservative faction  supporting trump was a gamble  do you reach for short term victory  even though his incompetence and unfitness might cost you in the long run  the danger for immigration hawks is that the long run has already arrived .
washington  president trump  facing a growing public backlash over the partial government shutdown  shifted course on saturday and offered democrats a deal  temporary protections for roughly 700 000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for  5 7 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border but the proposal  which mr  trump unveiled in a 13 minute address from the white house  appeared dead on arrival in the capitol  speaker nancy pelosi rejected it even before mr  trump spoke  and senator chuck schumer  the democratic leader  denounced the offer as not a compromise but more hostage taking with the shutdown entering its fifth week and polls showing a majority of the public blaming mr  trump  the presidents advisers have been searching for an exit strategy  saturdays speech grew out of talks that vice president mike pence and the presidents son in law and senior adviser  jared kushner  have had in recent days with lawmakers including senator mitch mcconnell  the majority leader the proposal was mr  trumps first public offer to democrats since the partial shutdown began nearly a month ago  it came after an acrimonious week of tit for tat politics  in which ms  pelosi told the president he could not deliver his state of the union address in the capitol until the shutdown was over  and the president retaliated by grounding a plane that was supposed to take ms  pelosi on a fact finding mission to afghanistan in casting the plan as a compromise  the president sought to shift pressure to democrats  who have repeatedly refused to give mr  trump any money for his border wall  to end the shutdown  but democrats continued to insist they will not negotiate with mr  trump over border security until the government reopens over the course of his administration  mr  trump has repeatedly sought to curb both legal and illegal immigration  he has revoked temporary protected status  or t p s   which offers crucial protections for immigrants  for people from some latin american and african countries  and he has moved to rescind deferred action for childhood arrivals  or daca  an obama era program that shielded the young undocumented immigrants known as dreamers from deportation in the deal he outlined on saturday  mr  trump offered to restore t p s  protection for 300 000 people  and said he would allow 700 000 dreamers to keep their protections for three more years in exchange for  5 7 billion for a border barrier that is our plan  mr  trump said  border security  daca  t p s  many other things  straightforward  fair  reasonable and common sense with lots of compromise  the proposal  mr  trump added  was intended to break the logjam and provide congress with a path forward the speech was the second time during the shutdown that the president addressed the nation about the immigration crisis  but unlike his first address  a prime time broadcast from the oval office that leaned heavily on dark messaging about the dangers of crime and illegal drugs flowing across the border  mr  trump seemed on saturday to soften his tone he paired the address with his first naturalization ceremony at the white house  a move intended to underscore the idea that he supports legal immigration  and his language was markedly different  instead of insisting on the big beautiful wall he promised during his 2016 campaign  mr  trump took care to use the word barrier as well  and seemed to pare back his vision for it calling the wall a powerful and beautifully designed see through steel barrier on our southern border  mr  trump said  this is not a 2 000 mile concrete structure from sea to sea  these are steel barriers in high priority locations  much of the border is already protected by natural barriers such as mountains and water mr  trump noted that he had adopted some democratic proposals on border security  the president proposed  800 million for humanitarian assistance and  805 million for drug detection technology  in addition to funding for 2 750 more border agents and law enforcement officials and 75 new immigration judge teams in her talking points  issued to democrats  ms  pelosi said her party favored new drug  weapons and contraband scanning technology at official ports of entry  and filling the more than 3 000 vacancies for customs officers  ms  pelosi also intends to bring up legislation in the coming days that includes an additional  1 billion for border security  including  563 million for 75 new immigration judges and support staff even so  democrats roundly criticized the presidents plan  they were particularly incensed that mr  trumps offer extended protections to dreamers and t p s  recipients that he himself revoked  and they said the deal was a nonstarter because it did not offer any permanent protections for dreamers i think its simply more fake promises raising false hopes  senator richard blumenthal  democrat of connecticut  said  it will fool few americans because its neither serious nor credible as a real remedy for dreamers some on the right also pushed back  describing the proposal as amnesty  james carafano  a national security expert at the heritage foundation who worked on mr  trumps transition  was among the critics  amnesty encourages further illegal immigration  incentivizes the tragedy of human trafficking and undermines our citizens confidence in the rule of law  he said mr  pence  briefing reporters after mr  trumps remarks  said the speech reflected a painstaking process of listening to lawmakers  including rank and file democrats who made it clear they believed that protections for daca and t p s  recipients must be included in a border security deal and he pushed back forcefully against critics like mr  carafano who said the measure amounted to an unacceptable amnesty for undocumented immigrants there is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal  mr  pence said but that was one reason many democrats considered it unacceptable  other senior administration officials made it clear that part of mr  trumps strategy was to try to drive a wedge within the party between those who want to hold out for a much more generous solution and those who may feel enough political pressure to end the shutdown that they will feel obliged to support it noting that tuesday is the deadline for the government to reopen in time to prevent federal employees from going a second consecutive pay period without a check  mick mulvaney  the acting chief of staff  said senate democrats had a tricky decision to make  he also noted that the presidents ability to declare a national emergency was absolutely still a tool available to mr  trump to find funds to build the wall if a legislative agreement could not be reached now it will be up to mr  mcconnell to put legislation incorporating mr  trumps proposal on the senate floor mr  mcconnell  who has insisted he will not put any legislation on the floor unless the president will sign it  spoke to mr  trump  mr  kushner and mr  pence on thursday night about finding a way forward mr  mcconnell told the president that before he could bring up legislation on the senate floor  he needed a public reassurance that mr  trump would sign it  one person close to the talks said  speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions the presidents proposal strikes a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle  mr  mcconnell said in a statement after mr  trumps speech if mr  mcconnell does indeed put a bill on the floor  as the president said he would  senate democrats will have to decide whether to block it or let it come up for a vote  despite democrats vow to reject the measure  it could create an opening for negotiations between the two sides the shutdown stalemate is creating increasing nervousness on capitol hill  especially among republicans seeking re election in democratic leaning states  one of them  senator susan collins of maine  is among only a handful of republicans who have broken with the president and called for the government to reopen without a border security deal on saturday  she praised the president  saying she hoped that mr  trumps offer would lead to constructive debate that will end this impasse white house aides and allies of mr  trump said saturday that mr  trump succeeded in ratcheting up the political pressure on ms  pelosi  especially if the senate succeeded in passing a bill the democrats talking points have been that the president is solely responsible for shutting down the government  marc short  the former white house legislative director  said  this puts more onus on them to come back and say why this proposal is insufficient but one reason democrats are so leery of the deal is that they have been down this road with the president before  last year  mr  trump and mr  schumer negotiated  25 billion in wall money for a pathway to citizenship for the dreamers  but that deal fell apart when hard line white house advisers persuaded the president to back away the standoff over the shutdown  some former aides noted  was the first time mr  trump has had to engage in meaningful  high stakes negotiations  but even that has come as a last resort  in what some have likened to negotiating out of desperation after failing to score political points .

el centro  calif   donald trump was on the television  but no matter  ferdinando galeanas customers were watching their plates  not the president as mr  trump delivered an ominous state of the union address from washington  which warned repeatedly about the dangers along the southwest border  mr  galeana dutifully tended to orders of tacos  horchata and micheladas at dpoly  the mexican eatery his family runs here about 10 miles from the mexican border  what the president was saying on the screen behind him  said mr  galeana  would not help his small business  his family or his five dozen employees what we need here is someone to help people looking for jobs  said mr  galeana  whose wife and american born children work with him at the restaurant  the things he says  they make me laugh residents of el centro and several other towns along the california mexico border have watched with curiosity and apprehension in recent years as the president has escalated his calls for a wall along the southwest frontier  mr  trump repeated his warnings about such perils again tuesday republicans and democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis  mr  trump said during his speech  delivered not long after a bitter impasse over funding for a border wall that shut down the government for 35 days  congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government  protect our homeland  and secure our very dangerous southern border  sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  on a busy tuesday night at dpoly  patrons occasionally glanced at the screen that played the presidents address to the nation  most paid it no mind at all  mr  galeana and others said they had largely tuned out what the president has to say because  too often  his rhetoric is disconnected from what their communities really want  they have struggled to reconcile the presidents warnings about threatening conditions on the border with their own experiences living in this quiet  largely agricultural hamlet what hes saying on the news is different from what were seeing here  said cecy magallanes  45  who is originally from mexicali  not far across the border in mexico  and works as a school bus driver she said mr  trumps previous calls for a border wall seemed like a strategy to get votes his wall  always his wall  added cesar salas  ms  magallaness husband  shaking his head located on el centros main street  dpoly and its clientele embody the biculturalism of border towns across the southwest

table after table  latin pop plays in the background  songs like dnde estars by the mexican electrocumbia musician raymix mr  galeana  who owns the restaurant along with his wife  teresa  said he and his family decorated with the idea of showcasing mexican culture in a modern setting  a concept that so often is lost in mexican restaurants in favor of stereotypical dcor like sombreros our idea was to show that mexico is not just what the stereotypes say  its so much more  he said  we are proud of our culture  and we want to show that that is what many of those here say they wish the president understood  immigration and cross national exchanges are celebrated in these towns along the border hildy carrillo  the executive director of the calexico chamber of commerce  has been sharply critical of president trumps immigration policies  she watched with exasperation last year when mr  trump called the replacement of the towns border barrier the start of our southern border wall  she said she feared the presidents remark would turn calexico into an anti immigration symbol and make it seem unsafe for that reason  ms  carrillo  a democrat  chose not to watch the speech tuesday  one of the few ive ever missed  she said  she went shopping instead  she said  because i refuse to get stressed out having to listen to him such frustrations are frequently expressed in towns along the southwest border  which spans nearly 2 000 miles from california to texas  public officials from el paso took to social media after tuesday nights speech to accuse the president of intentionally misleading the public after he said a border barrier had turned around high crime rates in the city  simply put  walls work and walls save lives  mr  trump said he lies   potus is once again lying and using the  sotu address to spread falsehoods about our beloved city of el paso  representative veronica escobar  a democrat who represents el paso  said on twitter a fact check by the el paso times on the matter  prepared in january but circulated heavily again on tuesday night  found the citys crime rate peaked in 1993  but by 2006 had sharply declined to its lowest level in decades  construction on the border fence that mr  trump appeared to reference began in 2008 the paper also pointed out that  before the bush era fence was approved  el paso and ciudad jurez had been separated by a border barrier for decades before the speech on tuesday  gov  michelle lujan grisham of new mexico  a democrat  denounced the presidents charade of border fear mongering and ordered the withdrawal of most national guard troops stationed at the border in her state many people living along the border  including mexican immigrants  say they understand the desire for strong border security  but in conversations here in el centro on tuesday  even those who agreed with some of the presidents positions were quick to point out that his statements about immigrants  and mexicans in particular  made them disinclined to support him aleyda montejano  21  who is mexican american  lives in the town of imperial but goes to hairstyling school in mexicali because it is less expensive  she said that she agreed with the president that there needed to be a deterrent to illegal immigration  but she said that message was difficult to separate from his tone the way he talks about mexicans  i just dont agree with it  she said  the reason people come here is to have a better life  but  about the border  there are some people that cross illegally and thats not right brian arturo posada  19  an american citizen who grew up in mexicali  said that he was sympathetic to some of the things republicans in washington talk about  like preventing abuse of social benefits such as unemployment insurance  but he said the presidents tone in past speeches too frequently crossed the line when he talked about immigrants and mexican laborers the only thing that really i didnt like was when he said all mexicans are gangsters  he said  thats not true  its not true  and when he was keeping those kids in jails  that made me really mad meanwhile  several mexican laborers in the region said they fear that the presidents warnings about immigrants and crime exacerbates discrimination against them cristina bejarano  34  a mexican laborer who picks cilantro and lives in calexico  about 12 miles south of el centro  said that life for her and other immigrants in the region can be difficult because of the nature of farm work  but she said she moved to the united states two years ago because  even if farm labor is backbreaking  her life and prospects are better here than in mexico she said she wished president trump and others could understand that a lot of people havent had a chance to meet any mexicans  ms  bejarano said  they say were all criminals when were not  just because were brown doesnt mean were dirty .

tijuana  mexico  a new trump administration policy forcing certain asylum seekers to wait in mexico while their cases are processed in the united states took effect on tuesday  when american officials ushered the first such migrant through a southern california border gate into northern mexico the migrant  a 55 year old man from honduras  had applied for asylum in the united states after crossing the border from mexico  under the new policy  he will live in mexico temporarily  returning to the united states only for court dates pertaining to his case dressed in a brown jacket and black cap  he looked dazed as he emerged late tuesday morning on the mexican side of the border in tijuana and was swarmed by scores of reporters  photographers and television cameramen im very tired  he mumbled before being quickly spirited away in a van by mexican migration officials the new policy  first announced in december by trump administration officials  is a dramatic step in what they cast as an effort to rein in asylum fraud and illegal immigration  it represents a major shift from a longstanding practice that permitted most migrants who requested asylum to go free in the united states while they awaited the outcome of their cases american officials said that under that policy  many asylum applicants would never show up for their court dates and would simply vanish into the interior of the country if the policy is applied to a majority of asylum applicants on the mexico united states border  it could result in thousands more migrants flooding mexicos border states every year mexican officials said that while they disagreed with the trump administrations new policy  they have agreed to take in certain asylum seekers and vowed to protect the migrants human rights and allow them to work in mexico while their cases unfold in the united states rodulfo figueroa  an official with mexicos national migration institute  said the man in the brown jacket  whose name was not revealed  would be the only migrant returned to mexico on tuesday under the new policy  but that more are expected soon were just reacting to a unilateral decision  said mr  figueroa  a top federal migration official in the mexican state of baja california since the trump administrations announcement of the new asylum policy  mexican officials have been negotiating with their counterparts in washington to define the conditions under which they would accept the migrants on monday night  tonatiuh guilln lpez  the commissioner of mexicos national migration institute  said mexico would only accept migrants from el salvador  guatemala and honduras between the ages of 18 and 60  he also said that mexico would only receive returned asylum seekers through the border crossing that connects tijuana with san diego  california the returned asylum seekers will be granted special four month  multiple entry visas that would allow them to travel to the united states for their court dates and then once again return to mexico  mexican officials said  some of the returnees will already have one year humanitarian visas which allow them to work and travel freely in the country  asylum cases in the united states can take years to resolve  yet it remained unclear whether and under what terms the mexican visas would be extended the american policy change applies to some asylum seekers who try to enter the united states at official crossings on the countrys southern border  or are apprehended on american soil after trying to cross illegally  but it will not apply to mexican asylum seekers who might risk harm if returned to mexico  the very place where they are claiming fear of persecution as grounds for their asylum claim migrants advocates and human rights groups have vociferously criticized the american policy shift  saying mexico  which is suffering historic levels of violence  is not a safe place to send people who already fear for their lives  in addition  tijuana and other border towns are already overwhelmed with migrants deported from the united states as well as migrants from central america and elsewhere seeking to enter the country in meetings in recent days  american immigration officials have assured advocates that the returns would be conducted in close coordination with mexican officials  who will preapprove all returnees  for now  the officials said  only single adult males in good health would be sent back to mexico while the mexican government has claimed that the policy implementation was a unilateral american move  the united states immigration officials  from the customs and border protection agency  assured the advocates that they had been working with their mexican counterparts at all levels for months and would continue to be in daily contact for at least the next 30 days while the program was gaining speed american advocacy groups are expected to file legal challenges to the new policy in the coming days  after gathering evidence from its rollout president andrs manuel lpez obrador of mexico has said he wanted to welcome migrants and foster employment opportunities for them  and he has begun to follow through on his promises  encouraging immigrants to stay and work in mexico by making it easier to get visas and promoting job creation strategies some asylum seekers who had just arrived in tijuana were surprised to hear on tuesday about the new american asylum policy anabel espaa  39  a honduran migrant who hoped to apply for asylum in the united states  said that staying in mexico for many months was never her plan we dont know what can happen to you here  if you will be kidnapped  she said  tijuana is not exactly the safest place  you know but ms  espaa  who said she had fled extortion threats in honduras  said at least she could work and wouldnt be held in a detention center in the united states at least here we are free  she said .
alpharetta  ga   at the beginning of the year  21 savage was at his commercial apex  his second album  i am   i was  spent two weeks atop the billboard album chart  rockstar  his collaboration with post malone  was nominated for two grammys  and he was set to perform at the ceremony but now he has a new  perhaps even higher profile public role  to his supporters  hes a possible martyr of conscience  under fire for his choice to express his political views in his music a week before the grammys  21 savage was arrested in atlanta and put into removal proceedings by immigration and customs enforcement  which said he was an unlawfully present united kingdom national and charged him with overstaying his visa  a week and a half later  he was released on  100 000 bond 21 savage  birth name sheyaa bin abraham joseph  was  unknown to most  born in london in 1992  and an undocumented immigrant in the united states  that alone makes him vulnerable to removal by the immigration authorities but in an interview earlier this month  two of his attorneys  dina lapolt  his general counsel  and charles kuck  his immigration attorney  proposed that there might have been political motivations at play three days before 21 savages arrest on feb  3  lapolt was already putting an action plan in motion  we had heard that they were looking at him  she said in late january  21 savage performed a new version of his single a lot on the tonight show starring jimmy fallon  with lyrics that touched on the issue of children being separated from their parents at the united states border  a controversial trump administration tactic to discourage illegal immigration there was scuttlebutt after the jimmy fallon show coming from some very high levels in washington  lapolt added  what she heard suggested that 21 savage had ruffled feathers and so on the thursday before the super bowl  lapolt dispatched another attorney from her firm  danielle price  to georgia to accompany 21 savage back to california  a more immigrant friendly state with a newly passed sanctuary law  he declined to go until after completing his contractual commitments  a pair of concerts at events surrounding the game  that weekend while his case winds its way through the immigration system  21 savages team has been actively underscoring the political dimension to his plight and marshaling public support  a  free21savage coalition of a couple of dozen activist organizations is drawing attention to his situation  and two members of congress  hank johnson and zoe lofgren  spoke publicly on his behalf while he was still in detention  lofgren  from california and chairwoman of the house judiciary immigration and citizenship subcommittee  released a statement opening the door for 21 savage to appear as a witness before her subcommittee and floating the idea that he had been arrested as a result of publicly questioning united states immigration policy  was his arrest in response to his constitutionally protected speech  the statement said  it looks like that bryan d  cox  ices southern region communications director  said in an email  were not able to give any additional comment on this case now that 21 savage has been released on bond  his case moves to a different docket  for those who arent detained  the wait for his next hearing could be more than a year  time is our friend  kuck said  we want to make sure we can maximize the politics and the process when 21 savage was in detention  he tried to refrain from talking to my mama and my kids  i aint want them to hear me through the phone  the rapper said  he did want to speak with his lawyers  however  i dont like hopes and none of that  he said he had told them  keep it real between them  there is an easy rapport  in his music  21 savage rarely raps above a whisper  and in person  he was contained and disarmingly calm  speaking forcefully without ever raising his voice  on the day after his release  he was wearing all black  from his balenciaga jacket to his prada shoes  and his demeanor was studious  by contrast  his lawyers were sharp tongued and defiant  while they barked on his behalf  he maintained imperturbable cool for now  anyway  they will do much of the speaking  after interviews the day after his release with the new york times and good morning america  21 savage has gone almost completely silent hip hop mythologies are built on regional specificities  more than any other genre in american pop  rap music understands itself as the product of place  21 savages atlanta is and has been the center of the genres innovation for more than a decade now  the most vital creative hotbed of the most vital american music so the knowledge that he initially came from elsewhere served as a useful reminder that this american music  like so many american musics before it  wouldnt sound the same without immigrants  a quick reminder  almost all of hip hops founder generation  kool herc  grandmaster flash  doug e  fresh  was born in the caribbean  the island influence continues through today  last year  nicki minaj wrote on instagram about coming to the united states as an undocumented immigrant from trinidad and tobago when she was 5 hip hop has also faced immigration crises before  slick rick  one of the most innovative rappers of the late 1980s and early 1990s  was born in england  in 1991  he pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted murder  and other charges  in connection with the 1990 shooting of his former bodyguard  in 2001  he was arrested after performing on a cruise ship that left american waters and put into deportation proceedings  beginning a tug of war over his residency until 2008  when he was pardoned by david a  paterson  then the governor of new york  in 2016  slick rick was granted united states citizenship in 2009  shyne  a protg of sean combs  was deported to belize  where he was born  not long after completing his sentence for attempted murder  assault and reckless endangerment related to the infamous 1999 shooting at club new york  which also involved combs and his girlfriend at the time  jennifer lopez  slick rick was  at times  a cause clbre  but largely among the genres elders  shyne became  in essence  collateral damage of late 90s rap excess  but both cases unfolded in far less dramatic moments of the immigration debate  by rapping about the child separation policy  21 savage inserted himself directly into a noxious political climate  and while many rappers  from yg to eminem to jay z  have spoken openly of their contempt for president trump and his policies  none had as much to lose early in his career  21 savage did not immediately appear as a likely candidate for a political agitator  on his earliest mixtapes  he emerged as a coldhearted menace  dulled to the worlds pain  his lyrics were bleak  his attitude bleaker  over the last couple of years  as he has become increasingly popular  hes been steadily remaking his public image  a product  he said  of being exposed to more of the world i think financial freedom made me grow as a person  he said  speaking about his desire to help others  i did it as soon as i had the resources and the time  cause when you first start making money  its like you still figuring yourself out but then its like  o k   we a machine now  he added  now we can get everybody else right it was this impulse  lapolt said  that resonated with her when she was first in discussions to represent 21 savage last year  i realized how much he did for the community  she said  citing his back to school drives and interest in spreading financial literacy to underserved populations  i said to the rest of the team  this needs to be at the forefront of the storytelling lapolt is a prominent music industry attorney who was one of the primary engines of the music modernization act  the copyright legislation that was signed into law in october and which  among other things  updates how royalties are paid in the streaming age  when 21 savage was arrested  she put her washington connections to work  johnson  a congressman from georgia who had attended a back to school drive organized by 21 savage  wrote a letter of support  lofgrens statement came soon after on the sunday of the grammys ceremony  which 21 savage ended up watching on a television in his detention center cell  kuck called ices toll free number for detainee information and learned that  unexpectedly  a hearing had been scheduled for tuesday morning now that 21 savage has been released from detention  the push to secure his status continues  his legal team has applied for cancellation of removal  which is available to individuals who have been in the united states for more than 10 years  have american citizen family members who rely on them  are of good moral character and have no disqualifying criminal convictions in interviews early in his career  21 savage spoke frankly about his life before music  i done sold cocaine  sold crack cocaine  he told the fader in 2016  i never sold  like  a whole brick  i done took bricks  in 2014 he was arrested  and later convicted  on drug charges  last year  through a first offender program  the conviction was removed from public record  though that still had monstrous immigration consequences  kuck said  subsequently  lapolt hired the atlanta area attorney abbi s  taylor  who secured the vacating of the plea and the dismissal of the charges  the file is now sealed  a search for 21 savage on the georgia felon search website turns up nothing in an hour plus interview  21 savage declined to speak only about the particulars of his prior interactions with law enforcement when ice arrested 21 savage  it stated that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony in addition to overstaying his visa  at the hearing where he was granted bond  it formally withdrew that charge not only does he not have a conviction  but there are no pending charges  there never will be any charges from that  and that case is sealed  kuck said  so it simply never happened but the specter of that case highlights a potential continuing concern  that 21 savages public persona  his art  his social media  his prior public statements  could be leveraged against him   public image  and especially lyrical content  have often been used in legal proceedings involving hip hop artists  as seen recently in the case of 6ix9ine  kuck said that such topics were raised in the first hearing  though  it didnt come up in a way that we believe hurt our case im very optimistic  kuck added  i am convinced that we will ultimately obtain permanent residence for him asked if the uncertainty he still faces causes him anxiety  21 savage was blunt  hell yeah that he could be used as a political cudgel isnt lost on anyone  including 21 savage himself  he goes  well  i dont want trump to come at me  and i go  youre the last person hes going to come after  lapolt said  who in their right mind is going to come after him and not have a complete backlash but for someone who for most of his life has lived with the permanent uncertainty of the undocumented  he was at his most exultant and confident speaking about not having to fight alone its like putting bulletproof glass in front of a bulletproof vest  21 savage said  im going to stand up already  this vest already going to stop any bullet you throw  and yall going to come help and put some glass in front of it too  this cant be stopped  we a tank now  we was already the army  now we coming in tanks .
a 61 year old man from the dominican republic has been waiting for his day in federal immigration court since the 1980s  unable to visit his dying mother back home or  in recent years  legally hold a job  his trial was finally to come next week but because of the federal government shutdown  he stands to lose his precious court date in the backlogged immigration courts  that is likely to mean not just a few more weeks of waiting  but a few more years  migrants like this man  who asked to be identified only by his first name  jose  for fear of repercussions in court  are being sent to the back of the line  with their new court dates coming as late as 2022 from furloughs at the justice department to confusion in the courts  to prison officers working without a paycheck  the shutdown has challenged the nations courts and criminal justice system and those whose livelihoods depend on them  slowing some cases while throwing others into disarray  read more  on friday  president trump threatened to keep the government shut down for months or even years   federal district courts are still operating because they have revenue from court fees and other sources aside from congressional appropriations  but those funds may run out as soon as next friday  leaving it up to judges to decide which cases are critical and must be heard and which will be delayed  criminal cases are likely to be prioritized at federal prisons  which employ roughly 36 000 people  corrections officers who struggle during normal times to cover their bills are now expecting that next weeks paycheck will not arrive  guards who normally take home  1 000 to  1 400 per biweekly check are scrambling to figure out how to pay for child care  rent and medications  read more  with no end in sight to the shutdown  800 000 federal workers have been sent home or are working without pay  eric young  the national president of prison locals for the american federation of government employees  said he had heard from one prison worker in florida who needs  200 for his supply of insulin injections  people are having to decide whether to keep the lights on or pay for their insulin  mr  young said  its depressing  and its just unconscionable to know that the federal work force is being penalized because of politics between the parties about four out of every five justice department employees are expected to keep working  because so many are employed in law enforcement or national security jobs  including at the f b i   the d e a   and the bureau of prisons  but none are expected to be paid during the shutdown  unless their offices have a funding source separate from congressional appropriations the shutdown has already led to a slowdown in civil lawsuits  and some confusion  as federal judges across the country have issued a hodgepodge of conflicting orders  in the federal district court for the southern district of west virginia  a federal judge ordered that all cases in which the federal government is a party be delayed another judge issued an order exempting his own cases from the first judges order the second judge  joseph r  goodwin  wrote  it is my view that the government should not be given special influence or accommodation in cases where such special considerations are unavailable to other litigants justice department lawyers whose civil cases are not granted delays can keep working to meet court deadlines and requirements for filings and appearances  most federal prosecutors and support staff for criminal cases are continuing to work  read more  what is and is not affected by the shutdown  elsewhere  justice department lawyers have begged to delay civil cases in which the government  or even president trump  is being sued  saying they are now prohibited from working on these cases except in emergencies and other very limited circumstances  they have met with mixed success in a lawsuit alleging that mr  trump used his washington hotel to illegally profit from business with foreign countries  a delay has been granted but in a case that seeks to block the trump administration from questioning people about their citizenship in the 2020 census  a measure that critics say is devised to suppress responses from migrants  the judge  richard seeborg of federal district court in san francisco  denied a request to delay and ordered the trial to begin monday  the justice department says it will comply judges will have significant latitude to determine which cases go forward and which are delayed  once the court fees and other revenue are depleted judges are in the best position to determine what cases have an urgency  said david sellers  the spokesman for the administrative office of the united states courts mr  sellers said judges will continue to appoint defense lawyers to represent criminal defendants too poor to pay for one  and jurors will continue to be empaneled  they will get paid  he said  once money is appropriated advocates for prisoners and their families fear that the shutdown could delay the implementation of a new criminal justice bill that promised to shorten sentences for some federal inmates by recalculating the amount of good time credit they have earned  because the justice department must create new tools and protocols first the deadlines for those were already pretty ambitious  even when the department was fully staffed and appropriated  said kevin ring  president of famm  a nonprofit group that was founded to oppose mandatory minimum sentences  were watching that closely but probably no system is feeling the shutdown as much as the already overburdened immigration courts  where there are more than 800 000 cases pending  most of these courts  except those that hear the cases of those currently in detention  are now closed because of the shutdown as a result  the impasse over the trump administrations demand for a border wall to halt illegal immigration will result in long delays in deportations for those who are already here but ultimately lose their cases that is the irony of this shutdown  said judge amiena khan  the executive vice president of the national association of immigration judges  the judges union  the impact is most acutely felt in immigration courts and proceedings where cases will not be going forward because of the volume of trials from the past two weeks that now must be rescheduled  the affected cases are likely to be pushed to the end of the judges dockets rather than squeezed into their schedules once the shutdown ends in new york  home to one of the busiest immigration courts in the country  those whose trials have been postponed will have to wait until the end of 2022 and 2023 at the earliest before their cases are heard because of the backlog  judge khan said i was very nervous because we were so close  and this is just making me even more nervous  jose said  every day i hope the government reopens .
the debate around a border wall and immigration has become so distorted by president trumps superheated nonsense  we must build a wall to keep out all these rapists and murderers  and mexico will pay for it  that weve forgotten what it would sound like if we actually had a president framing the real border issue in a really honest way to come up with a real solution  not just one to energize his base unfortunately  we have a president who wants to spend  5 7 billion on a wall to fix his political problems with rush limbaugh  ann coulter and laura ingraham  when what we need is a president who wants to spend  5 7 on a multipronged strategy that will address the actual immigration challenge we face here is how a real president would explain it  my fellow americans  we face a global crisis  more people are on the move today seeking jobs  asylum from murderous governments  safety from environmental disasters or just looking for order than at any time since world war ii  some 70 million people why now  answer  during the late 19th and the 20th centuries the world shifted from being governed by large empires in many regions to being governed by independent nation states  and the 50 years after world ii were a great time to be a weak little nation state  for several reasons  sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  first  because there were two superpowers competing for your affection by throwing foreign aid at you  building your army  buying your cheap goods and educating your kids at their universities  second  climate change was moderate  third  populations were still under control in the developing world  fourth  no one had a cellphone to easily organize movements against your government or even see what paris or phoenix looked like  fifth  china was not in the world trade organization  so every poor country could be in textiles and other low wage industries all of those advantages disappeared in the early 21st century  climate driven extreme weather  floods  droughts  record setting heat and cold  on top of man made deforestation began to hammer many countries  especially their small scale farmers  developing world populations exploded thanks to improved health care  africa went from 140 million people in 1900 to one billion in 2010 to a projected 2 5 billion by 2050  the same surge happened in central america  in countries like guatemala meanwhile  the smartphone enabled citizens to easily compare their living standards with paris or phoenix  and find a human trafficker app to take them there  also  china joined the w t o   gobbling up low wage industries  and the end of the cold war meant no superpower wanted to touch your country  because all it would win was a bill the result  its much harder to be a weak country today  and the weakest of them are starting to fail or fracture and hemorrhage their people  thats guatemala  honduras  el salvador and venezuela in our hemisphere and sudan  syria  afghanistan  libya and many countries in sub saharan africa across the atlantic this is creating wide zones of disorder  and the biggest geopolitical trend in the world is all the people trying to get out of zones of disorder into the world of order  and that is whats creating all the populist  nationalist  anti immigrant backlashes in the world of order  particularly in america and europe that is the real context for this immigration crisis  whats the answer  well  if you look at what slowed the flood of single mexican men illegally and legally coming to america in the last decade  it was the combination of greater economic opportunity in mexico  thanks in part to nafta  plus slower population growth in mexico  plus improved governance in mexico  plus better border security along the mexico u s  border that same formula has to be applied now to guatemala  honduras and el salvador  they have become the primary source of all those migrants and caravans coming to america today  including 187 000 minors without adult guardians  who were picked up by the u s  border patrol between 2014 and 2018  their parents sent them our way to connect with relatives already here or to be shielded from forced gang recruitment and violence a report last june by the council on foreign relations noted  in 2015  the latest year for which data is available  as many as 3 4 million people born in el salvador  guatemala and honduras were living in the united states  more than double the estimated 1 5 million people in 2000  because of rampant corruption and gang warfare  salvadorans  hondurans and guatemalans each year pay an estimated total of  651 million in extortion to organized crime groups  these gangs  like ms 13  exploded in central america in the mid 1990s following large scale deportations from the united states of undocumented immigrants with criminal records thats why  among other things  a smart u s  immigration policy would promote family planning in rural areas in central america  letting americas religious right limit u s  family planning assistance abroad is stupid  the only thing more stupid is not working to mitigate climate change  which trump refuses to do  extreme weather has been disrupting small scale farming in central america  and when small scale farming weakens or collapses  people leave the countryside and flock to the city  and if they find high unemployment and high crime rates there  they head to america at the same time  we need an investment shock by local and foreign companies and governments to build infrastructure  tourism and trade in central america so more people can thrive there  especially when 61 percent of the population is under 29 years of age alas  though  investment rates average just 12 percent of g d p  in guatemala  honduras and el salvador  while in mexico its 26 percent yes  both legal and illegal immigrants actually contribute  on balance  to american growth  but there is no question that border security  asylum courts  resettlement and absorption facilities put pressure on federal  state and local governments  but the u s  could spend millions of dollars to help stabilize central american countries  so that more of their citizens could stay home  which most immigrants prefer  and wed still save money and reduce illegal immigration  it costs us anywhere from  14 000 to  38 000 to detain and deport a single migrant finally  we also need fences  drones and sensors to strengthen the border in places  but rather than building a  5 7 billion wall against mexico  what we need most is to help mexico improve its capacity to intercept migrants at its southern border with guatemala  where all central american migrants headed north have to pass  its not that hard  there are only two main roads out of guatemala to the north  with a mountain in the middle  its called mexicos tehuantepec isthmus bottleneck if we worked with mexico to create better entry point infrastructure there with biometric controls and improved ability to inspect vehicles  people and merchandise to stop smugglers  and even interview potential asylum seekers there  we would significantly reduce the numbers coming out of central america  crossing mexico and piling up at our border in sum  we need a plan that creates a wall  not a wall that substitutes for a plan  thats what a real president would offer  if only we had one but have no illusions  more weak nation states will be imploding under these pressures in the coming decade and no empire is going to impose order there  those days are long gone  but many of these states simply cannot effectively govern themselves any longer   heck  britain cant effectively govern itself any longer  so how the world of order collaborates to bring order to more and more of these places  italy has basically created and funded the libyan coast guard to protect itself from migrants crossing the mediterranean  is going to become one of the biggest governing challenges of this century .
washington  president trump had a few things to say to start the new year about walls  about wheels  about death and sand  about mitt romney and iran  about his popularity in europe and within the republican party  about essentially firing jim mattis as defense secretary  and forcing the retiring senators bob corker and jeff flake from office  and about validation from kanye west and how his generals were better looking than tom cruise he lamented being lonely in the white house over christmas and new years  he had been essentially out of public view for a week  so when he convened his first cabinet meeting of 2019  he seemed to be releasing some pent up demand to be heard here are some takeaways and fact checks from the 95 minute session on wednesday walls  the president said  are a time tested effective way to secure a border  just look at the vatican  he said  is that wall  the biggest wall of them all  immoral  he asked   vatican city has walls  but they do not enclose the entire territory and visitors can easily enter some parts   the united states needs a physical barrier  he said  adding that it needs a wall  later  though  he said he did not really care if the barrier were called a wall  but wanted only to emphasize that a wall was needed a wall  he said  would stop the flow of heroin into the country  and it would stop human trafficking  there are probably 30 million to 35 million undocumented immigrants in the united states  he speculated  and they cost the government  250 billion  which would pay for the wall   government and independent analyses have estimated there are about 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country  and one of the highest estimates for costs of illegal immigration  a criticized study from an anti immigration group  pins the figure at  116 billion  building a wall would not remove these immigrants from the united states and reduce whatever costs they impose   and  mr  trump noted  president barack obama built a wall around his compound  except that is not quite what mr  obama did  in any event  mr  trump said he did not want to be critical of his predecessor  rather  he wanted to make the point that walls work  drones and other technology  he argued  had more limited capacity  i know more about drones than anybody  he said the wall  though  had the advantage of history the wheel  the wall  some things never get old  mr  trump said mr  romney  the newly elected republican senator from utah  announced his presence in washington by writing an op ed article in the washington post that was a scathing criticism of mr  trump  usually not one to shy from a fight  mr  trump was relatively restrained when he talked about mr  romney  who was the republican presidential nominee in 2012 id love him to be a team player  possibly he wont be  mr  trump said  the president noted that he had endorsed mr  romney for the senate  and mr  romney  in turn  had praised him profusely  then mr  trump added that mr  romneys words might not play well in utah  where the president said he is extremely popular   mr  trump is probably less popular in utah than almost any largely republican state  he went on to criticize mr  romneys race against mr  obama in 2012  and said that if mr  romney had fought mr  obama as hard as he has fought him  mr  romney might have won  and when asked if he were concerned about a primary challenge from mr  romney in 2020  mr  trump replied  they say i am the most popular president in the history of the republican party   actually  mr  trumps approval rating among republicans was 88 percent at 701 days into his term  according to gallup  the same as president george w  bush at the same point  over all  mr  trumps approval ratings among his own party have largely hovered below mr  bushs   one by one  the president called on select cabinet members for their contributions to border security  one by one  they responded by praising their boss kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  applauded his leadership on border security  she was followed by the acting attorney general  matthew g  whitaker  who saluted the president for giving up his christmas and new years holidays while some members of congress went on vacation  rick perry  the energy secretary and a former governor of texas  also praised the president  saying he had been rebuffed on border security from the obama administration  youre standing up and saying dont come  mr  perry said not to be outdone  vice president mike pence noted that he  too  stayed in washington over the holidays  then he  too  piled on the compliments  i want to thank you for the strong stand you have taken on border security  mr  trump was still stinging from criticism over his decision to withdraw american troops from syria  lamenting that he was the only person who would get bad publicity for it  one rebuke in particular  from mr  mattis  seemed to prompt the president to issue some criticism of his own  how has he done in afghanistan  not good  im not happy  mr  trump said  before adding  i wish him well  president obama fired him and  essentially  so did i   mr  mattis resigned in protest  and mr  trump initially characterized the retired marine generals departure as a retirement   he protested that some characterized the withdrawal as aiding russia  insisting that theyre not happy   in fact  president vladimir v  putin of russia called mr  trumps decision to withdraw american troops from syria correct   besides  he said  russia learned how costly and fruitless a foreign war can be after they went bankrupt fighting in afghanistan even though it had good reason to invade the country because terrorists were going to russia   the soviet union invaded afghanistan in 1979  beginning a decade long attempt by moscow to subdue the afghan civil war and maintain a friendly and socialist government on its border  according to the state department   mr  trump then misleadingly claimed that mr  obama gave iran  150 billion and  1 8 billion cash   the first figure refers to a high estimate of frozen iranian assets released by the iran nuclear deal  not a check cut to tehran  while the second refers to a payment of a debt owed to iran   unprompted  the president responded to a recent poll in europe that mr  romney cited in his op ed article that showed only 16 percent of people in germany  britain  france  canada and sweden believed that the american president would do the right thing in world affairs  down from 84 percent in 2016 mr  trump took the low number as a measure of how well he is doing in the united states  if i were popular in europe  i wouldnt be doing my job he later added  though  that he could indeed reverse those numbers  i could be the most popular person in europe  he said  i could run for any office if i wanted to mr  trump seemed to think that some of his predecessors  he did not name names  have coasted in what is frequently described as the most difficult  loneliest job in the world it would be a lot easier if i just relaxed and enjoyed the presidency like a lot of other people have done  he said .
as president trump delivered his state of the union address on tuesday  two guests sitting in the gallery and listening closely were immigrants he has long known  they cleaned mr  trumps cottage at his golf club in bedminster  n j   despite lacking legal status in the united states victorina morales and sandra diaz were among some 20 immigrants  many of them facing possible deportation  on the list of guests seated in the secure gallery for the annual address even as the president wrapped his speech in a theme of national unity  he made immigration  his signature issue  central to it  as divisive as it may be  his determination to build a wall along the southern border led recently to a 35 day government shutdown  and ahead of the next government funding deadline  on feb  15  there is still no deal in sight i never imagined i would set foot in such an important place  ms  morales  46  a native of guatemala who worked at mr  trumps golf resort for five years  said after the speech  i was an immigrant representing many immigrants in this country who dont want to show their faces because of what the president says  i was there for the 11 million undocumented ms  diaz  47  a native of costa rica who is now a legal resident of the united states  said she felt like cinderella attending the speech  but sitting in full view of the trump family  whom she had seen frequently at bedminster  and seeing the president deliver his address  she said  she had hoped he would have kinder words for undocumented immigrants it was hard to be face to face with him and realize he didnt change his position  especially for those of us who helped his businesses prosper  she said  i had the trust to be inside his home and serve him  sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  but the two former housekeepers  invited by a pair of democratic lawmakers  represent just one side of the fractious immigration debate  among those mr  trump invited were a daughter  a granddaughter and a great granddaughter of gerald and sharon david  a nevada couple killed in their home last month  an immigrant from central america who was believed to be in the country illegally has been charged in the case republican lawmakers chose guests whose experiences they believe bolstered their calls for a crackdown on illegal immigration and fortification of the southern border michael c  burgess  a republican lawmaker from texas  hosted chris odette  whose daughter  chrishia  13  was struck and killed as she was crossing the street in 2014 by a vehicle driven by an undocumented immigrant who had no drivers license  the driver was freed on bail and evaded immigration authorities when they went to arrest him  said mr  odette  a resident of rockwall  tex it is important to me to hear that the president is doing something to address the immigration issue  mr  odette said  people who keep trying to block it dont seem to care because they are not touched by the loss senator marsha blackburn and representative tim burchett  both tennessee republicans  invited the parents of pierce corcoran  22  who died in a head on vehicle collision in december with an undocumented immigrant in the knoxville area also among the republican invitees were leaders of the united states border patrol union  which has been a staunch backer of the president and his plan for a wall on the border democratic lawmakers  for their part  hosted immigrants who have been targeted by the trump administrations more vigorous immigration enforcement policies  including mothers separated from their children under the zero tolerance border policy  which was suspended in late june amid widespread public outrage albertina contreras and yakelin garcia  a guatemalan mother and daughter invited by senator jeff merkley of oregon  were separated at the border on may 24 and were unable to communicate for more than a month before being reunited on july 12  having fled domestic violence  they are living in murfreesburo  tenn   while they fight in court to remain in the united states i want to live here and get papers  it is a privilege to be here  said yakelin  who wore a black and white dress and a matching blazer for the occasion  which coincided with her 12th birthday gerald michaud  47  has been living in brooklyn under temporary protected status since an earthquake ravaged his native haiti in 2010  the t p s  program enables him to live and work in the united states  but the trump administration has moved to cancel the program later this year for haitians  salvadorans and others i am proud to represent more than 300 000 immigrants who would like a permanent solution  said mr  michaud  who is a wheelchair attendant at la guardia airport and teaches martial arts to at risk youths  we are afraid  i am working legally  which i cannot do if i lose t p s the state of the union address has long been a platform for presidents to report on key issues and seek congressional support  this is not the first time that it has been used to make a statement about the nations lingering divisions over immigration  in 2016  president barack obama invited a syrian refugee to his state of the union address to send the message that refugees were not a threat to the country but what will distinguish this years speech from past years is the sheer number of invitees whose immigration status is uncertain because of the presidents policies the attorney general of california  xavier becerra  delivered the democrats spanish language response to mr  trumps address  that  too  focused in part on immigration  tonight was about convincing us that  from here on out  the deceit and dysfunction would stop and that cooperation would begin  mr  becerra said  what we heard was the same tired refrain of building walls as for ms  morales and ms  diaz  the former housekeepers at the presidents golf club  tuesday night marked a first  until recently  neither had been to washington before  let alone attended a joint session of congress  their appearance began with an invitation to ms  morales from representative bonnie watson coleman of new jersey this year  there is no issue more important than the way this administration is using immigrants as an excuse to build a wall that doesnt work  said ms  watson coleman  who represents the district where ms  morales resides in recent weeks  the two women have been meeting with members of congress and aides all over capitol hill  hoping to spur an investigation into the difference between the presidents harsh words on immigration and his companies own hiring policies we wanted to highlight the hypocrisy of the administration  said jimmy gomez  the democratic congressman from los angeles who invited ms  diaz  the president demonizes immigrants  documented and undocumented  and also relies heavily on them .
palermo  sicily  italys populist interior minister  matteo salvini  celebrated parliaments passage of his security decree to crack down on illegal immigration by assuring his supporters last year that i wont stop but stopping mr  salvini is exactly what leoluca orlando  the mayor of palermo  the sicilian capital  wants to do passed with much fanfare late last year  mr  salvinis security decree was intended to make italy more unwelcoming to migrants  not least by doing away with two years of humanitarian protection for asylum seekers  a status that allowed them to live in the country legally far from adding to security  says mr  orlando  71  a veteran mayor and constitutional law professor who came to prominence in the fight against the mafia  the law risks pushing migrants into the shadows and the criminal underworld by denying them legal status as well as access to health care and other social services he has refused to apply the decree in a stand that has become a prominent part of a widening grass roots resistance to mr  salvinis hard line on immigration  which is increasingly dividing the country even as it has tightened the populist governments hold on power on friday afternoon  in defiance of the law  mr  orlando pushed through the first four applications by migrants seeking residency under their humanitarian status by signing their applications  mr  orlando hopes to invite a legal challenge by the government that he can take all the way to italys highest court  he intends to argue that mr  salvinis measures are unconstitutional and violate the migrants human rights i cannot accept that you produce criminality  mr  orlando said in an interview last month in his grand office  surrounded by gilded islamic manuscripts  a letter from pope francis and a paperweight of the dalai lama many liberal mayors across the country  from naples to florence to milan  applauded mr  orlandos intention to defy the government  which he first announced at the end of december mr  orlandos office now hopes his action will clear the way for the mayors to create italian versions of the sanctuary cities that sprouted in the united states in opposition to presidents trumps similarly minded crackdown on immigration this week  tuscany  umbria  sardinia and the northern region of piedmont filed a legal complaint against the security decree  charging that it actually increased criminal activity and decreased the possibility of economic integration in a further knock on the government  prosecutors in sicily initiated an investigation of mr  salvini on charges of kidnapping  after his refusal to allow an italian coast guard ship carrying migrants to dock this summer in the absence of plausible political opposition at the national level  some have welcomed the signs of resistance against the government led by mr  salvinis anti immigrant league and the anti establishment five star movement there are many little outbreaks that have failed to form in a single flame  said claudio cerasa  the author of a manual on resistance to italys culture of intolerance and the editor of il foglio  a newspaper critical of the government but the flickers of resistance have only inflamed mr  salvini  who clearly thinks he has a winning position ahead of critical european parliament elections in may  he continues to find evermore inventive ways to ratchet up his crack down on illegal migration mr  salvini has embraced the investigation aimed at him as an opportunity to play the victim of overreaching magistrates  he has already attacked the civilly disobedient mayors as scofflaws who help the illegal migrants hate italians  and they will answer to the law and to history i will not stop  he pledged indeed  last month  mr  salvini refused to offer a safe port to the sea watch 3  a vessel that had rescued 47 migrants from the mediterranean sea  for nearly two weeks  the ship was adrift as mr  salvini spoke of forming a naval blockade to seal off the country the standoff ended on thursday  only after european neighbors agreed to take in the majority of the migrants  who disembarked in another sicilian city  catania the repeating loop of ships approaching italy with rescued migrants  only to be turned away by mr  salvini  has given the tough talking interior minister a seemingly inexhaustible well of talking points and advantageous television footage i guarantee that our position will not change  zero tolerance mr  salvini posted on twitter thursday  adding later that millions of italians voted for me to block the landings mr  orlando accused mr  salvini of fear mongering and using the banner of security to get votes in the next european election his decision  which his office said is based on his reading of italian law  breaks a bureaucratic impasse with city workers who  unlike him  were loath to defy mr  salvinis decree  it sets off a process that will likely result this month in the mayor personally granting residency to the applicants this is the first concrete act of opposition  said mr  orlando  who is eager for italys highest court to rule on mr  salvinis law  i need a court in the meantime  migrants around italy are feeling the pressure i dont know what to do  saha abdul  21  a migrant from ghana  said as he shopped in the ballar market in the center of palermo  he said he had tried to renew his documents to gain residency in italy  but was told the decree made that impossible im already on the street  everything is in my bag  water  food  he lamented  i get no help  it will push people to do what people dont want to do at the university of palermo  a group of 10 lawyers and law students offered free counsel to migrants thrown in disarray by the new decree  outside of a classroom  lawyers worked off a call list with the names sakko  konate  camara and bolul migrants who arrived in italy as minors  attending italian schools  learning the language and integrating in their cities  often counted on the humanitarian status to remain in italy when they came of age  instead  many risked suddenly becoming illegal as they turned 18 alieu sosseh  17  said his application for a residency permit had been postponed until later this month i dont know why  im not trying to do something bad in this country  i have been going to school  he said  worried that people in his situation will eventually be forced to start dealing drugs in life when you cant get your meals  your breakfast  and that is the only opportunity  you can get involved in that thing  he said  you wont like it  but you have no choice mr  salvinis critics say that is exactly the outcome he desires  by producing more migrant crime  they say  he produces more anxiety and fear  exactly the conditions on which his law and order proposals feed but mr  salvini argues that the mayors and other liberals are simply making excuses for migrants  who they prefer over law abiding italian citizens acting on the authority of mr  salvinis security decree  the police last week cleared out an integration center in castelnuovo di porto  north of rome  mr  salvini said the closure of such centers  where about 6 000 refugee applicants across the country receive shelter  would save the state about six million euros mr  salvini pledged to carry out a similar evacuation of an even larger center in sicily later this year such moves continue to divide italians  the mayor of castelnuovo di porto expressed disgust with mr  salvini and took in a somali woman  other residents rallied around children who attended the local school and a 19 year old senegalese striker for the local soccer team mr  orlando had supported the sea watch  the rescue vessel that landed thursday  and even gave its crew a palermo flag before they set sail  residents in the sicilian town syracuse  outside of which the sea watch lingered  hung white sheets from their balconies reading let them dock  and some families offered to take migrants in mr  orlando is hoping that he  and the mayors who followed his lead  had at least sparked something in the country i played my role  he said  i hope i will not remain isolated and everyone will ask  in my field  what can i do to be concretely against this .
a former employee of the trump national golf club in new jersey said that her name was removed from a list of workers to be vetted by the secret service after she reminded management that she was unlawfully in the united states  the latest worker to assert that supervisors at the elite resort were aware that some members of their work force were undocumented the bedminster golf club has recently terminated several workers who were determined to be ineligible to work in the country  according to several people familiar with the matter  following a new york times report that revealed that immigrants who presented false documents were knowingly kept on the payroll  sometimes for years a lawyer representing the women has met with investigators from the new jersey attorney generals office and the federal bureau of investigation  presenting what he said was evidence that managers at the golf club knew that some workers were in the country illegally  and that at least one supervisor helped an employee obtain forged working documents in the latest revelation  emma torres  an undocumented immigrant from ecuador who prepared food at the club  said that members of the kitchen staff were asked in 2016  as donald j  trump was in the midst of his campaign for the white house  to write their names  addresses and other details  including their social security numbers  on a list of employees that would be submitted to the secret service for clearance the golf club has been a favorite place for vacation and business meetings for mr  trump when i learned this is for the secret service to see the records of everyone because they are giving protection to mr  trump  i rushed to human resources  ms  torres said in an interview  i thought  god  what will i do  ms  torres said she had used a fake social security number when she applied for her job she said that she told a human resources employee  whose name she does not know  that she did not have legal status  she said that the woman replied  its o k  no problem  she scratched me off the list the woman then asked ms  torres for names of other kitchen workers who might be undocumented  which ms  torres said she provided there is no evidence that mr  trump knew of the unlawful status of employees at the club  but halting illegal immigration  by stanching the influx across the border  and deporting immigrants living inside the country have been core priorities of his administration  mr  trump has demanded  5 billion in funding to erect a wall along the united states mexico border to help block the flow of immigrants  leading to a stalemate with democrats that has resulted in a partial shutdown of the federal government in a statement to the times on dec  7  the trump organization  which owns the new jersey golf club  pledged to terminate any workers it found to have been hired using fraudulent documents  which are typically a made up social security number and green card managers at the golf club and at trump international did not respond to requests for comment on ms  torress account  a secret service spokeswoman  cathy l  milhoan  said she could not discuss what measures the agency took to vet employees at the golf club  the u s  secret service does not comment on our protective operations to include the administration of our name check program  she said in a statement ms  torres said she believes the undocumented workers she identified to management also had their names removed from the list given to the secret service  but all of them  she said  remained on staff at the resort at least one other undocumented employee at the resort  victorina morales  a native of guatemala who had been illegally in the united states since 1999  said she was given a secret service pin to wear when the president was in residence at the club  secret service officials said the pin did not signify that she had passed any security clearance ms  torres  43  said she was hired to work at the resort in early 2015 using a falsified social security number and permanent resident card  she had informed a manager during her job interview that both were phony  she said  and the documents were photocopied for club files when she started working there after a few months working as a housekeeper  ms  torres said she complained to management about what she felt was abusive treatment by the housekeeping supervisor and was moved to the kitchen  where she started as a dishwasher  she said she worked her way up to assistant to the chef  earning  14 50 an hour among other tasks  ms  torres noted that she made sandwiches for secret service agents when they began visiting the property  she also prepared food for mr  trump mr  trump had praised her work and tipped her when she was in housekeeping  ms  torres recalled  but she and other former employees who have spoken with the times said they grew increasingly uncomfortable with mr  trumps derogatory comments about immigrants during his campaign  when he won the election  fear took over me  ms  torres said  i felt i was in the lions den  i had to leave ms  torres quit in early 2017  after finding another job since the timess initial report that the golf club employed undocumented immigrants  three additional immigrants have come forward  saying that they used fraudulent documents to secure jobs there and that management was aware of their illegal status ms  morales was still working at the club when the times published its report  but has not returned to work since  she said that when her initial fraudulent green card expired  a manager at the club arranged for her to be driven to a place where she could obtain new counterfeit documents  she said he lent her money to purchase them since the article was published  the trump organization has been quietly scrambling to bring its golf club work force into compliance  according to former employees who have been in contact with colleagues at the club  checking whether employees are authorized to work in the united states has resulted in the termination of about a dozen people  according to these workers and another source familiar with the organizations workings  though management at the club has not confirmed their accounts more broadly  the company is reviewing its staff at many properties to ensure they are authorized to work in the country  according to a person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity a lawyer representing some of the undocumented former employees  anibal romero  contacted the new jersey attorney generals office and the office of the special counsel  robert s  mueller iii  in october  mr  muellers office then referred the case to the f b i   said mr  romero  who said that both state and federal authorities contacted him in november  mr  romero said that he handed over  among other material  the false documents that a manager had helped ms  morales obtain neither state nor federal authorities have confirmed that they are conducting a full scale investigation into the matter a spokesman for the new jersey attorney general said that as a general matter  our office does not confirm or deny investigations  a spokeswoman for the f b i  declined to comment .
tijuana  mexico  with the bullhorn of a nationally televised address and the prestige of the white house around him  president trump delivered a dark  if familiar  message to the american people on tuesday night  the united states needs a border wall to stanch the flow of drugs and criminals  and it has no more room for migrants in mexico  the supposed origin and pipeline of these menaces  leaders and citizens reacted with a weary shrug in the mexican border city of tijuana  where thousands of migrants have gathered seeking entry to the united states  most of the televisions in a downtown restaurant showed soccer matches and basketball games  mr  trumps voice  nearly drowned out by music  emerged faintly from a screen in the back almost no one seemed to care  or even listen to what the american president had to say luis arce  a 32 year old lawyer  was among the few who took a moment to reflect on mr  trumps speech  he said he was not surprised by mr  trumps insistence on building a wall  nor by anything else in the remarks its a tantrum  mr  arce said  we all know he is temperamental and will never back down on this whim of his  especially since he promised it since his campaign and seems like he cant take it back a wall will clearly not solve drug addiction  the drug trade  weapons smuggling or illegal immigration  he added  those are problems that have to be addressed and solved by policymaking the situation at mexicos northern border would seem to demand urgent policymaking  as the migrants gathering at cities like tijuana have become a humanitarian and political crisis for mexico the demands of trying to shelter migrants and improve squalid  crowded conditions have overwhelmed local officials  and the arrival of the migrants has strained relations with the united states  last week  mexico called for an investigation into american officers repeated use of tear gas across the border yet the reaction to mr  trumps speech on tuesday night was muted although only several weeks into his term  president andrs manuel lpez obrador has gone out of his way not to antagonize his american counterpart  after mr  trumps address  he appeared to weigh his words carefully in a long interview with a mexican news program  mr  lpez obrador said mexico would always pursue a relationship of cooperation  of friendship  his government  he said  will confront migration with development  with employment after the interview  reporters asked mr  lpez obrador about mr  trumps speech and his insistence on the wall i dont even want to mention the word  mr  lopez obrador said  its an issue thats not even on our agenda  i dont think about it instead  the president said  he would try to bring mr  trump around to his way of thinking we will persuade him  convince him that we need cooperation for development  he said  this is the best way to face the phenomenon of migration vicente fox  the vocal former president of mexico  has berated mr  trump in the past  and on tuesday he appeared to see no reason to let up  dismissing the american leader on twitter  lenfant terrible  the enemy of all  even himself mr  fox urged mr  trump  dont be so stubborn  saying that mexico would never pay for the wall and that as far as i understand the american people will not either from the day he announced his candidacy for office in 2015  mr  trump has made the reduction of immigration  and the construction of a wall  a central issue of his campaign and presidency  sometimes promising that mexico would pay for the wall  he has since claimed a revised trade agreement with mexico and canada would pay for the wall  an idea rejected on tuesday by kenneth smith ramos  the chief mexican negotiator for the deal thats a chapter you will not find in the new agreement  simply because it does not exist  he wrote on twitter in a series of fact checking tweets about the speech  arturo sarukhan  mexicos former ambassador to the united states  rejected many of mr  trumps claims  saying there is a national security crisis on the border does a huge disservice to how the us and mexico have worked together since 9 11 to ensure our border is not used by terrorists to undermine our common security  he wrote on monday  mexicos interior minister  olga snchez cordero  staked out a position that was in implicit contrast to mr  trumps migrants are not criminals  much less do they constitute a threat to the security of mexico or the united states  she said  they are human beings who seek to escape the reality of insecurity and poverty in their countries of origin  who seek the most elemental thing  the possibility of remaining alive and finding a job that will allow them to advance with dignity but although she said mexico was open and willing to work with the united states  the two sides are still far apart on the nature of the problem itself mexicans in tijuana noted as much on tuesday  when mr  trump spoke daniel gmez  the manager of the bar airing the speech  called it bad news that would discourage tourism and hurt the mexican economy it is so frustrating to listen to him say the same things  which are nothing more than excuses to justify the massive problems that exists in the u s  and blame it all on the foreigner  the mexican  the other  he said its infuriating because we cant do absolutely anything about it  he said  all we can do is what we are doing right now  which is to sit down and watch it from afar .
washington  president trump attacked speaker nancy pelosi on sunday for rejecting his proposal to end the partial government shutdown  as he and republican leaders in congress sought to put democrats on defense  a place they have rarely been during the shutdown stalemate in a series of morning tweets  mr  trump said ms  pelosi had behaved so irrationally in spurning his offer to restore the temporary protections he took away from some undocumented immigrants in exchange for  5 7 billion for a border wall  he also pushed back against conservative critics who called the plan amnesty for immigrants who came to the united states illegally senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  plans to bring up legislation as early as tuesday that would wrap mr  trumps proposal into a broader package that would include billions of dollars in disaster relief and immediately reopen the government  an aide said  the move is intended to ratchet up pressure on democrats  who have insisted they will not negotiate with mr  trump until the shutdown is over president trump has put forward a serious and reasonable offer to reform parts of our broken immigration system and reopen government  representative kevin mccarthy  the republican leader  said on twitter  the moment now turns to nancy pelosi and chuck schumer  the country is watching but there was little indication from democrats  who have denounced mr  trumps plan as hostage taking  that they would abandon that position if he opens up the government  well discuss whatever he offers  but hostage taking should not work  senator chuck schumer  the democratic leader  told reporters in new york on sunday  adding  its very hard to negotiate when a gun is held to your head with the shutdown now in its fifth week  and 800 000 federal employees still furloughed or working without pay  pressure is rising on both republicans and democrats to end it  if it lasts until friday  congress will be forced to reckon with another grim milestone  affected workers will miss their second paycheck  read  trumps deal meets with skepticism among immigrants in texas as republicans go on offense in the senate  democrats will stay on offense in the house  where they have already passed a string of government funding bills that mr  mcconnell  who has largely remained on the sidelines during the shutdown debate  has refused to take up  on wednesday  ms  pelosi plans to bring up a package of six bills to fund shuttered government agencies  ignoring mr  trumps requests the measures gained approval last year from republicans on the house and senate appropriations committees  in effect  ms  pelosi will be daring republicans to vote against their own legislation  democrats will also begin talking more about their own vision for border security  a shift in strategy for a party that has focused mostly on the economic and personal toll of the shutdown amid the posturing  however  there were some hints that mr  trumps proposal  which he unveiled in a 13 minute white house address on saturday  might open the door to talks that could result in a deal  vice president mike pence  in an appearance on fox news sunday  suggested that mr  trumps proposal might be amended on the senate floor well  of course  mr  pence said  when the host  chris wallace  asked if he was open to negotiation  the legislative process is a negotiation and senator mark warner of virginia  a centrist democrat  described mr  trumps plan as a starting point on nbcs meet the press  though he added  youve got to start by reopening the government polls show the public largely blames mr  trump for the shutdown  and his advisers have been searching for an exit strategy  last week  mr  mcconnell told mr  trump  mr  pence and white house advisers that he needed the president to put forth a public offer so he could bring legislation to the floor mcconnells view of shutdowns is when youre in one  its a great opportunity for both sides to get things  said scott jennings  a republican strategist and former mcconnell aide who remains close to him  and what i think is dumbfounding everyone here is  why arent the democrats treating it as a situation where they could get something  the president has opened the door for them to get something  so lets talk throughout his administration  mr  trump has sought to limit both legal and illegal immigration  last year  he moved to rescind deferred action for childhood arrivals  or daca  which shielded from deportation hundreds of thousands of young unauthorized immigrants known as dreamers  he also revoked temporary protected status  or t p s   for some undocumented immigrants from latin american and african countries in the plan he unveiled on saturday  mr  trump offered to restore the daca and t p s  protections for three years  but democrats say that is a nonstarter  because it does not offer a pathway to citizenship for dreamers  and because mr  trump is simply giving back protections that he himself took away the mcconnell aide  don stewart  said the republican legislative package would include seven appropriations bills that would fund government agencies that have been partially closed for a month the legislation that the majority leader will bring to the floor this week would both reopen the remaining portions of the government  fund disaster relief  fund border security and address immigration issues that both republicans and democrats would like to address  all in one bill  mr  stewart said mr  mcconnell would need votes from all republicans and seven democrats for the package to pass  but only a handful of democrats in republican leaning states might feel pressured enough to cross the aisle  a spokesman for one of them  senator joe manchin iii of west virginia  said mr  manchin  who just won re election  would remain undecided on the republican proposal until he saw it in broadening the package beyond mr  trumps plan  mr  mcconnell may be trying to pick up additional democrats  especially those who are eager to vote for disaster relief hes starting to move the pieces around to see whats going to fly and whats not going to make it  said jim manley  who was a top aide to harry reid  the former democratic leader from nevada  hes trying to put the pressure back on democrats  and hes trying to see what the possibilities of a deal are by putting a larger package there  hes trying to see how large the package has to be to bring democrats on board but mr  trump seemed to be holding fast  he retweeted a series of endorsements of his proposal from republican lawmakers on sunday evening  and earlier in the day  he took aim at ms  pelosi and pushed back against conservative critics who have described the plan as amnesty for undocumented immigrants nancy pelosi and some of the democrats turned down my offer yesterday before i even got up to speak  mr  trump wrote  they dont see crime   drugs  they only see 2020  which they are not going to win  best economy  they should do the right thing for the country   allow people to go back to work mr  trump went on  nancy pelosi has behaved so irrationally   has gone so far to the left that she has now officially become a radical democrat  she is so petrified of the lefties in her party that she has lost control   and by the way  clean up the streets in san francisco  they are disgusting and to his conservative critics  mr  trump wrote  no  amnesty is not a part of my offer  it is a 3 year extension of daca  amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal  whether on immigration or something else  likewise there will be no big push to remove the 11 000 000 plus people who are here illegally  but be careful nancy ms  pelosi took to twitter to strike back   realdonaldtrump  800 000 americans are going without pay  re open the government  let workers get their paychecks and then we can discuss how we can come together to protect

as president trump continues his mad purge of the department of homeland security  a sinister figure is emerging as the driving force behind all the chaos  stephen miller  the presidents top immigration adviser a fierce restrictionist  mr  miller seems to have rarely met an immigrant he didnt want to deport  he is among the hardest of hard liners  known for spurring his boss to pursue ever more draconian measures not that mr  trump needs much encouragement  he did  after all  ascend to the white house on an immigrant bashing  ethnonationalist platform as dishonest as it was divisive  many of the administrations uglier policy ideas have been a result of mr  trumps failure to deliver on his signature campaign promise of a big  beautiful border wall  small wonder mr  miller has emerged as his favorite consigliere on such matters  mr  millers preferred approach to immigration and border security is straight out of ann coulters fever dreams  he was a chief architect of the travel ban on citizens from muslim majority countries  he favors the building of tent cities at the border for warehousing asylum seekers  hes agitating to end the 20 day limit on detaining migrant children  and he wants to reinstate the practice of snatching migrant children from their families  though this time hed like to give parents a binary choice of having their kids taken from them or held with them in detention indefinitely mr  miller is being credited with the blood bath at the department of homeland security  since friday  a handful of top leaders have been  or are soon to be  shown the door  including the head of the secret service  the acting director of immigration and customs enforcement and secretary kirstjen nielsen  who was never quite ruthless enough for the presidents or mr  millers taste  more firings are expected as mr  miller moves to remake the department in his image bottom line  stephen miller is a man whose anti immigration zeal remains unfettered by concern for the law  international norms or basic humanity and yet  the portrait of the 33 year old policy adviser as a figure of singular evil is both overly simplistic and counterproductive  sure  the guy is a force for darkness  easing the president ever further into nativism  but no matter how much of the administrations immigration agenda mr  miller has been responsible for  its taken a village to make that vision a reality  giving too much credit to any one person builds up mr  miller  undeservedly  as a machiavellian genius and lets many other folks off the hook a society does not fall because of a small coterie of bad actors  widespread rot requires legions of enablers  many of whom are driven by varying blends of personal ambition  ideological expedience and the self aggrandizing delusion that  through their invaluable counsel  they can save the state from total destruction expect increasingly to hear this last rationalization from former administration officials starting redemption tours as they resume life outside the trump bubble advisers like kellyanne conway  lawmakers like senator lindsey graham and the former house speaker paul ryan  party apparatchiks like the republican national committee chairwoman ronna romney mcdaniel and a whole host of trump friendly media personalities may not personally share the presidents views or policy aims  but their willingness to swallow some of the administrations cruelest acts renders them complicit  neither their reputations nor their consciences should be wiped clean take ms  nielsen  since her departure was announced  shes enjoyed some sympathy for having behaved less viciously than some in the white house desired  throughout her tenure  stories bubbled up about how she incurred mr  trumps wrath by dragging her feet on policies that would have run afoul of the law or thrown the nation into chaos  but she still carried out and aggressively enforced her share of atrocities now  defenders are portraying the woman who was in charge of caging migrant children as a hapless victim of the administrations more unhinged forces the so called immigration hard liners have flailed about since the beginning of the administration  giving bad advice to the president and misdirecting resources toward the wrong solutions to the wrong problems  thad bingel  a homeland security official under president george w  bush and former aide to ms  nielsen  told the times  they apparently dont want anyone like a secretary nielsen or secretary kelly  who deals in reality  to tell them or the president any of this no doubt  ms  nielsen had a difficult  perhaps impossible  job  but it was no profile in courage for her to cling to her morally untenable position until mr  trump gave her a shove its tempting to see stephen miller as the archvillain of the trump administrations immigration policies  but there is much guilt to go around  and even reluctant collaborators cannot be allowed to absolve themselves of responsibility for the administrations continuing outrages .
washington  president trump appeared poised on tuesday to end two months of scorched earth confrontation without the money he demanded for a border wall as republicans pressured him to accept a bipartisan spending deal rather than close the government again on friday mr  trump pronounced himself unsatisfied with the agreement brokered by house and senate negotiators  and he refused to publicly commit to signing it  but he all but ruled out another government shutdown and emphasized that he would find other methods to finance a border barrier  leading aides and allies to predict he would grudgingly go along with the deal am i happy at first glance  the president said  speaking with reporters at the beginning of a cabinet meeting  i just got to see it  the answer is no  im not  im not happy but he said he was moving things around in the budget from far less important areas to finance a wall even without explicit congressional approval  and he expressed no desire to repeat the standoff that shuttered many federal agencies for 35 days  i dont think youre going to see a shutdown  he said hours later  after a further briefing  mr  trump seemed to signal acceptance of the agreement  saying that it will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources and provide plenty of resources for border security even if not for the wall itself  regardless of wall money  he wrote on twitter on tuesday evening  it is being built as we speak the compromise measure  assembled by senior members of both parties on monday night  includes just  1 375 billion for new fencing along the border with mexico  far short of the  5 7 billion mr  trump sought for a steel or concrete wall  and less even than the deal that he rejected in december  prompting the longest government shutdown in american history the new measure will be taken up as early as wednesday by the house  which is controlled by democrats  followed by the senate  which is run by republicans while some conservatives denounced it as a sellout  senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  spoke with mr  trump by telephone on tuesday and urged him to accept the compromise  i hope hell sign it  mr  mcconnell told reporters afterward  i think he got a pretty good deal mr  mcconnell had initially sought to avoid the confrontation that has consumed the nations capital by pressing mr  trump to accept the previous measure in december  only to be surprised when the president changed his mind  however unenthusiastically  mr  mcconnell stood by the president for weeks and declined to put spending bills on the senate floor that mr  trump would not sign on tuesday  however  mr  mcconnell made clear that he was ready to put the new spending package to a vote even though the president had not endorsed it and  notably  did not rule out overriding a veto if mr  trump turned against the compromise as he did two months ago in an attempt to appease mr  trump  republicans repeatedly referred to the deal as a big down payment on his wall and indicated that they were open to him transferring funds within the government to build more barriers  mr  mcconnell said he had no objection to the president using whatever tools were available  senator lamar alexander of tennessee suggested using  800 million in drug interdiction funding to shore up border security in areas used by narcotic traffickers republicans also asserted that they scored a victory by fending off democratic efforts to impose a stricter cap on the number of detention beds for arrested immigrants and by securing any money for a barrier given that speaker nancy pelosi at one point rejected even a single dollar for a wall she deemed immoral its amazing how shutdown fatigue challenges your flexibility on things  said senator kevin cramer  republican of north dakota  adding that he would most likely support the bill if the final text matched the descriptions he had been given current and former administration officials said on tuesday that mr  trump seemed to be preparing to sign the bill and then reprogram as much money as he can on his own  although they cautioned that the president is unpredictable and his decision would depend on details still to be examined senator ted cruz of texas  who joined mr  trump on monday at a rally in el paso  told attendees at a senate republican lunch on tuesday that his conversations with the president left him with the impression that mr  trump was preparing to pivot to a yes on the deal  according to a person in the room even sean hannity  the fox news host who denounced the deal on monday night as a garbage compromise that republicans would have to answer for  said on tuesday that he expected mr  trump to sign it to keep the government open and get his down payment  hes telegraphing what hes going to do  mr  hannity said on his radio program ann coulter  the conservative commentator whose criticism helped push mr  trump into taking a tougher stand in december  agreed but castigated the president for it  trump talks a good game on the border wall but its increasingly clear hes afraid to fight for it  she wrote on twitter  call this his yellow new deal democrats  who had consented in december to give mr  trump  1 6 billion for border security  said this weeks agreement showed the folly of mr  trumps brinkmanship  the president had a better deal back in 2018  said representative henry cuellar  democrat of texas  he just ended up in a worse situation mr  trump told reporters that he was still thinking about declaring a national emergency to bypass congress and finance wall construction on his own authority  but aides increasingly doubt he will  given opposition by mr  mcconnell and other republicans instead  mr  trump seemed to be trying to frame the outcome on his own terms by insisting he would still be able to protect the border  right now  were building a lot of wall  he said in fact  no new walls have been built or financed by congress based on the prototypes that the trump administration unveiled in october 2017  projects to replace or repair about 40 miles of existing barriers have been started or completed since 2017 construction of the first extension of the current barriers  14 miles of a levee wall in the rio grande valley  is scheduled to begin this month  but a butterfly center has asked a judge to block construction because the barrier would bisect its property in his remarks on tuesday  mr  trump flip flopped again on taking responsibility for the government shutdown  during the weeks leading up to the impasse  mr  trump said he would be proud to shut down the government for border security and would not blame democrats  then during the shutdown  as 800 000 federal workers were caught in the middle without paychecks  he blamed democrats after all on tuesday  he switched gears again and took responsibility  i accepted the first one  and im proud of what weve accomplished because people learned during that shutdown all about the problems coming in from the southern border  he said  i accept it  ive always accepted it  but this one  i would never accept it if it happens  but i dont think its going to happen  but this would be totally on the democrats as mr  trump weighed his options  one person familiar with his thinking described him as frustrated by months of republicans not doing what he hoped to see done at the border a few weeks ago  in a meeting with restrictionist immigration group leaders  mr  trump faulted former speaker paul d  ryan  a fellow republican  for repeatedly deferring action on the wall  with promises of doing it down the road  now hes out fishing  mr  trump declared  according to an attendee the new agreement includes a provision that could give the trump administration broad discretion to increase the number of slots to shelter detained migrants  a win for republicans that could ease the sting of mr  trumps failure to secure full funding for his wall on its face  the agreement authorizes the department of homeland security to fund about 40 000 beds for detainees  many of them in facilities run by for profit companies and immigration and customs enforcement near the border in texas  arizona and california in background briefings  house democratic aides described the language as a glide path from the current level of 49 000 detention beds back to obama era levels of 35 000 or fewer but a summary of the provisions drafted by senate republican staff members placed the average number of beds funded under the deal at a much higher number  45 274  including 2 500 for families  and that could rise to as many as 58 500 beds  republican aides asserted in internal communications  because federal cabinet departments have latitude in how they use funds under the complex funding formula in the agreement  the department of homeland security would have reprogramming authority to transfer as much as  750 million from other programs into detention in short  there is more than enough flexibility for ice to respond to any forthcoming surges in illegal immigrations and apprehensions  the document said two democratic aides said the republican memo was accurate in theory  but added that such a drastic expansion in beds was unlikely because it would require taking money from other important programs  such as disaster relief democrats on the committee that hashed out the deal  under pressure from immigrant rights groups and their partys ascendant liberal wing  stalled talks over the weekend by demanding that any deal include a cap of 16 500 beds dedicated to housing detainees apprehended through sweeps of communities away from the border  there are currently 20 000 such slots immigrant rights advocates expressed disappointment  for the last two years  weve been in a defensive posture  working to hold the line and prevent the bad  but now house democrats have the power to start doing good  said lorella praeli of the american civil liberties union  which has sued the trump administration over its detention policies on the other side of the ideological divide  representative tom graves  republican of georgia and one of the 17 house and senate lawmakers negotiating a deal  said on twitter that he had not signed off or seen a final agreement  but based on the reports  i have concerns  he said  lots of questions too senator richard c  shelby  republican of alabama  the chairman of the senate appropriations committee and one of four lawmakers who worked out the accord  said he was not worried about objections from the right in some areas  we probably got more than a lot of people expected  and in some areas we didnt get as much  he said  but thats the nature of the beast .
west palm beach  fla   mick mulvaney  the acting white house chief of staff  defended president trumps threat to end assistance to three central american countries and to close parts of the united states border with mexico next week  saying on sunday that it would take something dramatic to prevent mr  trump from carrying out that plan why are we talking about closing the border  mr  mulvaney said in an interview on abcs this week  not to try and undo whats happening  but simply to say  look we need the people from the ports of entry to go out and patrol in the desert where we dont have a wall mr  trumps attempt to seal off the border by building a wall  and mulling the closure of ports to tamp down on immigration and drug smuggling  is at odds with a nagging reality  smuggling activity largely comes through ports of entry  according to government data  and the presidents move to cut off aid to guatemala  honduras and el salvador ignores a longstanding strategy touted by aid groups and military experts  including the presidents former chief of staff  that supporting those countries actually makes the border safer still  mr  trump spent the week emboldened by the results of his attorney generals summary of a report by the special counsel  robert s  mueller iii  that said that he and his campaign had not cooperated with the russian government  the president immediately turned back to immigration as a red meat issue for supporters ahead of the 2020 election im not playing games  he told reporters during a weekend in florida  which followed a week spent berating the democratic party for what he called lax immigration laws  assailing countries he has accused of doing little to stop the flow of migrant traveling north  and disparaging individual travelers seeking asylum as part of a big fat con job in the interview  mr  mulvaney criticized jeh johnson  who led the department of homeland security under president barack obama  for saying in an interview last week that the situation at the border was truly in a crisis  last month  76 000 migrants were apprehended crossing the border  an 11 year high  and the crossings are expected to increase again this month we hate to say we told you so  mr  mulvaney said  we need border security  and were going to do the best we can with what we have in recent weeks  border patrol facilities along the southwestern border have been strained to a breaking point by the largest influx of migrants in years  the numbers are growing  in part  because travelers are hoping to make the journey north before summertime  officials in el paso resorted to creating a makeshift encampment under a bridge last week when the main border processing facility in the area was strained to 400 percent of its capacity a full or partial sealing of the border would effectively close off the united states from one of its largest trading partners  and it could leave american citizens who cross back and forth with a sluggish or potentially nonexistent system of returning to the united states  mr  trump will travel to calexico  calif   to tour the border on friday kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  said in a statement on friday that she had asked volunteers to add more support at the border  and suggested that american citizens may encounter difficulty getting through as a result and by directing the state department to revoke aid from the three northern triangle countries  mr  trump is seeking to punish those countries for what he says is a failure to stop migrant caravans from making their way north leaders of those countries have said they are committed to solving the problem  despite what mr  trump has said  in 2017  the united states gave  420 million to central american countries struggling with violence  according to the u s  global leadership coalition  a nonprofit organization that supports diplomatic efforts of the united states  the northern triangle countries committed about ten times that amount  or  5 4 billion  to improve conditions american aid to central america is not charity  but an investment in our national security  liz schrayer  the president of the coalition  said in a statement  the idea of suspending the relatively small  but essential foreign assistance to the region will only exacerbate the root causes driving people to flee their homes  brutal violence  hunger and instability in an interview with jake tapper on cnns state of the union  who pointed out to him that experts within the presidents own administration have said aid money has helped curb violence in and migration from el salvador  mr  mulvaney shrugged off the data from career staffers and said the money had not done enough if were going to give these countries hundreds of millions of dollars  we would like them to do more  he said  if its working so well why are the people still coming mr  mulvaneys comments represent a rightward shift for an administration that has already taken a publicly hard line stance on immigration  in may 2017  john f  kelly  the presidents former chief of staff and former top officer of the militarys southern command  said during an atlantic council meeting that his experience showed him that partnering with northern triangle countries was key to securing the border if we can improve the conditions  the lot of life of hondurans  guatemalans  central americans  mr  kelly  then speaking in his capacity as homeland security secretary  we can do an awful lot to protect the southwest border .
merida  mexico  business and political leaders from the u s  and mexico gathered friday to promote greater trade at a time when actions by both governments have rattled investors  expressing optimism despite times of uncertainty and tensions over the border and illegal immigration investment in mexico has been cool pending passage of the new u s  mexico canada trade agreement that is meant to update nafta  and due to other concerns for the global economy  and attendees saw ratification as a solution to that thomas donohue  president and ceo of the u s  chamber of commerce  stressed the valuable u s  mexico relationship  noting that every day the countries do more than  1 7 billion in trade and some 500 000 people cross their shared border legally for work  school  or tourism  that s why we have fought vigorously for the successful completion of the usmca   donohue said   and we re going to keep up that fight until the deal is ratified and implemented   he also called for washington to lift steel and aluminum tariffs against mexico and canada before congress considers the trade deal in remarks to assembled executives and political leaders  donohue issued a pointed rejection of president donald trump s recent threats to close the united states  southern border and warnings to immigrants not to come because  our country is full   america has the lowest level of unemployment in 65 years  simply stated  we re out of people   donohue said  adding that the business community was leading efforts to expand the u s  labor pool and toward passage of  an effective immigration bill as soon as possible  that message resonated well with the mexican audience  we just heard that the united states has money and lacks people  we lack money and have people to spare   said carlos salazar lomeln  president of mexico s coordinating business council   there s no     more clear reason to be allies  donohue s and salazar s organizations signed a cooperation agreement at the end of the meeting  also friday  mexico s lower house of congress approved a labor reform aimed at ensuring workers can freely vote for their union representation and contracts  a change needed to win approval of the usmca while trump recently walked back his threat to seal the country s southern frontier  redeployments of border agents to handle a surge of migrant families led to long wait times at points of entry  with drivers sleeping in their trucks to keep their place in line possible disruption of the cross border industrial supply chain worried some at the gathering  for purposes of enforcement  the administration  is drawing down on what is needed to move trading  to move people and goods legally and efficiently across our points of entry   said antonio garza  former u s  ambassador to mexico laurence fink  chairman and ceo of investment management firm blackrock  spoke of ample investment opportunities in mexico and called for the two neighbors to work together  i am deeply saddened by the rancor and the tension that has grown between our countries       antagonism between our nations dehumanizes and demands  it poisons the well of economic opportunity and dims the vision that businesses  workers and investors have about what is truly possible however mexican president andrs manuel lpez obrador has rattled some nerves by canceling a multibillion dollar airport project for the capital that was already about a third built shortly after taking office dec  1 representatives were promoting his signature infrastructure project friday  an ambitious  maya train  that would link cities  beach resorts and archaeological ruins in the country s southeast  during a dinner gala the previous night at a lavish hacienda north of merida  mexican officials assured the guayabera clad executives that their investments would be safe still  mexico has work to do to woo foreign capital  mexican political and economic analyst macario schettino wrote recently for the newspaper el financiero that unless trends change  investment could fall 5  in the first trimester and possibly remain at similar levels throughout 2019 lpez obrador said mexico remains committed to things such as strengthening rule of law  policies favoring investment  lowering taxes and raising wages without harming business  and respecting contracts  he also promised to work with central american nations that are the source of much northward migration to ensure that leaving one s country  is optional  not forced  u s  deputy energy secretary dan brouillette said after meeting with mexican energy secretary roco nahle and chief of staff alfonso romo that there is no desire to roll back reforms that opened the energy sector to private companies five years ago under lpez obrador s predecessor  then president enrique pea nieto  only an intention to review and evaluate their performance  i didn t get any indication that they were looking to undo those reforms or somehow upend that effort       what we heard from mr  romo and what we heard from minister nahle is that they understand the sanctity of contracts  and that s very important for u s  companies   brouillette said often historically tricky  u s  mexico relations became particularly fraught following the election of trump  who repeatedly hammered the united states  southern neighbor on trade  the border and migration  i congratulate the new presidential administration in mexico for its strong emphasis on improving the economic development of this region in particular   u s  commerce secretary wilbur ross said at the gala   we also thank them for assisting us as we confront the crisis at our southern border  mexico is the united states  second largest export market and its third biggest trading partner  with more than  678 billion in goods and services changing hands last year  according to ross  u s  foreign direct investment in mexico was over  109 billion in 2017  he added  and mexican investment in the united states has reached more than  35 billion as the 2020 presidential campaign ramps up  candidate trump is seen as likely to try to keep illegal immigration front and center as meat for his base  when he is competing electorally or out there on the stump  he goes to a dark place  and mexico is often in that place   said shannon o neil  senior fellow for latin american studies at the council on foreign relations  whether it s immigration or drugs or other security threats or mexico s effect on the economy as he perceives it  i think that will be the mainstay of his rhetoric   said o neil  who was not at the merida gathering before lpez obrador took office in december  many had been concerned about possible clashes between trump and the leftist populist who won the presidency in his third try  but so far  ties between washington and mexico city seem to have generally held up well  with the two administrations working closely on a number of bilateral issues and lpez obrador officials reluctant to react to critical tweets from trump mexican officials said in merida that from the earliest days  lpez obrador s administration has looked to private sector leaders in both countries  executives with deep and longstanding cross border ties  for cues on navigating what they expected to be a trying relationship  i should thank president donald trump for being open to

washington  president donald trump had had it the flow of migrants at the southern border was surging  another caravan appeared to be forming  and his government had run out of holding space  forcing the release of tens of thousands of families apprehended at the border during a meeting with senior aides on the last thursday in march  trump demanded drastic action to make good on the threat he d tweeted that morning  shut the southern border  curbing illegal immigration was his signature issue  he railed  why couldn t he deliver homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen urged the president to reconsider  her agency had already diverted hundreds of border agents away from certain crossings to process migrant families elsewhere  creating what would soon become considerable bottlenecks  closing ports completely  she reasoned  would only encourage migrants to cross elsewhere  illegally trump wasn t having it  shut the ports at el paso  texas  at noon tomorrow  he ordered  end of meeting the directive set off a frantic behind the scenes push to get trump to change his mind  and he ultimately relented  but the episode launched a turbulent 12 day stretch that would lead to the eventual resignation of nielsen  the potential dismissal of much of her agency s top leadership and the beginning of a new phase in which immigration hard liners at the white house are determined to wield considerably more influence over homeland security this account is based on interviews with 20 administration officials  congressional aides and people familiar with the events  many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal deliberations    on borrowed timetrump and nielsen s relationship was never especially close  nielsen had been picked for the top homeland security job at the urging of her predecessor  john kelly  who left to become trump s white house chief of staff  trump had always been suspicious of her  in part because she d worked for former president george w  bush  she had been widely expected to leave the department last fall after kelly s departure from the white house  but she appeared to get back on trump s good side during the government shutdown  when she served as one of the top defenders of his push to build a southern border wall but nielsen took the brunt of trump s fury over rising border crossing numbers  and the situation was only getting worse  aides spent months desperately trying to come up with new solutions  and some tried to steer trump away from more drastic measures  including his talk of reinstating the family separation policy that prompted international outrage while nielsen had doubts at times  she had dutifully carried out trump s orders  taking ownership of his most divisive policies  including the family separations  and spending months trying to broker arrangements with central american countries  including mexico  but it also fell to nielsen to explain to trump the legal limits of things he wanted to do  and he didn t like it it didn t help that kelly had been critical of trump in appearances since he left the white house  something trump held against nielsen  or that john bolton  trump s national security adviser  had been pushing for nielsen s ouster since last fall  telling trump he didn t think her leadership or policies were effective    a trip cut shortnielsen had just landed in europe last week for her first time as secretary when she decided to rush back to washington  landing early tuesday morning though aides had succeeded in talking trump down from his border closure threat the week before  he had continued to crank up his rhetoric  warning by tweet that if mexico didn t  immediately stop all illegal immigration coming into the united states through our southern border   he would be  closing  the border  or large sections of it within a week by wednesday  nielsen was at the border  overseeing efforts to keep asylum seekers in mexico and preparing for the president s friday visit to calexico  california but the night before trump s visit  a puzzling notice arrived on capitol hill  trump was withdrawing his nomination of ron vitiello to permanently lead the u s  immigration and customs enforcement agency  it had to be a mistake  staffers reasoned  why would trump be spiking his own nominee  a well respected and longtime border official who appeared to be cruising to confirmation vitiello got a call that night from senior trump aide stephen miller informing him that he wouldn t be joining the president on his trip to the border the next morning  there was no explanation nielsen had received no heads up but word began to spread that his nomination was being yanked  we want to go in a tougher direction  was all trump told reporters as he left the white house on friday morning it was step one of the plot to purge dhs leadership nielsen joined trump at the border  echoing his words at a roundtable with border officers and local law enforcement and standing by trump s side as they toured a section of newly rebuilt border fencing  introducing him to local officials but inside she was fuming    dusting off a letternielsen returned to washington on a coast guard gulfstream as trump continued onto california and nevada to do some fundraising  by that night  murmurs were swirling that vitiello s removal wasn t a one off and that miller was orchestrating a wholesale leadership overhaul of her department already frustrated by what she saw as insufficient help from departments like justice and health and human services  with clear signs that white house hard liners were on the ascent  nielsen pulled up the resignation letter she d written months before  just in case she went into a sunday white house meeting with trump that she d requested not sure if she d be fired  resign or stay to fight another day it was  by all accounts  a cordial conversation in the yellow oval room of the white house residence  with acting chief of staff mick mulvaney in attendance  nielsen had come prepared with a list of ideas to share with the president  but the two quickly agreed the arrangement was no longer working  trump wanted to go in a different direction nielsen resigned on the spot  trump tweeted the news before she could get her letter out    the purgestanding outside her home in alexandria  virginia  on monday  nielsen sounded just as loyal to trump as she had at the border  i will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis   she said  thanking the president  for the tremendous opportunity to serve this country  by the end of the day  the department she had led appeared to be on the cusp of being dismantled  with the head of u s  citizenship and immigration services and the department s general counsel among those expected to be pushed out  it s time to do things a little differently   white house spokesman hogan gidley said on fox news channel   and so the president s looking around to reshape his team so he can have the people in place to carry out his agenda     associated press writer zeke miller

a recent survey asked republicans and democrats whether they agreed with the statement that members of the opposition party are not just worse for politics  they are downright evil the answers  published in january in a paper  lethal mass partisanship  were startling  but maybe they shouldnt have been just over 42 percent of the people in each party view the opposition as downright evil  in real numbers  this suggests that 48 8 million voters out of the 136 7 million who cast ballots in 2016 believe that members of opposition party are in league with the devil the mass partisanship paper was written by nathan p  kalmoe and lilliana mason  political scientists at louisiana state university and the university of maryland kalmoe and mason  taking the exploration of partisan animosity a step farther  found that nearly one out of five republicans and democrats agree with the statement that their political adversaries lack the traits to be considered fully human  they behave like animals their line of questioning did not stop there how about  do you ever think  wed be better off as a country if large numbers of the opposing party in the public today just died some 20 percent of democrats  that translates to 12 6 million voters  and 16 percent of republicans  or 7 9 million voters  do think on occasion that the country would be better off if large numbers of the opposition died were not finished  what if the opposing party wins the 2020 presidential election  how much do you feel violence would be justified then  18 3 percent of democrats and 13 8 percent of republicans said violence would be justified on a scale ranging from a little to a lot kalmoe and mason analyzed the data to see what kind of voter was likely to adopt extremely critical views of the opposition party  one personal trait stood out  aggression was the only factor that predicted all three types of lethal partisan attitudes contrary to the expectation that the losers of elections might be more inclined to violence  the two authors determined that winning increases support for violence against the opposition there was significantly more support for partisan violence among strong partisans when told their party was more likely than not to win in 2020 overall  the authors wrote  our evidence suggests that winning more than losing prompts strong partisans to feel less opposed to partisan violence as partisan hostility deepens  there is one group that might ordinarily be expected to help pull the electorate out of this morass  the most knowledgeable and sophisticated voters according to a forthcoming study  however  it is just these voters who display the most uncritical acceptance of party orthodoxy  left or right  on both sides  the best informed voters are by far the most partisan in understanding partisan cue receptivity  bert n  bakker and yphtach lelkes  professors at the amsterdam school of communication research and the university of pennsylvania  and ariel malka  a professor of psychology at yeshiva university  find that knowledgeable  politically engaged voters are the most likely to adopt issue attitudes that are cued as party consistent in the political information environment  in plain language  the most active voters  those notably high in cognitive resources  are the most willing to accept policy positions endorsed by their party  and they are doing so not out of principle  but to affirm their identity as a democrat or republican  they are expressing the desire to reach conclusions that are consistent with a valued identity the authors call this process identity expression or a tendency of partisans to adopt issue attitudes that are cued as party consistent in the political information environment this willingness to adopt a policy position not out of conviction but out of a desire to conform to partisan priorities reflects an urge  they write  to bolster and protect valued political identities by expressing and rationalizing the viewpoints cued to be consistent with these identities in an email  lelkes wrote that he and his co authors felt it important to be careful about causal reasoning  they concluded their article with this commentary these two papers raise a set of basic questions about group identity  why are partisan divisions sharpening now and are these conflicts likely to become more aggravated robert kurzban  the author of the hidden agenda of the political mind  argues that domestic politics have taken on a moralistic  judgmental cast any deviation  kurzban continued in an email  is likely to be severely punished  steven pinker  a professor of psychology at harvard  argues that it is the activation of group identity  of the friend enemy type  about which i have written before  that is driving hostile polarization but  he continued instead  pinker argued pinker cited the questions raised in the work of kurzban and peter descioli  a political scientist at stony brook  wonderingdescioli provided some answers to the question in his replies to my queries moral condemnation  descioli wrote  is amoral condemnation and approbation can both be useful to encourage productive cooperation within a group  but they can also be deeply destructive when used to demonize and humiliate outsiders john hibbing  a political scientist at the university of nebraska  makes the case that polarization has intensified becausewhile as recently as 30 years ago  there were a fair number of conservative democrats and liberal republicans who held views contrary to the majority of their respective parties  hibbing wrote hibbing dismissed the argument that people have become tribal because of changes in the media environment  instead  he wrote kevin smith  who is also a political scientist at the university of nebraska  argues that for much of the twentieth century  according to this line of thinking  the first world war  the great depression  the second world war and the cold war filled much of the need for an in group versus out group configuration  during this period  smith said  there were consensual sources of information and political parties that were relatively nonideological with many members willing to cross the aisle to cut deals in recent years  a lot of that has gone  smith told me  political parties are now deeply ideological  which makes it easier towhen  if ever  will things improve  jonathan haidt  a psychologist at n y u   is not optimistic  he emailed why two of the most insightful people on evolved human behavior are leda cosmides and john tooby  professors of psychology and anthropology at the university of california  santa barbara cosmides and tooby explore the complexities and ambiguities of moral reasoning in their seminal essay groups in mind  the coalitional roots of war and morality  which concludes on an appropriately ambiguous note in a lengthy email that i cannot fully do justice to in this column  tooby wrote that everybodythis  in turn  encourages evolved mental programs that support self advantageous information warfare  of all the signals an individual hears  and out of all the spontaneous thoughts that teem in our minds  each individual filters  remembers  and broadcasts what benefits her in building up herself and her allies  and downgrades those who are her rivals tooby added  i think we cannot begin to appreciate how immense and all encompassing this process is tooby pointed to group pressure to adopt down the line agreement on issues when there is  in fact  much room for dissent and disagreement even more important  he writes leda cosmides expressed some of her ideas about the connection between us and them thinking and evil  the topic with which i began this column  in an interview that was originally published in a chilean newspaper in 2001 and still resonates she went on this work is far from done .

 attorney general william p  barr said he will deliver the mueller report to congress and the public within a week  reiterating his earlier promise to release it by mid april  testifying before the house appropriations committee on tuesday  mr  barr said he would be transparent about redactions in the report  but he demurred when asked whether he has briefed the white house on it  the justice department inspector general expects to finish an examination of aspects of the russia investigation by may or june  mr  barr revealed  mr  barr has tried to keep the appropriations hearing focused on the departments proposed  29 2 billion budget  which includes money for 100 new immigration judges as president trump hardens his stance on immigration along the southwestern border mr  barr  hit immediately with questions about his handling of the mueller report by democrats  reiterated his vow to be as transparent as possible and said that he will turn over a redacted version of the report to congress and the public within a week mr  barr went over the categories of information he says he must black out  like information that is subject to grand jury secrecy rules  and said that whatever he censors in the report  he will identify the reason this process is going along very well and my original timetable of being able to release this by mid april stands  he said  and so i think that from my standpoint  within a week i will be in a position to release the report to the public representative jos e  serrano  democrat of new york and the head of the appropriations subcommittee that covers the justice department  pressed mr  barr to say whether the special counsel  robert s  mueller iii  or his staff had played any role in drafting or reviewing two letters that mr  barr sent to congress late last month about the report  mr  barr said that the special counsel had not participated in writing those letters  nor seen them in advance  though he gave mr  mueller the chance to see his letter summarizing the investigations main findings the letter of the 24th  mr  muellers team did not play a role in drafting that document  although we offered him the opportunity to review it before we sent it out and he declined that  mr  barr said  the letter on the 29th  i dont believe that that was reviewed by mr  mueller or that they participated in drafting that letter representative nita m  lowey  democrat of new york and chairwoman of the full appropriations committee  pressed mr  barr to say whether the white house has seen or been briefed on the contents of the mueller report beyond what was in his letters about it to congress  but mr  barr refused to answer ive said what im going to say about the report today  he said  ive issued three letters about it  i was willing to discuss the historic information of how the report came to me and my decision on sunday  march 24  when he wrote a four page letter to congress laying out the special counsels top line findings but ive already laid out the process that is going forward to release these reports hopefully within a week  he added  im not going to say anything more about it until the report is out and everyone has a chance to look at it in the past  justice department officials have said that mr  barr had not shown the white house any part of the mueller report or briefed mr  trumps team about its contents  his demurral on tuesday raised the possibility that the situation has shifted and the white house knows more than the public or congress about what mr  mueller said democrats who lead the house appropriations committee were eager to press mr  barr on what one called the elephant in the room  his handling of the highly anticipated special counsels report the american people have been left with many unanswered questions  serious concerns about the process by which you formulated your letter  and uncertainty about when we can expect to see the full report  mr  serrano said in his opening remarks i think it would strike a serious blow to our system and yes to our democracy if that report is not fully seen  he added democrats have criticized mr  barrs decision to share mr  muellers top line findings in a four page letter that quoted sparingly from the report itself and his declaration that mr  trump had not committed an obstruction of justice offense after mr  mueller declined to make a prosecutorial judgment  they renewed their complaints after the new york times revealed last week that some of mr  muellers investigators have complained that mr  barr failed to fully represent their findings and that they were more damaging for the president than the attorney general indicated on tuesday  they had their first chance to level criticism in person  ms  lowey called mr  barrs handling of the mueller report unacceptable and questioned how quickly he summarized the findings in his march 24 letter even for someone who has done this job before  she said  referring to mr  barrs first stint as attorney general in the 1990s  i would argue it is more suspicious than impressive batting back democrats criticism  mr  barr insisted that he had accurately delivered the bottom line conclusions of the special counsels investigation in his letter to congress and warned that attempting to quickly summarize the report more fully would have exposed him to a minefield of potential criticism asked about the timess reporting on frustrations among some of mr  muellers investigators about the narrow scope of his letter laying out their findings  mr  barr appeared unswayed i was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize  mr  barr said  because i think any summary  regardless of who prepares it  not only runs the risk of being under inclusive or over inclusive  but also would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once each page of the report was marked that it might contain secret grand jury material and could not be readily released anyway  he said  he also said he had asked the intelligence community to review the report for any information that might compromise their sources and methods of intelligence gathering and would thus need to be redacted but he did not address his decision to step in and make a judgment on whether mr  trump illegally obstructed justice after mr  muellers team conspicuously did not republicans tried to help mr  barr hammer home the reports top line findings the conclusions were simple  no collusion  no obstruction  said representative tom graves  republican of georgia  ignoring mr  muellers statement that the investigation did not exonerate mr  trump of obstruction and that it found no criminal conspiracy between any trump associates and russias election interference mr  graves added  is there anything new you have seen that would change your conclusions mr  barr responded  there is nothing to suggest to me that the conclusions have changed  the letter speaks for itself  congress waits as barr blacks out parts of the mueller report  one of the key reasons mr  barr has said he must black out portions of the mueller report before showing it to congress is a federal rule of criminal procedure that forbids justice department officials from disclosing grand jury information to outsiders on its face  that rule  known as 6 e   makes no exception for congress  there are exceptions to the rule  however  particularly if a judge issues an order permitting the material to be disclosed  that happened in 1974  when a judge overseeing the watergate grand jury permitted the evidence it gathered to be sent to the house judiciary committee  which had opened an impeachment inquiry into president nixon but the executive branch in 1974 supported sending the evidence to congress  mr  barr was asked whether his justice department would be willing to join a similar motion to allow congress to see the grand jury material that mr  mueller gathered but mr  barr said he has no such intention  he said if house judiciary committee members want to see that material  they can ask the judge the chairman of the judiciary committee is free to go to court if he feels one of those exceptions is applicable  mr  barr said  adding  my intention is not to ask for it at this stage  i mean  if the chairman has a good explanation of why 6 e  does not apply and his need for the information  im willing to listen under pressure to give congress the entire text of the mueller report  mr  barr repeatedly reminded his critics that he is operating under rules written by clinton administration officials to prevent a repetition of the whitewater monica lewinsky scandal  where ken starr gave lawmakers a long report that contained detailed narrative description of the evidence  including lurid sexual details and extensive legal analysis of potential crimes by the president mr  barrs point seemed to be  if you have a problem with this process  blame the clinton democrats this whole mechanism for the special counsel  as i said  was established during the clinton administration in the wake of ken starrs report  mr  barr said  thats why the current rule says the report should be kept confidential  because there was a lot of reaction against the publication of ken starrs report and many of the people who are right now calling for release of this report were basically castigating ken starr and others for releasing the starr report mr  starr  the independent counsel leading the clinton investigation  was operating under a now defunct law that gave him the authority to send a report directly to congress  the republican controlled congress promptly made the whole thing public that experience helped persuade members of congress of both parties that the independent counsel law should be permitted to lapse in 1999  but there was still a need for some kind of mechanism for prosecutors with a degree of independence to investigate potential high level executive branch wrongdoing under then attorney general janet reno  the clinton administration issued the special counsel regulation that governed mr  muellers investigation  among other things  it called for the special counsel to write a confidential report for the attorney general  who would then relay his own report to congress saying the investigation was over  in short  those rules did not envision a lengthy report from mr  mueller going to congress and being published for the public to read  in any form you will recognize that im operating under a regulation that was put together during the clinton administration and does not provide for the publication of the report  mr  barr said  but i am relying on my own discretion to make as much public as i can representative matt cartwright  democrat of pennsylvania  assailed mr  barr and the justice department for declining to defend the affordable care act in federal court in texas  where a judge recently struck down the sweeping health care law as unconstitutional mr  cartwright accused mr  barr of putting the weight of the justice department behind a political effort to invalidate the law and warned that it could result in millions of people losing their health care coverage mr  barr did not dispute that he had decided to no longer defend the law but told mr  cartwright that he had nothing to worry about if he thought that the department had taken such an outrageous position because the government was likely to lose the case in question  let the courts do their job  mr  barr said republicans have challenged the law in various court cases since it was passed nine years ago  late last year  a federal judge in texas struck down the law on the grounds that its requirement that americans buy health insurance was unconstitutional  the justice department had said last summer that it would no longer defend that mandate  and broadened its attack on the law last month  telling a federal appeals court that it believed the entire law should be invalidated if the court accepts that argument  millions of people could lose health insurance  mr  barr declined to speculate about the impact of the justice departments decision not to defend the law  though he acknowledged that it could end with no plan in place for those who depend on the law to maintain coverage the exchange underscored mr  barrs sweeping view of executive power and that the attorney general ultimately answers to the president  though the justice department generally defends the law in any challenges to it  mr  barr indicated he was willing to make an exception in a case where the president asked for something different so long as it was legally defensible mr  barr is requesting an additional  72 1 million for immigration enforcement  an amount that would fund 100 new immigration judges  at a time when mr  trump has hardened his stance against illegal immigration and asylum seekers  over the past two days  he has purged top immigration and security leaders to accelerate that goal while the additional judges will provide some relief from a critical backlog in the immigration courts  mr  barr said  he also said that an influx of cases constrains our ability to manage the backlog of cases  and other reforms are necessary the justice department oversees the nations immigration judges  who are separate from the judicial branch mr  barr also said that attacking those transnational criminal organizations is a high priority for the department and noted that the justice department is asking for more than  140 million in budget increases at the f b i   the drug enforcement administration and elsewhere to address drug crimes the justice department inspector general intends to complete by may or june his investigation into aspects of the russia inquiry  including whether law enforcement officials abused their surveillance powers to spy on a trump campaign aide  mr  barr said the inspector general  michael e  horowitz  has been examining how the f b i  and justice department obtained a secret warrant in october 2016 to wiretap carter page  a former trump campaign foreign policy adviser  republicans have accused law enforcement officials of improperly obtaining the warrant because they relied in part on democratic funded opposition research compiled by christopher steele  a former british intelligence officer who was also an f b i  informant  in seeking permission from the secretive foreign intelligence surveillance court to surveil mr  page as part of his investigation  mr  horowitz is also scrutinizing the f b i s relationship with mr  steele mr  barr also said he was studying the f b i s decision to begin investigating ties between russia and mr  trumps campaign during the 2016 election  mr  barr said  he said he was trying to get his arms around all the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation .
washington  it would most likely resemble the aftermath of a major natural disaster  food shortages  skyrocketing prices  people out of work and a plummeting stock market while president trump sees shutting the border with mexico as punishment for its failure to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants  economists warn that the move would effectively paralyze the united states economy given the huge volume of bluejeans  cars  flat screen tvs  avocados and other goods that cross the border every day mr  trump does not see it that way  in a series of tweets in recent days  the president has blasted mexicos immigration policies and erroneously claimed that shutting the southern border would save the united states money  given that the country buys more goods from mexico than it sells to it next step is to close the border  the president tweeted on sunday  this will also help us with stopping the drug flow from mexico if mexico doesnt immediately stop all illegal immigration coming into the united states through our southern border  i will be closing the border  or large sections of the border  next week  the president wrote on friday while mr  trump has repeatedly frightened business leaders by threatening to terminate the north american free trade agreement  which facilitates trade around the continent by cutting tariffs and streamlining regulations  shutting the southern border entirely would be far more destructive nearly  1 7 billion of goods and services flow across the border daily  as well as nearly half a million legal workers  students  shoppers and tourists  the u s  chamber of commerce said on monday most of us in the trade business thought terminating nafta would be quite a body blow  but what trump is talking about now  shutting the southern border  would be catastrophic  said gary hufbauer  a nonresident senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics  its just absurd if mr  trump were to shut down the border  here is who would pay the biggest price american industries including agriculture and autos rely on mexico for trade  either by selling goods and services into mexico or by using mexican materials in their products  so one of the biggest victims of a border shutdown would be american manufacturing  a sector the president has promised to help the united states imported  349 6 billion of goods from mexico in 2018  and it sent  265 billion back across the border  according to statistics from the union nations international trade center  making mexico the united states largest trading partner after china and canada automakers  who have spread their supply chains across north america  would be among those most affected  shutting the border would lead to sudden disruptions in the supply chains for auto parts  causing car production lines in south carolina  michigan  indiana and alabama to shutter  the change would begin to affect american auto production in less than one week  said ann wilson  the senior vice president for government affairs at the motor   equipment manufacturers association  which represents auto parts makers other industries would be hard hit as well  many manufacturers of flat screen tvs  computer hardware and medical devices are set up south of the border  while the apparel industry sources raw materials like cotton  buttons  zippers and threads from the united states and sews them into finished products in mexico closings would also affect sectors outside manufacturing  including energy  the united states supplies much of mexicos natural gas through pipelines that run across the border  as well as the transportation sector  where hundreds of thousands of american jobs are tied to moving goods to and from mexico through ports and by truck or train over all  some of the worlds biggest multinational companies would be affected  including ford  toyota  boeing and caterpillar  but so would countless small  and medium size businesses that depend on trade to make and sell their products the signing of nafta prompted a huge reorganization in agriculture on both sides of the border  now  consumers in the united states depend on mexican farmers for fresh fruit and vegetables like avocados  tomatoes  strawberries  grapes and mangoes  as well as packaged foods and beer  mexico relies heavily on american soybeans  corn  dairy products  chickens  beef and other goods the development of refrigerated trucks and railroad cars means much of the industry depends on just in time deliveries  if the border were shut down  consumers would most likely see an immediate spike in food prices  and supplies of fresh food could dwindle from grocery store shelves in a matter of days  american farmers would lose a major market  causing a drop in prices for their crops and a potential buildup of their goods in factories  slaughterhouses and grain bins lance jungmeyer  the president of the fresh produce association of the americas  said that mexico supplied more than 60 percent of all american produce in the winter and early spring  and that a shutdown could result in immediate and uncontrollable spikes in prices for items like bell peppers  squash  tomatoes  cucumbers  melons  eggplant  and yes  the beloved avocado  the rise in the popularity of the avocado would not have been possible without trade with mexico  which supplies 80 percent of the avocados eaten in the united states if prices go up for fresh produce  people are going to have to choose between eating healthy or putting other food on their plates  mr  jungmeyer said mr  trump often credits his policies with economic growth  renewed business confidence and a rising stock market  but shuttering the border to legitimate commerce and travel could quickly undermine american growth and productivity  the u s  chamber of commerce said in a statement on monday closing the u s  mexico border would inflict severe economic harm on american families  workers  farmers and manufacturers across the united states  said neil bradley  the chambers executive vice president and chief policy officer it is hard to imagine that such a measure would not prompt a drop in the stock market  which has seized up as the president threatened to withdraw from nafta or put more extensive tariffs on china  that would dent the retirement savings of many americans  as well as affect the ability of companies to raise money in the capital markets once the president breaks the glass once  that casts a lot of uncertainty on the future  said scott lincicome  an adjunct scholar at the cato institute  it would cast a cloud of uncertainty around a commercial relationship that for decades has been almost an afterthought americans often take for granted the fact that mexico is an ally  ready to work with the united states on a range of issues  including water use and drug trafficking  but before nafta went into force in 1994  that future was by no means assured  said phil levy of the chicago council on global affairs if business ties and relations with mexico are strained  border communities in the united states would most likely suffer  from both decreased economic activity and potentially higher costs from crime and migration in mcallen  tex   for example  mexican shoppers make up nearly one third of the roughly  3 2 billion worth of retail sales the city records annually  signaling a grim prospect for city coffers if mr  trump follows through on his threat to shut down the border were impacted at a very personal level in that the people in mcallen  some of them  work in mexico  mcallens city manager  roel rodriguez  said in an interview  adding that 30 percent is a huge number la plaza mall  a simon malls property  is constantly full of shoppers on weekends  and the parking lots are often dotted with license plates from various mexican states  the city and the chamber of commerce spend tens of thousands of dollars advertising mcallen in mexico each year the more global concern would be how it would impact the whole country  because the goods and services that come through the ports of entry  they dont just stay at the border  mr  rodriguez said  the produce  the equipment  the auto parts  so theres a real danger for cities on the border  but it has a greater impact than just the cities on the border salvador contreras  who runs the center for border economic studies at the university of texas rio grande valley  said there was a big risk for large companies with plants in the mexican border town of reynosa  across the rio grande from mcallen  including caterpillar  lg and panasonic if youre a multinational corporation who has  say  an operation in reynosa  and your ability to operate is being impacted  you might question your desire to maintain that plant there  mr  contreras said northern mexican cities that depend on trade with the united states would be devastated by any extended border closing  leading to mass unemployment that could ironically prompt more attempts to cross the united states border  under united states law  asylum seekers can request protections once they reach american soil  meaning border closings could actually encourage more desperate flights across the border if anything  it would promote more poverty in mexico  which would then turn into more pressure on immigration in the u s   mr  hufbauer said .

one clear lesson from the elections of 2016 and 2018 is that president trump and his fellow republican candidates win where white voters are losing ground take a look at the 2018 congressional results in the upper midwest and pennsylvania  states that provided the electoral college votes crucial to trumps capture of the white house john c  austin  the director of the michigan economic center and a senior fellow at brookings  analyzed economic trends in 15 congressional districts that changed hands last year  12 from republican to democrat  three from democrat to republican  in pennsylvania  michigan  minnesota and iowa austin found a striking pattern  in the majority of districts that went from republican to democrat the accompanying graphic reveals the extent to which economic considerations shaped the outcome in these districts the same general pattern emerged in state after state in the recent midterms in september 2018  siobhan hughes and dante chinni of the wall street journal took the 70 congressional races ranked as most competitive by the cook political report  they then ranked the races on the basis of an economic health index created by the institute of international finance of the ten districts ranked highest on economic health  eight were categorized lean republican by the cook political report  and two lean democrat  before the november election  nine of those 10 seats were held by republicans on election day  democrats carried eight out of 10 of these districts mark muro and jacob whiton  both of brookings  worked with john harwood of cnbc to analyze democratic and republican held congressional districts in the aftermath of the 2018 election  their conclusions reinforce the findings of austin  hughes and chinni the key result  the 20 most prosperous districts are now held by democrats  while republicans represent 16 of the 20 least prosperous  measured by share of g d p  the accompanying chart illustrates their analysis the authors calculation of the contribution to the g d p  of every congressional district showed that democratic districts produce  10 2 trillion of the nations goods and services and republican districts  6 2 trillion this trend creates a significant dilemma for trump and the republican party  candidates on the right do best during hard times and in recent elections  they have gained the most politically in regions experiencing the sharpest downturn  electorally speaking  in other words  republicans profit from economic stagnation and decline lets return to john austin of the michigan economic center  in an email he describes this unusual situation succinctly  a rising economic tide tends to sink the trump tugboat  addingcertainly more people and communities that are feeling abandoned  not part of a vibrant economy means more fertile ground for the resentment politics and blaming others for peoples woes  like immigrants and people of color  that fuel trumps supporters in june 2017  austin demonstrated the importance of struggling white communities to the republican party  his study of the 2016 presidential results in the midwest showed how strong turnout among voters in regions facing economic deterioration can help republicans  in that earlier report  austin wrote this pattern is not limited to the united states  there are numerous studies demonstrating that european and british voters who are falling behind in the global economy  and who were hurt by the 2008 recession and the subsequent cuts to the welfare state  drove brexit as well as the rise of right wing populist parties one paper  measuring the effects of economic austerity on pro sociality  evidence from greece  by nicholas sambanis  anna schultz and elena nikolova  political scientists at penn  duke and university college london  found  for example in a july 2018 paper  did austerity cause brexit  thiemo fetzer  an economist at the university of warwick in coventry  england  argues that austerity policies adopted in the wake of the 2008 financial collapse were crucial both to voter support for the right wing populist party ukip in britain and to voter approval of brexit these political movements are strongly and causally associated with an individuals or an areas exposure to austerity since 2010  fetzer writes  examination of economic trends  welfare policy and polling data shows  according to fetzer  thatthere are significant parallels between voting patterns for and against brexit and the patterns in the 2016 and 2018 elections in this country in a separate 2017 paper  who voted for brexit  fetzer and two fellow economists at the university of warwick  sascha o  becker and dennis novy  found that in particular  fiscal cuts in the context of the recent u k  austerity program are strongly associated with a higher vote leave share  this heldthe results here and in england reinforce the conclusion that the worse things get  the better the right does as a rule  as economic conditions improve and voters begin to feel more secure  they become more generous and more liberal  in the united states  this means that voters move to the left  in britain  it means voters are stronger in their support for staying in the european union in his forthcoming book  democratic capitalism at the crossroads  technological change and the future of politics carles boix  a political scientist at princeton  describes how postwar prosperity from 1945 to the mid 1970s led to a liberal international consensus as global competition  outsourcing and later  automation  began to produce significant economic disruption  beginning in the 1970s  this liberal consensus frayed boix writes in the united states  economic adversity helped produce trump  whose inaugural speech  reportedly the handiwork of steve bannon and stephen miller  boix cites as emblematic of the hostility emerging with the fall of liberalism together  the trends described above raise an intriguing question  if the republican party now depends on the votes of those who are falling behind  does the party have a vested interest in economic stagnation and decline i asked scholars and officials at the niskanen center  a washington think tank that recently received favorable coverage for its efforts to resolve contemporary ideological division  whether they thought the republican party has come to recognize that prosperity helps democrats  while economic adversity engenders hostility to immigrants  resentment of liberal elites and animosity among rural voters toward urban america  does this awareness give politicians on the right a motive to support policies and actions that foster government dysfunction and further impair sections of the country that are in decline jerry taylor  president of niskanen  replied to my inquiry by making the case that as conservatives see it  the more visible government dysfunction is  the better  it provides civic education working from this premise  taylor argued that as far as conservatives go taylor disputed the suggestion that republicans consciously or unconsciously labor to frustrate economic growth in rural white america  instead  he said  they are ideologically committed to the belief that economic growth iswill wilkinson  the centers vice president for research  wrote back to me but  in actual practice moving from campaigning to governing  wilkinson continued  trumpswhats more  wilkinson noted this has put the republican party in a painful position  according to wilkinson brink lindsey  vice president for policy  replied to my queries from a somewhat different angle  you dont need conscious intent to produce dysfunction to explain republican governance failures in lindseys view this is not  according to lindsey in addition to the mueller investigation  there are two major factors that will determine the sustainability of the republican partys rotten equilibrium the first  of course  is trump himself  his victory in 2016 was a charlatans ascent  and his presidency has served to sustain distrust in government  fuel  in one sense  for the continued success of charlatans  for the moment  though  his failure to win money for the border wall has punctured his viability as a governing force trumps second  if less heralded  achievement has been to invigorate the democratic opposition  he has inspired an immense  rambunctious  intensely motivated and exceptionally diverse pack of candidates  some prepared  some less so  to dislodge him from the white house .
a 45 year old mexican migrant died on monday in the custody of united states customs and border protection  an event that was sure to intensify pressure on an agency overwhelmed by record numbers of migrant families crossing the border  while its health and safety standards have come under harsh public scrutiny the migrant  who was not identified  had been apprehended on feb  2 by the police in roma  tex   near a port of entry into the united states  and requested medical attention  he was found to have cirrhosis of the liver and congestive heart failure  the agency said in a statement  and was hospitalized twice while in custody  the second time spending two weeks in the intensive care unit of the mcallen medical center  he died there around 9 a m  monday the death came less than two months after 7 year old jakelin caal maquin and 8 year old felipe gomez alonzo also died in the agencys custody  in december  amid three straight months of record breaking numbers of migrant families entering the country  both had shown symptoms of illness after they were taken into custody along the southwest border  and their deaths prompted widespread condemnation from members of congress and the public  the agency soon after announced new medical checks for children  and a temporary infusion of support from other federal agencies  including the coast guard and the united states public health service kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  has requested  800 million from congress to address the influx of migrant children and families  calling it a humanitarian crisis  the money would go toward staffing  supplies and enhanced facilities  among other things the migrant who died monday was apprehended alone for illegal re entry  meaning that he had entered the united states without authorization at least once in the past  according to andrew meehan  an assistant commissioner with the agencys office of public affairs this loss of life is tragic  mr  meehan said in a statement  our condolences go out to the family and loved ones  c b p  remains committed to ensuring the safe and humane treatment of those within the care of our custody many migrants who cross the southwest border  hoping either to request asylum or sneak in illicitly  become injured or ill during their journey to the united states  while others arrive in need of care for chronic or longstanding conditions the demographics of border crossers have evolved significantly in the last decade  putting a strain on c b p s resources  once predominantly single  healthy men from mexico who could be returned home within a few hours  a majority of current border crossers are central americans who cannot be turned back immediately because of legal provisions  many of them request asylum  assuring an even longer stay in federal custody more than 40 percent of migrants apprehended along the southwest border enter through the rio grande valley  where roma is  and where local residents have become accustomed to a heavy presence of border patrol and newly arrived immigrants  recently  though  higher numbers of migrants have been crossing in remote areas  in part as a result of harsh policies introduced by the trump administration  where the lack of resources has been particularly acute encounters with migrants who have come to be in grave danger have also increased  the agency said  including 17 people who had to be rescued on thursday after becoming stranded or overcome by swift currents as they tried to cross the rio grande  the rescues took place near eagle pass  tex   about 200 miles northwest of roma c b p s office of professional responsibility is reviewing the death that occurred on monday  mr  meehan  the agency spokesman  said  the office is also reviewing the deaths of the two children that occurred in december  jakelin caal maquins father has disputed the agencys assertion that she had not eaten or had water for several days before they were apprehended .
welcome to crossing the border  a limited run weekly newsletter from the new york times  like what you see  send this to a friend  if someone forwarded it to you  sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox by manny fernandez in los indios  tex the border wall doesnt get any shorter or stranger than this  giant  pointy topped steel pillars that would seem imposing  if only there were more of them this border fence has exactly 36 burgundy colored beams  they stand alone on a grassy island in south texas where two dirt roads intersect  its open on the left and open on the right  you can walk around the whole thing at a fast clip in 17 36 seconds  a quick lap around a pocket sized piece of americas border security the line that is the border wall here is dotted  it zigs  it zags  it stops  it starts  it stops again  it has corners where it mimics the twists and turns of the rio grande  and it has doors  sometimes  these doors are gates that open when a code is entered on a keypad  sometimes  these doors are full fledged openings  a road cuts into the fence  leaving a gap that essentially gives the border patrol one more thing to worry about the mini wall is the unusual product of two such openings  the fence line in the texas border town of los indios spreads out north of the los indios international bridge  about 20 miles northwest of brownsville  the steel slat wall traces a path parallel to robertson street  in a flat rural landscape of corn and grain sorghum fields  but at the point where robertson street intersects with rio grande avenue  the border wall takes a hard left and flows to the west along rio grande avenue the fence designers created an opening on robertson but also put another one at rio grande  so as the fence turns at this intersection  the two openings create a leftover morsel of wall in the middle  a lonely  taxpayer funded gothic median president trump lamented the various doors in the border wall last week  during a border security roundtable in calexico  calif  he talked about a stretch of fence along the rio grande that had been erected under previous administrations  saying it was not a good looking wall because it had 36 doors that you can drive a truck through so now were filling up those big  those big gaping wounds in this wall and its going to have a big effect  mr  trump said but its unclear if the president was aware of this los indios patch  which was built around 2009  local and federal officials said the funding dried up to close the openings and install gates that would connect the grassy island with the rest of the fencing representative filemon b  vela jr   a democrat who represents brownsville in congress and whose district includes los indios  said the little piece of fence illustrated the pointlessness of a border wall  regardless of which administration built it ive voted against every single piece of border wall funding thats ever come up  and im going to continue to do so  mr  vela said  decisions are being made in washington in terms of where to put fencing that dont make any sense as the president suggested  this strange little spots days appear to be numbered  a border patrol official who oversees the los indios area  henry leo  the patrol agent in charge of the agencys station in harlingen  tex   said plans are in the works to finally install the necessary gates in the next one to three years we did request additional fencing and gates in that area  so what you see right now is not the complete picture  mr  leo said  the plan is to connect to that piece of fencing and make it a continuous fence with gates both mr  leo and the mayor of los indios  rick cavazos  defended the fence in the area  including the stand alone section  saying that overall the fencing had helped decrease illegal crossings  i saw a dramatic decline in crossings and apprehensions as a result of the barrier  said mr  cavazos  who is a retired border patrol agent  in 2004  2005  2006  this was a high crossing area  people would come up from the river  the numbers went down on a hot april afternoon  it was all quiet at the fence island  the loudest sound was the soil  the dry brush  dirt and grass crunches underfoot  the pillars of the fence are as rough as sandpaper  and leave little red flakes on your fingertips that resemble chili powder adding to the head scratching quality of this fence is its location on one side of the fence is america  but the other side is america  too  the fence runs inland  far from the river  the middle of which is the official boundary between mexico and the united states  that means this 36 beam fence in one sense divides the country itself  in that sense  the openings in the fence are necessary  they allow property owners and ranchers to access their land that is north of the river but south of the fence  a region locals call a no mans land here  as much as anywhere  the border patrol is watching  walk around the spot  and

explores years of warnings that the u s  immigration system is broken  or on the verge of breaking  and how it got there read the full story here  by caitlin dickerson  new york times national immigration reporterfirst came the news that homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen had resigned  likely at the request of president trump  then  at least two other high ranking agency officials were pegged for dismissal  all of it happening days after the president had pulled back on his nominee to run immigration and customs enforcement  with mr  trump telling reporters that he had decided to go in a tougher direction its been a whirlwind week on the immigration front  with all signs suggesting that the president plans to triple down on his goal of securing the border  the unusually large number of heads rolling around washington seemed to indicate that anyone with misgivings about the administrations plans will be asked  if not forced  to leave mr  trump is operating under mounting pressure from unauthorized border crossings that are steadily increasing  and hes contending with the painful reality that after 14 months of harsh policies designed to discourage immigration  he  the president who was elected on a promise to crack down on border crossings  has not made a meaningful dent in them to the contrary  whoever fills the now open jobs in his administration will have to contend with record numbers of central american families seeking asylum  all of whom are being processed through a decades old system that is not equipped to handle them  and their efforts will be frustrated by the same set of laws and court settlements that have blocked many of the administrations attempts thus far from going into effect it was those laws that led to the downfall of ms  nielsen  who lost her job because the president felt that she was not hawkish enough  though she became known during her tenure as the public face of many of mr  trumps most controversial immigration policies  including family separation  in private  the two had often clashed when she cautioned him about the legal and logistical constraints that rendered his policy ideas untenable read earlier

los angeles  gov  gavin newsom of california announced monday that he would withdraw nearly 400 of his states national guard troops from deployment along the border with mexico and assign them to other duties the step to rescind state authorization for the border deployment is a sharp rebuke of president trumps continued warnings that undocumented migrants present a national security risk to the united states  it follows a similar move last week by gov  michelle lujan grisham of new mexico under a general order that mr  newsom plans to sign  110 california national guard troops will be redirected to support the states central fire agency  cal fire  and another 100 will work on statewide intelligence operations aimed at international criminal drug gangs mr  newsom is also seeking to expand the states counterdrug task force with 150 national guard troops  which would require funding from the department of defense  this month  were launching a limited run weekly newsletter about life on the border  far from the tug of war of washington politics  sign up here to receive the first issue of crossing the border when it launches  since his election in november  mr  newsom has emphasized a progressive vision for california and the country  pitching his state as a leader on issues like immigration  climate change and income inequality  he promised last month to offer an alternative to the corruption and incompetence in the white house mr  newsom is expected to speak publicly about the redeployment during his state of the state address on tuesday  with sharp criticism of the presidents immigration policies and rhetoric the national guard has had an expanded presence in california since april  when mr  newsoms predecessor  jerry brown  agreed to add 400 troops to shore up border related security at the request of the trump administration at the time  mr  brown stressed that the deployment  which was financed by the federal government  would support efforts to go after criminal gangs  human traffickers and drug smugglers  he said the troops would not be used to enforce federal immigration policies this will not be a mission to build a new wall  mr  brown wrote in a letter to kirstjen nielsen  the secretary of homeland security  and jim mattis  who was secretary of defense at the time it will not be a mission to round up women and children or detain people escaping violence and seeking a better life  mr  brown wrote  adding  there is no massive wave of migrants pouring into california  overall immigrant apprehensions on the border last year were as low as theyve been in nearly 50 years mr  newsom and mr  brown are both democrats  so is governor grisham of new mexico  though the predecessor whose deployment decision she reversed was a republican before the april deployment  there were about 250 national guard troops serving in california  and 55 of them were stationed at the border  under federal law  the troops are paid by the federal government but are under the control of the governor  it was not clear whether federal financing for the troops would continue after mr  newsoms redirection order mr  browns letter authorizing the deployment was largely seen at the time as a denunciation of president trumps immigration policies  but many activists and elected officials in the state sharply criticized mr  brown for agreeing to any guard deployment at all last summer  kevin de len  who was then the state senate leader  urged mr  brown to not be complicit in the administrations hard line immigration priorities  which he called driven by racial animus  mr  de leon  a democrat  drafted the state law limiting coordination between local authorities and immigration enforcement agents  known colloquially as the sanctuary state law  which mr  brown signed in 2017 despite the criticism  mr  brown later extended state authorization for the national guard presence at the border through march 2019 mr  trump initially thanked mr  brown for the deployment  which was part of a national deployment of up to 4 000 troops authorized by mr  mattis  but to the confusion of many californians  mr  trump later blasted the governor for placing limits on what the troops could do looks like jerry brown and california are not looking for safety and security along their very porous border  mr  trump wrote on twitter  he cannot come to terms for the national guard to patrol and protect the border  the high crime rate will only get higher illegal border crossings have been sharply declining for years  apprehensions of undocumented migrants by border patrol agents are near historic lows  and undetected crossings have fallen to 62 000 in 2016 from 851 000 in 2006  according to the department of homeland security  several studies indicate that crime rates are lower among immigrants than among native born americans .
washington  in recent months  kirstjen nielsen  the secretary of homeland security  had become a regular presence eating dinner at the trump international hotel  she had been heckled and booed when dining out after becoming the face of some of president trumps most hard line immigration policies  like family separations  and her affinity for the hotel  a gathering place for the presidents supporters  seemed like a sign that she felt safer on the inside but her status inside the white house  where she was subject to dressing downs from mr  trump during cabinet meetings and constant criticism by the president  was not much more secure so when ms  nielsen went to the white house on sunday night to meet with the president to discuss some grievances  she was also prepared to avoid a messy end by letting mr  trump  who is known for not personally firing people  off the hook  after mr  trump made it clear that he was looking for a change  ms  nielsen told him she would resign  ridding him of a cabinet secretary who had long disappointed him ms  nielsens departure  announced sunday night  was abrupt but hardly unforeseen  the latest in a long and growing conga line of senior officials who have left the administration unceremoniously because of their own frustrations with the president  or because of the presidents obvious disappointment in them  usually  it is both mr  trump has ripped into ms  nielsen  holding her personally responsible for the uptick in crossings at the southwestern border  and ms  nielsen wanted to tell mr  trump that she was upset not to have been notified beforehand about his sudden withdrawal of ron vitiello  the nominee to serve as immigration and customs enforcement director  and that she was frustrated at being pulled from security meetings in europe last week and ordered to appear by the presidents side on a trip to the border  according to someone close to ms  nielsen the end for ms  nielsen was something that has become familiar in the trump administration  a high ranking official like jeff sessions  the former attorney general  or rex tillerson  the former secretary of state  leaving with a reputation in need of rehabilitation normally  people just resign  said ronald a  klain  who served as chief of staff to vice president joseph r  biden jr  the president sends word through an intermediary that hes unhappy  and you resign  the president says something nice about them and then they leave but here  quitting isnt good enough some exits have been more humiliating than others  since the departure of mr  tillerson  mr  trump has referred to him as dumb as a rock and lazy as hell  after calling the departure of his defense secretary  jim mattis  a retirement and praising his service  mr  trump turned on him once he understood that the resignation was an affront to him  whats he done for me  mr  trump said of mr  mattis  how had he done in afghanistan  not too good after years of haranguing mr  sessions in public and in private  mr  trump sent john f  kelly  his former chief of staff  to demand his resignation in november  and he has not let up on him since he left office  in a speech in front of the conservative political action conference last month  mr  trump mimicked mr  sessionss southern accent while discussing his decision to recuse himself from the special counsels investigation into russian meddling during the 2016 campaign mr  kelly later suffered his own ignoble end  after he and mr  trump ironed out a departure plan at the end of last year  mr  kelly planned to make his own announcement at a senior staff dinner at the white house  but the president chose to break the news first  telling reporters that mr  kelly would be departing at the end of december although all involved tried to put the best face on the sunday meeting between mr  trump and ms  nielsen  someone familiar with it said the president had even asked her if she would want to return in another position  the two competed afterward for how to spin its contents within minutes of the meetings end  mr  trump wrote on twitter that ms  nielsen was leaving her position  making it sound as if she was the latest cabinet secretary he had ousted online  ms  nielsen then posted her resignation letter on twitter  notably leaving out any mention or praise for mr  trump mr  trump has yet to criticize her publicly since  but ms  nielsen has already absorbed more than her share of criticism for her role in implementing the presidents policies immigration and civil rights groups have been pressuring fortune 500 companies to blacklist former trump officials like ms  nielsen  who have promoted his immigration policies  writing that they should not be allowed to seek refuge in your boardrooms or corner offices  many other former administration officials have not experienced the post white house career bump that has become part of the payoff for putting in grueling hours on government salaries with a few exceptions  like the smooth send off for nikki r  haley  the former ambassador to the united nations  and a glowing farewell to linda mcmahon  the former administrator of the small business administration  mr  trumps top aides often find themselves damaged by their former boss in real time  or on delay even those who have managed to stay in mr  trumps favor  like mike pompeo  the secretary of state  have a sense of gallows humor about what might ultimately befall them ill be there until he tweets me out of the office  mr  pompeo recently joked at an event in his home state of kansas  when asked about his future in politics for her part  ms  nielsen appears to be intent on trying to minimize the damage to her reputation  with surrogates out defending her record the so called immigration hard liners have flailed about since the beginning of the administration  giving bad advice to the president and misdirecting resources toward the wrong solutions to the wrong problems  said thad bingel  who was a senior homeland security official in the bush administration and served as an aide to ms  nielsen during her senate confirmation they apparently dont want anyone like a secretary nielsen or secretary kelly  who deals in reality  to tell them or the president any of this .
mexico city  president trumps state of the union speech hit hard on a topic that has dominated his term in office  defending the border with mexico against what he described as migrants in large organized caravans he also suggested that the mexican authorities were encouraging the migrants to cross the border illegally we have just heard that mexican cities  in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities  are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection  mr  trump said in his speech tuesday night some aspects of mr  trumps assertions are true but others are unsubstantiated or distorted  there is no evidence  for example  that the mexican authorities are sending migrants to weak points along the border migrants have said they have banded together in large groups  called caravans  because such groups help keep them safe from robberies and other dangers along the trek north through mexico  but their size has drawn the presidents anger and made them one of his frequent targets as the migrants from central america have moved north through mexico  city and state governments have sometimes provided transport with help from churches and local aid groups some small town mayors opt to do this because they have limited resources  and it is easier to arrange transport than to house and feed several thousand people at a time  some state governments provided this type of aid along parts of the route migrants traveled last october and november on their way to tijuana  a busy border crossing station with the united states the stated purpose of the action is humanitarian  and women and children are given priority when space is short mr  trump was most likely referring to recent action taken by the state government of coahuila  across the border from texas  on monday  coahuila officials  with help from local businesses  provided buses for 1 700 members of a migrant caravan that left honduras on jan  14 the state government posted on twitter photos of coahuila gov  miguel riquelme meeting with migrants the night before their journey and then visiting a temporary shelter set up to receive the migrants in piedras negras  just across the border from eagle pass  texas the migrants were driven five hours from arteaga  in southern coahuila  to piedras negras  which has a population of more than 150 000 and does not fit the definition of a remote unprotected border area there is no indication that the transport provided by cities or states is deliberately targeted at areas lacking border protection  on the contrary  the mexican authorities prefer to help migrants reach border cities with adequate shelter space mexicos federal government is not providing transport of any sort to migrants in a statement on tuesday  kirstjen m  nielsen  mr  trumps homeland security secretary  said that the government was prepared for the caravans arrival illegal entry will not be tolerated  and we stand ready to prevent it  she said  the department of homeland security  dhs  has been working with the departments of state  defense and justice to ensure all possible resources are available to address this lawless caravan most of the migrants have said that they hope to apply for asylum in the united states through legal routes .
she was 49  a recent immigrant and deeply in debt to a loan shark back home in china when she answered an employment ad three years ago that promised thousands of dollars a month  but offered no job description  she realized too late that she had been tricked into working at a massage parlor in flushing  queens  where besides kneading backs  she was expected to sexually service up to a dozen men a day some of the clients were violent  and the boss charged  10 a day for her to sleep on a sofa in a room at the parlor where rats nibbled on her food  the customers were very terrible  said the woman  who  ashamed of the stigma of her former profession  asked that her name not be used  after you perform a service  they would find an excuse to take the money away  they would  she said  do even worse things in strip malls across the country  neon signs and brightly colored placards promise hot stones  acupuncture and shiatsu with photos of women or couples receiving relaxing shoulder rubs  but a traditionally asian form of therapeutic relaxation with deep roots in big city chinatowns has spun off a different kind of massage parlor that has little to do with traditional remedies  it has exploded into a  3 billion a year sex industry that relies on pervasive secrecy  close knit ownership rings and tens of thousands of mostly foreign women ensnared in a form of modern indentured servitude  read more about a thriving sex trafficking trade in florida  the frequently middle aged women who work in parlors with names like orchids of asia and rainbow spa are often struggling to pay

them further in the shadows  with some of them rotated every 10 days to two weeks between spas operated by the same owners  forced to pay for their own supplies and even their own condoms  many women must sleep on the same massage tables where they service customers and cook on hot plates in cramped kitchens or on back steps we stopped thinking about just cages  bars and chains as the means of coercion  said john richmond  the state departments top anti trafficking official  they are using nonviolent forms of coercion the recent arrest warrant filed against robert k  kraft  owner of the new england patriots  and the solicitation charges filed against nearly 300 men in multiple jurisdictions as part of the same case  riveted national attention to a stretch of highway 1 along floridas treasure coast dotted with strip malls  gas stations and sapphire ocean views  across the region  parlors were empty and many frequent clients were phoning their lawyers  wondering if more warrants were going to drop law enforcement officials said there were an estimated 9 000 illicit massage parlors across the country  from orlando to los angeles  the epicenter of this national underground is the bustling chinatown in flushing  in the new york city borough of queens  women  typically chinese  but also korean  thai and east european  arrive at kennedy international airport  learn the trade and are sent out to places like virginia  iowa  texas and florida  women are recruited locally through ads in chinese language newspapers or over the social network wechat flushing is the center of this network  said lori cohen  the director of sanctuary for families anti trafficking initiative  which has interviewed around 1 000 massage workers over the past five years and helped the 49 year old immigrant who was sexually assaulted leave the business after she was arrested  they are showing up in different parts of the country  but all of them have addresses in flushing  queens  she said  read  an epic tragedy in the underground sex industry in flushing  the women are paid just a sliver of the  60 or more the client pays for an hourlong massage  their real money  and chance at a better life  comes in the form of tips  which they are encouraged or forced to amplify through illegal means a 60 year old former massage worker from taiwan  who agreed to be identified only by the nickname she commonly uses  tina  said she was lured into working at a massage parlor in new york a decade ago by the travel agency broker who helped secure her visa to travel to the united states  people come here and dont have a place to live  she said  these places offer a place to live  and it seems like a nice idea  they say  its not safe to keep your passport on hand  and they will ask to hold the passport she was arrested several times before getting out of the business  and feels comparatively lucky  one close friend was spirited to texas by traffickers  she said  had her passport taken and was forced to see eight to 12 customers a day  one day the tearful calls she often received from her friend came to an abrupt halt a lot of the businesses that look like either nail salons or massage places  especially the places that offer massage  there are bad things happening there  she said  its 100 percent organized crime the ubiquity of the massage parlors offers an accessibility and sheen of normalcy not offered by traditional brothels  and as the massage parlors have expanded even into small town america in recent years  meticulously detailed review sites like rubmaps have served as the yelp and foursquare of the illicit parlor business  with graphic anatomical descriptions of the women and explicit breakdowns of the sexual services proffered even at illicit parlors  owners and managers can claim ignorance of the additional services offered by employees behind closed doors  the evidence gathered during raids and searches often tells a far different tale  the police say it is common to find ledgers tracking the number of dates women have had  as was found in a bust in dallas in 2016  in one case in kansas  a search of the premises yielded a notebook with handwritten chinese english translations that included sexually explicit phrases such as did you bring condom and happy ending a federal law enforcement official  speaking on the condition of anonymity because this person is involved in active cases  said that the most common method for smuggling women from asian countries was either a fraudulent tourist visa or a fraudulent work visa  such as for nursing work  many came as students  then overstayed to work in the sex industry many women arrive in the united states from china bearing heavy debt burdens and try to find work in restaurants or nail salons  but the money isnt good enough for the five figure debts weighing them down  the massage jobs are presented as opportunities for fast  easy money they will talk about how they used to work in a restaurant and it was really hard physically and they couldnt make that much money  and then they heard from somebody or saw an ad saying they could make a lot more money in a massage parlor  said leigh latimer  a supervising attorney at the legal aid societys exploitation intervention project in new york one reason the asian massage parlors remain so poorly understood is the extreme reluctance of the women to speak with the police and even with their own lawyers even though ive represented many  many women arrested in unlicensed massage parlors  because of the level of distrust of people working  almost all immigrants  almost all undocumented  they dont trust even their attorneys enough to let them know whats happened to them  ms  latimer said some fear retaliation by traffickers to their families in china  and some feel morally indebted to those who helped find them a job  said chris muller  the director of training and external affairs at restore nyc  an anti sex trafficking organization this is a powerful exploitation tactic  he said  any favor is implied there is going to be a payment back  look at what i have done for you  i found you a job  i found you a place to live and this is how you repay me small networks of spas are also common  and their ownership structures are complex and opaque  its rare that you have a mom and pop business where theyre just running one  said lt  christopher sharpe of the new york police departments vice section  usually if theyre running one  they have a second or a third business bradley myles  chief executive of polaris project  a nonprofit that works to combat human trafficking  said that the madams arrested on big raids like the recent ones in florida  known as mamasans  are often women in their 60s and 70s who have spent decades in the sex trade but are usually pretty far down in the organization above these site managers is usually a person who appears on paperwork as the massage parlor owner  but is often just a frontman running a shell company  the payouts from the shell company go to what is legally known as the beneficial owner very little is known of the behind the scene owners  mr  myles said  they are hiding behind shell companies  hiding behind mamasans  they are hiding behind fake people in addition  the networks have groups of drivers that help move the women from place to place  some networks are only two or three layers deep  others four or five ive certainly seen indicia of larger networks and indicia of powerful transporters  said the federal law enforcement official the florida department of health disciplined 62 massage parlors or therapists last fiscal year  up from 14 the year before  records show  the agency receives upward of 300 complaints about unlicensed massage facilities each year department inspection reports described women inside the spas living in tight quarters cluttered with essentials  including rolling bath carts stuffed with toiletries  shelves lined with coffee mugs and cooking pots and stashes of assorted snacks  the women slept on individual cots and in some cases appeared to keep their belongings and blankets inside locked plastic trunks their ids showed that several of them had addresses outside florida  including in flushing  n y   lilburn  ga   san gabriel  calif   and temple city  calif those who are arrested are not necessarily left to their own resources  when sheriffs deputies in martin county  fla   were interviewing lixia zhu  48  one of the massage parlor employees arrested two weeks ago  it wasnt long before a new york lawyer arrived and identified himself as her lawyer  the lawyer  baya harrison iv  told the new york times that ms  zhu used to work in new york and that her friends had hired him to defend her the county sheriff  william d  snyder  said ms  zhu had tearfully told deputies and a public defender about how her passport was kept from her in a locked safe and how the woman she worked for once threatened her by brandishing a gun one woman in the florida sting has been charged with human trafficking  after police officers conducting surveillance saw her shuttling two other women carrying suitcases in and out of a spa in vero beach bob houston  a former f b i  agent who now works as a consultant to combat trafficking  said that thai traffickers often employ elaborate schemes to help women intended for the massage industry apply for tourist visas  the traffickers create false back stories  giving women the appearance of an established life at home  including a spouse and bank account  all to help them qualify for a tourist visa  they even produce fake diplomas from massage schools  the tab is usually  40 000 to  60 000  he said they owe a bunch of money to the people who recruited them  he said in december  36 people in minnesota were convicted for their roles in a thai sex trafficking ring that shuttled hundreds of women from bangkok to cities across the united states  including phoenix  las vegas  atlanta and minneapolis the women  referred to as flowers by the criminal organizations  were forced to work at massage parlors with no choice about where  when and with whom they performed sex acts until their debts were paid off  they were permitted to move around outside the parlors only with so called runners working for the organization  evidence in the case showed the decision by law enforcement in florida to focus on patrons of the establishments in such a public way rather than the women working there has generated a lot of fear among clients john musca  a criminal defense lawyer with an office in vero beach whose website advertises sex crime defense  said he has received panicked phone calls from many men who frequented the establishments and are worried that the police are about to come knocking there are a great number of folks who are on pins and needles  mr  musca said .

washington  president trump said on friday that his administration was strongly considering releasing migrants detained at the border into mostly democratic sanctuary cities  suggesting that the idea should make liberals very happy because of their immigration policies we are looking at the possibility  strongly looking at it to be honest with you  he said on friday in response to a question about the proposal we might as well do what they always say they want  mr  trump said if democrats do not agree to new immigration policies  well bring them to sanctuary city areas and let that particular area take care of it  he said  adding that california welcomed the idea of more people coming to the state we can give them a lot  we can give them an unlimited supply  he said the comments came a day after the administration said the policy proposal was never seriously considered  but after the presidents twitter posts on friday  a white house spokesman said democrats should work with the administration to welcome migrants into their districts democrats say we must have open borders and that illegal immigrants have a right to be in this country at all costs  the spokesman  hogan gidley  said  adding  so they should be working with the administration to find the best ways to transport those illegal aliens that are already set for release  into communities in their districts and states democratic lawmakers do not want open borders  as the president has suggested  they favor improving border security  but they do not support many of mr  trumps hard line immigration policy proposals  such as building a wall along the southwestern border last year  trump administration officials had floated the idea of transporting migrants to sanctuary cities  which do not strictly adhere to federal immigration laws  as a way to address the influx of migrants crossing the border with mexico one of the highest profile sanctuary cities is san francisco  home to speaker nancy pelosi  who is one of the presidents top political rivals and a thorn in his efforts to change american immigration laws  the white house raised the proposal again in february  suggesting it could punish democrats for rejecting budget requests for border security ms  pelosis office condemned the trump administration for the idea  which the department of homeland security said on thursday was ultimately rejected but mr  trumps tweets on friday indicated it was not off the table  and the president appeared to revel in the democratic outrage  saying  the radical left always seems to have an open borders  open arms policy  so this should make them very happy senator edward j  markey  democrat of massachusetts  a state with several sanctuary cities  criticized the presidents proposal trumps plan to release migrants into enemy cities as if they are some kind of contagion is reprehensible  mr  markey tweeted  trump is obsessed with the border and sanctuary cities because he only wins by dividing people there has been an influx of migrant families crossing the southern border into the united states  exceeding the staffing and resources available for immigration enforcement  and with a shortage of space in shelters and detention centers  immigration officials have been releasing migrants into the country as they wait to appear before an immigration court  those courts are so backlogged with cases that it can be months or years before the migrants are called to appear before a judge a top immigration official at the department of homeland security pushed back last year against the proposal to release migrants into sanctuary cities  and said it would create an unnecessary operational burden on immigration and customs enforcement currently  these migrants are released into border towns  transporting them to sanctuary cities  which are scattered across the country  with some as far away as massachusetts and vermont  would come at a great expense typically  reallocating homeland security funds intended for a specific purpose would require approval from house and senate appropriators some immigration advocates saw mr  trumps proposal as an attempt to stoke racial tensions across the country george gascn  the district attorney for san francisco  said the proposal was the clearest sign yet that the president fully intends to chart a path to re election on the back of racist rhetoric and policies intended to divide us janet murgua  the president of unidosus  formerly the national council of la raza  called the proposal reprehensible it seems that not only is president trump attempting to utilize human beings  who have already experienced a traumatic situation  as tools to get back at political foes  but as a vehicle to further divide communities by stoking racial tensions  she said in a statement .

mr  trump has escalated a misleading defense of his administrations practice of breaking up families to outright revisionist history  there is no law that mandates family separation  let alone a law enacted under mr  obama  the practice is the result of a policy enacted by the trump administration  and ended by mr  trump last june last year  as the trump administration faced backlash over its policy  top officials countered that mr  trumps predecessors had also separated families at the border  that was misleading  while previous administrations did break up families  it was rare  for example  in cases where there was doubt about the familial relationship between a child and an accompanying adult  according to former officials and immigration experts neither former presidents george w  bush nor barack obama had a policy that had the effect of widespread family separation  sarah pierce of the migration policy institute told the times last june  nothing like what the trump administration is doing has occurred before  she said the bush administration introduced a program in 2005 that also referred for prosecution immigrants illegally crossing the border  but it made an exception for parents with children  the obama administration in 2014 detained families together  drawing its own criticisms and lawsuits under mr  trump  the justice department announced its zero tolerance policy for illegally entering the united states in april 2018  describing it as new and in response to an increase in unauthorized border crossings that spring  the policy called for the criminal prosecution of everyone who enters the country illegally  as a result  nearly 3 000 children were forcibly separated from adult family members who were detained under the new policy that multiple top trump officials have characterized as a deterrent after widespread condemnation from lawmakers in both parties  immigration activists and the united nations  mr  trump signed an executive order in june that attempted to end the practice of family separation  it did not rescind the zero tolerance approach toward prosecuting migrants  but said it is now the policy of the trump administration to keep families together at the white house on tuesday  mr  trump said that his administration would not revive family separation as a practice  but he added  when you dont do it  it brings a lot more people to the border  curious about the accuracy of a claim  email factcheck nytimes com .
welcome to crossing the border  a limited run weekly newsletter from the new york times  like what you see  send this to a friend  if someone forwarded it to you  sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox by kirk semple in ciudad jurez  mexicoin 1994  franklin pupos father fled cuba by way of central america and mexico  before settling in las vegas now  25 years later  mr  pupo is following roughly the same path incredible  said mr  pupo  40  marveling at how his familys history was repeating itself i spoke with mr  pupo and his wife  yaima garca  37  this week in an evangelical church that had been converted into a temporary migrant shelter  the building  a cinder block warehouse that previously served as a hardware store  was tucked in a scrappy  semi industrial neighborhood of this border city in northern mexico the couples journey had come to an abrupt halt here a month ago when their quest for sanctuary in the united states ran up against the cold realities of the border  they are now among many thousands who are waiting in ciudad jurez and other border cities for their chance to apply for asylum in the united states its a quirk of current migratory patterns that mr  pupo and ms  garca also find themselves among many other cuban asylum seekers in ciudad jurez  by the estimates of government officials  as many as 70 percent of the more than 3 000 migrants waiting here to apply for asylum across the border in el paso  are cuban in other border cities  those waiting to cross are mostly central americans the cuban always tries to be in a group  ms  garca explained  i see it as a form of protectionhow ciudad jurez came to be the preferred crossing point for cubans remains a mystery  but migrants say that it has the reputation for being safer for migrants and less crowded with asylum seekers than other popular crossing points  word traveled through the cuban migrant grapevine  in whatsapp messaging groups  by phone and on social media while cubans have been a common sight for years on the migrant trail through mexico  their numbers rising and falling in response to events back home and shifts in american policy  the flow appeared to pick up in recent months officials here in ciudad jurez said they began registering a sharp increase in the number of cuban asylum seekers in late fall the cubans  by and large  say they are fleeing political repression in the caribbean nation  cubans seeking sanctuary used to get special treatment in the united states  under a policy known as wet foot  dry foot  cubans who made it to american soil were allowed to stay and eventually apply for permanent residency  but the obama administration halted those privileges in january 2017  and since then cuban asylum seekers have been like everyone else in ciudad jurez  they have run up against a trump administration system that limits the daily number of asylum seekers allowed to present their cases at ports of entry  this practice has given rise to informal waiting lists in border towns so  the cubans and others are biding their time  in migrant shelters  in budget hotels and in cheap  rented rooms  and suppressing the impulse to hire a smuggler and cross illegally mr  pupo and ms  garca left cuba on feb  6  flew to panama and traveled overland to mexico  arriving in ciudad jurez on march 1 and finding their way to solus christus church the shelter is overseen by lilia and rodolfo barraza  who opened its doors to migrants on feb  26 after local officials appealed for help in absorbing the flow of asylum seekers into the city mr  barraza  65  a pastor  said that initially he had been inclined to say no  but he remembered a biblical passage that described the moral obligation to do good and when i thought of that biblical verse  i said  bring them  mr  barraza recalled  and the next day they were here the couple has hosted as many as 74 migrants at one time  jammed into a space suitable for far less  there are currently 38  all but one of them cubans   the exception is a venezuelan woman  ms  barraza  61  said that before they had opened their doors  she had never met a cuban  but now i think theyre beautiful  she said  we love them  they are our brothers and sisters the symbolic focus of the space is a white board on which is written the waiting list number of the last migrant allowed to cross the border and present themselves to the american authorities  a migrants number in line has become almost as important as any other piece of data in their life when a migrants number is called and they successfully cross  its a bittersweet moment for those who remain behind  they lose a traveling partner but move one step closer to their own appointment it could be a week  two weeks  a month  ms  garca mused on a recent afternoon at the shelter the number on the board was 6995  her number is 7533  mr  pupos is 7534 for now  mr  pupo added  this is our refuge kirk is one of a team of

largest detention center has swelled in recent weeks amid an influx of migrant families from honduras  guatemala and el salvador  the processing center in the border city of mcallen has frequently exceeded its capacity  leading to mass releases of migrants that have overwhelmed nonprofit shelters the building  known informally as ursula because of its ursula avenue address  has been criticized by immigrant advocates for holding migrants in large pens made of chain link fencing   manny fernandez  the new york times houston bureau chief  spoke to senator jon tester  a montana democrat who spent more than an hour touring the ursula facility last week the following is an edited and condensed version of the conversation q  what was it like a  i was there on sunday  march 24   im not going to talk to you like most democrats will talk to you  im going to tell you that  when i walked in there  it ripped your guts out  it made you cry  it did all those things that people say it did to you  because you had children and you had mothers  i looked at them as kids the same age as my grandkids  on the other side of the equation  there were a lot of people in a fairly small area  and the ventilation had to be pretty darn good because it didnt stink how many migrants were there at the time twenty two hundred  and their capacity is 1 500 did it feel overcrowded or just crowded gosh  youre asking the wrong guy  because this is the first time ive been in that processing center  it felt crowded can you describe it its a metal building thats insulated  each one of the holding areas had a bathroom and a sink  theyre held by sex  of course  and then the families were held in different steel cages  basically  everybody had a blanket that wanted one  mylar blankets  most of them were laying down on mats  some of them were standing up  some of them were sitting on benches what were border patrol officials saying about all this they said they were processing them through as quick as they could  they said the manpower they were using here was manpower that theyd rather have on the border  but nonetheless they had to process these folks  look  i mean  i dont like prisons  i dont like holding people up  but the bottom line is that i dont have any better idea than the way they were doing it  and i asked them if they did and they didnt either  although they were tasked with trying to find a better way to do it  they were providing food and water and baby formula  and were treating these folks as good as they could treat them  in the conditions that were there  im simply just not critical of border protection in this situation because i dont know what the solution is some democrats were calling the mass releases a manufactured attempt to fuel the crisis at the border narrative  do you agree i dont think i can agree with it  look  im not a conspiracy theorist  i think i have to go with what i saw  and what i saw literally was a bunch of families in this facility and i think it is what it is right now  the direction i would take it is  what are the push factors in these countries that are pushing these families to our southern border was border patrol cooperative during the tour they were absolutely cooperative  ive been on these trips before  and i know for a fact they show you want they want you to see  but they were very cooperative were the conditions horrible  beauty is in the eye of the beholder  i guess  i dont think they were horrible  but by the same token it was gut wrenching to see mothers and children sitting there in cages it sounds like it was packed but people still had some room i dont know how many square feet each person needs to determine whether it was overflowed or packed or beyond the pale  i just know as i looked there  there was some space and people could mill around  although it was very crowded  it would drive me crazy  my nearest neighbor is a mile away  it would drive me nuts president trump visited a portion of the border wall in california on friday  a day after backing off a threat to close the border with mexico the president  floated the idea of closing the border last week  defending it repeatedly here and here  even as economic experts warned doing so could damage the economy  the agricultural and manufacturing industries would have been especially hard hit by a closing  including a potential avocado shortage  instead  on thursday  mr  trump said he would give mexico a one year warning before closing the border if the drugs dont stop or arent largely stopped  were going to put tariffs on mexico and products  in particular cars  the whole ballgame is cars  he said  and if that doesnt stop the drugs  we close the border read earlier installments of crossing the border here

san antonio  president trump used the backdrop of a texas fund raiser on wednesday to warn of the dangers and tragedy of migrants flowing across the mexican border  an issue he predicted would play well for him in his 2020 re election campaign with high dollar donors standing behind him  mr  trump said migrants pouring across the southwestern border were dying in great numbers while gang members arriving from central america were marauding and threatening american ranchers  and he made clear that he was going to try to put the blame on democrats i think theyre going to pay a very big price in 2020  mr  trump said here  before heading to houston for another fund raiser  i think the border is going to be an incredible issue  and theyre on the wrong side  they want to have open borders but julin castro  the former mayor of san antonio and a democratic candidate for president  fired back at mr  trump  accusing him of using such talk as a political tool to energize his voters with dark threats about immigrants it was predictable that he would start beating the drum of this again as he gets closer to re election  mr  castro said in an interview  what ive noticed is that any time he gets into political hot water  he goes back to the issue of immigration to drum up support mr  castro  who served as housing secretary in the obama administration  is uniquely positioned to take on mr  trump on the immigration issue  the grandson of a mexican immigrant  he is the only latino candidate in the race for the democratic nomination as the sun set wednesday evening  mr  castro held an immigration focused rally of his own in san antonio  his campaign had billed the event as an opportunity for the city  with its significant mexican american population  to show its resistance to mr  trumps immigration policy before a modest crowd  mr  castro denounced mr  trumps anti immigrant message in no uncertain terms  calling the presidents policies downright stupid when it comes to immigration  mr  castro said  this president and his policies have been an absolute failure for our country the presidents decision to weigh in on the border was a clear signal that he did not intend to let the issue fade  at the fund raiser  he told reporters that he wanted to call attention to a situation that he said has been ignored in the news media  the plight of migrants who cross illegally into the united states and then die of thirst or hunger this doesnt come out in the fake news  mr  trump said as he recounted the stories about migrants that about a dozen donors told him  at mr  trumps urging  several of the donors described finding the bodies of migrants  including pregnant women and children  in the vast brush of their property the president said he had never heard such stories of migrants dying  even from his top immigration and border patrol officials  in fact  immigrant advocates have for years documented the grim fate of some migrants who grow sick and die trying to make it into the united states  the advocates say mr  trumps policies have made the problem worse by limiting the number of migrants who can legally claim asylum at ports of entry  pushing more to cross at remote areas of the border several of the donors also told of how afraid they had felt when migrants from central america  dressed in black  turned up at their homes dangerous people are coming here  and the good people are dying  mr  trump said  adding that the donors had all told him that the answer to the problem was to build the wall that has become the symbol of his approach to immigration the president  who was joined at the round table with donors by brad parscale  his 2020 campaign manager  denied that the unscheduled remarks to reporters about the border were part of a campaign message  but immigration and border security has been a defining issue of his presidency  and mr  trump is betting that portraying the crisis that he says now exists on the mexican border will be just as effective in his re election campaign as the issue was in 2016 in the past several days  mr  trump has forced out kirstjen nielsen  his homeland security secretary  and several other top immigration officials for being too timid about shutting down the border and changing asylum rules to deny entry to migrants seeking protection in the united states one of those officials  ronald d  vitiello  the acting chief of immigration and customs enforcement  resigned on wednesday after mr  trump pulled back his nomination for the permanent position  saying he wanted someone tougher  in a statement issued on her last day in office  ms  nielsen called mr  vitiello an unwavering advocate for the dedicated men and women who enforce our immigration laws a top administration official said tuesday that the staffing changes were meant to make way for more aggressive immigration actions  sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  but the president faces challenges of his own  his campaign promises have mostly gone unfulfilled  he has largely failed to build the big beautiful wall along the southwestern border as he promised  and the recent surge of migrant families from central america is a vivid demonstration of his inability to stop what he has called an invasion there was also significant evidence during the 2018 midterm elections that the presidents immigration attacks backfired in some republican districts around the country  for example  several house republicans  including some of the partys leaders in congress  complained to mr  trump that his announcement right before the election that he was considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship might have cost several moderate republicans their seats and as he sets out for the re election campaign  mr  trump is certain to face several challengers among the democrats who are determined to make the presidents immigration agenda a key part of their reason for running  in february  beto orourke  a former congressman from el paso who has since declared his own candidacy for president  outlined his opposition to mr  trumps immigration policies at a rally held at the same time the president spoke in that texas border city we are not safe because of walls but in spite of walls  mr  orourke told supporters even as mr  trump was pressing to finish the wall the dual candidacies of mr  castro and mr  orourke are almost certain to place texas squarely at the center of the increasingly heated immigration debate texas is a latino state  and we have two texans on the ballot who are going to be turning out and galvanizing people from texas  said mayra macias  a vice president of the latino victory project  but its also helping galvanize people  latinos in particular  across the country because they are seeing these candidates talk about issues that affect us but if immigration is at once a key campaign issue in texas and other states  including california and arizona  republicans are betting that mr  trumps anti immigrant message will also resonate far from the border .
kevin k  mcaleenan  the commissioner of united states customs and border protection  will become the acting secretary of the department of homeland security  president trump said in a tweet on sunday the announcement came shortly after mr  trump said kirstjen nielsen was leaving the position  ending a tumultuous tenure in charge of the agency  which oversees border security  among other duties  she had taken the job in late 2017 mr  mcaleenan  47  will oversee an agency that has at times been a target of the presidents dissatisfaction over an increase of migrants illegally entering the united states at the southwestern border i have confidence that kevin will do a great job  mr  trump said in his tweet in her resignation letter  ms  nielsen said she hoped the incoming secretary would have the support of congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure americas borders and which have contributed to discord in our nations discourse mr  mcaleenan has a law degree from the university of chicago and practiced law in california before he worked for the government  he held a variety of positions at the border protection agency before becoming its deputy commissioner in 2014 under the obama administration  he won the countrys highest civil service honor  the presidential rank award  in 2015 mr  mcaleenan became the acting commissioner of the agency in january 2017 and was formally sworn in as commissioner in march 2018  he focused on counterterrorism  border security and trade enforcement  oversaw about 60 000 employees and managed a budget of over  13 billion  according to the agency as the nations top border enforcement officer  mr  mcaleenan also helped carry out the trump administrations zero tolerance policy to prosecute parents caught crossing the border illegally  which led to family separations  that policy was reversed  but the effects remain  in court documents filed on friday  the government said it might take federal officials two years to identify what could be thousands of immigrant children who were separated from their families at the border in an interview in august  mr  mcaleenan said that a better system would allow us to keep families together for the entirety of the immigration proceeding  which takes an average of 45 days he added that there should be a penalty for crossing the border illegally its not a victimless crime  he said  not only are the people at risk  so are our agents who need to apprehend or rescue them  its also a diversionary tactic for smugglers who use family groups to tie down our agents while drugs are moved behind them mr  mcaleenan said his job as the agencys commissioner was to enforce laws  not make them last month  mr  mcaleenan was the public face of new government data showing that unauthorized entries at the southwestern border were reaching record breaking numbers  more than 76 000 migrants crossed the border without authorization in february  an 11 year high the system is well beyond capacity  and remains at the breaking point  he told reporters  adding that this is clearly both a border security and a humanitarian crisis at a senate hearing last month  he suggested ways to address that crisis  the united states government should support governments in central america to improve economic opportunities there  he said  and work with the mexican authorities to clamp down on transnational criminal organizations that prey on migrants and we must invest in border security  he said  a modern border barrier system  additional agents and officers  additional technology at and between ports of entry  and air and marine support  and we must also have a whole of u s  government approach to address childrens unique medical needs and the undeniable humanitarian challenges we are facing .

it may take federal officials two years to identify what could be thousands of immigrant children who were separated from their families at the southern united states border  the government said in court documents filed on friday a federal judge had asked for a plan to identify these children and their families after a report from government inspectors in january revealed that the trump administration most likely separated thousands more children from their parents than was previously believed these families were separated before the administration unveiled its zero tolerance immigration policy in the spring of 2018  when nearly all adults entering the country illegally were prosecuted and any children accompanying them were put into shelters or foster care to identify these families  the government said it would apply a statistical analysis to about 47 000 children who were referred to the office of refugee resettlement and subsequently discharged  according to the court filing  from there  the government said it would manually review the case records of the children who appeared to have the highest probability of being part of the separated families officials estimated that the process would take at least one year and potentially two  in explaining the reason for such an arduous process  the government said united states customs and border protection did not collect specific data on migrant family separations before april 2018 lawyers representing the office of refugee resettlement did not immediately respond to requests for comment on saturday in a court filing for the government  jonathan white  a commander with the united states public health service commissioned corps  wrote that identifying this group of children presented new challenges because they were already discharged from the office of refugee resettlement  meaning the government lacks access to them the statistical analysis was required because manually reviewing the cases of nearly 50 000 children would overwhelm the offices resources  he wrote the governments proposed plan arose from a class action lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of california  in june  judge dana m  sabraw ordered the reunification of children and parents who had been separated under the trump administration policy  president trump rescinded the policy that same month about 2 800 children have been reunified with their families or situated according to their parents wishes  said lee gelernt  who challenged the policy in court on behalf of the american civil liberties union the january report  by the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services  revealed that a group of separated families was unaccounted for because the government lacked an effective tracking system  in march  judge sabraw ruled that those families should be included in the litigation mr  gelernt said this identification process should take months  not years  if the government believed finding these children was a priority  they could do it quicker than two years  mr  gelernt said the families the government may now be tasked with locating are those who entered the united states on or after july 1  2017  the earliest known date that families were separated  were detained by immigration officials  and have a child who was detained and then released to a sponsor  such as a relative  before the judges reunification order on june 26  2018 when the government previously identified children for reunification  it included only the children who were detained at the time of the reunification order judge sabraw wrote in his march 8 order that because all of these families had been subjected to the same policies and had been separated under questionable circumstances  they should have the same opportunity for relief  although identifying the families may be burdensome  as the government argued  it clearly can be done  the judge wrote according to the governments proposed plan  officials would update the a c l u  about the families information after completing the analysis and reviewing the childrens cases  the organization would then use that information to help reunify parents and children mr  gelernt said a two year wait to reunite families would be devastating  the longer these children remained separated from their families  he said  the more psychological trauma they would endure  he said the a c l u  planned to argue against the proposed plan in court the family separations were a central part of the trump administrations effort to deter migrant families from trying to enter the united states through its southern border with mexico data released last month suggested that the administrations immigration measures  including the separation policy and attempts to beef up border security and limit who qualified for asylum  failed to deter tens of thousands of migrants traveling to the united states  most of whom were escaping violence and poverty in central america .
washington  kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  said on monday that cyberthreats against the united states were a national security crisis that she described as her top priority  not the situation for which president trump last month declared a national emergency on top of my list of threats  that many of you can guess  the word cyber is circled  highlighted and underlined  ms  nielsen said in a speech outlining her departments focus in the coming year  the cyberdomain is a target  a weapon and a threat vector all at the same time mr  trump has called the increasing flow of immigrants to the southern border one of the most urgent national security issues threatening the united states  last week  issuing his first veto against legislation that would have blocked him from diverting defense department funds to build a border wall  the president described a recent spike in migrants crossing the border as an invasion the department of homeland security oversees customs officers and immigration agents who are on the front lines of the trump administrations campaign to close the border to illegal immigration ms  nielsen did dedicate a portion of her speech on monday to what she called a humanitarian and security catastrophe of central american families traveling to the border  she also noted that the projected number of migrants who may be apprehended at the southern border this month was expected to rise to 100 000  up from 76 000 in february but mentions of digital threats were dispersed throughout her approximately 35 minute address to an auditorium of various department of homeland security officials among global jihadists and transnational criminals  ms  nielsen listed cyberthugs and hackers and resurgent nation state rivals as an emerging threat to the united states  she asked two cybersecurity officials who helped safeguard the 2018 elections to stand for a round of applause ms  nielsen also assailed president vladimir v  putin of russia and the kremlin for a concerted effort to undermine our elections and our democratic process using cyberenabled means  and she said the average american citizen or company was no match for virtual threats from russia  china  north korea and iran i am more worried about the ability of bad guys to hijack our networks than their ability to hijack our flights  ms  nielsen said  i am concerned about them holding our infrastructure hostage  stealing our money and secrets  exploiting children online and even hacking our democracy john cohen  a former acting under secretary for intelligence during the obama administration  said law enforcement could no longer look at the threats in the digital world and the physical world as separate issues  extremist groups now circulate videos on the internet to inspire terrorist attacks  and drug traffickers are using the dark web  something ms  nielsen also highlighted in her speech mr  cohen said he remained unclear on how ms  nielsen proposed combating cybersecurity threats there is an incredible amount of talent at d h s   said mr  cohen  also a senior adviser at the agency during the george w  bush administration  my concern is that talent and those capabilities are being underutilized  because in the eyes of many at the white house  the sole purpose for d h s  is to conduct its immigrant and border security activities ms  nielsen said the department was focused on increasing collaboration with the private sector  citing a summit meeting held in new york last year for industry and government officials  she said she expected the cooperation between various homeland security agencies to improve when the department consolidates at a former mental hospital next month she praised the departments work in defending the integrity of the 2018 midterm elections and said she was confident in her departments ability to secure the 2020 presidential vote  ms  nielsen also said homeland security would continue to pursue prosecutions against foreign entities that hack the american digital infrastructure what worries me  though  is not what these threat actors have done  ms  nielsen said  but what they have the capability to do .
calexico  calif   president trump traveled to this small border town two hours east of san diego on friday to highlight what he and his aides say is an out of control crisis caused by a surge of central american families who have overwhelmed law enforcement facilities at the border just a day after retreating from his threat to shut down the entire border with mexico  mr  trump accepted a plaque from border agents and sheriffs in front of a 30 foot tall section of border wall  the physical embodiment of his immigration agenda  and met with border officials  lawmakers and administration officials at the border patrol station here were really making progress at letting people know this is an emergency  the president said  its a colossal surge and its overwhelming our immigration system and we cant let that happen critics argue that the wall is not a solution to the surge of families that have arrived in recent months since most of the families are not trying to sneak into the country undetected  on the contrary  most are seeking border patrol agents to turn themselves in  either at the ports of entry or between them but mr  trump insisted on friday that his efforts to seal off the border from undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers was necessary because we dont have room  that means you cant take em i dont think anyone has ever expressed it like that but i am expressing it like that  mr  trump added  when its full  its full asked on thursday night why the president was not using the national emergency he recently declared to seek funds to provide humanitarian relief to the families who have been apprehended recently  kirstjen nielsen  the secretary of homeland security  conceded that the focus on the wall is  partly  a stunt well  i think part of that is just a  its an optic  she told chris cuomo  the host of cuomo prime time on cnn  to have the president stand in front of the wall indicates immediately to any viewer that hes at the border  but i think his message will be about the dual crisis and how we need congress to act  to give us the authorities to address mr  trump  however  hailed what he called the tremendous impact of the wall in calexico and said that his administration expected to build 400 miles worth of wall in the next two years in fact  the small section of wall that mr  trump stood in front of  next to a field of solar panels  is not evidence that the president is building the wall he repeatedly called for during his 2016 presidential campaign but merely an upgrade to an existing section of fencing  the two mile section was completed in october  sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  weeks after declaring a national emergency at the border because congress refused to fund construction of his border wall  mr  trump recently threatened to close the legal ports of entry between mexico and the united states  potentially disrupting billions of dollars worth of trade and halting the travel of a half million people each day but on the eve of his trip here  mr  trump backed down in the face of hard criticism from the business community and top officials in his own party  senator mitch mcconnell  the republican leader  predicted that a complete border shutdown would have a potentially catastrophic economic impact on the country mr  trump responded on thursday by initially saying he would give mexico a year to stop central american migrants from traversing mexico on their way to the united states  he added that if mexico did not do its part  he would first impose tariffs on mexican cars before shutting down the border later in the day  mr  trump denied that he had put off a border shutdown for a year  saying that it could still happen if he decided that mexico was not doing enough to keep migrants from traveling to the united states well start with the tariffs and see what happens  he said in his visit here  mr  trump thanked mexico for deporting migrants at its southern border  which he said they have never done before in three decades  and suggested he had delayed closing the border because of their heightened efforts but it is false that mexico only recently began enforcing its southern border at mr  trumps urging  according to data  experts and the mexican government  marcelo ebrard  mexicos foreign minister  told reporters on tuesday that mexico had been consistent in its immigration policies it deported 40 000 to 190 000 migrants every year from 2011 to 2016  data from segob  mexicos internal affairs agency  shows  in 2016  mexico deported nearly 150 000 migrants from honduras  el salvador and guatemala compared with 107 000 deportations of migrants from those three countries in 2018  in the first two months of 2019  mexico deported more than 13 000 migrants from the countries contrary to mr  trumps repeated claims this week  mexicos immigration laws are not harsher or stronger than the united states  illegal crossing are decriminalized in mexico and considered a minor offense  experts said they were not aware of any changes in the laws or enforcement practices on the contrary  the discourse of president lpez obrador has been more humanitarian than that of the former president  granting work permits and making efforts to find last minute shelters  said karla a  valenzuela  a professor at ibero american university in mexico city who specializes in migration dr  valenzuela said an uptick in detentions and removals in recent weeks was not necessarily indicative of intensified enforcement  but rather more linked to increased flows from central america meanwhile  the presidents re election campaign released a video on friday blasting democrats for their position on the border  a clear indication that mr  trump intends to use the issue of border security for his political benefit  no matter the facts on the ground the video shows leading democratic presidential candidates  including beto orourke  senator kamala harris and senator elizabeth warren  mocking the idea of a wall at the border we do not need any walls  mr  orourke is shown saying  the headline in the video says  bluntly  democrats do not want to keep americans safe and adds  its time for democrats to stop playing political games with national security a response from the democratic national committee assailed the presidents visit as nothing more than a photo opportunity to try and build nonexistent support for his unnecessary and ineffective border wall instead of doing anything to address the issues that matter most to the people of calexico  trump is actually making things worse  the committee said .
 read the latest edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  federal immigration officials appear to have cleared out an enclosure under a bridge in el paso where they were detaining hundreds of families of asylum seekers  following an outcry over the conditions at the site but authorities appeared to have shifted some processing of migrants to another site on the other side of the bridge  using a military style tent near an existing processing facility operated by customs and border protection  a smaller number of migrants could be seen at that site late sunday afternoon separately  a spokesman for customs and border protection said on sunday that the agency was in the process of transferring all of the illegal aliens being held temporarily at the original enclosure under the bridge to a processing station in northeast el paso  the spokesman said that the decision was made to relocate to a location with more space and more shelter capability the border agency contended last week that it had no choice but to hold the migrants in the outdoor location  surrounded by fencing and razor wire  because of overcrowding at processing facilities in el paso brought on by a surge in central american migrants applying for asylum kevin mcaleenan  the commissioner of customs and border protection  addressed journalists last wednesday near the enclosure when he claimed that the countrys immigration enforcement system was at a breaking point criticism over the bridge enclosure had been building all week  with reports of children sleeping on trash strewn gravel at the site under the paso del norte bridge  some migrant families stayed inside a military tent set up at the site  others remained outside even as nighttime temperatures dipped into the 40s the american civil liberties union said on sunday that the detention of migrants in outdoor pens was an unprecedented and extreme violation citing interviews with families held under the bridge  the a c l u  said it had received reports that agents had verbally and physically harmed migrants  forced them to stand for prolonged periods and deprived them of sleep and access to medical care  and had failed to provide the migrants with adequate food and water some families were detained under the bridge for as long as four days  the a c l u  said  adding that families with infant children were told to sleep on the ground and were not provided with any bedding  mats or chairs we are demanding an immediate investigation by the inspector general into abuses inflicted on asylum seekers by border patrol agents in the outdoor facilities  said shaw drake  policy counsel for the a c l u s border rights center migrants have since been transferred to undisclosed locations  he said  adding that the agency has not told us or members of congress where migrants are now being held and under what conditions local political leaders and human rights groups said that a sharp increase in asylum seekers should have been foreseeable  as part of an annual surge in border crossings before the arrival of the deadly summer heat immigration officials were already scrambling to respond to a shifting profile of migrants arriving at the border with mexico  border patrol apprehensions remain well below their peak of 1 6 million in the 2000 fiscal year  but they have been climbing lately  reaching 467 000 in the 2018 calendar year  the highest figure in six years  and more of them are now central american families seeking asylum rather than single men from mexico federal immigration officials claim that legal rulings have created loopholes that make it more attractive for central americans to apply for asylum in the united states this status quo is not an option  andrew meehan  assistant commissioner for public affairs at customs and border protection  said in a statement on saturday  the legal framework must be addressed  he said  repeating the administrations calls for congress to address asylum laws  the only remedy to this crisis is congressional action advocates for immigrants said the federal government was obligated by law to humanely process asylum requests  and could have avoided the need for migrant families to spend days on end in the holding pen if they wanted to prepare for this  they could have done so  said fernando garcia  director of the border network for human rights  an organization in el paso  the administration could have redirected resources  assigned more asylum agents  looked at what was happening on the ground immigration authorities in el paso have asserted that detention facilities were overwhelmed in the city  as in other places along the border  mr  mcaleenan said that the border patrol was temporarily reassigning about 750 inspectors to care for newly arrived central american families in its complaint to the inspector general  the a c l u  questioned why the border parol was resorting to holding migrants under the bridge when its budget had grown to  16 7 billion in 2019 from  7 1 billion in 2006  the border patrols work force has also expanded  the civil liberties union said  reaching 19 555 in 2018  compared with 9 212 in 2000 .
once more  president trump stands ready to dazzle with his willingness to sacrifice the national interest on the altar of his political whims for days  the president has been indulging in one of his made for tv teasers by threatening to shut down the united states mexico border  not beef up the border patrol  not tighten security at ports of entry  just hang up a closed sign and call it a day as the white house tells it  the failures of mexico and congressional democrats to stop illegal crossings have left the president no choice  the influx of drugs  criminals and other undesirables has reached the point where drastic action is required mr  trump is nothing if not a man of drastic action  or at least ominous vows of drastic action dismayed critics have rushed to object that shutting the border will do nothing to solve the humanitarian strains caused by the flood of migrant families from central america  that such a move will  in fact  make things only worse by disrupting the legal flow of people and commerce  wreaking social and economic havoc such warnings are spot on  they also miss the point  in threatening to shut down the border  mr  trump isnt looking to solve a crisis  his primary aim is to make life unpleasant for those who have crossed him  or simply had the misfortune to get in his way in politics  as in life  there are fixers and there are punishers  fixers shine a light on problems or injustices and work to find ways to resolve them  theirs is a constructive vision  one that values cooperation and pragmatism and getting stuff done punishers  too  are about spotlighting problems  a skill at which they may excel even more than fixers  but punishers arent looking to make things right so much as to find someone to blame  and chasten  for the perceived wrongs neither party holds a monopoly on either category  charlie baker  the republican governor of massachusetts  is a fixer  ilhan omar  the freshman democratic house member from minnesota  is fast establishing herself as a punisher  president barack obama was a fixer  while the entire house freedom caucus sprang from the conviction that anyone willing to work with mr  obama should be cast into the abyss  punished with extreme prejudice  as it were punishers have their charms and their purpose  and whether you see them as avenging angels or vengeful demagogues often depends on whether you share their particular worldview  but every now and again  along comes a punisher so wanton that he rattles even members of his own team  mr  trump is one of this rare breed the desire to crush those who displease him is a defining characteristic of this president  when challenged  his impulse is to lash out  preferably with personal  degrading insults  this has been on most vivid display with the myriad investigations into sketchy presidential behavior  but it also has been a hallmark of mr  trumps approach to key policy issues  border security  health care  trade  you name the debate  mr  trumps answer is to stake out his position  vowing pain and regret for those who do not embrace it on sunday  the acting white house chief of staff  mick mulvaney  went on television to rub democrats noses in the growing border tumult and defend the presidents closure threat  we hate to say we told you so  he said  we need border security  and were going to do the best we can with what we have he also dismissed questions about the wisdom of mr  trumps plan to end financial aid to el salvador  guatemala and honduras  complaining about the troubled nations failure to stop their people from fleeing north  mr  mulvaney brushed off administration experts who have cautioned that cutting aid would further destabilize the countries  likely worsening the migrant crisis translation  fine  no one will give us a border wall  well show you the meaning of chaos the presidents fans cheer his pugilism  as though he was bravely defending himself  and them  against big  bad bullies  but all too often  the price is paid by the innocent and vulnerable  migrant children snatched from their parents at the border  federal workers thrown into financial turmoil by the government shutdown  farm workers and manufacturers caught up in the trade war  the millions of americans who stand to lose their health insurance if the administration keeps laboring to kill obamacare  for mr  trump  anyone who stands between him and his objective becomes collateral damage  and pity those considered part of an unfriendly demographic  such as the people of puerto rico  whom the president dismisses as a tool of the democratic party and mistreats accordingly  as the senate has worked this week to hash out a comprehensive disaster relief package  mr  trumps contribution has been to fire off a series of obnoxious  dishonest tweets charging that corrupt or incompetent island officials have wasted epic levels of relief funding and are now hot for democrats to give them more  taking dollars away from our farmers and so many others  disgraceful  a white house spokesman  hogan gidley  subsequently appeared on tv with a spirited defense of his bosss broadside against that country  as for those who actively defy the president  the goal is not simply to punish them for a single transgression but to discourage them from future rebellions  deliver a painful enough lesson  and everyone will fall into line  .
palm beach  fla   president trump said on friday that there would be a very good likelihood that he would seal off the united states border with mexico next week  even as he moved to punish guatemala  honduras and el salvador for migrant caravans by cutting off all foreign aid to the countries the moves escalated a sustained berating of countries he blames for being unable to stop the flow of migrants trying to make their way north i will close the border if mexico doesnt get with it  mr  trump said to reporters who had gathered at mar a lago  his winter retreat in florida  if mexico doesnt stop it at mr  trumps direction  the state department on friday began the process of informing congress that it intended to end the foreign aid  a person with knowledge of the decision said that mr  trump met with secretary of state mike pompeo on thursday  after which diplomats were directed to begin the process of cutting off the funds by drafting letters to lawmakers  mr  trump publicly said as much on friday in comments to reporters no money goes there anymore  mr  trump said  were giving them tremendous aid  we stopped payment the state department issued a statement late on friday saying  at the secretarys instruction  we are carrying out the presidents direction and ending fy 2017 and fy 2018 foreign assistance programs for the northern triangle  we will be engaging congress as part of this process mr  trump has threatened to close off the border and cut off aid to the three countries  known as the northern triangle  several times before and has not followed through but his comments on friday signaled a new escalation and a diplomatic assault on americas neighbors in the hemisphere as his administration confirmed that it would review ways to reshuffle border patrol agents  shut down traffic lanes and close ports of entry at the southwest border  he began the day with a morning tweet saying that he would close the border next week  and then told reporters that he was prepared to close off trade and commercial ports of entry a full or partial sealing of the border would effectively close off the united states from one of its largest trading partners  but it could leave american citizens who cross back and forth with a sluggish or potentially nonexistent system of returning to the united states im not playing games  mr  trump said on friday  as he threatened to close the border with mexico  sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  the president has been emboldened since the release of a report by the special counsel  robert s  mueller iii  found that his campaign had not cooperated with the russian government  and a partisan upholding of his national emergency declaration over a wall along the southwestern border has prompted mr  trump to ratchet up harsh words against immigration as he seeks to galvanize supporters ahead of the 2020 presidential election as he engaged in multiple photo opportunities throughout the day  mr  trumps actions and comments indicated that his mind was not on the scenes at hand but on immigration how are we doing at the border  he asked a military official on a tour of lake okeechobee  the site of a restoration project in the central part of the state  during a meeting at mar a lago to announce that linda mcmahon  who has led the small business administration  had resigned  he again turned to immigration we have the most laughed at immigration laws of anywhere in the world  mr  trump said to reporters as he and ms  mcmahon sat in the ornate front room of the club  theyre the democrats laws  and i got stuck with them mr  trumps decision to end the aid to the central american countries is likely to anger members of congress from both parties  who have supported spending money to try to address the root causes of the violence that has caused migrants to flee those countries to come to the united states currently  the united states spends about  620 million a year for gang prevention programs and other initiatives aimed at helping support civil society in the three countries  advocates say that cutting the funds will only accelerate the migrant flows into the united states but the president has repeatedly expressed anger that the united states sends money to the countries even as caravans of migrants make their way to the border in an email from the director of the office of u s  foreign assistance resources on friday night  senior state department and united states agency for international development officials were instructed to redirect all 2018 assistance away from these countries and to cease and desist all 2017 spending already started the email sent state department officials scrambling to carry out the presidents order  it was unclear how quickly the funding would cease since the governments had not yet been notified formally of the decision it is also unclear whether the department can redirect all of the money to other parts of the world  some of the money meant for the 2017 fiscal year has already been allocated to specific contracts  so it might not be able to be withdrawn  according to a person familiar with the effort mr  trump told reporters that he would consider shutting down ports along the border  a decision that could imperil the transit of goods between the united states and mexico  according to government figures  mexico is the united states third largest goods trading partner  with  557 6 billion worth of products flowing across the border in both directions a move by mr  trump to shut down or drastically curb trade with mexico would pose significant risks to the american economy  it would also represent a stunning reversal in trade relations between the two countries  which last august put their differences aside to renegotiate their portion of the north american free trade agreement  the new deal  known as the united states mexico canada agreement  still needs to be approved by congress the president lamented that mexico was making a fortune off the united states  and said mexicos immigration laws were the strongest immigration laws of anywhere in the world   mexico is much weaker than the united states at enforcing its border laws   mr  trump also again invoked migrant caravans  including one containing hundreds of people heading to the united states  as a reason mexico needed to act mexico is tough  mr  trump said  if they dont stop them  were closing the border americans would feel the effects in other ways  border control agencies are already reviewing ways to slow down immigration processing at the border  a senior homeland security official confirmed on friday that shutting down ports of entry along the southwest border was on the table to handle the surge in migrants seeking asylum kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  said in a statement that she had asked volunteers to add more support at the border  and suggested that american citizens may encounter difficulty getting through as a result make no mistake  americans may feel effects from this emergency  ms  nielsen said  as personnel are reallocated to join the crisis response effort  there may be commercial delays  higher vehicle wait times at the border and longer pedestrian lines she added that despite these impacts  we cannot shirk our responsibility to the american people to do everything possible to secure our country while also upholding our humanitarian values stephen h  legomsky  a law professor at washington university in st  louis  said there were a few options available to mr  trump if he wanted to move to stop the flow of people at the border  including slowing down processing at ports of entry  the administration has already limited the number of migrants who can apply for asylum each day he could pretend that this was necessary in the interest of national security  mr  legomsky said  and it could be that the courts would be hesitant to second guess a national security claim by a president mr  legomsky said putting up trade roadblocks and slowing down the processing of people would have harmful effects  both on american citizens who could find themselves marooned in mexico and on families  including groups of women and children  who are fleeing violence and poverty theres a huge humanitarian concern  mr  legomsky said  so many of the people are these central american mothers and children fleeing from high levels of violence  they would be effectively stuck in the border areas which are also extremely dangerous on thursday  the president said that he did not share concern over the plight of people in danger  in front of supporters at a rally in grand rapids  mich   he used harsh language to describe the thousands of people who have tried to flee violence and poverty  calling the problem an invasion and referring to asylum seekers as a big fat con job in a news conference in el paso on wednesday  kevin mcaleenan  the commissioner of customs and border protection  said that an influx of migrants had reached a breaking point in february  there were 76 000 crossings at the border  which marked an 11 year high and signaled that the trump administrations harsher policies have not stopped the flow of people trying to enter the country the threat to close the border is one that mr  trump has made previously but not carried out  but he has not yet attached a deadline by which he would take such a drastic measure  and did not respond to reporters who asked on friday whether he would set one the homeland security official said the trump administration had not yet decided to shut down a major port  but that the department had been forced to divert agents from ports of entries and interior checkpoints to handle large groups of migrants trying to illegally come into the united states  including families .
el paso  beto orourke officially kicked off his campaign for the democratic presidential nomination saturday morning  quoting the rev  dr  martin luther king jr   raising populist themes and praising the way immigration has enriched el paso and the nation speaking at a downtown rally near the border with mexico  mr  orourke said that his hometown  el paso  its embrace of immigration and its rich ties with mexico represented the best of the american experience  adding that the challenges facing the country presented a moment of truth quoting dr  king  he said el paso and its mexican neighbor of ciudad jurez were caught in an inescapable network of mutuality  tied in a single garment of destiny he added  this is a campaign for america  for everyone in america  sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race  his words and the setting on the street that connects el paso with ciudad jurez symbolized what his campaign said would be one of mr  orourkes themes  a unifying vision for bridging divides to unite americans from all walks of life but the speech by mr  orourke  a former three term member of congress  comes at a time of extraordinary discord over immigration  with a surge of migrants trying to enter the united states and president trump threatening to seal off the border next week el paso has been a flash point for much of that unrest  with hundreds of migrants now being held in a makeshift encampment under a bridge near where mr  orourke was speaking the encampment  where immigration officials are detaining people behind razor wire with little hot food  was set up last week when el pasos main border processing center reached overflow capacity following the largest influx of migrants in years acknowledging the plight of the migrants  mr  orourke said  let us remember that every single one of us  including those who are just three or four blocks from here detained under the international bridge  behind chain link fence and barbed wire  they are our fellow human beings and deserve to be treated like our fellow human beings mr  orourke  who also held rallies saturday in houston and outside the states capitol in austin  stressed not only immigration but also health care  education  climate change  criminal justice reform  the economy  voting rights and racial inequality  all are topics that have emerged as major issues in the effort by democrats to unseat mr  trump in 2020  check out our tracker of the 2020 democratic candidate field  this is our moment of truth and we cannot be found wanting  he told the enthusiastic crowd  the challenges before us are the greatest of our lifetimes  an economy that works too well for too few and not at all for too many more  a health care system where millions are unable to see a doctor or be well enough to live to their full potential and the last  best hope of averting the catastrophe that will follow climate change  fading before our very inaction  we must overcome these challenges mr  orourke was introduced by his wife  amy orourke  an educator  the couples three children also attended mr  orourke has been campaigning for two weeks  often in impromptu sessions in cafes or intimate town halls  but this was billed as his first major public event and opportunity to present the broad themes of his campaign speaking extemporaneously for 34 minutes  gesticulating as he walked around a stage set in the middle of the street  mr  orourke hit particularly hard on access to health care and prescription drug costs when one of the largest providers of mental health care services is a county jail system  and in a nation that is in the midst of a maternal mortality crisis  three times as deadly for women of color  let us ensure that universal health care means we can see a primary care provider  all of us can get mental health care  and that universal health care means that every woman makes her own decisions about her own body  he said he also called for better pay for teachers  lets pay them what theyre worth  and a world class public school system from pre k to 12 the crowd of several thousand supporters included marta lopez  71  a retired state worker from el paso  who had come wearing a black and white beto t shirt weve lived here all our lives  and i feel we dont need a wall  said ms  lopez  adding that she admires mr  orourkes positions on immigration as well as his pledge not to accept pac money several supporters of mr  orourke said they were intimidated by a gantlet of pro trump protesters blocking their way to the rally they were just very confrontational and yelling scary stuff at us  said thelma ramos  38  of el paso  who came with her 13 year old daughter mr  orourke  46  grew up in this texas border city  the son of a local political figure and a furniture store operator  he had little name recognition until last year  when he became a national figure during his unsuccessful effort to unseat senator ted cruz  a republican with a progressive sheen and grass roots appeal  mr  orourke set fund raising records in that senate campaign  he continued that record setting pace in the 24 hours after announcing his white house ambitions two weeks ago  raising more than  6 1 million online in one day  that outpaced the  5 9 million collected by senator bernie sanders of vermont in his first day some recent polls place mr  orourke third in popularity among democrats expected to be in the race  behind former vice president joe biden  who has not yet announced his intentions  and mr  sanders and if his style is entirely different from mr  sanders  he hit many similar themes for too long in this country  the powerful have maintained their privilege at the expense of the powerless  he said  they have used fears and division in the same way that our current president uses fear and division .
there are two countries that ive been professionally  emotionally and intellectually involved with my entire journalism career  the united states and israel  ive never been more worried about both  because president trump and prime minister benjamin netanyahu are essentially the same person  and they pose the same threat to their respective nations they are both men utterly without shame  backed by parties utterly without spine  protected by big media outlets utterly without integrity  they are both funded by a las vegas casino magnate  sheldon adelson  they are both making support for israel a republican cause  no longer a bipartisan one  and they each could shoot an innocent man in broad daylight in the middle of fifth avenue and their supporters would say the victim had it coming as a result  they are each free to cross red lines that their predecessors never dared to  which is why i believe that four more years of netanyahu  which is almost certain after israels election on tuesday  and six more years of trump  which is a real possibility  will hasten the emergence of an america and an israel where respect for civility  democracy  an independent judiciary and independent media are no longer examples for others to follow  instead  both countries will be cautionary tales of how precious are the norms and institutions that bind a democracy  and how easily they can be undermined by leaders who will tell any lie  smear any competitor and wink at any extremist to stay in power netanyahus first order of business will be to strike an agreement with his potential coalition partners  most of them far right  pro settler parties  in which  as haaretz reported  those parties will agree to create legislation that gets rid of the multiple indictments for corruption looming in bibis future  and in return he will agree to annex west bank settlements to israel  and trump will somehow go along  maybe as part of his own peace plan  it is going to be a dirty business  for sure but what else could we expect  the parallels between trump and netanyahu are now deep and broad bibi has openly embraced a racist  anti arab israeli party and racist  anti arab rhetoric  unlike any previous israeli prime minister  at the same time  he has steadily been erasing the green line that separated israel from the west bank and its 2 5 million palestinians  with the help of trumps ambassador to israel  making it increasingly unlikely that israel will ever separate itself from that area and increasingly likely that it will become a binational state in which jews will enjoy rights that palestinians will be denied meanwhile  trump is increasingly turning america into a banana republic  firing cabinet officials and senior bureaucrats who refuse to carry out his impulsive orders  which are often illegal and mostly related to preventing legal and illegal immigration or asylum requests along the mexico united states border  trump prefers to govern through acting cabinet secretaries  he has fired their bosses and not replaced them  who are much more vulnerable to his whims and more accepting of his more than 10 000 lies and falsehoods since taking office bibi  for his part  prefers to simply hold multiple portfolios  for a good chunk of his last term he was prime minister  defense minister  foreign minister and health minister both men have no close friends  the one major difference between them is that bibi is very smart  an avid reader and a deft tactician in managing relations with israels neighbors and big powers  such as america  russia  india and china  trump is clever but probably has not read a book in years  he gets his information from fox news and other right wing media  and rather than playing vladimir putin  has been played by him both trump and netanyahu are being investigated for serious financial improprieties  israels attorney general has recommended that netanyahu be indicted on charges of fraud  bribery and breach of trust in three corruption cases trump has been cleared by the special counsel on charges of collusion with russia in the 2016 election  but he remains under investigation  as reuters noted  on issues including his businesses and financial dealings  personal conduct  charitable foundation and inaugural committee  five close trump aides have already admitted to crimes  mostly financial  or been convicted neither man is interested in being a leader for all their people  each has chosen to rule by dividing his people  not uniting them  they each just want to win by 50 01 percent  by using fear of the outsider and drawing cultural or religious distinctions between their citizens to garner just enough votes to squeak by bibis strategy was to demonize israeli arabs  and trumps was to demonize muslims and mexicans and immigrants from what he called shithole countries  both men have rebuilt their parties around themselves and their personal politics  and both believe that as long as they can hold their bases by stoking enough fear and cultural division  they can win  and theyre willing to sacrifice any values or norms to do so neither man is entirely wrong about the world around him  america does have an illegal immigration problem that democrats have not taken seriously enough  israel has real enemies like iran and its proxies  but israels external enemies are well deterred  the existential threat to israel is internal  that it will annex the west bank with its palestinian population and look to the world as an apartheidlike south africa my critique of both men is that they consistently try to use these real threats for political gain  to feed fears  rather than to think creatively about how to defuse them  because for bibi to think imaginatively about how to separate from the west bank and for trump to think creatively about how to defuse our immigration problem with a coherent national strategy would require each to disappoint or confront the extreme ultranationalists who form the core bases of their support  neither has the courage or the desire to do so indeed  netanyahu has gone so deep into the gutter that in this last election he agreed to partner with a small  racist  anti arab israeli party  a party so vile that the israeli supreme court barred its leader from running  in response  netanyahus allies immediately threatened to gut the supreme court if they win  i dont have to tell you where trump has gone in indulging white supremacists bibi will go down in history as the israeli leader who concretized the distinction between israelis and jews  noted bernard avishai in a smart essay in the new yorker  the menace  netanyahu has implied  is not just the arabs but what might be termed israeliness  a legal and cultural identity available to any citizen who participates in hebrew speaking civil society  including the 20 percent who are arab while benny gantz  bibis opponent in the recent election  has argued that  broadly defined  israeli identity is increasingly plausible for  among others  young  middle class arabs  who accounted for more than 16 percent of students in bachelors degree programs in 2017  that is not netanyahus view netanyahus version  in contrast  avishai explained  is a state essentially reserved for jews  including those in the diaspora  who can prove their jewishness by either rabbinical certification or maternal descent  one that is democratic only in the sense that jews constitute the majority  the general will of jews necessarily prevails  and non jews are in the state by sufferance  not really by right that is why netanyahu passed the recent nation state law  which stipulated that israel is the national home of the jewish people  in which it fulfills its natural  cultural  religious and historical right to self determination  however much american jews  and traditional  secular american jewish supporters of israel  may try to shield netanyahu  it is increasingly clear that he is at odds with their democratic standards  which are already under assault  avishai concluded  american jews  like israeli voters  have choices to make  is israel a state for jews or for all its citizens trump has dabbled in the same kind of tropes  he may not say it explicitly  but his whole worldview  evident from his dog whistles  is that real americans are primarily white judeo christians  certainly not muslims  and that all black or brown immigrants are suspect finally  both trump and bibi worship only one thing  raw  naked power  and they are not afraid to exercise it  bibi is convinced that if israel is strong militarily  economically and technologically  the world will bend to its will and beat a path to its door  the palestinians will surrender  the arabs will deal with israel under the table  and china  india and russia will all come to buy israeli software  and so far he has been right  bibi is convinced that liberal american jews are worthless  that theyll soon disappear via intermarriage and that the countrys orthodox jews and evangelical christians will be powerful enough to do israels bidding in washington trump too has an obsession with raw power  his favorite insult is to call someone weak  he lives by the credo  never apologize  no matter how foul your actions or how big your lie  just stand firm and everyone will eventually bend your way  it has worked for him too  but at what long term costs for both societies trump is replacing the entire logic of american foreign policy since world war ii  that more global integration and stronger global rules and institutions will make for a more prosperous world  and if america pays a little more than others for that we will reap far more benefits because we are the worlds biggest economy  with a philosophy of competitive nationalism for trump  all the global institutions built after world war ii  nato  the world bank  the international monetary fund  the world trade organization  the united nations  are just tools for small countries to rip off america or stick it to israel  trump actually wants the european union to crack up  because he thinks that if the united states just negotiates with every nation bilaterally  it will be able to impose asymmetrical trade agreements on them so have no doubts  four more years of netanyahu and six more years of trump wont just change america and israel  it will change the world  and not for the better .

mexico city ottawa  more than six months after the united states  mexico and canada agreed a new deal to govern more than  1 trillion in regional trade  the chances of the countries ratifying the pact this year are receding the three countries struck the united states mexico canada agreement  usmca  on sept  30  ending a year of difficult negotiations after u s  president donald trump demanded the preceding trade pact be renegotiated or scrapped but the deal has not ended trade tensions in north america  if ratification is delayed much longer  it could become hostage to electoral politics the united states has its next presidential contest in 2020  and canada holds a federal election in october the delay means businesses are still uncertain about the framework that will govern future investments in the region   the usmca is in trouble   said andres rozental  a former mexican deputy foreign minister for north america though he believed the deal would ultimately be approved  rozental said opposition from u s  democrats and unions to labor provisions in the deal  as well as bickering over tariffs  made its passage in the next few months highly unlikely canada s parliament must also ratify the treaty and officials say the timetable is very tight  current legislators only have a few weeks work left before the start of the summer recess in june  and members of the new parliament would have little chance to address ratification until 2020 trump  a republican  has shown frustration with the democratic led u s  house of representatives for failing to sign off on the usmca  he has threatened to pull out of the old pact  the north american free trade agreement  nafta   if congress does not hurry up if trump did dump nafta  the three nations would revert to trade rules in place before it came into effect in 1994 tariffscanada and mexico are seeking exemption from u s  tariffs on global metal imports imposed last year the metals tariffs were not included in the usmca and mexico and canada are impatient to resolve the issue  mexico has repeatedly threatened to target new u s  products by the end of april in retribution if tariffs are imposed meanwhile  trump on thursday threatened to slap tariffs on mexican auto exports unless mexico does more to stop drug traffickers and illegal immigration mexico s government is in the final stages of completing a new list of potential u s  imports to be targeted  said luz maria de la mora  a mexican deputy economy minister  there s going to be a bit of everything   she told reuters  declining to give details of how the list   originally encompassing products such as bourbon  cheese  motor boats  pork legs  steel and apples   could be modified de la mora would not be drawn on whether mexico could refuse to ratify usmca if steel tariffs are not withdrawn  saying only   all options are on the table  in ottawa  canadian foreign minister chrystia freeland said this week her government was  constantly  looking at its own retaliation list  noting that trump s tariffs left the country over c 16 billion worth of space to strike back freeland did not say when that list could change  and a government source  speaking on condition of anonymity  said it might not be necessary  still  freeland said canada was coordinating with mexico about its options prime minister justin trudeau  who faces a tough re election battle  on thursday rejected accepting quotas on canadian steel and aluminum in exchange for u s  tariffs being dropped trudeau was criticized during the usmca negotiations for giving ground to trump on access to canada s dairy sector workersu s  democrats have threatened to block the usmca unless mexico passes legislation to improve workers  rights  a demand shared by the canadian government a bill already in mexico s congress to strengthen trade unions should be approved this month  the government says trump blamed nafta for millions of job losses in the united states as companies moved south to employ cheaper mexican labor  trump is running for re election in 2020  and his  america first  policy will likely feature prominently in the campaign forcing mexico and canada to rework nafta was one of trump s signature pledges during his shock win in 2016  and democrats are pulling out the stops to avoid losing again  the closer the election gets  the harder it will be for democrats to grant trump a victory  by ratifying the usmca  said sergio alcocer  a former deputy mexican foreign minister some democrats are pushing to change the deal   an idea that both canadian and mexican officials resist  people need to be very careful around opening up what could really be a pandora s box   freeland said on thursday canadian officials say they fear that if one

the former white house chief of staff  john f  kelly  on wednesday declined to answer questions about the existence of a memo he wrote saying that president trump had ordered officials to give his son in law  jared kushner  a security clearance in may 2018 mr  kelly also broke with mr  trump on key aspects of his approach to immigration and the nato alliance  and said that his top concern about decisions made by the president was whether they were objectively right for the country when divorced from political concerns mr  kelly  who kept his voice level during a 90 minute question and answer session at duke university  would not specifically address mr  kushners clearance being ordered by mr  trump  which the new york times reported last week i couldnt  and im not dodging  i couldnt comment on that for a couple of reasons  mr  kelly said  citing clearances being among the things that he could not discuss  and that conversations with the president at that level would certainly be kept confidential under executive privilege asked specifically about whether he had ever created memos for the record  mr  kelly said  id prefer not to talk about that mr  trump ordered the chief of staff to get mr  kushner a clearance after it stalled for most of the first half of the presidents term over concerns from the f b i  and career security officials about mr  kushners personal foreign contacts  as well as those related to his familys real estate business mr  trump has the legal authority to overrule recommendations from security clearance officials  but his action added to ongoing questions about how people obtained them  and it contradicted a statement at the time from mr  kushners lawyer that his clearance went through a normal process  and the president himself asserted to the times in an oval office interview in january that he had not directed mr  kelly or anyone else to grant a clearance in his conversation at duke with professor peter feaver  mr  kelly said that his 18 months as the chief of staff were the least favorite job he had held  but the most important  he acknowledged that his colleagues in the marine corps  where he served as a four star general  might not like hearing that however  mr  kelly said  during that time  mr  trump went from a guy who didnt know how the system works to one who understands how it works mr  kelly  who left at the end of december  also made clear he did not consider himself working for mr  trump  but doing his civic duty to serve  if hillary clinton had won  he said  he probably would have worked for her as well mr  kelly defended the utility of the nato alliance  which mr  trump has often criticized as an unfair financial drain on the united states on a wall at the border with mexico  mr  kelly said that there were specific areas where it could be effective but constructing one from sea to shining sea was a waste of money the issuance of the zero tolerance policy for border crossings that resulted in family separations came as a surprise to him and to other officials  mr  kelly said  defending his replacement as secretary of the department of homeland security  kirstjen nielsen  from criticism  he appeared to place most of the blame on the former attorney general  jeff sessions  who announced the policy of people crossing the border who are apprehended  mr  kelly contradicted the president  theyre overwhelmingly not criminals  theyre people coming up here for economic purposes  mr  trump has regularly portrayed immigrants crossing at the southern border as dangerous lawbreakers he also joked wryly about the advice he gave his successor  mick mulvaney  run for it  mr  kelly said  to laughter  on a serious note  he said  he told him the chief of staffs job was to tell the president what he needs to hear .
washington  president trump plans to use his state of the union address on tuesday night to outline a bipartisan and optimistic vision of the country  a senior administration official said on friday it could be a difficult sell in the past few weeks  as he has tried to navigate his way out of a political standoff with democrats  mr  trump has ramped up his anti immigration messaging  stormed out of meetings with democratic leaders and refused to accept any compromise that does not ultimately include funding for a border wall and while the white house said on friday that the goal of the speech was to bring together a divided government and a divided nation  the official said immigration would emerge as the main theme mr  trump is also expected to make an appeal to his evangelical anti abortion base by talking about the fundamental importance and respect for human life  the official said  and he will focus a large portion of his remarks on the importance of ending illegal immigration but the official  who refused to be identified according to the ground rules of the briefing  framed the speech as an opportunity to change the tone of the current political debate together we can break decades of political stalemate  mr  trump is expected to say  according to an excerpt from the speech shared by the official  we can bridge old divisions  heal old wounds  build new coalitions  forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of americas future  the decision is ours to make the overarching theme of the speech  the official said  will be choosing greatness  and it will focus on issues where there is a possibility of bipartisan consensus  infrastructure  lowering health care and prescription drug costs  protecting american workers affected by what he described as decades of flawed trade deals and safeguarding national security the president will also call on congress to replace what he described as the nafta disaster with the united states mexico canada agreement and discuss the trading relationship with china in his first state of the union address last year  mr  trump also sought to strike a unifying tone that was a contrast to the political attacks and divisive messaging that he is better known for  but the promises in last years speech  including bringing democrats and republicans together behind a  1 5 trillion infrastructure plan  have not materialized  while the more contentious policies of his presidency have continued this year  mr  trump will address the nation after a 35 day government shutdown caused by his insistence that congress approve funding for the border wall  and although the president agreed to three weeks of negotiations to end the impasse  he said on thursday that the talks are a waste of time and strongly hinted that he would declare a national emergency to bypass congress and obtain wall funding mr  trump suggested on friday that he would announce his decision on declaring a national emergency during the state of the union speech i dont want to say  he told reporters when asked if he was planning to do so  youll hear the state of the union and lets see what happens  he said white house officials have been warning him against the action  but they also view it as a potential last ditch exit ramp if they cannot find another face saving solution last month  in the midst of the shutdown  speaker nancy pelosi told the president she wanted to postpone the address  initially scheduled for jan  29  until after the government reopened  and suggested he deliver the speech in writing mr  trump retaliated by grounding the military plane that was supposed to take ms  pelosi and other lawmakers on a fact finding trip to afghanistan  then  when mr  trump pressed ahead  insisting he wanted to give the speech  ms  pelosi disinvited him  but this week she and the president agreed he would give the speech on feb  5 .
the video for a lot  21 savages elegiac single  takes place at a formal dinner and party in a cloud high mansion  a lavish and exuberant celebration of black wealth  but theres a moving sequence midway through that suggests trouble just beneath the surface the cuts are quick  warm shots of confident guests at the dinner table interspersed with darker scenes in which theyre suffering  poor health  financial hardship  criminal past  abuse  death of a loved one  the message of the video isnt exactly that nothing is as it seems  but more that where you end up may be far from where you came from  and that success doesnt cure all obstacles when 21 savage first emerged in 2015  he was a cold brutalist of a rapper whose verses verged on the dead eyed  but just a few years on  hes taken a turn to the reflective  later in the video  he added a ruminative new verse to the song  rapping  went through some things  but i couldnt imagine my kids stuck at the border  directly addressing the current administrations divisive immigration policies  never miss a pop music story  get our weekly newsletter  louder  on sunday  just a couple of days after that videos release  21 savage was arrested by agents of immigration and customs enforcement  which said he was in this country illegally and placed him into deportation proceedings  as of wednesday afternoon  he remained in ice custody is 21 savage american  by any measurement other than citizenship  yes  he was born sheyaa bin abraham joseph in england in 1992  according to charles kuck  one of his immigration attorneys  he came to the united states at age 7 and has been here continuously ever since  apart from a one month period in 2005  he then re entered the country on an h 4 visa  which expired in 2006  leaving him without legal status but the events of the last few days underscore the ways in which the hard power of government authority and soft power of online conversation can align in peculiar and insidious ways  as news began to spread on social media of 21 savages arrest on sunday  the meme and joke ecosystem that uses trauma as oxygen went into overdrive  reacting with special intensity to the revelation that 21 savage  one of the titans of atlantas rap scene  was in fact british  as the government put his relationship with this country in peril  thousands of people chirped in online to poke at the unlikeliness  and precariousness  of his situation that 21 savage is in fact a british national is  ultimately  not particularly revelatory  or even meaningful  foreign born residents made up 13 7 percent of the united states population in 2017  according to the census bureaus american community survey  published last year  which includes those in the country legally and illegally   most of the humor turned on a high society caricature understanding of england  and the dissonance of locating someone like 21 savage  a seen it all stoicist with a dagger tattooed on his forehead  inside it  by and large  those people overlooked  or didnt think as far as  the more odious association  that of empire and colonization   his mothers family hails from dominica  a former british colony in the west indies  his success  however  is especially american  growing up in some of atlantas poorest communities  21 savage had a troubled childhood  hes said that he dropped out of school to sell drugs  and has spoken in interviews of a youth marked by violence and crime  but after losing a close friend and a brother to gun violence  he turned to rapping  and within a year  he was one of atlantas most promising prospects hes since worked with drake  cardi b and post malone  his 2017 debut album  issa album  went gold  and his second studio album  i am   i was  released in december  debuted at the top of the billboard album chart  at this sundays grammy awards  21 savage is nominated in two categories he has also been maturing in the public eye  advocating for gun control  donating money to educate young people in atlanta on financial literacy  an announcement made on ellen degeneress show  of all places   even walking alongside then girlfriend amber rose in 2017 at her slutwalk  a womens empowerment event  carrying a sign that read im a hoe too this is the american promise  no  to start from nothing and turn it into a bounty  to receive a cruel hand and still emerge victorious and yet there is this other american promise  or threat  which is that all that comfort can be easily ripped away if it isnt achieved in the correct fashion in the case of 21 savage  whose public image was built on a kind of impenetrable toughness mixed with weary resilience  this moment of vulnerability was destabilizing  even in his most intimate music  he never presents as anything other than an agent of control but the immigration system is beyond his jurisdiction  even though  since becoming a public figure  he has taken steps to address his status  according to a statement released by his attorneys on tuesday  in 2017 he applied for a u visa  which  according to united states citizenship and immigration services  can be issued by the government to crime victims who have suffered mental or physical abuse and are helpful to law enforcement or government officials in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity  21 savage has said he was shot in 2013  the statement did not specify whether he cooperated with authorities the atlanta journal constitution reported that 21 savage was arrested at the same time dekalb county police arrested another rapper  young nudy  on unrelated charges  but 21 savage was detained directly by ice  kuck said  21 savage also was convicted on felony drug charges in 2014  the conviction record was expunged in september 2018 as part of georgias first offender program and the files have been sealed  according to jacoby hudson  who represented 21 savage in the matter  though expunged convictions have been used in deportation proceedings  21 savage would be eligible for removal simply for the overstayed visa  21 savage is now among the highest profile immigration detainees  his situation instantly becoming a flash point in national conversations about people living in this country without legal status  and in dialogues about the ways in which immigrants contribute to american society  a petition asking for his release started by black lives matter has amassed over 200 000 signatures a star who built his own success  21 savage has in one fell swoop re emerged as someone in need of protection  but in his recent music and public life  his identity was already becoming more complex and nuanced  delivering tales about the horrors of life at the bottom salted with a fresh understanding of just how slippery it can be at the top .
theres no reason to mourn kirstjen nielsens departure from the department of homeland security  she was an immigration hard liner working aggressively to carry out president trumps restrictionist agenda  she spearheaded efforts to crack down on migrants and asylum seekers  she requested military assistance at the border  she limited the number of people who can legally present for asylum at ports of entry  and she vastly increased the number of immigrants in detention she also carried out the presidents zero tolerance policy  resulting in the separation of thousands of families at our border with mexico  many parents are still searching for their children but there were limits to nielsens embrace of trumps immigration policies  she pushed back on his demands to break the law to stop migrants from entering the country  according to the times  and repeatedly reminded the president of the limitations imposed on her department by federal laws  court settlements and international obligations in almost any other administration  this would be unremarkable  it simply means nielsen took her job and its legal obligations seriously  what we would expect from any civil servant  but trump is unusual among modern presidents for his routine elevation of people who lack that basic sense of public ethics  if regular pressure to break the law was part of nielsens decision to leave the administration  then her departure illustrates how any belief in the public good  no matter how slight  is incompatible with working for this president  even if you share his views  join jamelle bouie as he shines a light on overlooked writing  culture and ideas from around the internet  for exclusive thoughts  photos and reading recommendations  sign up for his newsletter  this was evident from previous resignations and firings  rex tillerson  trumps first secretary of state  seemed to share the presidents skepticism of the department  carrying out an agenda meant to shrink its influence  but when trump wanted to break the law  which  tillerson said in an interview after leaving the administration  was often  tillerson would push back  unwilling to completely subordinate himself to the presidents will  i would have to say to him  mr  president  i understand what you want to do  but you cant do it that way  it violates the law the presidents first attorney general  jeff sessions  faced similar pressures after he recused himself from any investigations related to the prospect of russian interference with the 2016 presidential election  sessions took that step after the washington post revealed his meetings with the russian ambassador  sergey kislyak  during the campaign  the kind of contact he had denied during his confirmation hearing before the senate judiciary committee trump was furious  which grew into rage after the deputy attorney general  rod rosenstein  appointed robert mueller special counsel  trump reportedly berated sessions in the oval office  which the attorney general called his most humiliating experience in decades of public life  and complained that the recusal was unfair trump wanted sessions to derail the russia investigation and protect him from scrutiny  essentially making himself above the law  and he spent much of 2018 pressuring the attorney general to do just that  either attacking him in public or cajoling him in private  sessions  who shared trumps politics but not his complete contempt for the rule of law  wouldnt budge  as long as i am the attorney general  i will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor  and this department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and constitution  he said in a february 2018 statement  this stalemate resolved itself after the midterm elections  when a frustrated and weakened trump finally fired sessions  replacing him temporarily with matthew whitaker  a loyalist who served as sessionss chief of staff  and permanently with william barr  who served as attorney general under george h w  bush  shielding him from the fallout of the iran contra scandal the overall pattern is clear  trump wants to act with impunity  breaking the law if he needs or even just wants to  his appointees  who share his goals but not his methods  resist  he scolds and attacks them until they resign  replacing them with loyalists who may actually bend to his will rex tillerson was replaced by mike pompeo  then serving as director of the c i a  unlike tillerson  who attempted to contain trumps worst instincts  pompeo has been willing to say or do nearly anything to stay in trumps favor  its why he would echo the presidents widely criticized flattery of kim jong un and the north korean government trump says that kevin mcaleenan  until now the commissioner of customs and border protection  will take over for nielsen as acting secretary of homeland security  like nielsen  mcaleenan backs the presidents harsh border policies  he defended border patrol agents after they used tear gas on hundreds of migrants  including women and children  who tried to enter the united states near tijuana  mexico  some attorneys say its unclear if trump can elevate mcaleenan  since the laws regarding succession point to under secretary for management claire grady as next in line as acting director for a more permanent replacement  trump is reportedly considering ken cuccinelli  the former virginia attorney general turned conservative television personality  and kris kobach  the former kansas secretary of state notorious for his aggressively anti immigrant policies with either choice  trump would affirm the pattern of his administration so far  jettisoning people who act as if they were accountable to the public and replacing them with people who above all are loyal to trump  willing to go in the tougher  and possibly illegal  direction he demands .
rome  an italian school bus driver took 51 seventh graders hostage in northern italy on wednesday  pouring gasoline on the bus floor and later setting it afire after someone on the bus made an emergency call  italian carabinieri  or military police  reached the bus and safely rescued all the children  as well as two teachers and a janitor aboard  as it burst into flames the driver  osseynou sy  an italian of senegalese origin  said that he wanted to vindicate the dead of the mediterranean  according to warrant officer marco palmieri  a spokesman for milans provincial branch of the carabinieri  italys military police mr  sy  he said  was referring to the large number of migrants who lose their lives each year during the perilous crossing of the mediterranean from north africa to europe  the international organization for migration estimates that 282 people have drowned that way this year a promise to curb migration from north africa was a key factor in the election of italys populist national government a year ago  since then  the country  once a principal hub for migrants crossing the mediterranean  has closed its ports to nongovernmental rescue vessels  to force other european countries to bear the burden of migrant landings the italian interior ministry announced on sunday that migrant arrivals were down 94 percent this year  compared to 2018 mr  sy was arrested and treated at a milanese hospital for burns on his hand  he was expected to be charged with kidnapping  arson  resisting arrest  intention to commit mass murder  because some students were still on the bus when it burst into flames  and terrorism as an aggravating factor  because he created panic and threatened italian institutions  said alberto nobili  one of the milanese prosecutors assigned to the case mr  sy told prosecutors that he had acted alone and that he intended to send a message to african immigrants not to come to europe  but at the same time to punish europe for what he saw as its unacceptable migration policies  mr  nobili said at a news conference in milan on wednesday night the students  who attend a middle school in crema  a city some 50 kilometers  or almost 32 miles  east of milan  were returning from gym class when mr  sy  a regular driver on the route  poured gasoline down the buss center aisle and announced that he was hijacking it and taking them to linate airport in milan  investigators said he then gave zip ties to the three adults  ordering them to tie each childs wrists together as he drove  as they went back the rows of seats  the adults left the zip ties progressively looser  another prosecutor  francesco greco  said police in two carabinieri cars  tipped off by the phone call  forced the bus to stop on the paullese provincial highway  but mr  sy rammed the cars again and again  while some officers tried to speak to him  others from a third military police car forced the buss side door open and broke the windows at the back to allow the passengers to flee at that point  mr  sy apparently ignited a lighter he was holding  officers said  and the bus caught fire as the hostages were escaping italian television stations showed images of the charred skeleton of the bus  completely destroyed asked why the adults did not try to overpower the driver  warrant officer palmieri said that he could not speak for them  but that the threat was very real mr  sy was born in senegal in 1972  investigators said  and became an italian citizen in 2004  his wife  from whom he is separated  is italian  and the couple have two children mr  sy had been working for the autoguidovie bus company for 15 years  a company official  corrado bianchessi  said  he never gave any particular signal to indicate what he had planned  mr  bianchessi told the italian channel of sky news  we are amazed  he said deputy prime minister matteo salvini  who is also italys interior minister and a major opponent of illegal immigration  posted a tweet in which he said that mr  sy had a police record for driving under the influence and sexual assault why was someone with such record driving a bus for school children  he asked  but prosecutors said the offenses were relatively minor mr  nobili said mr  sy had made a video explaining his actions on tuesday  he wanted the world to speak of this event  he said  adding that prosecutors had no sense the episode was tied to radicalized terrorism he said mr  sy told investigators he wanted to board a plane to senegal from linate airport  but it was unclear how he could do that or what he intended to do with the students  who were around 12 years old mr  sy told prosecutors he never wanted to hurt anyone  but mr  greco wasnt buying it  if were not crying over the death of dozens of schoolchildren  he said  it is thanks to the courage and rapid response of the carabinieri it could have been a massacre  he told the ansa news agency .

the australia letter is a weekly newsletter from our australia bureau chief  sign up to get it by email    parliament approved a bill this week to allow medical evacuation for asylum seekers on nauru and manus over the opposition of prime minister scott morrison  throwing australia into another visceral debate over immigration in the coming months  with an election approaching  we can expect to hear all kinds of intense and moralistic rhetoric mr  morrison and his supporters are already arguing that opening the door even a little to settlement in australia will encourage a flood of migrants and deaths at sea  labor  the greens and others on the left are maintaining that immigration is a net positive for australia and that cruelty must be restrained this is all part of a broader conversation across the west about migration and national identity  the white house announced just today that president trump will declare a state of emergency to build a border wall and its a conversation that matters  these disputes  however they end up  will shape many countries  and the world  for decades but for me  theres a certain familiarity to the discussion  not just in washington but also in canberra ive written about immigration for nearly 20 years  from various countries  from the neighborhoods and towns where immigrants cluster to the halls of power where decisions are made along the way  there are a few things ive learned to look out for the hero vs  villain trapin heated moments like this one  immigrants and the nuances of their lives and motivations tend to be reduced to the most simplistic of archetypes either they are criminals  the worst of the worst  rapists  murders  pedophiles  or they are blameless hard working heroes  say  doctors or professional basketball players from australia in the n b a   the reality  and this should be obvious  but often gets overlooked  is that most migrants are in the messy middle with the rest of us  theyre good and bad  theyre parents and workers  and theyre mostly just trying to make life a little bit better for themselves and their loved ones this idea that they are somehow different and more extreme reflects little more than the political need for narrative and division  beware of the packaging of simplicity its a fact free zonewhen i was reporting a series of stories back in 2012  the first to show that the era of mass mexican migration was over  an expert i talked to warned that policymakers would ignore my findings immigration  he said  is an issue driven by emotion  its a fact free zone  he said  and he was right no matter how many cold hard facts get put into the public domain in the next few months  and i hope there are a lot of them  dont expect the politicians to adjust their arguments  theyre appealing less to the head than the heart and look out for whats missing too you probably wont hear anyone  for example  pointing out that the decision to migrate is typically a long term bet  calculated and paid for over several years  which rarely responds to immediate policy changes in predictable ways there are both push  from a country  and pull  to a country  factors and  according to sociologists and demographers  it is often impossible to make sweeping cause and effect conclusions based on one element alone every immigrant has a story all their own  people move and flee for reasons that often have very little to do with what policymakers do to deter or assist them interaction winsduring a long road trip from the mexican to the canadian border  for a project exploring immigration in middle america  i met dozens of americans with all kinds of views about immigration but there are two people  both older white women  who i still think about one was in farmers branch  texas  an area that had tried  but failed  to push out immigrants who might not be documented with a series of strict residential rental rules and policing  she told me through her locked screen door that she wanted tougher enforcement  she was afraid another was in wichita  in kansas  in an area that had gone from a declining white  working class community to one that was reviving but more mixed in terms of ethnicity and origin the womans name was francene sharp  you can read her full story here  but what stuck with me was her reaction to a break in at her home by some local mexican teenagers she had cause to be angry  but because shed spent years getting to know many of her other immigrant neighbors  including a friend who she called for help right after the break in  her response and her views were tempered and calm what she had  that the woman in texas did not  was real life interaction  enough of it to prevent her from making sweeping judgments about people or policy she relied on her own deep experience and a remarkable openness to combat the fact free zone and the hero villain trap border policy was on her radar  she was no supporter of open borders  but she was far more interested in why those teenagers who broke in were not at home studying  integration and community mattered more to her than border walls which brings me to what ill be looking for in this years australian  and american  immigration debate will there be people pushing the conversation beyond border enforcement and detention who  if anyone  will be asking  how can immigration be studied  discussed and shaped in conjunction with immigrants to ensure that australia  the country that often calls itself the worlds most successful multicultural nation  lives up to that promise now for a

amid a surge in the number of migrants at the border with mexico a senior administration official said trump asked for nielsen s resignation and she gave it  trump  who has recently expressed growing anger about the situation at the border  said on twitter   secretary of homeland security kirstjen nielsen will be leaving her position  and i would like to thank her for her service  in another tweet  trump said kevin mcaleenan  the current u s  customs and border protection commissioner  would become acting dhs secretary in a tweet late sunday  nielsen said that she would stay on until wednesday  i have agreed to stay on as secretary through wednesday  april 10th to assist with an orderly transition and ensure that key dhs missions are not impacted   she said nielsen s departure was first reported by cbs news  nielsen  46  had been dhs secretary since december 2017  her departure had been repeatedly rumored over the past year  particularly after a wave of anger over the administration s 2018 family separation policy at the border with mexico and most recently as u s  border officials estimated that 100 000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border in march  the highest level in a decade another senior administration official said trump s national security adviser  john bolton  after a blowup with nielsen late last year  also recommended to trump that she should go trump has made a clampdown on illegal immigration a centerpiece of his two year old presidency  leading chants of  build that wall  at his rallies as he has sought to cut back on the number of newcomers entering the united states without proper documentation many of the migrants picked up last month were central americans seeking u s  asylum trump was so frustrated about the increase that he announced he would cut off u s  aid to guatemala  honduras and el salvador  he also threatened to close the border with mexico  although he later backed off that proposal with a threat to impose tariffs on auto imports in her resignation letter  nielsen asked for more from congress and the courts  which have opposed such trump administration initiatives as his effort to limit immigration from muslim nations and the border wall  i hope that the next secretary will have the support of congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure america s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation s discourse   she wrote to trump trump also took aim at congress in another tweet later on sunday  saying   country is full   and saying democrats in congress must  fix loopholes  and repeating his threats to close the border or impose tariffs if mexico does not do more  nielsen s resignation was the latest high profile departure from the trump administration  and leaves just four women in his cabinet  among others  trump currently lacks a permanent secretary of defense or chief of staff lightning rodnielsen s departure was announced two days after the republican president abruptly said on friday he was dumping his nominee to be the top official at u s  immigration and customs enforcement  ice   ronald vitiello  saying he wanted someone  tougher  ice is under the jurisdiction of dhs  which was formed following the sept  11  2001  attacks on new york and washington repeatedly subjected to tough questioning by democrats at congressional hearings  nielsen became a lightning rod for criticism of trump s policies  she was confronted by protesters last year at a mexican restaurant in washington last year  nielsen came under increasing pressure by critics to step aside after the trump administration adopted the policy of separating migrant children from their parents as part of its  zero tolerance  approach intended to deter families from leaving home in the hope of entering the united states after criticism as pictures of children in cages were spread across the world  trump signed an executive order in june ending family separations and requiring that families be held together in federal custody while the adults awaited prosecution for illegally crossing the border but the government reported that at least 245 children were taken from their families between that time and the first months of 2019 trump insists that the arrival of immigrants across the southern u s  border constitutes a national emergency so important that he sidestepped congress  refusal to provide him with billions of dollars he requested to build the border wall representative bennie thompson  the democratic chairman of the house of representatives homeland security committee  said nielsen s tenure at dhs  was a disaster from the start  he said in a statement  however  that she should not serve as a scapegoat  blasting trump for  terrible and cruel policies   noting that the department now has neither a permanent secretary nor deputy secretary  thompson called on the administration to work with congress  in good faith  before she was nominated as secretary  nielsen worked as a deputy to former marine general john kelly  who headed dhs before becoming white house chief of staff  kelly resigned as chief of staff on jan  2

el paso  i have a suggestion for president trump  instead of fanning fear during your visit to this city on monday night  stroll across the paso del norte bridge into ciudad jarez  join the 70 000 people crossing four bridges who daily form the human tissue linking the united states and mexico  they work  they study  they eat  they shop  all part of what dee margo  the mayor of el paso  calls one region  one culture i crossed the bridge  things slow down  as they do when you move from the developed to the developing world  secondhand clothes for sale hang on simple brightly painted homes  the poorest made of pallets and corrugated iron roofs  jarez  home to many of the foreign owned assembly plants known as maquiladoras  has a violent history and big social problems  but in the dusty streets and cafes serving steaming bowls of tripe and bean soup i discerned no tension its simple  julin cardona  a photographer  told me  everyone here knows trump hates brown people  we call him trompudo  or big mouth from that mouth seeps the sinister specter of an invasion  thousands of active duty troops are dispatched to the border  concertina wire spreads  the government shutdown that ended on jan  25 could be followed soon by trumps declaration of a national emergency to build his wall  presidential powers include the power to manufacture a threat where none exists from my vantage point in el paso there is no crisis  margo  the mayor  told me  you look south and you cant tell where el paso merges into jarez bridges  in other words  trump walls at one of the shelters run by the nonprofit annunciation house  i met iris galindo maldonado  an undocumented 43 year old woman from guerrero state  in southwestern mexico  who entered the united states on jan  15 with her 10 year old daughter to request asylum  her husband was killed seven years ago by drug dealers angered by his refusal to cooperate with them  she said they have threatened her in turn for refusing to help them smuggle cocaine ive already lived  she told me  i hope the american authorities support me for my daughter  so shes not in danger  shes not menaced  and gets educated  i told her  even if we stay one week  two weeks  however long it is  use the opportunity to learn english  shes already in school  and i pray to god a lot galindo  aged 43  has been processed by ice  fitted with an ankle bracelet  and let go to face a long wait in american limbo  along with several hundred thousand others  before her day in immigration court  she has no family in the united states trump calls us killers  delinquents and drug dealers  she told me  in fact that is exactly what we are fleeing from annunciation house took her in  ruben garcia  the director of the organization  says he is finding beds these days for more than 2 000 people a week  if nothing else  trumps rhetoric and policy swerves have helped feed chaos for trump  to be a refugee is to be a murderer and a rapist  garcia told me  this is what he ran on  he has a can of paint filled with a certain ideology and paints everything with it  to supporters of the wall  i ask  is it time to take down the statue of liberty representative veronica escobar  the successor to beto orourke  now a possible democratic presidential candidate  took me down to the spot  near a stretch of existing wall  where border agents detained an 8 year old guatemalan boy  felipe gmez alonzo  in december  he later died in united states custody the spot is over the rio grande  in the united states  but just short of the wall  raising the question of the barriers usefulness  that is a question the president has refused to address with any seriousness  his wall is much less about security than macho symbolism  a monument to bigotry  in escobars words i got talking to an agent who stopped us as we stepped south of the wall  he said agents in that area detained 300 bodies a day  he said the bodies were jumping the line  he said by the time their cases came before an immigration judge  the bodies are somewhere else so they get to stay  so  he concluded  we really have no authority to enforce the law bodies  i noted  is a term generally used for dead people  would it not be better to call them people or human beings  as this is what they are  the agent said he didnt mean that they are dead  but that bodies was the favored term i was subsequently advised not to read too much into this law enforcement vernacular  border agents are under a lot of pressure  their gestures of humanity  a birthday cake  a soccer ball  tend to go unrecorded  still  if you talk about bodies you are liable to see bodies  that is to say  people stripped of their humanity  their agonizing choices  their humble ambitions and their hopes  it is then easier to treat them with callous harshness  to forget what we americans are and where we came from when i walked back across the bridge  a united states passport control officer pored over my passport for several minutes  the iranian visa  the iraqi visa  the chinese visa  the indian visa  she asked what i do  whether id crossed the bridge before  why id entered mexico  she was hostile this guys from the new york times  she said  turning to the agent next to her  what should i do with him he looked me over  let him go  he said  i thanked her for the warm welcome home  just doing my job  she said trumps rhetoric is not innocuous .
el paso  ahead of president trumps scheduled rally in this west texas city aimed at building support for his proposed wall on the border with mexico  people from across the ideological spectrum in el paso had a message for him on sunday  dont speak for us the president is just wrong about the wall and wrong about el paso  said jon barela  a lifelong republican and chief executive of the borderplex alliance  an organization promoting economic development in a cross border industrial hub with a combined population of more than 2 7 million  taking in the cities of el paso  ciudad jurez and las cruces mr  barela disputed mr  trumps widely discredited assertion that border fencing had cut violent crime in el paso  pointing to f b i  data showing that the city has ranked for decades among the safest urban areas its size in the united states  long before american authorities started building some fencing along the border about a decade ago as a fiscally conservative republican  i just dont understand how spending  25 billion on a wall with limited effectiveness is a good idea  mr  barela said in an interview  mexico is an economic and strategic ally of the united states  and an antiquated effort to place a barrier between us just wont work  this month  were launching a limited run weekly newsletter about life on the border  far from the tug of war of washington politics  sign up here to receive the first issue of crossing the border when it launches  dee margo  the republican mayor of el paso  voiced similar criticism of mr  trumps description of el paso  in his state of the union address  as one of the nations most dangerous cities before the barrier went up on the border  representative veronica escobar  a democrat recently elected to congress to represent el paso  is asking mr  trump to apologize and meet with migrant families seeking asylum in the united states the tension surrounding mr  trumps planned visit to el paso on monday is revealing political fissures  a democratic bastion in a state where republicans have long wielded dominance in statewide politics  el paso is also home to beto orourke  the former local congressman who is a star of the democratic party and a potential challenger to mr  trump in the 2020 presidential election at the same time mr  trump is scheduled to speak before about 6 000 people at the el paso county coliseum  mr  orourke will speak at another rally a mile away  mr  orourke said in an essay on medium that mr  trump will promise a wall and will repeat his lies about the dangers that immigrants pose el paso  where hispanics account for about 80 percent of the population  was already hostile ground for mr  trump  in the 2016 election  he took only about 26 percent of the vote in el paso county  read our latest story on trump and betos rallies in el paso  still  the president shouldnt have a problem filling the venue  some of his supporters in the city remain eager to hear what mr  trump has to say id like to see a wall go up along the entire border  said joshua ascencio  21  a cavalry scout in the united states army who has plans to become an agent with the border patrol when he leaves the military  mr  ascencio said he was looking forward to mr  trumps rally im a supporter of the president and i think its important to be there for him  said mr  ascencio  i want to hear him on border security still  for many others in this city of immigrants the mere idea of mr  trump coming to el paso to promote his administrations crackdown on immigration raises hackles the president of the united states is  disgracefully  nothing more than a racist  said mayra cabral  37  an immigrant who grew up across the border in ciudad jurez and now cleans tables at a restaurant in el paso  where she has lived for the last 19 years after marrying an american citizen ms  cabral laughed out loud when asked about mr  trumps claims that hispanic immigrants bring crime to the united states  she said that el paso is normally so calm that its boring here sometimes  ms  cabral added that she and her family were not getting waylaid by talk of the presidents visit  on saturday night  they hosted a quinceaera for her 15 year old daughter attended by about 300 people i was able to do this for my daughter because i work at a job that people born in the united states wont do  ms  cabral said  trump likes to call us criminals  but what about all the americans in the country who commit violent crimes  why doesnt he talk about them for once mr  trump appears to have homed in on el paso after meeting with republican officials from texas in january in mcallen  a city affected by a large influx of migrant families traveling through the rio grande valley  at that meeting  attorney general ken paxton of texas told mr  trump that the construction of border fencing in el paso caused crime to fall in the city but while el paso has long been relatively safer than other american cities its size  the violent crime rate in the city actually climbed briefly just before and in the two years after authorities installed fencing on the border as part of an effort to improve border security during the administration of george w  bush mr  paxton tried to back up his assertion that a border wall in el paso had cut crime rates by referring to a 131 mile fence that was completed in 2010  politifact  the nonpartisan fact checking website owned by the poynter institute  questioned mr  paxtons claim  pointing out that while texas does have 131 miles of fencing not all of it is even in el paso the contested assertions of a senior state official comes at a time of ratcheting tension in texas over the treatment of latino voters by republican state officials  who in january called into question the citizenship status of nearly 100 000 voters  county officials found that the list of voters  which was referred to by mr  paxton in a campaign fund raising email with the headline voter fraud alert  actually included scores of naturalized citizens the mexican american legal defense fund filed a lawsuit this month against mr  paxton  gov  greg abbott and secretary of state david whitley of texas  arguing that they conspired to purge latinos from voter rolls following a surge in turnout by latino voters in the midterm elections governor abbott and united states senator ted cruz  the republican who narrowly defeated mr  orourke to hold on to his seat in november  are among the republican officials from around the state who are expected to attend the rally on monday in support of mr  trump but elsewhere along the border  there has been rising opposition among state and local officials to the presidents security strategies  read  butterflies  bulldozers and barbed wire rally border wall opponents new mexicos governor  michelle lujan grisham  announced last week that she had ordered a partial withdrawal of national guard troops from her state  new mexico will not take part in the presidents charade of border fear mongering by misusing our diligent national guard troops  ms  grisham  a democrat  said in a statement early monday  gov  gavin newsom of california announced that his state  too  would withdraw national guard troops sent earlier to help the federal government boost security at the border in nogales  ariz   the city council on wednesday passed a resolution condemning the recent installation of new barbed wire along the existing border wall in that city  calling it an indiscriminate use of lethal force that is typically only found in a war  battlefield or prison setting gaining public support for the idea of a wall at an event such as the rally in el paso will be important for mr  trump  as talks for a bipartisan agreement on border security appeared to have stalled on sunday amid lingering disagreement over how much should be spent on a border barrier  president trump  who initially proposed spending  25 billion on a wall  now is looking for  5 7 billion  democratic lawmakers have talked about a figure closer to  1 3 billion to  2 billion a second government shutdown could be in the works if no agreement is reached bob giles  a car dealer from lafayette  la   who is building a new volvo dealership in el paso  said that he understood how mr  trumps proposed wall could seem like a good idea from an outside perspective but when you spend time in el paso and talk to people  its clear they take offense that a wall made a difference in the city  said mr  giles  while mr  trump often speaks of a crisis on the border  mr  giles said he hasnt seen one thats not the word i would choose  he said  his own hope is to sell cars not just to americans  but also to business executives from jurez who have homes in el paso  this is an incredibly vibrant market with lots of construction going on  he said  it makes a difference when you see it with your own eyes .
washington  the trump administration proposed a rule on wednesday night intended to prevent undocumented immigrants from receiving federal housing assistance  the latest step in its efforts to ramp up enforcement of the nations immigration laws the proposal  according to an administration official  is intended to overturn what the official described as a clinton era loophole that allowed some undocumented immigrants to obtain public housing without revealing their citizenship status  the rule would ensure that the social safety net is awarded only to verified american citizens and legal residents the long waiting lists for public housing prompted the crackdown  the official said  adding that the rule would affect about 25 000 households the department of housing and urban development  which proposed the rule  would require expanded use of the systematic alien verification for entitlements program  known as save  a program administered by the department of homeland security save is meant to help federal and local government agencies quickly verify a persons immigration and citizenship status  and determine whether people are eligible for benefits  it was not immediately clear whether hud was also targeting undocumented immigrants who might live in public housing with a spouse or a family member who is an american citizen a spokesman for hud  raffi williams  did not respond to a request for comment  a spokesman for the department of homeland security declined to comment julin castro  the former housing secretary under president barack obama and a current democratic presidential candidate  criticized the proposal once again  the trump administration is using the immigrant community as a punching bag to distract his base from his own political troubles  he said  the bottom line is that our government is terrorizing families  first with ice raids  now with evictions the rule was delivered to congress on wednesday night for a 15 day review period  after that  there will be 60 days for public comment  if the rule goes into effect  undocumented immigrants living in public housing would not be immediately removed  the official said  they would be given up to 18 months  through three six month waivers  to relocate the move is not the first time the trump administration has sought to crack down on immigrants using the public safety net  for months  stephen miller  one of president trumps top advisers and the architect of his immigration agenda  has pushed the administration to complete a new regulation that would penalize legal immigrants who rely on public benefits like section 8 housing vouchers or food assistance  the regulation would give officials more power to declare an immigrant who uses welfare benefits to be a public charge  making him or her ineligible for permanent legal status like the administrations other efforts to crack down on immigrants  the public housing rule also fits mr  trumps message to his core supporters as he begins his 2020 re election campaign the president and his top political advisers believe that no issue better symbolizes their commitment to keeping the united states safe and prosperous than mr  trumps pledge to rid the country of undocumented immigrants and drastically reduce the flow of legal immigrants into the country in addition to a crackdown at the southwestern border  where mr  trump has sought to toughen asylum policies  the white house has freed immigration officers around the country to round up and deport undocumented immigrants  regardless of whether they have committed serious crimes the administration has also moved to limit the highly skilled immigrants whom technology companies bring to the united states and to subject them to much tougher vetting  a recent proposal would also deny the spouses of such immigrants the ability to legally work in the country  a change that could lead many couples to leave during the 2018 midterm elections  mr  trump campaigned on little else  to the dismay of some republican lawmakers  who argued that the president should have focused more on the booming economy and the passage of a major tax cut during his first two years but mr  miller and mr  trump have shown little interest in pulling back on the immigration agenda .
 what you need to know to start the day  get new york today in your inbox  president trump  who has frequently pointed to the violent ms 13 street gang to justify his immigration policy  could not have choreographed a better political talking point if he had tried  two days before tuesdays state of the union address  a deadly shooting on a queens subway platform catapulted the gangs brutality back onto the national stage the police have said the man charged with the killing  ramiro gutierrez  is a member of ms 13  a transnational gang founded in los angeles with ties to el salvador  the slaying featured prominently in mr  trumps address mr  gutierrez  26  was in the country without documentation and had a long arrest record  the authorities said  he is accused of firing six shots at close range into a rival gang members head in front of horrified straphangers  at the time  mr  gutierrez was out on  2 500 bail after being arrested in a gang takedown last december but missing from mr  trumps speech was an important nuance  the shooting does not signal a recent rise of the gang in queens  experts said  neither ms 13  nor its rival  the 18th street gang  is new to new york city  they have been a violent presence in the city for two decades  despite repeated prosecutions  and the shooting on sunday was just the latest incident in a complicated history between the two gangs around 12 45 p m  on sunday  a fight broke out between four men on a manhattan bound 7 train  when the train pulled into the 90th street elmhurst avenue station  the brawl spilled out onto the platform in a bystanders video  a man the police later identified as mr  gutierrez is shown extricating himself from the melee and standing up  grasping what appears to be a small revolver  mr  gutierrez  who is from el salvador  can then be seen pointing the gun at a man on the ground wearing a mets jersey  later identified as abel mosso six shots rang out  as bystanders screamed and ran for cover on the stalled train  mr  mosso was struck several times in the face and died on the platform  the police arrested mr  gutierrez on monday on charges of murder and gang assault mr  mosso  a mexican citizen  was a purported member of the 18th street gang  both men  according to immigration officials  were in the united states without documentation though both gangs began in southern california in the mid 1980s and quickly became archrivals  ms 13 and 18th street had established a presence in eastern queens  and neighboring nassau and suffolk counties by the mid 1990s lou savelli  a former sergeant and head of the police departments first citywide gang unit  said ms 13 and 18th street have been active in new york city and the surrounding region ever since  mr  savelli  who retired from the department in 2004  first encountered ms 13 while working gang cases in the 109th precinct in flushing during ms 13s early years in new york  the gang would sometimes be targeted by the squad for acts of violence  he said  we did some short term things on machete cases where they chopped up one guy  shot and killed another guy  and another case where they ran an auto theft ring  mr  savelli said the rival 18th street gang was less organized  mr  savelli said raphael ramos  a former sergeant in the queens gang squad  said the 18th street gang controls the lucrative trade in forged documents along roosevelt avenue between 90th street and 82nd street historically  thats been their territory  and theyre known as m 18  mr  ramos said the queens district attorney and the united states attorneys office in brooklyn have filed dozens of criminal cases against ms 13 members over the past decade  with charges including racketeering  conspiracy  murder  fraud and robbery aided by statements like mr  trumps in his state of the union address  ms 13 has achieved an almost mythic level of infamy in the world of street gangs  their notoriously gruesome killings  members have been known to cut the hearts out of victims or hack people to death with machetes  began surfacing in new york and long island as far back as the mid 1990s the gang has plagued long island and queens in recent years with a series of brutal slayings  in 2016  the gang killed two teenage girls in brentwood  nisa mickens  15  and her best friend kayla cuevas  16  in a case that drew national attention and landed the victims parents an invitation to mr  trumps first state of the union address last summer  15 year old angel soler was found in a long island field  hacked to death by a machete  a murder law enforcement officials attributed to ms 13  and in december  a 23 year old man was found dead in a queens bird sanctuary after ms 13 members lured him there  prosecutors said beyond murder and assault  the ms 13 gang has also been linked to drug and gun trafficking  as well as extortion and racketeering schemes  the 18th street gang is better known for prostitution  protection rackets and selling forged documents still  the gangs exist in pockets of the city  and the violence they generate is seldom random  law enforcement officials said  often  it involves turf wars and other immigrants  other gangs  the bloods  the crips  the latin kings  the trinitarios  are a higher priority for the new york police department i wouldnt put them at the top of the pecking order of what we see day in and day out  said chief dermot shea  who runs the departments detective bureau it took years for law enforcement to sketch out ms 13s inner workings  and to recognize its hierarchy  it was far more organized than most street gangs  almost akin to the mafia  prosecutors said that learning curve helped ms 13 survive the guys who get caught with the gun at the murder scene  theyre going to be replaced  said james trusty  a former prosecutor who led the justice departments organized crime division  the only way youre going to actually dent the organization as a whole has got to be holistic as ms 13 established its foothold in the mid 2000s  approaches to crackdowns varied between the three major american metropolises where the gang existed  new york  los angeles and washington prosecutors in los angeles and outside the capital built complicated conspiracy cases  taking out ms 13 leaders  but in new york prosecutors favored striking fast  arresting two or three people at a time after murders and robberies long island prosecutors changed their tactics after a spike in ms 13 violence in 2016 and 2017 led to at least 22 killings  madeline singas  the nassau district attorney  indicted 17 ms 13 members in january 2018  including the man believed to be the highest ranking member in the northeast its tough for the organization to bounce back from that  ms  singas said still  ms  singas said she does not believe that long islands crackdown pushed the gang west into queens they were in queens before  too  she said  its not like they moved there because nassau became inhospitable to them .
london  ordering landlords to check prospective tenants immigration status leads to racial discrimination and breaches human rights  britains high court has ruled  in a judgment that deals a blow to migration control measures championed by prime minister theresa may the mandatory checks are one plank in what has become known as the governments hostile environment policy  which aims to force people in the country illegally to leave by blocking their access to jobs  bank accounts and free medical care  among other things the policy has been criticized as imposing heavy burdens on legal immigrants and british citizens who are not white but are obliged to prove their status repeatedly  it has brought particularly harsh consequences for the windrush generation of migrants encouraged to move from the caribbean after world war ii to help with britains reconstruction  many of whom never had  or previously needed  the sort of documents demanded landlords said the mandatory checks made them unwilling border police and discouraged them from renting to anyone whose migration status might not be straightforward the judgment does not strike down the 2014 legislation that imposed document checks on tenants in england  but it asks parliament to reconsider how the law is applied and blocks plans to extend the checks to scotland  wales and northern ireland a report commissioned by the residential landlords association  which backed the legal challenge brought by an immigrant rights group and decided by the high court on friday  found that close to half of landlords were less likely to rent to someone without a british passport the measures have a disproportionately discriminatory effect  justice martin spencer said in his judgment  even if the checks had been shown to be effective in controlling migration  he added  he would have found that this was significantly outweighed by the discriminatory effect evidence submitted to the court showed that the government had failed to measure whether the checks resulted in discrimination  or even whether they helped detect and remove people who were in the country illegally according to the migration observatory at the university of oxford  forced removals and voluntary departures from britain have declined since 2013 the net has been cast too wide and the effect of the scheme has been to cause landlords to commit nationality and or race discrimination against those who are perfectly entitled to rent  with the result that they are less able to find homes than  white  british citizens  the judge said  citing claims from the joint council for the welfare of immigrants  which brought the case to court mrs  may  who was britains home secretary for six years before becoming prime minister in 2016  has been closely identified with moves to tighten the countrys migration policies  she promised to create a really hostile environment for illegal immigration in a 2012 interview with the daily telegraph  although her government now prefers to speak of a compliant environment measures to achieve that included a poster campaign  with billboards driven on vans across londons suburbs in the summer of 2013  urging those in the country illegally to go home or face arrest the billboards drew widespread criticism and quickly disappeared  but they were followed by the legislation mandating document checks at many key points in daily life  a cultural shift for britain  which has no mandatory identity card system  unlike many european countries  and has long considered its relative lack of official paperwork a point of national pride criticism of the measures reached a peak last year  when the government had to apologize to windrush migrants  the name refers to the empire windrush  the liner

that campaigns for civil liberties and supported the court challenge  told the bbc while effective immigration control is a legitimate aim for any government  the home office must stop outsourcing its discriminatory policies to third parties who are ill equipped to enforce them but may be slapped with heavy fines and even end up in prison if they dont  she added the residential landlords

border police would lead to the exact form of discrimination the court has found  it said in a statement on friday in an emailed statement  the home office said it was disappointed with the judgment

malta said saturday that four european union nations would accept 64 migrants rescued at sea off libya 10 days ago in a statement  maltas government said that the migrants will be sent to germany  france  portugal and luxembourg  the migrants are being transferred to maltese vessels and brought to port after days of uncertainty however  malta said the german flagged aid ship  named alan kurdi after a young syrian boy who drowned during the crossing from turkey to greece in 2015  will not be allowed to enter its ports  and none of the migrants will remain in malta once again  the smallest member of the european union was put under unnecessary pressure  being asked to resolve a case which was neither its responsibility nor its remit  the government said  a solution was found in order not to let the situation deteriorate further while making it clear malta cannot keep shouldering this burden the transfer of migrants from the alan kurdi to maltese army boats was conducted at sea and the maltese army was expected to return to dock by saturday afternoon malta has argued it cannot open its ports to humanitarian rescue ships because their activities off libya encourage human traffickers the german ngo sea eye had detailed worsening conditions aboard the ship for the 64 migrants  two have been evacuated in recent days because of health issues  on friday night  a member of the ships crew was also airlifted off the vessel  in recent days  sea eye had documented the deteriorating conditions on the ship  posting video on social media of dozens of people  including women and children  sleeping on a cramped deck the organization criticized the decision from malta to block the ship from entering port while the negotiations over the fate of the migrants onboard were underway it is simply unexplainable why it was necessary for people to stay on board during the long negotiations  while governments negotiated over 64 individual fates  gorden isler  the chairman of sea eye said in a statement  what about the pressure that has been put on our crew and 64 rescued people for 11 days italys interior minister matteo salvini  who has repeatedly rejected calls to allow the ship to enter italian ports  hailed the deal excellent news  he tweeted  soon after the deal was announced  he praised malta for doing the right thing by denouncing the dangerous and undue pressures exerted by the ngos .
to the editor re trump the punisher  editorial observer  april 3  michelle cottles description of president trump as a punisher does not capture the essence no one hates as effectively as president trump  it is his gift  the question is why his gift for hatred is so appealing to so many  the answer lies in how many americans identify with his black or white  all or none  the ends justify the means way of thinking  it can be extremely tempting to ally with someone who intensely guarantees a black or white solution to a complex and perplexing problem  mr  trump may be the master of such a mode of hateful thinking  but he is not a rarity  just a more skilled salesman  his method of hating particularly galvanizes people who feel victimized  it places responsibility for problems upon the vilified and hated other the more desperate somebody feels and the more victimized he may feel  the more enticing the temptation to hate  the desire to punish is just one expression  one antidote is to comprehend and tolerate complexity  appreciating this requires sensitivity and self knowledge  not hatred  binary thinking and overreaction davis a  suskindsan diego.
washington  william p  barr  president trumps nominee for attorney general  promised on monday that he would allow the special counsel to continue his investigation  seeking to allay democrats fears that he might shut down the inquiry it is in the best interest of everyone  the president  congress  and  most importantly  the american people  that this matter be resolved by allowing the special counsel to complete his work  mr  barr said in written testimony that he plans to deliver on tuesday at the start of his two day confirmation hearing before the senate judiciary committee the country needs a credible resolution of these issues  he added  if confirmed  i will not permit partisan politics  personal interests  or any other improper consideration to interfere with this or any other investigation but mr  barrs written statement also included a subtle caveat  limiting his assurances about the investigation to issues under his control  i can assure you that  where judgments are to be made by me  i will make those judgments based solely on the law and will let no personal  political  or other improper interests influence my decision  he wrote that qualification could be important because mr  barr has long advanced a philosophy of strong executive powers under which almost any executive branch decision is ultimately the presidents to make and the president is the nations top law enforcement official  not the attorney general after mr  barr was nominated last month  an unsolicited memo emerged that he had sent to justice department officials and the presidents lawyers last year criticizing a focus of the inquiry  whether the president obstructed justice by firing james b  comey as f b i  director in a possible effort to impede the inquiry itself obviously  the president and any other official can commit obstruction in this classic sense of sabotaging a proceedings truth finding function  mr  barr wrote  noting that the president is not exempt from the law the memo prompted concerns among congressional democrats that mr  barr might stop the investigation by the special counsel  robert s  mueller iii  if mr  trump ordered him to do so  the senate democratic leader  chuck schumer  and senator mark warner of virginia  the leading democrat on the intelligence committee  have called on mr  trump in recent days to rescind mr  barrs nomination  saying that his memo disqualifies him to lead the department in his planned remarks  mr  barr said that his memo addressed only the single obstruction of justice issue and that he did not argue that a president can never obstruct justice the memo did not address  or in any way question  the special counsels core investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election  mr  barr planned to say  i wrote it myself  on my own initiative  without assistance  and based solely on public information in his prepared testimony  mr  barr also said he would follow the rules governing mr  muellers appointment and work to allow him to finish the investigation into russias 2016 election interference and whether any trump associates conspired with it i will follow the special counsel regulations scrupulously and in good faith  and on my watch  bob will be allowed to complete his work  mr  barr planned to say  according to the prepared remarks nonetheless  senators still plan to press mr  barr about the memo  senator dianne feinstein of california  the leading democrat on the judiciary committee  said in a letter to mr  barr that she plans to ask him why he wrote the memo  who he conferred with in writing it  and exactly who he shared it with mr  barr also said that he would provide as much information to the public as the law allowed about the results of the inquiry noting that they worked together at the justice department under president george bush  mr  barr planned to say that he has known and respected mr  mueller as a colleague and friend for 30 years and that he had confidence that mr  mueller would handle the special counsel inquiry properly mr  barr said in his prepared testimony that he reluctantly accepted the nomination out of a sense of civic duty  and that mr  trump has sought no assurances  promises  or commitments from me of any kind  either express or implied in a letter of support for mr  barrs nomination  former justice department officials including former attorney general michael b  mukasey and james m  cole  an obama administration deputy attorney general  wrote that mr  barr  who was attorney general under mr  bush  served without regard to favor or politics mr  barr will lay out his other priorities at the hearing including clamping down on illegal immigration and ensuring the integrity of elections  according to his prepared remarks  the attorney general must ensure that the administration of justice  the enforcement of the law  is above and away from politics  mr  barr planned to say .
palm beach  fla   behind the clipped hedges of president trumps sumptuous private clubs in south florida  including his mar a lago estate where he has spent many getaway weekends  there has long been a built in contradiction to the policy the president has repeatedly described as america first many of his employees have foreign passports romanians serve dinner in lavish banquet halls  south africans tend to guests at the spa  britons bake elegant pastries  most are young people hired as guest workers on special visas  living over the winter high season in a gated community with a sand volleyball pit and a movie theater  in the mornings  they dress in trim uniforms and are chauffeured by van over a bridge to the luxury compound six miles away in palm beach but thats only part of the trump resort work force in south florida alongside the foreign guest workers and the sizable american staff is another category of employees  mostly those who work on the pair of lush golf courses near mar a lago  not offered apartments  they have been picked up by trump contractors from groups of undocumented laborers at the side of the road  hired through staffing companies that assume responsibility for checking their immigration status  or brought onto the payroll with little apparent scrutiny of their social security cards and green cards  some of which are fake that second pool of immigrant labor is an embarrassing reality for a president who has railed against undocumented immigrants  one his company is scrambling to erase mr  trump has long acknowledged that running the hospitality industry on a tight supply of american labor is extraordinarily difficult  the reason mar a lago has frequently turned to legal guest workers for jobs that typically span only  in the case of florida  the pleasant winter months  its very  very hard to get people  he explained during the 2016 campaign  but other hotels do the exact same thing in the case of the trump organization  the hiring of some immigrant labor may be about to change  facing growing questions about its employment of undocumented workers  the company has quietly begun to take steps to eliminate any remaining undocumented workers from its labor pool in south florida in march  seven veteran maintenance workers at trump national jupiter  the golf club 18 miles north of mar a lago that mr  trump bought in 2012  were informed that the work force was being reorganized  workers had until march 22 to provide proof that they were legally eligible to work in the united states  they were told one by one  the workers  from el salvador  guatemala  honduras and mexico  began to depart  only one of the seven was a legal resident they got rid of me after so many years of hard work because i dont have papers  said doroteo hernndez  42  an undocumented immigrant from mexico who worked for 10 years on the maintenance crew at jupiter  one of mr  trumps favorite golfing spots on his weekends at mar a lago mr  hernndez  a diminutive man with a weather beaten face and workmans hands  said that in late march he handed over 11 well worn  button down shirts embroidered with his name and the name of the club  11 pairs of khakis and a club cap to his supervisor  who praised him and gave him a farewell hug im battling on  said mr  hernndez  who supports his parents and siblings in mexico  everyone just wants to take care of their family similar scenes have played out at a number of trump organization golf properties since the new york times first reported that two undocumented housekeepers had for several years worked in proximity to mr  trump at his golf property in bedminster  n j  additional laborers working without legal authorization came forward at other trump golf properties  some of them deliberately kept off the lists of workers vetted by the secret service the undocumented workers raise questions not only about the trump organizations hiring practices  but also about security at mar a lago and the luxurious golf properties that surround it  recently subject to scrutiny after a woman carrying two chinese passports and a thumb drive containing malicious software was detained on march 30 at mar a lago though maintenance workers  drivers and painters from mexico and central america would not normally be thought of as security threats  the presence of workers with fraudulent identity documents poses additional complications in vetting those who may be in proximity to the president at his leisure properties in florida and elsewhere in palm beach county  home to dozens of hotels  golf resorts and residential communities  there is a steady demand for menial labor  some of it performed by foreigners who come in on h 2b guest worker visas  the trump florida properties requested 148 of these immigrant workers for the 2018 19 season  an increase over most past years  this is one area of immigration that the trump administration has pushed to expand meanwhile  across the county  immigrant enclaves have grown in the shadows of multimillion dollar homes  places where the streets are lined with much humbler homes  butcher shops called carniceras  and money order offices where on fridays immigrants wire money home to relatives  unlike those living in the gated complex  the immigrants here are mainly central american  mexican and haitian a number of staffing company offices  discreet  sometimes with mirrored glass windows  are tucked into strip malls  here  workers can submit applications to be placed on job sites  sometimes the same day staffing companies were originally intended to serve as external human resource departments  supplying temporary workers and handling their paperwork  according to richard celler  an employment lawyer in fort lauderdale  fla  but now  mr  celler said  its morphed  he said employers had come to run their regular workers through the companies to cut the cost of workers compensation insurance and to narrow their liability its the outsourcing of labor  he said there is another important advantage greg schell  a lawyer based in lake worth  fla   who represents farmworkers and other migrant workers  said that as employers have faced increased scrutiny from federal authorities over hiring undocumented labor  they have turned to staffing companies  some of which engage in careful immigration verification  some of which do not  these companies enable many florida farms and golf resorts  which can have difficulty finding legal workers  to maintain large work crews without assuming legal responsibility for their immigration status  mr  schell said the whole concept is to have someone else bear the responsibility  he said not long ago  groundskeepers and golf maintenance workers were directly employed at the trump properties in florida and frequently moved between them  according to former employees  however  in recent years  the organization transferred the work crews at mar a lago and nearby golf courses over to barnett management  a staffing company with headquarters in west palm beach that specializes in supplying golf maintenance  landscaping  farm and nursery workers  as well as setup staff for events and banquets in late february  jeff payer  the jupiter clubs golf course superintendent  called in mr  hernndez and the six other maintenance workers who were still on the payroll of another staffing company  ryvor golf  the immigrant workers said  mr  payer informed them that they would be transferred to barnett  which was already handling the majority of the clubs roughly three dozen golf maintenance workers and groundskeepers  they said he told us  you can keep working  we trust you and know your work  recalled roberto carlos mndez  29  a guatemalan  mr  payer declined to be interviewed and did not respond to questions but in early march  several of the former workers said  a barnett representative who visited the club said they could not stay on  telling them that only workers with legal immigration papers would be allowed to transfer to barnetts payroll i spoke personally to the barnett guy  he told me that  unfortunately  i didnt qualify to stay at the club  said mr  mndez  who had worked at the jupiter property since sneaking across the border nearly four years ago in separate interviews  five of the workers offered the same account  all said they were in the country illegally and had been hired despite having phony identification cards and social security numbers and as recently as two and a half years ago  during the 2016 presidential campaign  florida law does not require employers to use the e verify electronic verification system to check employees documents  though some companies  including barnett  use it voluntarily no one from the management at the jupiter club  or at any of the florida trump properties  responded to interview requests for this article  nor did officials from the trump organization  but none of the immigrants doubted that club managers were aware all along that they were undocumented  and were disappointed to see them go they knew immigrants working there are here illegally  said giovanni velsquez  a 23 year old from guatemala who said he had been allowed to continue working as long as he did because he was needed  the know how that i have  the work i do  cant be easily replaced  no american wants to do it mr  mndez said that he spent 10 minutes with the barnett representative trying to ascertain why the ryvor workers were being let go while workers already on barnetts payroll  some of whom he believed were also undocumented  were untouched i told him  i dont understand  he said  he responded that going forward  they will not take people without papers this transition to a greater reliance on staffing companies appeared to begin around 2016  former workers said  though it is not clear if there was any connection to mr  trumps presidential campaign barnett officials declined to discuss the recent staff moves at jupiter  or any other matters  barnett management complies with all federal laws and regulations with respect to the hiring of employees  corey witzel  the general counsel for barnetts parent company  mvp staffing  said in an email in addition to the workers who recently lost their jobs at the jupiter club  around a dozen other undocumented workers at local pickup spots and a resource center for day laborers told the times that they had worked stints at the golf club  brought in by contractors to install irrigation plumbing  spray insecticide and paint houses  one of them said he had worked there for years a man who gave only his first name  santos  31  said that they give us a permisito  a pass  so we could go in  he said he had worked nearly three years painting houses at the golf club starting in 2012 a 24 year old who also gave only his first name  alfonso  said that he  too  worked at the trump national golf club in jupiter as part of a painting crew  and was allowed to continue there even after mr  trump became president  nothing changed with the election  he said as the deadline approached for the undocumented maintenance workers at the jupiter club to leave their jobs  many pondered their futures  mr  mndez  one of the guatemalan immigrants  said that he was offered maintenance work at other golf clubs  but for less than the  11 hourly wage he made at jupiter  if we take a job at a golf club for less  we are moving backward instead of advancing  he said daniel federico gmez  23  said he had not found a job  either  though he had started to train the replacements who would be taking the workers places at jupiter two days before the march 22 deadline  mr  gmez and mr  mndez were the last of the undocumented group still on the job mr  velsquez had found work at an italian restaurant washing dishes for  10 an hour  i have to start all over  he said  all my experience is on the golf course as for mr  hernndez  a friend found him a landscaping job  sitting in his neat apartment after his second day of work  he was still not sure about his salary  mr  payer  the golf superintendent  had found work for him and his co workers at another golf course  mr  hernndez said  but it was too far away for someone like him  who cannot obtain a florida drivers license because he has no proof of legal residence on his last day at jupiter  he returned every part of his tattered trump uniform  they cannot say i took a single thing that didnt belong to me  he said his boss  however  had insisted he keep the cap with the club logo .

on sunday evening  news broke that kirstjen nielsen was leaving her job as head of the department of homeland security  the new york times reporter maggie haberman tweeted that according to people close to nielsen  one reason she hung on as long as she did was because she was aware how awful life would will be for her on the outside  given her role in defending donald trumps policies lets make it so nielsen did not create trumps monstrous policy of separating migrant families  but she should be known forever as the person who carried it out  she put babies in cages  traumatized children for life  and then appears to have lied to congress about what she had done  she did this evil work with either blithe incompetence or malicious sloppiness  failing to create a system to properly track kids who were ripped from their families  on friday  the trump administration said it could take up to two years to identify thousands of separated migrant children  listen to the argument podcast every thursday morning  with ross douthat  michelle goldberg and david leonhardt   now trump is gearing up to do it again  according to nbc news  for months the president has urged his administration to reinstate large scale separation of migrant families crossing the border  nielsen reportedly resisted  citing court rulings and trumps own 2018 executive order ending his administrations family separation policy  trumps choice for acting homeland security secretary  kevin mcaleenan  apparently is more open to the idea should this happen  congress and some judges will try to intervene  but trump is growing ever more lawless and autocratic  there is a near systematic purge happening at the nations second largest national security agency  a senior administration official told cnn on monday  speaking of d h s  the president is filling positions with acting officials  circumventing senate confirmation  some senior members of the administration  like wilbur ross  the commerce secretary  are flatly refusing to cooperate with congressional oversight  cnn reported that trump told border agents to ignore judges when taking steps to keep migrants out  we should not assume that government institutions will restrain the president before he visits anguish and terror on thousands more of the worlds most vulnerable children what happens to nielsen now can serve as an example to other people in the administration as they decide whether to just follow orders  by this  i dont mean that people should scream at nielsen in restaurants  rather  those horrified by family separation should do whatever they can to deny nielsen the sort of cushy corporate landing or prestigious academic appointment once customary for ex administration officials  the fact that she evidently didnt go as far as an erratic and out of control trump wanted is immaterial  she should be a pariah for going as far as she did coincidentally  the day before nielsen resigned  a coalition of progressive groups signed on to a petition asking corporate america to blacklist senior people in the trump administration  including nielsen  who took part in crafting  enacting or defending family separation  allowing her to seek refuge in a corporate corner office or a boardroom  university  speaking agency or elsewhere poses a significant reputational risk for those involved  said karl frisch  a spokesman for restore public trust  the group organizing the campaign how much of a risk will depend on decent trump hating americans  the resistance has been flagging recently  even if abhorrence of trumps degenerate administration has not  many people  having worked frantically to deliver the house to democrats in the midterms  are exhausted  the crackup of the womens march  and the resulting tensions between some black and jewish activists  has been deeply dispiriting  the beginning of the democratic presidential primary has reanimated old intra left animosities  and relentless outrage is hard to sustain  no matter how justified but with the possible return of family separation  the resistance needs to regroup  and demanding a boycott of trump officials tainted by baby snatching is a good place to begin  such a boycott would take advantage of one of the central asymmetries in american life  rural voters  who tend to be conservative  have disproportionate political power  its why trump  who lost the popular vote  is president in the first place  but cosmopolitan progressives have disproportionate economic and cultural power  which is why we have the faintly absurd phenomenon of woke capitalism  that power should be deployed to force the sort of accountability nielsen reportedly fears  and to serve as a warning to others that the trump stink never washes off on monday  henry farrell  a professor at george washington university  wrote that he will boycott any university or think tank that employs nielsen  and refuse to be on panels with anyone from such an institution  he invited others to join him  its a small start  but a start  nielsen should not be permitted to launder her reputation through a fellowship at harvard  like corey lewandowski or sean spicer did  she should not get to follow h r  mcmaster to stanford there are plenty of places that will hire a disgraced child torturer  private prisons  which often hold undocumented immigrants  are a big business  and henry kissingers storied social life shows that americas elite is far from inhospitable to ghouls  but as the country hurtles into a dangerous new phase of unbound trumpism  those who want to say no need to muster whatever leverage they can  including public shame and economic sanctions  either the leaders of corporate america and academia want to be associated with terrorizing toddlers  or not .
washington  kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  resigned on sunday after meeting with president trump  ending a tumultuous tenure in charge of the border security agency that had made her the target of the presidents criticism i have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside  ms  nielsen said in a resignation letter  i hope that the next secretary will have the support of congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure americas borders and which have contributed to discord in our nations discourse ms  nielsen had requested the meeting to plan a way forward at the border  in part thinking she could have a reasoned conversation with mr  trump about the role  according to three people familiar with the meeting  she came prepared with a list of things that needed to change to improve the relationship with the president mr  trump in recent weeks had asked ms  nielsen to close the ports of entry along the border and to stop accepting asylum seekers  which ms  nielsen found ineffective and inappropriate  while the 30 minute meeting was cordial  mr  trump was determined to ask for her resignation  after the meeting  she submitted it the move comes just two days after mr  trump  who has repeatedly expressed anger at a rise in migrants at the southwestern border  withdrew his nominee to run immigration and customs enforcement because he wanted the agency to go in a tougher direction mr  trump has ratcheted up his anti immigration message in recent months as he seeks to galvanize supporters before the 2020 election  shutting down the government and then declaring a national emergency to secure funding to build a border wall  cutting aid to central american countries and repeatedly denouncing what he believes is a crisis of migrants trying to enter the country he took aim again sunday night after announcing ms  nielsens departure  tweeting  our country is full ms  nielsen said she planned to stay on as secretary through wednesday in order to assist with an orderly transition  the abruptness was unusual because the department of homeland security currently does not have a deputy secretary  who would normally take the reins the president said in a tweet that kevin mcaleenan  the commissioner of customs and border protection  would take over as the acting replacement for ms  nielsen  who became the sixth secretary to lead the agency in late 2017  but by law  the under secretary for management  claire grady  who is currently serving as acting deputy secretary  is next in line to be acting secretary  the white house will have to fire her to make mr  mcaleenan acting secretary  people familiar with the transition said  ms  grady has told colleagues that she has no intention of resigning to make way for mr  mcaleenan  read about kevin mcaleenan  the new acting homeland security secretary  among the possible replacements for ms  nielsen in the long term is ken cuccinelli  the former virginia attorney general who is a favorite among conservative activists and who fits the profile that mr  trump wants the next homeland secretary to have  people familiar with the discussions said ms  nielsen had been pressured by mr  trump to be more aggressive in stemming the influx of migrant crossings at the border  people familiar with their discussions in recent months said her entire time in the job was spent batting back suspicion from the president  even as he told people he liked how she performed on television and enjoyed dealing with her personally  he initially was skeptical because of ms  nielsens previous service in the george w  bush administration  and then because she was close to john f  kelly  mr  trumps former chief of staff the president called ms  nielsen at home early in the mornings to demand that she take action to stop migrants from entering the country  including doing things that were clearly illegal  such as blocking all migrants from seeking asylum  she repeatedly noted the limitations imposed on her department by federal laws  court settlements and international obligations those responses only infuriated mr  trump further  the presidents fury erupted in the spring of 2018 as ms  nielsen hesitated for weeks about whether to sign a memo ordering the routine separation of migrant children from their families so that the parents could be detained in a cabinet meeting surrounded by her peers  mr  trump castigated her repeatedly  leading her to draft a resignation letter and to tell colleagues that there was no reason for her to lead the department any longer  by the end of the week  she had reconsidered and remained in her position  becoming an increasingly fierce supporter of his policies  including the family separations mr  trump and stephen miller  the presidents top immigration adviser  have privately but regularly complained about ms  nielsen  lou dobbs  a fox news host who is one of the presidents favorite sounding boards  has also encouraged mr  trumps negative views of her handling of the migrant crisis ms  nielsen lost a powerful protector when mr  kelly  her mentor  left his job as white house chief of staff at the beginning of the year  mr  kelly was the trump administrations first homeland security secretary and lobbied for ms  nielsen to replace him multiple white house officials said she had grown deeply paranoid in recent months  after numerous stories about her job being on the line  she also had supported the immigration and customs enforcement nominee mr  trump withdrew  ronald d  vitiello  and her support for him was described as problematic for her with the president  mr  trump felt mr  vitiello did not favor closing the border  as the president threatened again to do in a tweet on sunday night in early 2019  as the number of migrant families from central american countries surged  the presidents fury at ms  nielsen did  too  he repeatedly demanded that she cut off foreign aid to central american countries even though the funding was the responsibility of the state department  she repeatedly deflected his demands one day after ms  nielsen traveled to honduras to sign a regional compact with officials from guatemala  honduras and el salvador  mr  trump cut state department funding for the countries  and in recent days  the president made public moves to undercut her authority  leaking news that he might nominate an immigration czar to assume oversight of the issue at the heart of ms  nielsens department still  ms  nielsen embraced the presidents crisis language as apprehensions of migrants at the border shot up to thousands per day  on friday  mr  trump traveled with ms  nielsen and mr  mcaleenan to calexico  calif   to highlight the issue while the number of border crossings is not as high as in the early 2000s  the demographic of migrants has shifted largely from individual mexicans looking for jobs  who could easily be deported  to central american families  overwhelming detention facilities and prompting mass releases of migrants into cities along the border ms  nielsen estimated last month that border officials had stopped as many as 100 000 migrants in march but despite the trip and several stories about how much better her relationship with mr  trump was  ms  nielsen never learned how to manage him  people familiar with their discussions said  he often felt lectured to by ms  nielsen  the people familiar with the discussions said and his son in law  jared kushner  was not an admirer of ms  nielsen  several administration officials said  that came to a head recently as mr  kushner had inserted himself into immigration discussions while mr  trump often blamed ms  nielsen for the surge in migrant crossings  she will be remembered for leading the department during the trump administrations zero tolerance policy along the southwestern border  which initially resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant children from their families an intense backlash ensued  and the department of homeland security was unprepared to deal with separating nearly 3 000 children from their parents hampered by misstep after misstep  kirstjen nielsens tenure at the department of homeland security was a disaster from the start  said representative bennie thompson  a mississippi democrat and the chairman of the houses committee on homeland security  it is clearer now than ever that the trump administrations border security and immigration policies  that she enacted and helped craft  have been an abysmal failure and have helped create the humanitarian crisis at the border mr  trump eventually moved to halt the family separations  though the government struggled in some cases to reunite those it had already separated by naming mr  mcaleenan acting secretary  mr  trump is installing another veteran of previous administrations  not a loyal foot soldier of mr  trumps campaign married to a salvadoran immigrant  mr  mcaleenan is a lawyer who wrote an honors thesis at amherst college on marriage equality and applied at the f b i  after the sept  11 attacks described by colleagues as a savvy political operator  mr  mcaleenan worked cooperatively with obama administration officials but later embraced mr  trumps agenda  which included unshackling border patrol agents from restrictions that the previous administration had imposed mr  mcaleenan was also one of three department of homeland security officials who had urged ms  nielsen to sign the memo authorizing the routine separation of migrant families at the border the department  which has a budget of more than  40 billion and more than 240 000 employees  is an amalgam of 22 government agencies that was created after the sept  11 terrorist attacks  it is responsible for everything from protecting the nation from cyberattacks to responding to natural disasters at 46  ms  nielsen was the youngest person to lead the sprawling department  and an unlikely choice for the job in the months immediately after the sept  11 attacks  she helped set up the transportation security administration  now an agency within the department  she also worked as a special assistant to president george w  bush on natural disaster response while serving on the white house homeland security council when mr  trump moved mr  kelly to the white house in july 2017  ms  nielsen moved with him  as the principal deputy chief of staff  she enforced mr  kellys attempts to regulate access to mr  trump in the oval office  including the presidents schedule  irritating white house staff members  who complained she was uncompromising mr  kelly later backed ms  nielsen to succeed him at the homeland security department  though she was criticized as too inexperienced for the job by democrats and anti immigration groups  mr  trump  however  said she was ready on day 1 there will be no on the job training for kirstjen  mr  trump said in october 2017  announcing her nomination for the post but by the following spring  ms  nielsen was telling associates she was miserable in the job .
time finally ran out for kirstjen nielsen  president trumps beleaguered secretary of homeland security the terms of ms  nielsens departure are unclear  she met with the president on sunday evening to discuss continuing problems at the southern border  at the conclusion of the meeting  mr  trump announced on twitter that ms  nielsen will be leaving her position and he thanked her for her service  implying he had asked her to step down  ms  nielsen issued a formal letter of resignation  saying it was the right time for me to step aside  considering the long simmering tensions between the president and ms  nielsen  the most surprising thing about her departure may be that it didnt happen months ago she was said to have become increasingly insecure in her job in recent weeks  as mr  trump repeatedly railed about the chaos at the border and pushed for dramatic action  including reinstating his policy of separating migrant families at the border and closing legal ports of entry  the president grew impatient with ms  nielsens insistence that federal law and international obligations limited her actions  in recent days  including in the hours immediately after the secretarys resignation  he repeatedly fumed that our country is full  its no secret that mr  trump had a problem with ms  nielsen  whom he considered weak on matters of border security  the president and stephen miller  his hard line immigration adviser  have long grumbled privately about the secretarys insufficiently brutal approach to the surge in migrant families across the border  last may  stories surfaced about mr  trump berating her in front of the entire cabinet for failing to stop the crossings  in her letter released on sunday  ms  nielsen noted  for more than two years of service beginning during the presidential transition  i have worked tirelessly to advance the goals and missions of the department this is hardly something to brag about  whatever the secretarys personal views  and no matter how impossible her job  she was the face of some of the administrations most poorly conceived and gratuitously callous policies  at best  she was complicit and  yes  rather weak ms  nielsens response to her bosss displeasure and abuse was often both morally anemic and strategically incoherent  last summer  as republicans and democrats and much of the american public  protested the administrations practice of tearing migrant children from their parents at the border  ms  nielsen rushed to defend the policy  scratch that  she insisted  repeatedly and bizarrely  that the administration had no such policy  even as her agency was enforcing and justifying it  we do not have a policy of separating families at the border  she said on twitter in june  period  she repeated as much to congress as recently as march  but the grim repercussions of this nonpolicy are still being felt  just on friday  in a court filing  federal officials said it could take up to two years to identify possibly thousands of migrant children taken from their families beginning in july 2017 not that immigration was the only issue on which ms  nielsen floundered  on the critical question of russias meddling in the 2016 elections  she was even less lucid  at times  she seemed to support the intelligence communitys findings that the kremlin had been up to no good  other times  she supported the view that russia had not favored mr  trump in the election  her every utterance seemed intended to obfuscate rather than to clarify ms  nielsens departure is part of a broader purging in her department  two days before meeting with the secretary  the president withdrew his nomination for the next head of the immigration and customs enforcement agency  saying that he wanted to go in a tougher direction  on monday  the white house confirmed that randolph alles  the head of the secret service  was on his way out as well  the general counsel for homeland security  john mitnick  and the head of citizenship and immigration services  l  francis cissna  are expected to soon follow  for now  ms  nielsens acting replacement will be kevin mcaleenan  the commissioner of customs and border protection  this leaves homeland security without a top official at either of its critical immigration agencies  it comes as the swell of migrant families across the border pushes the system toward collapse  possible successors being discussed include rick perry  the secretary of energy  and ken cuccinelli  the former attorney general of virginia whoever takes ms  nielsens place  it seems likely that greater influence will be exerted by mr  miller  who inspires and reinforces mr  trumps harshest impulses on immigrants and immigration  as the president becomes increasingly agitated about the border situation  mr  miller is said to be aggressively pushing to stock the administration with like minded hard liners  in addition to being a longtime critic of ms  nielsen  mr  miller is thought to have played a role in the withdrawal of the nomination of ron vitiello to lead ice and the impending departure of mr  cissna  the house speaker  nancy pelosi  a democrat  said of ms  nielsens departure  it is deeply alarming that the trump administration official who put children in cages is reportedly resigning because she is not extreme enough for the white houses liking the plan is for ms  nielsen to continue through wednesday to help with an orderly transition  i share the presidents goal of securing the border  she said monday morning  i will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis on the border if ms  nielsen is inclined to perform one last act of public service  she should come clean about the costs of the policies she enforced over the past year and a half  not only to the desperate migrants seeking a better life in the united states  but also to the thousands of employees of her department charged with carrying out an inhumane and ineffective agenda  .
for eight years  it seemed to margarita cruz that the management at the trump organizations golf club in westchester county  n y   did not notice  or did not care  that the green card and social security card she had used to get hired were fake  purchased in queens for about  120 ms  cruz  a housekeeper  said she cleaned guest rooms  offices and shops at the club  she laundered sheets and pool towels  but that all ended this month  she said ms  cruz and about a dozen other employees  housekeepers  landscapers and a head chef  at the club  trump national golf club  were fired jan  18 because they were in the country illegally  according to interviews with ms  cruz and the former workers lawyer the firings were first reported on saturday by the washington post the new york times reported in december that undocumented immigrants had been employed at another club owned by the trump organization  the trump national golf club in bedminster  n j   and that they were kept on the payroll for years even though management there had some knowledge of their fraudulent papers several workers deemed ineligible to work in the country had already been fired at the bedminster club  according to people familiar with the matter the employment of undocumented workers at trump organization properties runs counter to president trumps anti immigrant rhetoric  which he has made central to his campaign and his presidency  he is currently in a heated political battle to build a wall along the border with mexico  which he claims would stop drugs and crime  evidence does not support mr  trumps thesis there is nothing to indicate that mr  trump or trump organization executives knew about the workers immigration status at either golf club  but ms  cruz  44  said she believed that management at the westchester club knew about her immigration status before january her papers were requested again two years ago  she said  not just when she was hired  anibal romero  who represents ms  cruz and 14 other former workers at the golf club  the majority of whom were fired jan  18  was stronger in his wording im not buying that they didnt know  mr  romero said neither ms  cruz nor the other former workers received benefits like health insurance or a pension  as other golf club employees did  mr  romero said  most of his clients came into the country through mexico  mr  romero said  and were originally from countries such as mexico  ecuador and honduras this was a two tiered system  he said  the people who were legal and the people who are undocumented he said the workers were fired by being individually called into a room by an executive  who read their names off a list the white house referred questions to the trump organization on saturday  the trump organization and the westchester golf club did not respond to requests for comment in a statement to the post  eric trump  who manages the trump organization with his brother donald jr   said  we are making a broad effort to identify any employee who has given false and fraudulent documents to unlawfully gain employment  where identified  any individual will be terminated immediately ms  cruz entered the united states in 2009 near piedras negras  mexico  on the texas border  she said  with a 12 year old daughter and a 9 year old son  her parents had paid a coyote  11 000 for the trip she said that in mexico she earned about  40 a week working at a restaurant  she started at  11 per hour at the golf club  and then got a raise to  14 per hour  she said she did not have any savings when she was fired because she had been paying back her parents mr  trumps political rhetoric has been surprising  she said  because he would regularly come by the golf club before his election and give the workers  50 tips in cash he would come over and say hello  ask your name and how long you had worked at the club  ms  cruz said  he would ask you how you liked the rug  or a picture on the wall  things like that she added  if he really did hate latinos so much  why did he come over to talk to us she said some of her colleagues had worked at the golf club for 18 years i couldnt understand why he started talking like that about latinos now and why he fired us  she said mr  romero said he is seeking federal and state investigations of the golf club to see if it had been exploiting the undocumented workers .
ciudad jurez  mexico  from her home in honduras  maria magdalena ferrufino nuez learned that mexicos new president was helping the migrants who were heading north in search of a better life i heard that he was welcoming the caravans  said ms  ferrufino nuez  55  who traveled with her son toward ciudad jurez  where she is waiting in a shelter for a chance to apply for asylum in the united states the spring months usually see an upswell in migration in the region as central americans  fleeing poverty and violence or seeking to reunite with family members in the united states  take advantage of the temperate weather to travel north  but this year  a record number of migrant families is overwhelming officials and facilities on not only on the american side of the mexico united states border  infuriating trump administration officials  but also on the mexican side the backup of migrants in mexico has been commonly blamed on restrictions the trump administration has imposed on the american asylum process  but this crisis appears to be also  in part  of the mexican presidents making according to migrants  local officials and migration scholars  this increase in northward migration has been partly spurred by the policies of president andrs manuel lpez obrador of mexico  who had campaigned as a defender of the poor and the downtrodden  and took office in december  read the latest edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  during his tenure  he has sought to strike a contrast with his predecessors by presenting a kinder  gentler face toward migrants  deportations have plummeted under his watch  and his administration has sought to incorporate more migrants into mexican society by being more generous with humanitarian visas and work permits at the same time  he has also helped the trump administrations efforts to impede people seeking asylum in the united states with more migrants moving north  and greater restrictions on entry into the united states  the number of migrants waiting along the mexican side of the border has swelled  from tijuana  on the western end of the border  to matamoros on the eastern end  thousands of migrants have overflowed shelters  drawn down the emergency resources of local governments and civil society and tested the generosity and patience of residents in ciudad jurez  northbound migrants  from central america  the caribbean and elsewhere  started arriving en masse late last year  the citys two longtime shelters quickly overflowed  churches pushed aside pews to make room for mattresses  and a public school gymnasium was converted to a dormitory  there are now nine shelters  still not enough to house newly arriving migrants  who are pouring in at a rate of more than 100 a day  local and state officials said nobody knows where this is going to go  how many people are going to come  how many more people were going to help  said rogelio pinal castellanos  the director of human rights in ciudad jurez and the situation would only get worse should mr  trump follow through on his threat to close the border in retaliation for what he says has been an inadequate effort by the mexican government to stem unauthorized migration the surge of migrants winding up in ciudad jurez and other border cities corresponds to a rise in the number of undocumented migrants trying to enter the united states american officials say about 76 000 migrants without authorization were intercepted  or surrendered  along the southwest border in february  a 31 percent increase over januarys number  interdictions of undocumented immigrants  most of them from central america  were on pace to surpass 100 000 last month  the trump administration claims  and could reach one million by the end of september  these are levels not seen since the early 2000s the surge in undocumented migrants has come despite a series of aggressive policies by the trump administration designed to discourage migration  including the constricting of the asylum process for years  migrants seeking asylum only needed to present themselves at a port of entry into the united states to begin the process  but the trump administration has begun to use a system known as metering  which limits the daily number of asylum seekers allowed to present their cases at certain ports of entry the practice has given rise to informal waiting lists managed by the mexican authorities  or even by the migrants themselves  there are currently more than 3 300 asylum seekers on the list in ciudad jurez  the number that can formally cross each day ranges from several dozen to none  and the wait can stretch for months  on sunday only 10 were allowed to cross  the day before  zero in a trend that began during the obama administration  an increasing percentage of migrants are traveling in family units with children  some say they bring their children in part because they know they will have a better chance of being released from american detention more quickly we heard in guatemala that if you were traveling with children  it was much easier to cross  said a woman  30  who has been staying with her 5 year old son at a jurez shelter waiting for her turn to apply for asylum in neighboring el paso  she gave her surname as ramirez  but asked that her full name not be published because she did not want to imperil her case  she said she was fleeing a violent gang in guatemala while president lpez obrador has chosen  in some ways  to help the united states carry out its immigration agenda  he has also sent a message to potential migrants that they are now more welcome than ever in mexico in the first three months of the lpez obrador administration  there were 44 percent fewer deportations than during the last three months of president enrique pea nietos administration mr  lpez obrador has also talked repeatedly about  incorporating more migrants into the mexican work force in january  the mexican immigration agency set up a special task force on the southern border to expedite the issuing of yearlong  renewable humanitarian visas for central americans approaching as part of a large migrant caravan but after more than 13 000 migrants applied for the visa in two weeks  the government abruptly ended the program many migrants who had applied for the visa said they intended to use it to ease their passage to the northern border  and then cross into the united states  either legally or illegally i heard that they were giving an excellent entry permit  and because of that we came with the idea of making it to the united states  said donald tejada  28  a coffee plantation worker from honduras who applied for the special visa in late january and though the migrant caravans account for only a small  albeit high profile  fraction of the total number of migrants who traverse mexico  the lpez obrador administration has largely allowed them to move unimpeded across mexican territory at least two large migrant caravans  one numbering about 2 000 people and the other about 800  are currently traveling through southern mexico toward the united states  according to local news reports  yet another left san salvador  the capital of el salvador  on saturday  also heading north on sunday  the mexican migration agency said it would resume issuing humanitarian visas on monday to migrants in a limited manner in the southern state of chiapas  giving priority to women  children and people older than 65  the agency also said it would start issuing the visas through mexican consulates in guatemala  el salvador and honduras beginning in may but the lpez obrador administration has been under considerable pressure from president trump to help curb illegal migration into the united states  and following a meeting last week with trump administration officials  mexicos interior minister  olga snchez cordero  said security forces would be deployed to form a containment cordon across southern mexico to help control migration the lpez obrador administration is also under pressure from the northern border cities and states that have been shouldering the burden of care for the thousands of migrants officials in the state of chihuahua  which includes ciudad jurez  said they have repeatedly lobbied their federal counterparts for money to help support the migrants waiting to cross into the united states  arguing that their presence is partly a result of inconsistent national migration policy but they have received little assistance we dont have the capacity to receive so many people for so much time  said enrique valenzuela  the coordinator of the chihuahua governments population council  which oversees migrant issues for the state  facing a situation that we didnt cause  the costs have been high and are increasing part of mr  valenzuelas work is to urge patience among the migrants waiting to apply for asylum  but  he cautions  the longer they have to wait  the more likely they will be to try to cross illegally and the more that people cross illegally  the more that the trump administration will reassign personnel from the legal border crossings  causing slowdowns at ports of entry  further limiting the procession of asylum seekers and fueling a vicious cycle andrew selee  the president of the migration policy institute in washington  said that both the trump and lpez obrador administrations are learning the limits of their own political rhetoric the great irony here is that you have one administration north of the border that rhetorically thinks only in terms of enforcement and one south of the border that rhetorically thinks in terms of getting rid of enforcement  he said  and neither one is possible .
president trump said last week that he would cut off aid to guatemala  honduras and el salvador  the home countries of most of the migrants arriving at the united states southern border to seek asylum the trump administration has already taken the first step to act on the presidents directive  notifying congress that it wanted to divert the  450 million allocated to the region  by monday  though  the administration had not offered details about whether any aid  such as military aid or support to combat drug trafficking  might be exempt from the order if the aid withdrawal does go ahead  aid advocates say  it would probably affect the regions most vulnerable people  including small farmers struggling to adapt to climate change and teenagers pressured to join gangs in a region that is a major drug transit route  according to state department estimates  advocates say that  should these threats to lives and livelihoods grow  many more people will take their chances on the road and leave for the united states the decision to end aid is likely to provoke anger in congress  where lawmakers in both parties have supported efforts to address the root causes of migration  if the money is ultimately withheld  it would affect a wide range of programs designed to improve citizen security  promote economic development and encourage accountable government mr  trump has complained that the governments of the three countries have done too little to halt immigration  and portrayed the withdrawal of aid as punishment for their leaders a vast majority of the aid  however  goes to nongovernmental organizations  churches  charities and private contractors that carry out projects for the state department and the united states agency for international development  according to the washington office on latin america  a human rights research group  the largest portion of aid has gone to improving security and justice systems  and to preventing violence aid varies from country to country to address their different needs  in el salvador  where the united states has helped support a broad antiviolence program  57 percent of the  149 million in aid allocated in 2017 went to projects intended to prevent violence  improve security and community policing  and train judges  prosecutors and public defenders in honduras  where aid reached almost  182 million in 2017  the highest percentage of funds  some 44 percent  went to support programs that improved justice and security  with an additional 30 percent allocated for antipoverty programs among the countrys rural poor the aid also supports anticorruption measures by providing funds for international prosecutors who have been investigating graft in honduras and guatemala  and a special anticorruption unit in the salvadoran attorney generals office  in advance of guatemalas elections in june  the united states has also helped finance the countrys electoral agency the united states also supported border security and efforts to combat drug trafficking  though those funds accounted for a smaller percentage of the overall aid  the pentagon set aside millions to improve drug interdiction and to supply equipment and training to counter trafficking in honduras in guatemala  poverty  rather than violence  is the main driver of migration  more than half of the  178 million in 2017 aid went to programs to alleviate poverty  particularly in the countrys western highlands  where many children suffer from chronic malnutrition economic aid is the next largest block of american support in central america  after security and related programs  the funds support small businesses in guatemala  schools in honduras and job training for at risk youth in el salvador  among other projects  some of the programs are broader  such as an effort to bring down high power costs by connecting electrical grids and financing new infrastructure in 2017   18 million was allocated to help farmers in honduras diversify their crops and improve productivity  to reduce extreme hunger and poverty  and  14 5 million to help small business owners  including funds to help create a sustainable system for cacao production in guatemala that year  more than  10 million was designated to help communities adapt to climate changes effects  such as increased drought and coffee destroying fungus  and  6 3 million to help the health ministry prevent maternal and infant deaths  and prevent h i v  infections until a large wave of unaccompanied minors from central america arrived at the texas border in 2014  american aid to the region focused on economic growth and law enforcement  but the surge of child migrants  which was in part spurred by the high murder rates in the northern triangle  prompted the obama administration to request more money from congress for a broader approach to the region as a result  aid increased to  750 million in 2016 before beginning to drop under the trump administration  over all  congress allocated almost  2 1 billion to central america from 2016 to 2018  most of it for the northern triangle countries  though agencies have been slow to spend all the money murder rates have fallen in all three countries but poverty remains as entrenched as ever  and it remains difficult to assess how effective the aid has been  particularly over such a short period  advocates argue that programs need years to take effect the trump administration has also redirected its emphasis toward security and away from the focus on ethical governance  that shift has taken pressure off central american governments to become more accountable  and both the guatemalan and honduran governments have recently pushed back against anticorruption efforts .
by threatening to close the border with mexico and moving to cut off aid to el salvador  honduras and guatemala  the so called northern triangle countries  from which many migrants headed to the united states are coming  president trump is effectively shooting america in the foot  to paraphrase one expert kevin mcaleenan  the commissioner of united states customs and border protection  noted last week that the near record number of migrant families with children seeking asylum both at and in between official ports of entry on the southern border was stretching his agency to a breaking point  this was made startlingly clear as photos of hundreds of migrants  including many small children  confined behind razor wire in a makeshift enclosure beneath a bridge in el paso  spread quickly across the internet  the agency has since closed the holding area c b p  and immigration and customs enforcement  both of which operate under the department of homeland security  have taken steps to grapple with the increased flow of migrants  a vast majority of them families with children seeking asylum  the agencies have diverted resources and personnel to process and care for the migrants  even agreeing to release some families to american cities far from the border we are doing everything we can to simply avoid a tragedy in a c b p  facility  mr  mcaleenan said  but with these numbers  with the types of illnesses were seeing at the border  i fear that its just a matter of time in an attempt to ease the problem  kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  signed a compact with officials from the northern triangle last week to help curb the complex drivers of irregular migration  including crime and gang violence in the region  mr  trump  less than a day later  announced he was ending aid to those countries  nonsensically  mr  trump has insisted that the real problem is mexico  which he suggested is doing nothing to help stop the tide of migrants  thats despite the efforts by mexican leaders to intercept migrant groups  providing temporary visas to asylum seekers and allowing some making the trek north to remain in mexico while they await court hearings in the united states as with the presidents wall  which would do little to discourage unauthorized migration  let alone illegal drug trafficking  no one with a working knowledge of immigration policy believes that closing the border is a solution to the recent surge  the economic disruption for border communities and the impact on trade would be disastrous  plus  closing the border wont stop migrants from stepping onto united states soil and claiming asylum  as many of the groups surrendering to border agents in recent months have done in between ports of entry what would help much more is action to address the root causes of the surge in border crossings  from reforming federal immigration laws to aid to improve economic conditions in central america  and most urgently  congress needs to come up with a more nimble legal framework to address the glut of asylum claims and more funding for log jammed immigration courts to process them  this moment calls for proactive measures  not incendiary policies that are destined to backfire .
hi  welcome to on politics  your guide to the day in national politics  im lisa lerer  your host  get on politics delivered to your inbox  hes running julin castro  the former housing secretary and former mayor of san antonio  tex   said on saturday that he will run for president  the first major latino candidate to make a 2020 bid  mr  castro  44  advocated for a fairly progressive platform in his announcement speech here at on politics  were trying to talk to all the 2020 candidates as they enter the race  and mr  castro agreed to be our first subject  we spoke late sunday afternoon  shortly after he landed in san juan  puerto rico  where he planed to speak to a group of political activists and tour a hurricane recovery zone   as usual  our conversation has been condensed for clarity  lisa  hi  thanks for chatting with us  as you well know  youre one of the first of whats likely to be quite a number of democrats running for president  how can you distinguish yourself castro  i have a track record of getting things done as mayor of san antonio and as secretary of housing  i have a strong vision for the countrys future  and ive lived a life that i believe lets me understand people all along the scale of experience in our country  i had a modest upbringing and i can understand people that are striving to reach their dreams  ive also reached my dreams and can understand folks who have had a lot of success youre in puerto rico right now  thats pretty far from iowa  why start your campaign there i want everybody to understand that everybody counts in this country  the most basic tenet of government is protection  and this administration failed our fellow americans in puerto rico by not protecting them after hurricane maria  im going to highlight that  and then well let folks know that in the years to come everybody is going to count in this country  including the people of puerto rico president trump has said theres a massive crisis on the border  do you agree not at all  the crisis that exists is a crisis of leadership  this president has failed  he promised all of us that if americans could just be cruel enough to separate babies from their parents at the border  that it would deter more families from coming over there  now weve seen that more families are coming over  so he has failed with his policies  and hes failed in trying to convince the american people that hes not to blame for this shutdown  and the best thing that he can do now is to set aside his political ploy of the wall you may be the only latino in a crowded race  how do you think that will impact the contest ive got to be myself  and im confident that i can appeal to a broad cross section of americans  at the same time  of course  theres significance to the latino community because i believe a lot of latinos feel targeted right now by this administration  for me  personally  i can relate to many of todays immigrants because my grandmother that i grew up with came over from mexico  and i grew up in san antonio  just a few hours away from the border  so ive seen the positive value that immigrants add to this country in a very direct way  and i know that these cities along the border are some of the safest cities in the united states any democrats who runs will have to answer the question of how to challenge mr  trump  whats your philosophy the way i see it is that  above all else  people want to know what you stand for  im going to give people a strong positive vision for our countrys future  of course  im going to point out where i differ with the president  but my first priority is to let you know  if you elect me  what im going to do for you or for your family do you think a democrat will end up running against mr  trump  like  do you think hell still be in office next year  thats probably the best question out there now  you know  its hard to tell whats going to happen  my hope is that these investigations will proceed thoroughly and congress will act once the investigation is finished appropriately  so right now  im prepared to face president trump in november of 2020  if theres somebody else whos up for the republicans  then ill face them mr  trump is known for giving nicknames to his opponents  what do you think yours will be  who knows and who cares  you know  the thing about magic tricks is that even magic tricks get old  and his tricks are getting old  sign up here to get on politics in your inbox                      talks between the white house and congressional democrats to end the longest

and that uniformed officers will get a  500 bonus on tuesday so far  the youngs have been able to stretch their finances to cover their expenses  but if the shutdown continues into next month  the couple said they will have to make some really hard choices about which bills to pay we had a screw in our tire  and i had to go and figure out how were going to pay for it to get fixed  said mr

washington  president donald trump s administration stepped up pressure on the department of homeland security  dhs  on tuesday  raising the likelihood that he might fire more senior officials as the agency struggles with a surge of immigrants on the u s  mexico border two days after homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen announced her departure  a senior administration official said others at dhs were not doing enough to enact trump s promised immigration crackdown  a top priority for him since he announced his candidacy for the white house four years ago dhs acting deputy secretary claire grady offered her resignation to trump  effective wednesday  after a 28 year career at the departments of defense and homeland security  nielsen said in a tweet late on tuesday several other dhs officials could be forced out soon  said an official familiar with the matter among them were the department s general counsel  john mitnick  and u s  citizenship and immigration services  uscis  director francis cissna  the source said  a dhs spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on the officials  expected tenure trump denied that he was overhauling dhs and said his administration was fighting  bad laws  on immigration and a court system that  never ever rules for us    a frequent refrain of his as a succession of policies to curb entry to the united states has been met with legal challenges by civil rights advocates  nobody ever said i was cleaning house   trump told reporters at the white house nielsen announced her resignation on sunday after a meeting with trump in which the two disagreed on the best way to handle border security  the personnel changes could further destabilize the u s  domestic security agency as it tries to stem rising numbers of immigrants arriving at the border  many of them families fleeing violence and poverty in central america  dhs said it arrested or denied entry to more than 103 000 people along the border last month  more than double the march 2018 figure  the u s  secret service said on monday that its chief  randolph  tex  alles  would depart his job next month  trump last friday withdrew the nomination of ronald vitiello to serve as director of u s  immigration and customs enforcement several top dhs jobs are either vacant or filled on an acting basis  including positions responsible for disaster response  immigration enforcement  finance  policy  and science and technology  it s not good to have all these people performing in an acting position   said senate homeland security committee chairman ron johnson  a republican frustrationstrump has grown increasingly frustrated as dhs officials have told him that the dramatic immigration changes they seek are not possible under current law and would require the cooperation of congress  several sources say trump repeatedly pressed nielsen over recent weeks to bring back last year s controversial policy of separating migrant children from their parents  one source said  trump abandoned that policy last year in the face of widespread public outrage  and it was subsequently struck down in court trump denied on tuesday that he was reviving the separation policy  johnson said that policy would have  no support  in congress a senior administration official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said one option may be to give migrant families a choice of staying in long term detention together while they await a court hearing or splitting up  an idea known as  binary choice   the administration may also move to detain migrant children for longer than the 20 day maximum set by a court ruling  to spur a legal challenge that could overturn that limit  the official said  the official said dhs has been too slow in drafting new rules that would tighten immigration the official singled out uscis  saying it had not moved quickly enough to tighten h 1b visas for skilled workers and has granted an  astronomical  number of asylum claims asylum officers found that applicants had a  credible fear  of persecution in their home countries in 78 percent of the cases they decided between october and february  according to uscis data the white house could anger allies in congress if it fires uscis head cissna  who previously worked with republicans on the senate judiciary committee  republican senator chuck grassley said on twitter that cissna was  doing what voters asked4 w prestrump election  any move to fire cissna or other dhs leaders would likely complicate the department s leadership woes u s  customs and border protection commissioner kevin mcaleenan is due to take nielsen s place on a temporary basis  starting on wednesday  leaving dhs without a permanent leader on the front lines of the border crisis dhs s acting deputy secretary grady was legally supposed to take over after nielsen s departure  so grady s resignation on tuesday cleared the way for mcaleenan to take the agency s reins trump has interviewed several candidates for the top job over the past week and a half  including former kansas secretary of state kris kobach  former virginia attorney general ken cuccinelli  and former acting immigrations and customs enforcement head thomas homan  all three have expressed hard line views on illegal immigration  and could have difficulty winning confirmation in the u s  senate  which trump s republicans control by a 53 47 margin senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said congress needed to set aside its differences to overhaul immigration laws  which it has

 read the latest edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  a 7 year old guatemalan girl who died in united states custody last december was suffering from a bacterial infection that was so advanced she probably would have been visibly sick for many hours  said several physicians who reviewed a newly released autopsy report of her death by the time the girl  jakelin caal maquin  arrived at a childrens hospital in el paso with seizures and difficulty breathing  she already had severe blood abnormalities  according to a part of the report that summarized her condition in the emergency room of the childrens hospital at the hospitals of providence memorial campus the new findings were released on friday by the el paso county office of the medical examiner  customs and border protection officials and lawyers for the girls family have sparred over whether the severity of her infection  with a common streptococcus bacteria  should have been recognized and whether she should have been taken for medical care more quickly something like that takes hours to progress  said dr  lee sanders  the chief of general pediatrics at stanford university jakelin and her father  nery gilberto caal cruz  spent about eight hours in a remote area of the new mexico border after they were apprehended by border patrol agents for crossing illegally into the united states as part of a group of 163 migrants  they were not placed on the first bus departing for the lordsburg border patrol station  according to a timeline released last december by customs and border protection officials said that mr  caal signed a form after he was apprehended that certified his child was healthy  however  lawyers representing mr  caal have said the form was in english  which mr  caal did not speak many migrants interviewed in recent weeks after being released from border patrol custody said they or their children had been sick but they had not revealed the illnesses  for reasons ranging from fear that it would slow their processing to a lack of knowledge that medical care would be available  pediatricians said that it would be difficult for border patrol agents with little or no medical training to judge how sick a child was congressman raul ruiz  a democrat from california who is an emergency physician  said in an interview that the new report highlighted the need for standardized medical checks at the border clearly there was no meaningful observation or evaluation of this child  he said  it is the legal responsibility of c b p  to provide for the humanitarian needs and the health needs of the children under their custody while being detained that duty is made more challenging by the fact that migrants are crossing in difficult to reach areas  where medical resources  including ambulances  are in short supply the agency said mr  caal notified border patrol agents that his daughter was sick and vomiting only immediately before their departure from the remote region  still  the girl did not receive medical attention until the bus arrived at the station  roughly an hour and a half later  where border patrol agents trained as emergency medical technicians examined her and called for an ambulance  she was then flown to the el paso hospital jakelins death  and then the death just weeks later of another guatemalan child  felipe gmez alonzo  led the federal agency to  begin making improvements in evaluating children for medical problems and increase staffing of medical professionals  congress has earmarked funds for that this year lawyers for the girls family have called for an independent investigation  and said in a statement friday that while the autopsy report sheds some light on jakelins cause of death  it still leaves many questions that require further review the reports findings suggest that jakelins chances of surviving would have been improved with earlier medical intervention  they said in the statement  according to the autopsy  jakelins death resulted from streptococcal sepsis  a life threatening response to infection mr  caal said friday evening that although he had been informed about the release of the autopsy report  he had not yet seen it i wanted to know what happened  he said  speaking by phone from philadelphia where he is staying with relatives  he had been concerned that the report might in some way affect his immigration case the agency  which has defended its handling of the case  did not offer a comment on the new report at a news conference on wednesday announcing further increases in illegal border crossings  kevin k  mcaleenan  the customs and border protection commissioner  warned that dangers remained with 55 000 families  including 40 000 children expected to enter the process this month  we are doing everything we can to simply avoid a tragedy in a c b p  facility  he said  but with these numbers  with the types of illnesses were seeing in the border  i fear that its just a matter of time .
twenty two days into the longest government shutdown ever  president trump continued to press his case for a border wall  his tweet on saturday was crammed with statistics that were either exaggerated or omitted important context  immigrant prison populationmr  trumps figure for the percentage of unauthorized immigrants in federal prisons is exaggerated out of the bureau of prisons total inmate population of 183 058 in the first quarter of the 2018 fiscal year  21 percent were immigrants  both legal and undocumented  according to a government report  at least 13 percent of the total population  or 23 826 inmates  were in the country unlawfully  the immigration status of another 11 698 inmates was under investigation  while 2 608 inmates were lawful immigrants or had received relief from deportation the most common crimes committed by these immigrants were drug related offenses  46 percent  and immigration offenses  29 percent   its worth noting  too  that about half of the arrests made by the federal government are for immigration related offenses  perhaps explaining the high proportion of immigrants in federal prisons  the report acknowledges that it does not include data from state and local prisons  which house 90 percent of all inmates in the united states border arrestsmr  trump did not give a time frame for his 240 percent figure  nor did he specify what the number referred to  which may give the misleading impression that border crossings overall have increased threefold  the figure instead refers to a surge in families attempting to cross at the southwest border  the number of family units apprehended at the border more than tripled from 8 120 in december 2017 to 27 518 in december 2018  overwhelming immigration officials and creating a new humanitarian crisis overall  illegal border crossings have been declining for nearly two decades  and in the 2017 fiscal year  border crossing apprehensions were at their lowest point since 1971  in the 2018 fiscal year  however  annual apprehensions did increase by 30 percent from the previous fiscal year immigrant criminals in texasmr  trumps figures are accurate  but they need context  the texas department of public safety did report that the 186 000 unauthorized immigrants booked into local jails from 2011 to 2018 faced 292 000 charges the caveats  these offenses did not necessarily occur during that eight year time frame  more than half of these charges were uncategorized  and the charges mr  trump singled out did not always result in convictions  238 for homicide  13 559 for assault  1 689 for sexual assault and 1 280 for weapons  for comparison  data from the texas department of public safety shows that some 7 5 million arrests were made from 2010 to 2017  data for 2018 was not yet available   including 6 161 for murder  177 000 for aggravated assault  14 000 for rape and nearly 89 000 for weapons charges  a 2018 study from the libertarian cato institute found that in texas  conviction and arrest rates for illegal immigrants were lower than those for native born americans for most crimes .
the 90 minute drive from tucson to rancho de la osa  a recently reopened dude ranch on the border with mexico  is a lonely one  turning onto highway 286  your car may be the only southbound vehicle for 44 miles while the occasional u s  border patrol van trolls north  the road runs directly to the border fence  here made up of eerie metal posts spaced less than a foot apart  at the town of sasabe  minutes before reaching it  a right turn onto a dirt road delivers you to the historic adobe ranch  painted a warm terra cotta  with a porch lined with turquoise adirondack chairs you got the right place  and we got the right horse  said a cowboy in the driveway  when i pulled in last winter  fully living up to wrangler stereotype with a handlebar mustache and weathered 10 gallon hat once  the border fence was such a strong deterrent to visitors that it helped drive the 1920s dude ranch out of business  but  if anything  president trumps campaign for a border wall has helped revive interest in a region that already has a barrier at the border like trump or hate trump  now the border is an attraction  said russell true  who with partners  bought rancho de la osa at auction complete with its vintage western furnishings and period art in late 2016  they dont publicize the ranchs proximity to the border fence and had hoped the border would be a neutral feature of the ranch  instead  mr  true said it has piqued the interest of guests  the first thing they want to do is see the wall  he said  we could not have planned for the political shift and that it would become interesting originally opened in the 1920s  rancho de la osa drew many celebrated guests  including joan crawford  cesar romero and john wayne  for whom three of the 18 bedrooms are named  double room rates from  235 a person  all inclusive   the cowboy actor of the silent film era  tom mix  made one of his many films here  authors checked in too  including the western novelist zane grey and margaret mitchell  presidents franklin d  roosevelt and lyndon b  johnson led the political a list along with william clayton  who drafted the marshall plan to aid european countries after world war ii in a two bedroom house on the property more current events also helped drive the ranch out of business  according to mr  true  who also co owns white stallion ranch near tucson  in 2010  jan brewer then the governor of arizona  decried beheadings in the desert she said were linked to illegal immigration and drug trafficking  allegations that were never corroborated and that she later called an error on her part  we just had an absolute  possibly even slightly irrational need to save it  mr  true told me as we sat in the main lodge  where the adobe walls are washed in orange  red and yellow hues and an antique leather sofa is embossed with an image of a saddle  somebody else would have bought it  but nobody else was going to run it as a dude ranch as a dude ranch  the 590 acre rancho de

course  the degree to which the desert is deserted is up for debate  and on my first ride i spotted the well patrolled fence   mostly out of sight from the ranch dwellings  that undulates east with the hills as far as the eye can see it abruptly stops at the nearby territory of the tohono oodham people who have prevented the fence  erected in 2007  from crossing tribal land  when the knoxes drove me and four fellow guests in an off road cart to see it  we took turns walking around to the mexican side of the border and posing for photos  a few foot paths snaked into the hills on the american side staked with spiky ocotillo cactus still  it was easy to forget about politics in a place where a juvenile great horned owl  flying low at dusk  roosted in a tree just 10 feet from my

mcallen  tex   border patrol detention centers in texass rio grande valley have soared well past their capacity in recent days  prompting mass releases of migrants onto the streets as local leaders scramble to house and feed hundreds of new arrivals daily theyre as stressed as we are  jim darling  mayor of the south texas border city of mcallen  said of border patrol officials  the officials have released more than 2 200 people from government processing facilities in the rio grande valley since monday  setting aside once again the trump administrations vow to end what it calls catch and release of those who cross the border without authorization were trying to determine how many sites we have to have  the last thing we want is people walking our streets and having to sleep in doorways  mr  darling said the primary migrant services facility in the region  a former nursing home in mcallen now used by catholic charities as an immigrant respite center  is already reaching capacity  with nearly every inch of the low slung red brick building occupied  read the latest edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico

government buses pulled up outside to drop off even more  54 in one bus and 57 in the second  on wednesday  migrants slept on blue padded mats on the floors of small crowded rooms as they waited for rides to the downtown bus station in el paso  the sudden release of about 150 migrants on tuesday set in motion a flurry to try to accommodate them  a network of shelters run by the nonprofit annunciation house had no more space  so city officials converted a public park into a staging area  until space for the migrants was found at local hotels unauthorized border crossings have spiked in recent months  with more than 76 000 migrants apprehended on the southwest border in february  an 11 year high  processing facilities in el paso and in the rio grande valley region in south texas have swelled with migrant families in recent days  early tuesday  border patrol agents at the border fence in el paso apprehended a group of 194 men  women and children traveling together  about five minutes later  agents in another part of the city took in a second group of 252 migrants last week  agents in the mcallen area encountered a group of nearly 300 migrants walking toward a river levee  the largest such group seen this year  in a single 24 hour period  agents in that region had apprehended more than 1 000 migrants  most of them voluntarily turning themselves in and seeking protection under asylum laws the unusually large numbers are what caused agents in the border patrols rio grande valley sector this week to release some migrant families at an early stage  the agency said  the releases bypassed the usual procedure in which newly arrived migrants are handed over after initial processing to another federal agency  immigration and customs enforcement  which may detain them or release them with some requirement that they will show up for future court appearances instead  migrants traveling in families are being released directly by customs and border protection  the border patrols parent agency  after being given papers instructing them to show up at a later date in immigration court  local officials were told that border patrol facilities in the area were over capacity by about 2 100 migrants the border patrol said in a statement that the recent increase in apprehensions led to a limited availability of space at the agencys facilities in the rio grande valley sector  out of concern for the safety of officers and migrants  the agency said it had begun to release families after giving them a notice to appear in immigration court r g v  sector will continue to coordinate with state and local stakeholders and nongovernmental organizations while these temporary measures are in place  the agency said the recent releases resembled a similar series of unannounced mass releases of migrants late last year in el paso and san diego  this time  however  federal immigration agencies appeared to be coordinating more closely with local officials  who in december had been caught off guard the mass release in mcallen has caused a ripple effect along the texas border  officials in brownsville  60 miles east of mcallen  were told by border patrol officials to expect releases there in the coming days as well  it appeared that the border patrol intended to ease pressure on the mcallen shelter network by putting migrants on buses and dropping them off in brownsville tony martinez  the mayor of brownsville  said the city was prepared to open the downtown bus station for 24 hours to accommodate migrants  after their release  many migrants board buses to join their relatives already living elsewhere in the united states at this particular point  we are having meetings on a daily basis so that we can monitor the numbers  mr  martinez said the scramble comes as kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  was scheduled to visit mcallen on thursday  some immigrant advocates and elected officials were skeptical of the timing of the releases  suggesting they were part of a trump administration effort to justify the presidents descriptions of a border in crisis and his declaration of a national emergency  border patrol officials deny such claims representative vicente gonzalez  a texas democrat whose district includes mcallen  criticized the mass release of migrants without processing  without proper plans for housing and with no course of reasonable action and questioned the administrations motives president trump  secretary nielsen  and the entire administration have been presented with the truth  there is no crisis on the u s  mexico border  he said in the statement  their response  create one the nonprofit texas civil rights project  which has been conducting legal interviews with migrants released from border patrol custody in the rio grande valley  said it appeared that the government was deliberately releasing them hundreds at a time  some of those released recently reported that they had been detained for up to eight days  the group said  normally  customs and border protection holds newly detained migrants for about 72 hours also raising suspicion was a recent drop in the number of migrants prosecuted for illegal border crossings at the federal courthouse in mcallen  prosecutions during january and february ranged from about 400 to 700 per week  but the number of migrants brought to the courthouse dropped sharply last week  with only 176 prosecuted  and 88 had been charged during the first three days of this week  even though overall apprehensions remained high families should never be detained  but this practice must be met with skepticism  astrid dominguez of the american civil liberties unions border rights center said in a statement on tuesday  sister norma pimentel  the executive director of catholic charities of the rio grande valley  posted an urgent plea for assistance on facebook  asking for volunteers in both mcallen and brownsville  as well chicken and vegetables to make soup  and cereal and bananas for breakfast sister pimentel later stood outside the respite center in a light rain to help newly arrived migrants off a bus  the respite center received more than 800 migrants on monday  another 800 on tuesday and more than 600 by wednesday afternoon  sister pimentel said she was told by border patrol to expect up to 800 a day for an unspecified amount of time  in recent months  the most that catholic charities had assisted in one day was about 400 its not typical at all  she said amid a crowd of migrants in the front lobby  we were not expecting this  the numbers are very high  they just simply said theyre apprehending big numbers and theyre over capacity  and they need to create the space for those that are just arriving she said city officials had identified two additional sites that can be used to house migrants if the numbers warrant  if those are not enough  the group plans to charter buses to houston and possibly san antonio  she said as crowded as the respite center was  the conditions in the border patrol facilities were even more congested  some migrants who had just been released said there were so many people  said albertina  a 29 year old honduran mother who had just left the central processing center in mcallen  albertina  who asked to be identified only by her first name  stood in line at the respite center holding her infant daughter  and said she was going to take a bus to join her family in tennessee a 45 year old man from honduras who identified himself as david said he had arrived

washington  house democrats issued subpoenas late tuesday to three cabinet officials  in a sharp escalation of their battle over the administrations policy of separating migrant families at the southern border administration officials did not immediately say if the cabinet officials  the homeland security secretary  kirstjen nielsen  the attorney general  william p  barr  and the health and human services secretary  alex m  azar ii  would comply  but ms  nielsen has previously refused to appear before the house homeland security committee to answer similar inquiries  and the justice department suggested mr  barr would not turn over documents requested by the committee earlier in the day  the house oversight and reform committee easily passed a measure authorizing the subpoenas that called for the officials to turn over documents pertaining to the detention policies  as two republicans  representative justin amash of michigan and representative chip roy of texas  voted with democrats to authorize the subpoenas  moments later  the house judiciary committee held its first hearing on a child separation policy that the panels democratic chairman  representative jerrold nadler of new york  described as indefensible  inhumane and immoral in his opening statement  read the latest edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  mr  nadler and other democrats complained about the pace and quality of the data administration officials had provided them before the hearings  on monday night  administration officials sent a trove of data that committee democrats had requested months earlier  including a report documenting hundreds of allegations of sexual abuse reported by minors at detention facilities over the past several years more than 2 700 children were separated from their parents at the border under president trumps zero tolerance policy of prosecuting anyone caught crossing the border illegally  even those with families seeking asylum on humanitarian grounds the subpoenas are part of a larger effort  led by representative elijah e  cummings of maryland  the chairman of the oversight panel  and other democratic committee chairmen to compel public testimony on a range of issues from officials with the departments of homeland security  justice and health and human services while the subpoenas do not initially call for the secretaries to testify  congressional aides said they had not ruled out that possibility caitlin b  oakley  a spokeswoman for mr  azar  would not say if he intended to comply  the health and human services department understands and appreciates the important role of congressional oversight  she said in a statement kerri kupec  a spokeswoman for mr  barr  suggested the committee should receive the documents from the other two departments  the documents requested by the house oversight committee should be obtained from the originating agencies  here  h h s  and d h s  she said  referring to the departments of health and human services and homeland security  the department of justice is currently representing h h s  and d h s  in litigation and the information requested was obtained in the course of that representation aides to ms  nielsen did not immediately return requests for comment representative jim jordan of ohio  the committees top republican  asked mr  cummings in a letter this week to reconsider the wide issuance of subpoenas the trump policy of prosecuting all adults crossing the border led to the practice of separating families and caring for the children in licensed facilities while trying to place them with a relative  because a previous court settlement had restricted the detention of children  the department of homeland security struggled to track families and their children after the policy was put in place last spring  and did not create a comprehensive family reunification policy until a federal judge intervened mr  trump eventually relented on the family separations  and a federal judge in california halted them in june  but in january  the inspector general of the department of health and human services reported that thousands more families might have been separated than previously reported democrats  whose questions were largely ignored by the administration before they took control of the house in january  leveled their sharpest questions on tuesday at scott lloyd  who until recently oversaw the department of health and human services refugee resettlement program  which oversees the carrying out of the policy mr  lloyd spoke so softly that committee members craned over the rostrum to hear his answers  he struggled to explain why his agency initially failed to track migrant families separated as part of the policy when representative sheila jackson lee  democrat of texas  asked about a report that mr  lloyd had instructed department staff members to stop maintaining a database used to track separated children and families  mr  lloyd responded by saying the report was incorrect  but offered no further explanation in prepared remarks  mr  lloyd  an anti abortion activist who had no prior experience administering refugee programs before being placed in his former post  laid some of the blame on the homeland security department  saying that d h s  had not consistently adhered to processes used to identify and track migrant families sitting next to mr  lloyd at the witness table was cmdr  jonathan white of the united states public health service commissioned corps  a career federal official who repeatedly warned him last year that the family separation policy could cause permanent trauma to young children commander white said that he raised his opposition to the policy in every conversation we had about family separation and that he raised those concerns with mr  lloyds staff and other top officials at the department of health and human services last summer  when detention facilities were overwhelmed by families detained at the border research showed that the policy had very significant and lifelong psychological impacts on the children who were detained  he added in an extraordinary exchange  representative pramila jayapal  democrat of washington  asked mr  lloyd if he had heeded commander whites warnings by intensifying efforts to create a comprehensive plan for tracking and reuniting families i did not direct anybody to not plan  mr  lloyd responded when ms  jayapal asked him if he informed anyone above you that the detention policy could harm children  mr  lloyd replied  i did not in another heated exchange  commander white bristled when representative ted deutch  democrat of florida  sharply questioned him about new data  provided by the department of health and human services to the committee late monday  that documented thousands of allegations of sexual abuse at detention facilities overseen by the department the report  compiled by the justice department  showed that there were 1 226 allegations of sexual abuse made to the office of refugee resettlement at the department of health and human services in 2018  which was largely in keeping with the number of reports filed in the previous three years  348 of them were deemed serious enough to warrant a justice department investigation  fifty six involved staff members at detention centers that is false  commander white shouted  as mr  deutch read the numbers later  he apologized for his outburst and said that the vast majority of allegations proved to be unfounded and that he was not aware of any accusations against staff members that were found to have merit .
washington  the supreme court on tuesday adopted a strict interpretation of a federal immigration law  saying it required the detention of immigrants facing deportation without the possibility of bail if they had committed crimes  including minor ones  no matter how long ago they had been released from criminal custody the vote was 5 to 4  with the courts more conservative justices in the majority  justice samuel a  alito jr   writing for the majority  said the plain language of a federal law required the result justice stephen g  breyer summarized his dissent from the bench  a sign of profound disagreement  he said the majority had violated the nations basic values the greater importance of the case  he said  lies in the power that the majoritys interpretation grants the government  it is a power to detain persons who committed a minor crime many years before  and it is a power to hold those persons  perhaps for many months  without an opportunity to obtain bail justice alito said the law may be subject to constitutional challenges in individual cases  a subject that was not before the justices  it was clear  he wrote  that congress had required the secretary of homeland security to take into custody immigrants released from criminal custody even if years had passed in the meantime an officials crucial duties are better carried out late than never  justice alito wrote cecillia wang  a lawyer with the american civil liberties union  which represented the immigrants challenging the law  said the decision was part of a worrisome trend for two terms in a row now  she said  the supreme court has endorsed the most extreme interpretation of immigration detention statutes  allowing mass incarceration of people without any hearing  simply because they are defending themselves against a deportation charge the case concerned a law  enacted in 1996  which included a contested phrase  it said federal authorities shall take into custody any alien convicted of certain crimes  some serious and some minor  when the alien is released  the key word was when immigrants rights advocates said the law required prompt detention  lawyers for the federal government said immigrants convicted of crimes may be detained years after their release the difference matters  for hundreds and perhaps thousands of immigrants  because people detained under the law are not entitled to a bail hearing to determine whether they are dangerous or pose a flight risk the plaintiffs included people who entered the country illegally  tourists or students who overstayed their visas and lawful permanent residents  among them were immigrants who arrived in the united states legally as infants  committed minor crimes like possessing marijuana and were detained years after completing their sentences the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit  in san francisco  concluded that the law requires mandatory detention only if the federal authorities take immigrants into custody soon after they are released because congresss use of the word when conveys immediacy  jacqueline h  nguyen wrote for a unanimous three judge panel  we conclude that the immigration detention must occur promptly upon the aliens release from criminal custody justice alito wrote that such a strict deadline could allow local authorities opposed to federal immigration policy to frustrate the goals of the federal law state and local officials sometimes rebuff the governments request that they give notice when a criminal alien will be released  he wrote  he cited statistics indicating that there were tens of thousand of such refusals in 48 states from january 2014 to september 2016 under these circumstances  it is hard to believe that congress made the secretarys mandatory detention authority vanish at the stroke of midnight after an aliens release  he wrote chief justice john g  roberts jr  and justices clarence thomas  neil m  gorsuch and brett m  kavanaugh joined all or most of the majority opinion in a concurring opinion  justice kavanaugh wrote that the question before the court was a narrow one he said it was beyond dispute that the government can deport immigrants convicted of some crimes and that it can detain them during deportation proceedings the question the court decided  he wrote  was merely whether the executive branchs mandatory duty to detain a particular noncitizen when the noncitizen is released from criminal custody remains mandatory if the executive branch fails to immediately detain the noncitizen when the noncitizen is released from criminal custody it would be odd  he wrote  for that requirement to change  for example  if the executive branch fails to immediately detain the noncitizen because of resource constraints or because the executive branch cannot immediately locate and apprehend the individual in question in dissent  justice breyer wrote that the case was neither narrow nor technical under the governments view  he wrote  the aliens subject to detention without a bail hearing may have been released from criminal custody years earlier  and may have established families and put down roots in a community these aliens  justice breyer wrote  may then be detained for months  sometimes years  without the possibility of release  they may have been convicted of only minor crimes  for example  minor drug offenses  or crimes of moral turpitude such as illegally downloading music or possessing stolen bus transfers  and they sometimes may be innocent spouses or children of a suspect person justices ruth bader ginsburg  sonia sotomayor and elena kagan joined the dissent in the case  nielsen v  preap  no  16 1363 .
washington  the supreme court added eight cases to its docket on friday  including ones on how gun laws apply to undocumented immigrants and whether the police may have blood drawn from unconscious motorists suspected of drunken driving the court took no action on an unusually large number of pending petitions on significant issues  including president trumps efforts to shut down a program that shields some 700 000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation and to bar most transgender people from military service other petitions under consideration concern an indiana abortion law  a new york city gun control ordinance  a new jersey ruling barring government grants to repair churches and whether a federal civil rights law prohibits job discrimination against gay  lesbian and transgender workers if the court is to hear any of those cases this term  it will have to act soon  if it does not grant review by next week  the courts past practices indicate that any cases it does eventually agree to hear will not be argued until its next term starts in october the case concerning immigrants and guns involves hamid m  rehaif  who came to the united states from the united arab emirates to study at the florida institute of technology on a student visa  he was dismissed for academic reasons after three semesters but stayed in the united states about a year after he left school  mr  rehaif went to a shooting range  rented a gun and bought ammunition  six days later  a worker at a hotel where was staying told the authorities that he had been acting suspiciously  when he was questioned by an f b i  agent  mr  rehaif admitted to visiting the firing range  he allowed a search of his room  which turned up the remaining ammunition mr  rehaif was charged with violating a federal law that makes it a crime for people illegally or unlawfully in the united states to possess any firearm or ammunition  another provision of the law says that violations of it must be made knowingly  mr  rehaif was convicted and sentenced to a 18 months in prison the question in the case  rehaif v  united states  no  17 9560  was whether prosecutors had to prove not only that mr  rehaif knew he possessed a gun or ammunition  but also that he knew he was in the united states unlawfully the united states court of appeals for the 11th circuit affirmed his conviction  ruling that a trial judge had properly instructed the jury that the government is not required to prove that the defendant knew that he was illegally or unlawfully in the united states in urging the supreme court to hear the case  mr  rehaif relied on a 2012 concurrence from justice neil m  gorsuch  who at the time was a federal appeals court judge in denver  judge gorsuch wrote that logic and the rules of grammar required proof that every element of the crime in question had been committed knowingly  it makes no sense  he wrote  to read the word knowingly as so modest that it might blush in the face of the very first element only to regain its composure and reappear at the second the case on drawing blood from motorists  mitchell v  wisconsin  no  18 6210  concerns gerald p  mitchell  a wisconsin man arrested on suspicion of drunken driving  a police officer took him to a hospital  where he was slumped over and unresponsive  the officer instructed medical personnel to draw blood from mr  mitchell  and they found that his blood alcohol concentration was 0 22  which is above the legal limit for driving it was mr  mitchells seventh offense for driving under the influence  he was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison  and he challenged his conviction on fourth amendment grounds a splintered wisconsin supreme court rejected that argument  relying on a state law that presumes drivers have consented to blood tests and punishes them if they decline to cooperate by revoking their drivers licenses  the law says unconscious motorists are presumed not to have withdrawn consent to having their blood drawn twenty eight states have similar laws  according to mr  mitchells petition seeking supreme court review  but some of them have been struck down after two recent supreme court decisions in 2013  the court ruled that a warrant is ordinarily needed before drawing blood in drunken driving investigations  in 2016  the court added that motorists cannot be deemed to have consented to submit to a blood test on pain of committing a criminal offense  in mr  mitchells case  the penalty of losing a drivers license is a civil one in urging the supreme court to deny review  lawyers for the state said mr  mitchell should not benefit because he got so drunk that  after driving while under the influence  he passed out and became unconscious mr  mitchell should not  the states brief said  receive the windfall of avoiding the lawful civil choice  which other drunk drivers must face  of having their blood drawn or losing their license .

washington  as he makes his case for building a border wall  president trump says that his predecessors have secretly confided in him that they should have done it themselves  the only problem  all of the living presidents say thats not true former president jimmy carter said on monday that he never had such a conversation with mr  trump  making him the last of the veterans of the oval office to dispute the assertion  i have not discussed the border wall with president trump and do not support him on the issue  mr  carter said in a statement aides to the other living presidents  bill clinton  george w  bush and barack obama  have all likewise denied mr  trumps claim  former president george bush  who died in november  was in failing health throughout mr  trumps administration and did not have any discussion with the current president about substantive issues  according to people close to him this would not be the first time mr  trump has bragged about conversations that never happened  in 2017  he publicly claimed that the head of the boy scouts called him to praise a speech as the best ever given to the organization  he also asserted that the president of mexico had called him to say that mr  trumps enforcement efforts at the border were deterring central americans from crossing into mexico because they knew they could no longer get into the united states after both the boy scouts leader and president enrique pea nieto of mexico denied making such calls  the white house acknowledged that they never happened  but the presidents press secretary  sarah huckabee sanders  insisted that boy scouts leaders and mr  pea nieto had said things like that in person  just not on the telephone the white house did not respond to requests on friday or monday to explain the presidents latest statement  a senior administration official  who insisted on anonymity to address the matter  said mr  trump might have been referring to public comments made by previous presidents on behalf of border security  though not the wall specifically or directly to mr  trump in an interview with today on nbc aired tuesday morning  vice president mike pence defended the presidents comments while suggesting that they were not based on actual conversations with his predecessors i know the president has said that that was his impression from previous administrations  previous presidents  mr  pence said  i know ive seen clips of previous presidents talking about the importance of border security  the importance of addressing the issue of illegal immigration the issue came up on friday when mr  trump held an expansive news conference in the rose garden about his standoff with congress over funding for a wall  this should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me  he said  and they all know it  some of them have told me that we should have done it while in office  the younger mr  bush signed legislation authorizing 700 miles of fencing  but he has said that stronger border enforcement should be paired with an overhaul of rules making it possible for some of the millions of immigrants in the country illegally to stay  a spokesman said mr  bush had not discussed the issue with mr  trump  mr  clinton  mr  obama and mr  carter are on record opposing mr  trumps wall mr  trump has not interacted with any of his predecessors in any meaningful way since his inauguration  none of the five former presidents alive when mr  trump was elected in 2016 voted for him  even the republicans  the elder mr  bush voted for hillary clinton  and the younger mr  bush told the author mark k  updegrove that he voted for none of the above mr  trump has not met with any of his predecessors in two years in office  he called the younger mr  bush to offer condolences when his father died  and the first time he saw any of the former presidents since taking office was at the funeral a few days later  he shook mr  obamas hand and mr  bush came over to shake his  but none of the former presidents had any extended words with the incumbent .

alpharetta  ga   for the last four years  21 savage has been one of the stalwarts of atlanta rap  a rising star who has collaborated with drake and cardi b  among many others  and become one of the signature voices in the city  his december album i am   i was spent two weeks at the top of the billboard chart  and his collaboration with post malone  rockstar  was nominated for two grammys with that success has come more visibility  in late january  he performed his single a lot on the tonight show starring jimmy fallon  adding a new verse in which he rapped about children being separated from their parents at the border a few days later  early in the morning on super bowl sunday  feb  3  21 savage  born sheyaa bin abraham joseph  was arrested by immigration and customs enforcement  who said he was an unlawfully present united kingdom national who had overstayed his visa he remained in ice custody at the irwin county detention center in south georgia until feb  13  when he was released on  100 000 bond  the next day  he was in a hotel room in a suburb north of atlanta  surrounded by several members of his legal team  dressed in somber all black  he spoke at length about his childhood  his time in detention  the grammy awards ceremony he missed and how growing up without legal status shaped the person he became  these are edited excerpts from the conversation do you remember first arriving here when you were young yeah  everything was like  bigger  i come from the poor side of london  my grandma house is real skinny  so when we first moved here  we was living in the hood still  but it was  like  way bigger  the toilet size  the bathroom size  it was just different  but i fell in love with it  its all i know did you have a british accent yeah  i had a accent  cause my first day of school they was making fun of me so i beat somebody up  and they was calling me taekwondo kid  my mama whupped me  she made me stay in the house  so i know i had a accent  but i been here 20 years  i dont know what happened to it do you remember when you became aware that your status wasnt settled probably like the age when you start to get your drivers license  i couldnt never take drivers ed  i couldnt never go get a job  about that age was it something you wanted to get taken care of it felt impossible  it got to the point where i just learned to live without it  cause i still aint got it  im 26  and im rich  so  just learned to live without it like a lot of other immigrants we struggled but we couldnt get food stamps  we couldnt get government assistance  i learned how to live without  you know in school  when you get to a certain age  your clothes make you popular  i learned how to be popular without that  people respected me just for me do you think

citizen  i wouldnt have never did it  i still want to go through this right here cause it made me who i am  it made me strong were you aware that there was a possibility that at some point you might not be able to stay in the country yeah  for sure  its like my worst nightmare  thats why its always been trying to get corrected  even if you got money  it aint easy  it aint no favoritism  and i respect it  i honestly respect it  it would be kind of messed up if they treated rich immigrants better than poor immigrants  i think how draining was it being in detention  especially with the uncertainty of how long it was going to last it really wasnt jail  it was the possibility of me not being able to live in this country no more that ive been living in my whole life  all that just going through your head  like  damn  i love my house  i aint gonna be able to go in my house no more  i aint gonna be able to go to my favorite restaurant that i been going to for 20 years straight

life im sure you were spending a lot of time in your head i could have made myself go crazy  i think they really try to break you  its like we gonna put you in jail and we gonna make you fight your case the slowest you can fight it so that you just want to go home  nobody want to sit in jail  especially if they dont have the money to fight it and they aint been to court in three months what do

their mind in some type of way  thats all that mattered  they didnt have to say it cause everybody knew it  it was in the air  all the people that was there  they said the words in other places and

oxon hill  md   president trump said on saturday that he planned to issue an executive order that would help guarantee free speech at colleges and universities by putting their federal aid at risk if they do not protect the viewpoints of students of all political stripes the president made the announcement during a rambling two hour speech to activists at the conservative political action conference outside washington  but he did not provide any details about the possible executive order  several white house officials did not respond to emails or telephone calls seeking additional information the white house did not respond to questions about when the president might sign the order the issue of free speech on college campuses has for years been a cause clbre among young conservative activists  who point to instances around the country in which conservative voices have been shunned by liberal students and professors the crowd  which included many college age conservatives  welcomed mr  trumps announcement  leaping to their feet when he pledged to hold school administrators accountable for ensuring that conservatives were permitted to express their views on campuses  often places where liberals outnumber them the president cited the case of hayden williams  a young activist who was beaten up last month as he was recruiting for a conservative organization at the university of california  berkeley  long one of the leading centers of liberal academic thought if they want our dollars  and we give it to them by the billions  theyve got to allow people like hayden and many great young people  and old people  to speak  mr  trump said  drawing huge applause mr  trump invited mr  williams  who was in the audience  to address the crowd briefly  calling him strong and urging him to sue the university because of the episode  mr  williams thanked the president for supporting young conservatives such as himself floyd abrams  a leading first amendment lawyer  expressed concern about the presidents proposed executive order the visage of the most congenitally anti free speech administration in american history making a series of decisions as to which campus conduct is pro  or anti free speech is more than alarming  mr  abrams said in an email saturday afternoon the president has raised a similar threat before  implying he would withhold federal funds from berkeley after it canceled a speech by milo yiannopoulos  a conservative speaker and professional provocateur students at multiple campuses threatened to boycott events where mr  yiannopoulos was to speak  forcing them to cancel the appearances in 2017  at claremont mckenna college  a private liberal arts school in southern california  about 250 people blocked entrances to an auditorium where heather mac donald  a conservative writer who has criticized the black lives matter movement  was speaking that same year  students at middlebury college in vermont disrupted a speech by charles murray  a scholar known for his 1994 book  the bell curve  which links socioeconomic status with race and intelligence  protesters chanted  racist  sexist  anti gay  charles murray  go away it is unclear how mr  trumps executive order would change that dynamic  though he hinted that universities and colleges would have to do more to prevent such demonstrations or risk the loss of grant money that the institutions receive from the federal government to support research he said the executive order would require colleges to support free speech if they want federal research funding it is not clear how long the idea has been under consideration at the white house or whether the president decided to pursue an executive order because of the episode involving mr  williams  which fox news and other conservative outlets covered extensively it is also unclear how much the president can withhold federal aid to colleges without congressional action  previous discussions of that issue in conservative circles have focused on passing legislation to change the requirements for colleges to request grant funding from the federal government mr  trump made the announcement during one of the longest speeches he has ever delivered  speaking for more than two hours to the thousands of activists at the conclusion of the three day annual convention the campaign like speech touched on dozens of hot button issues  including illegal immigration  the president accused open border democrats of letting murderers  rapists and drug dealers into the country they give us some very bad people  people with big  long crime records  he said of central american countries including honduras  guatemala and el salvador  murderers  killers  drug dealers  human traffickers  its so sad to see how stupid we have been more than two years after he took office  mr  trump once again insisted that his inaugural crowd was larger than his critics have admitted  he bragged about the state of the economy and denounced democrats who he said supported socialism he denigrated the trade deals made by previous politicians and boasted about the tariffs that the united states had imposed on china and other countries  and he repeatedly mocked the new green deal offered by some democrats  saying it would destroy the economy and take away peoples cars and airplanes somebody described it as a high school term paper  written by a poor student  he joked .
american border officers sent tear gas into mexico early tuesday to drive away about 150 migrants trying to cross the border into the united states  the authorities said in a statement  the customs and border protection agency said that the migrants tried to climb over and crawl under the border fence near san diego and tijuana  mexico  the same area where american officers fired tear gas across the border late last year and where mexico is struggling to handle thousands of migrants who have fled violence and poverty in central america early tuesday  as migrants gathered at the border fence there  several teenagers with heavy jackets  blankets and rubber mats tried to cross or cover concertina wire at the barrier  others began throwing rocks over the fence at the american officers  according to the statement the american officers also saw members of the group try to lift toddler sized children up and over the concertina wire  dangerously so  it said at this point  the agency said  its officers used smoke  pepper spray and tear gas upwind of the rock throwers and south of the border fence and not toward migrants already in the united states or trying to cross at the fence line the officers used tear gas only after there were rocks and there were kids involved  said a spokesman for the agency  andrew meehan  then it became an issue of safety for the officers and frankly safety of the migrants at least three volleys of tear gas were sent across the border  according to the associated press  which said the gas affected women and children in its account  customs and border protection said that no agents witnessed any of the migrants at the fence line  including children  experiencing effects of the chemical agents  which were targeted at the rock throwers after the tear gas was deployed  most of the migrants fled back under the fence and away from the border  mr  meehan said twenty five migrants were detained  including two teenagers  the agency said the trump administrations department of homeland security  which oversees customs and border protection  has come under intense scrutiny for how it has treated migrants at the border and in the united states rights experts have questioned whether the firing of tear gas across the border is justifiable or legal  the number of detained migrant children has soared to the highest ever recorded  and at least two children have died in united states custody mr  meehan could not immediately provide data about how often border officers use tear gas or pepper spray  citing the government shutdowns effect on resources  and said the agency would review the incident as it does all uses of force the use of those types of nonlethals is fairly common in law enforcement organizations  he said  but the number of uses of force for c b p  has been historically down year over year  in large part because of the way we review and improve our policies .
 sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race  beto orourke  the former texas congressman who just joined the democratic presidential race  gained an instant following last year when he came within three points of unseating senator ted cruz but while he was able to stand out in his senate campaign with a broadly liberal message and no signature policy issue  that broad message is not likely to be enough in a ballooning democratic field this time  the specifics are going to be crucial  heres a look at where mr  orourke stands on some major issues as president trumps proposed border wall has become one of the biggest issues in american politics  mr  orourke has made immigration the centerpiece of his speeches in addition to supporting the dream act and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants  he has called for the closing of private immigrant detention centers  denounced the militarization of immigration enforcement and spoken out against the wall  beto orourke announces candidacy  joins field filled with committed progressives we are not safe because of walls but in spite of walls  he said at a rally in el paso last month  held at the same time mr  trump was holding his own rally nearby  far from extending a barrier across the entire border  he has said  he would like to remove the existing fencing in el paso  one of the countrys largest border cities  and mr  orourkes hometown in his state of the union address  mr  trump held up el paso as an example of the need for a wall  claiming that the city had been one of the most dangerous in the united states until a border fence was built there but the crime rate in el paso actually fell long before the fence was built and rose afterward  and mr  orourke is holding up the city as an example of the lack of need for a wall mr  orourke arguably first made his name when  after the shooting at the pulse nightclub in orlando in 2016  he live streamed the sit in he and other democratic representatives were holding on the house floor in support of stricter gun laws the republican controlled congress did not pass any gun control legislation then  but mr  orourke continues to support similar policies  including universal background checks  magazine size limits and restrictions on some semiautomatic weapons he also opposes concealed carry reciprocity  which would make concealed carry permits granted in any state valid nationwide  forcing states with strict licensing requirements to recognize permits from states with looser standards  it is one of the national rifle associations legislative priorities while mr  orourke supports universal health care  increasingly a litmus test position for democratic candidates  he hasnt committed to a specific way to get there  during his senate campaign  he suggested that universal health care could take the form of a single payer system or a dual system  in which a government run program would coexist with private insurance he has given conflicting messages on the most prominent proposal  medicare for all in 2017  during his time in the house  he said unequivocally  a single payer medicare for all program is the best way to ensure all americans get the health care they need  but during his senate campaign  he carefully avoided those words  calling instead for universal  guaranteed  high quality health care for all he does support expanding medicaid under the affordable care act and has urged texas to do so  other points in his 2018 platform included allowing the government to negotiate prescription drug prices with manufacturers and creating incentives for insurers to participate in the affordable care acts exchanges when it comes to proposals for mitigating climate change  opponents frequently cite the potential costs of those plans  but mr  orourke has emphasized the financial impact of climate change itself  billions of dollars that are spent on steps like sea walls  which would be critical if climate change continues unchecked  is money not spent on other priorities  he noted at a town hall event with columbia university students last month at that event  mr  orourke spoke positively about the green new deal  calling it technically and logistically doable  as for its political prospects  i dont know  he said  thats up to all of us  right he supports the paris climate accords  and has also made a point of emphasizing effects that climate change is having  more storms like hurricane harvey  for instance  which devastated texas mr  orourke emphasized criminal justice in his 2018 campaign  focusing in particular on racial and economic inequities  in an op ed in the houston chronicle  he described his own criminal record  he was arrested once for attempted forcible entry and once for drunken driving when he was in his 20s  both charges were dismissed  and argued that his success since then had been possible because of his race and economic status the chance that i had  and which i have made the most of  is denied to too many of our fellow texans  particularly those who dont look like me or have access to the same opportunities that i did  he wrote he called for closing private and for profit prisons  decriminalizing marijuana and expunging the records of people previously convicted of possessing it  eliminating mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent crimes  and reforming the bail system so people charged with misdemeanors would not be incarcerated because of their inability to pay he also emphasized rehabilitation for offenders released from prison  including the restoration of voting rights  currently  those rights vary drastically by state like many of the democratic candidates  mr  orourke has criticized mr  trumps trade policies  including the imposition of tariffs  which have hurt some farmers and blue collar workers  in his senate campaign  he emphasized the needs of farmers  calling for a stronger crop insurance program and federal investments in rural infrastructure  including high speed internet  roads and schools he has also drawn connections between agricultural policy and immigration policy  noting that immigrants  many of them undocumented  make up a large share of farm laborers  on that basis  he has cast immigration reform as an economic issue as well as a social one we should treat these individuals with dignity and respect  he wrote on his website last year  because they are a critical component of our agriculture communities .

the number of migrant families crossing the southwest border has once again broken records  with unauthorized entries nearly double what they were a year ago  suggesting that the trump administrations aggressive policies have not discouraged new migration to the united states more than 76 000 migrants crossed the border without authorization in february  an 11 year high and a strong sign that stepped up prosecutions  new controls on asylum and harsher detention policies have not reversed what remains a powerful lure for thousands of families fleeing violence and poverty the system is well beyond capacity  and remains at the breaking point  kevin k  mcaleenan  commissioner of customs and border protection  told reporters in announcing the new data on tuesday the nations top border enforcement officer painted a picture of processing centers filled to capacity  border agents struggling to meet medical needs and thousands of exhausted members of migrant families crammed into a detention system that was not built to house them  all while newcomers continue to arrive  sometimes by the busload  at the rate of 2 200 a day this is clearly both a border security and a humanitarian crisis  mr  mcaleenan said  read the latest edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  president trump has used the escalating numbers to justify his plan to build an expanded wall along the 1 900 mile border with mexico  but a wall would do little to slow migration  most immigration analysts say  while the exact numbers are not known  many of those apprehended along the southern border  including the thousands who present themselves at legal ports of entry  surrender voluntarily to border patrol agents and eventually submit legal asylum claims the main problem is not one of uncontrolled masses scaling the fences  but a humanitarian challenge created as thousands of migrant families surge into remote areas where the administration has so far failed to devote sufficient resources to care for them  as is required under the law the latest numbers stung an administration that has over the past two years introduced a rash of aggressive policies intended to deter migrants from journeying to the united states  including separating families  limiting entries at official ports and requiring some asylum seekers to wait in mexico through the duration of their immigration cases more than 50 000 adults are currently in immigration and customs enforcement custody  the highest number ever despite targeted successes in certain areas  about 2 000 migrants who traveled in a caravan from central america last year appeared to have given up their cause as of last month after being discouraged by long delays in tijuana  migrants seem only to have adjusted their routes rather than turn back  indeed  they are traveling in even larger numbers than before  read more about why more migrants are crossing the border  arrests along the southern border have increased 97 percent since last year  the border patrol said  with a 434 percent increase in the el paso sector  which covers the state of new mexico and the two westernmost counties of texas  families  mainly from central america  continue to arrive in ever larger groups in remote parts of the southwest at least 70 such groups of 100 or more people have turned themselves in at border patrol stations that typically are staffed by only a handful of agents  often hours away from civilization  by comparison  only 13 such groups arrived in the last fiscal year  and two in the year before understanding what is happening on the border is difficult because  while the numbers are currently higher than they have been in several years  they are nowhere near the historic levels of migration seen across the southwest border  arrests for illegally crossing the border reached up to 1 64 million in 2000  under president clinton  in the 2018 fiscal year  they reached 396 579  for the first five months of the current fiscal year  268 044 have been apprehended the difference is that the nature of immigration has changed  and the demographics of those arriving now are proving more taxing for border officials to accommodate  most of those entering the country in earlier years were single men  most of them from mexico  coming to look for work  if they were arrested  they could quickly be deported now  the majority of border crossers are not single men but families  fathers from honduras with adolescent boys they are pulling away from gang violence  mothers with toddlers from guatemala whose farms have been lost to drought  while they may not have a good case to remain in the united states permanently  it is not so easy to speedily deport them if they arrive with children and claim protection under the asylum laws families with children can be held in detention for no longer than 20 days  under a much debated court ruling  and since there are a limited number of detention centers certified to hold families  the practical effect is that most families are released into the country to await their hearings in immigration court  the courts are so backlogged that it could take months or years for cases to be decided  some people never show up for court at all finally  detaining families even for the first few days after their arrival in the united states  while they are undergoing initial processing  is also a challenging job often arriving exhausted  dehydrated  and some of them requiring urgent medical care  the families need food  diapers  infant formula and space to play  they can often spend days inside cramped concrete cells that were built to house the previous generation of border crossers  young  single men who would likely be there only a few hours as part of the announcements on tuesday  mr  mcaleenan also said the agency is making sweeping changes to procedures for guaranteeing adequate medical care for migrants  an overhaul brought on by the deaths of two migrant children in the agencys custody in december  the measures  which include comprehensive health screenings for all migrant children and a new processing center in el paso that would help provide better shelter and medical care for migrant families  are an attempt to fix years of health care inadequacies that have left many at risk the agency will also expand medical contracts to place health care practitioners  largely registered nurses and nurse practitioners  in high risk and high traffic locations along the border  it will also dedicate more money for translation services to meet increasing demand from central americans  many of whom speak indigenous languages and dialects and may not be able to communicate their needs in english or spanish  read  border patrol facilities put detainees with medical conditions at risk these solutions are temporary and this situation is not sustainable  mr  mcaleenan said mr  mcaleenan said the authorities believe that the large numbers of families are coming because smugglers have effectively communicated across central america that adults who travel with children will be allowed to enter and stay in the united states brian hastings  the agencys chief of law enforcement operations  said that since april 2018  border agents had detected nearly 2 400 false families  including cases in which migrants had falsely claimed to be related when they were not  or untruthfully claimed to be younger than 18 the throngs of new families are also affecting communities on the american side of the border  in el paso  a volunteer network that temporarily houses the migrants after they are released from custody has had to expand to 20 facilities  compared with only three during the same period last year  migrants are now being housed in churches  a converted nursing home and about 125 hotel rooms that are being paid for with donations we had never seen these kinds of numbers  said ruben garcia  the director of the organization  called annunciation house  he said that during one week in february  immigration authorities had released more than 3 600 migrants to his organization  the highest number in any single week since the groups founding in 1978 for the most part  mr  garcia said that his staff and volunteer workers had been able to keep up with the surge  often making frantic calls to churches to request access to more space for housing families on short notice  but sometimes their best efforts were upended  he said  including on one day last week  when the authorities dropped off 150 more migrants than planned we just didnt have the space  mr  garcia said .
good morning  heres the sign up  if you dont already get california today by email  how californians get power has been in the news a lot lately  between pacific gas   electrics  woes and mayor eric garcettis recent announcement that the los angeles department of water and power would phase out three natural gas power plants on its way toward 100 percent renewable energy sources we have an obligation to end dependence on fossil fuels  embrace the technologies of tomorrow  and prioritize renewable energy  mr  garcetti said in a statement to the times this week the question now is how to do that today  the residential solar power provider sunrun released a report with what its leaders said could be the answer  a mass deployment of residential solar panels  along with batteries  that collectively form a kind of virtual power plant operated by a utility if one of the challenges is that we want to decommission three of these gas plants  we believe that with rooftop solar and storage  we could pretty easily replace one of them by 2030  said lynn jurich  sunruns chief executive and co founder according to the report  although l a  already has 36 000 homes with rooftop solar units  as a percentage  its fractional  2 5 percent of residential customers  compared with san diegos 11 percent  or 139 000 homeowners expanding l a s total to 75 000 homes and apartment buildings  with batteries  could provide enough power to replace one of the retiring plants and cost  60 million less  the report says the batteries  ms  jurich said  would give customers a backup power source when its less sunny  addressing a primary concern about solar  read about sunruns challenge to tesla  the report suggests a virtual power plant could also counter another concern about residential solar power  that upfront costs make it too expensive for many would be customers you can contract with the utility  so you can use that credit  she said sunrun  however  has an interest in promoting solar power  so how realistic is its suggestion i put that question to bill powers  an engineer in san diego who serves as an expert witness on behalf of consumers before utility regulators across the country what sunrun is proposing is absolutely doable  it is the future and it will happen  he told me  from a technological and cost standpoint  it would be straightforward to make the transition the problem  he said  is that it is so diametrically counter to the way investor owned utilities and even large publicly owned utilities have made money and done business historically but  mr  powers said  as pushback against the investor owned pacific gas   electric has built up  large scale solar power in l a  could be a model for cities like san francisco  which is exploring creating city owned utilities whats happening in the state is a general grass roots fatigue with investor owned utilities  he said aura vasquez  a commissioner for the los angeles department of water and power  said she thought that  ultimately  rooftop solar will be a big  cost effective source of the citys power in the future  but getting there will be the tough part staff are excited and they want to do it  she

los angeles  in an attempt to determine who was behind the caravans that were bringing large numbers of migrants from central america to the southwest border  the trump administration created a list of activists and journalists whom they subjected to additional scrutiny when they entered the united states last year federal immigration authorities faced criticism on thursday after an internal government document  obtained by nbc 7 san diego  suggested that immigration activists and journalists were specifically singled out for extra screening at border entry points by the united states and mexican governments many of those on the list had traveled with the migrant caravans as they arrived in mexican border cities from central america to seek asylum  others on the list  according to lawyers representing them  had provided legal assistance or aid to migrants  but had not traveled with the caravans at all customs and border protection officials said they had identified people because they may have had information in connection to assaults against border patrol agents that took place last november and in january  but said that gathering this type of information was standard c b p  does not target journalists for inspection based on their occupation or their reporting  andrew meehan  the agencys assistant commissioner of public affairs  said in a statement  adding that c b p  has policies in place that prohibit discrimination against arriving travelers and has specific provisions regarding encounters with journalists nonetheless  the inspector general for the homeland security department opened an inquiry last month  with c b p   to ensure that all appropriate policies and practices were followed in washington  lawmakers on the house homeland security committee sent a letter on thursday to customs and border protection criticizing the list and said it raised serious legal and constitutional questions esha bhandari  a lawyer with the american civil liberties union  said that targeting reporters or advocates for secondary screening and extended detention on the basis of their work was a violation of their rights  ms  bhandari said the a c l u  was monitoring developments in the cases and exploring all legal options the implications of this are really disturbing  she said  it is unconstitutional for the government to target people for punishment or retaliation solely based on their first amendment protected activity  read the latest edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet

months that his name had been flagged to immigration officials in an interview thursday  he recalled being stopped by mexican authorities in late december while he was near the border fence in tijuana to take photographs of migrants  the officers asked to see mr  nakamuras passport  something he had not experienced during other lengthy assignments on the border  he said  he thought it was strange when the officers took photos of his passport on cellphones mr  nakamura  an american citizen  tried to re enter the united states several days later  and initially faced routine questions  he was asked about his background  where he lived  where he went to school  he was also asked about when he began working as a photojournalist but the questioning began to alarm mr  nakamura when an officer pulled out a document with pictures of about 10 to 14 faces and asked him to identify them they asked me if i recognized any of the faces  mr  nakamura said  i didnt  so i said no  the officer who showed me the papers  she was asking me if i was connected with the organizers of the caravan  she was like  have you met the organizers or do i know the organizers i felt like they thought i was a spy or something  mr  nakamura said kitra cahana  a freelance photographer on the list whose work has also appeared in the times  said she was barred from entering mexico on jan  17 while she was en route to photograph another caravan of migrants traveling through the country  as she was about to board a flight from montreal to detroit  she scanned her passport at a pre clearance machine  which printed out a picture with an x over my face  she was taken into secondary questioning in montreal  but was ultimately allowed to board her flight in mexico city  she was again detained  that time she was held for about 13 hours  she said  before being officially denied entry to mexico mexican authorities confiscated her american passport and cellphone during that period  she was escorted to a flight back to detroit  later that month  on jan  26  she said she tried to cross into mexico from guatemala  and was denied entry ms  bhandari said there were specific rules outlined by the justice department that the government must follow when questioning journalists  which  she said  customs and border protection may have violated the existence of these dossiers can have a real chilling effect  ms  bhandari said  it can suggest to other journalists that if they dare to report on activities that are embarrassing to the united states government  you too can be singled out for this harsh treatment .
welcome to crossing the border  a limited run weekly newsletter from the new york times  like what you see  send this to a friend  if someone forwarded it to you  sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox for weeks  president trump has been criticized for exaggerating the brutality experienced by migrant women on the border as he makes his case for a wall a rose garden address in january was only one of the times when mr  trump has made the claim if the president was suggesting that such savagery occurs daily on americas southern border  then he was indeed exaggerating

a 45 year old honduran woman told us in an interview  she said she was raped after her smugglers forced her into prostitution shortly after she illegally crossed the border in texas  the woman  who now lives in austin and who asked to be identified by her first name  lucy  was held captive in a makeshift brothel in the south texas city of mcallen human smuggling has grown more and more violent  as border security tightens and as the smuggling of people and drugs becomes costlier and riskier  in this particular kind of border crossing  the smugglers are paid thousands of dollars by the migrants  but the relationship resembles not seller and buyer but prisoner and warden the smugglers are called coyotes  and the migrants are called pollos  or chickens  and these terms very much reflect the dehumanized nature of a migrants journey through the borderlands  clients are sometimes forced to take off their shoes or strip to their underwear to prevent them from fleeing  the coyotes control when and what the migrants eat  and where they sleep  they decide when their debt can be considered paid in one trailer home in carrizo springs  tex   smugglers raped a salvadoran woman and tortured two men  covering the mens hands with plastic bags  putting their hands on a stool and pounding their fingers with a hammer  all because their relatives failed to pay the fees and the

the woman  40  who asked to be identified by her initials  m g mr  manzanares tried to kill m g  and her daughter  and then handcuffed the 14 year old girl to a tree  her mouth still taped  he finished his shift  returned to the tree for the girl  drove her to his apartment and tied her to a bunk bed  where he repeatedly sexually assaulted her  her ordeal ended only many hours later  when

city  this one comes pretty close it starts with a question about crime  how many murders occurred last year in the south texas border city of mcallen  the center of the busiest border patrol sector and the release point for thousands of asylum seekers from central america zero thats right  mcallen had zero homicides in 2018  down from seven in 2017  three in 2016 and two in 2015 how did it happen there is cartel fueled drug violence directly across the border in parts of mexico  but it largely fails to spillover into mcallen  undocumented immigrants and drugs are smuggled through mcallen  but the city is largely a crossing point for that flow of people and drugs  not a destination point  last years zero homicides were part of an overall low crime pattern in the city  which has a population of 142 000  in 1991  about 2 150 cars were stolen in mcallen  last year  there were 55 right now we have the lowest crime rate in mcallen in a 34 year period  said the citys chief of

mark doss  a supervising lawyer at the international refugee assistance project  pulled an all nighter on jan  27  2017  and his work life has not been the same since  on that day two years ago  his client hameed darweesh  an iraqi who had worked primarily as an interpreter on behalf of the united states government for 10 years  was the first person detained at kennedy airport under president trumps executive order barring immigrants from seven predominantly muslim countries  including iraq images of immigration lawyers huddled together over laptops on airport floors across the country made global news  nineteen hours and a habeas corpus petition titled darweesh v  trump later  mr  darweesh was the first detainee to be released  mr  doss was able to comfort his weeping client at baggage claim  when youre an immigrant to the united states  you come to rely on a selection of people you never expected to need as guides  the co worker who explains that aluminum is both spelled and pronounced incorrectly here  the waitress who advises against ordering that second cold brew and  crucially  the immigration lawyer who can push open the door to a new life  a whole country  i moved here five years ago in a relatively straightforward way  but one that still involved much paperwork  expense and anxiety  amanda gupta  who specializes in visas for artists and entertainers  was my lawyer  its because of her i get to live my own peculiar american dream  which is to have a comedy career and drink as much cold brew as i can before my heart explodes that first travel ban  and each subsequent one  made my stomach lurch  as i imagined not being allowed back into the place i belong  and since that chaotic weekend two years ago  i have wondered what life has been like for immigration lawyers  people whose livelihoods depend on getting others through a door that was only ever ajar and is now in danger of slamming shut as the administration hacks away at immigrants rights and rains down policy changes  immigration requests that would usually have been approved are denied  many lawyers told me  they are receiving requests for further evidence that are baffling  with precedents continuously blurring  any way the government can have a moment of gotcha they do and they will  ms  gupta said  if they can get you out of the country  they will  john khosravi  an immigration lawyer in los angeles  agrees  these past two years its like someone is running around sticking their finger in peoples eyes and im an eye doctor  he said  sure  business is good  but those arent the injuries i want to treat  on his podcast the immigration lawyers podcast  he urges his colleagues to have a plan b and to save their money for a rainy day  mr  khosravi is iranian american  and when he started practicing nearly a decade ago  all of his clients were iranian  since then  he has diversified and now has clients from around the world  had i just been starting out when the ban came down  that would have been lights out  just no way  he said for lauren blodgett  a staff lawyer at safe passage project  the past two years have seen her definition of success change  she has represented children seeking asylum who were separated from a parent at the border  per the policy put in place by this administration last year  she said that even if her clients are denied a chance to stay in the united states  its crucial to her to help them feel heard and even loved throughout the process  they will remember their case for the rest of their lives  she said  adding that its a privilege to get to do this kind of difficult work  she has sometimes had to tell 8  or 9 year olds that she honestly has no idea whether they will see their parents again what  i asked  could one possibly do to unwind after a workday that involved those conversations  twice a month  ms  blodgett goes to a dance party that takes place from 6 to 9 a m  we dance and then  some days  i go to straight to court  she said  i bring my suit and change in the bathroom at the end of our conversation  i asked her whether she ever feels hopeless  and she looked at me surprised  the same way i looked at her when she told me she voluntarily goes to early morning raves  this work is an opportunity to turn your rage and anger and disgust into action  she said mr  doss married last year and spent the days before his wedding finalizing a waiver application for a woman stranded in yemen because of the travel ban to be reunited with her children in the united states  his wifes brother  a graphic designer in jordan  was denied a visitors visa  so he could not be with them on their wedding day  its heartbreaking  he told me  particularly for his new in laws  but his perspective quickly broadened  for my clients from syria or yemen or libya who are trying to reunite with their loved ones in the united states  theyre indefinitely banned  he worries that these separated families have been forgotten about  lost in the mix of everything else that has happened in the past two years the number of globally displaced people has hit a record high  and last year the trump administration set the lowest cap on the number of refugees who can be resettled in the united states since congress passed the refugee act in 1980  i asked mr  doss what his clients  refugees who have made it through  feel about arriving in a country run by people who do not seem to want them here  they are often fleeing from governments that have persecuted them  but they have a deep love for the country  he explained  so theyre able to separate the government from the people  most americans  when theyre face to face  are kind and caring  the phone line went quiet for a second and i worried we had been disconnected  until he cleared his throat and added  i think .

the campaign for the votes of 900 million indians in the continuing national elections  being conducted in seven phases from april 11 to may 23  has taken a rancorous and religiously polarized tenor  which is unprecedented even for india narendra modi  the prime minister of india  is leading the campaign for his governing hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party  he remains the focus of much of the campaign for his party as well as for the opposition parties challenging his re election bid mr  modi is not seeking to persuade the indian voters to vote for him and his party on the basis of his record while governing india for the past five years or by presenting compelling ideas for indias future  mr  modi is seeking votes by doing what he does best  raising and stoking fear among the hindu majority of the potential dangers posed by the presence of a large muslim minority in india  since he first consolidated power and built his political capital on the back of religious violence against muslims in gujarat in 2002 under his watch as chief minister  mr  modi has mastered the art of linking the threat of terrorism  muslims and pakistan  his strategy has worked in every election he has deployed it in his current campaign is taking place in the wake of the feb  14 suicide attack in pulwama district of indian administered kashmir  which killed 40 indian paramilitary soldiers  the attack was followed by a few weeks of intense escalation and cross border airstrikes by india and pakistan mr  modi has made the pulwama attack the basis of his most recent recasting of the theme of a terrorism pakistan muslim threat  on april 9  at a campaign rally  mr  modi directed his attention toward young indians voting for the first time  can your first vote be dedicated to the valiant soldiers who carried out the airstrike in pakistan  can your first vote be dedicated to the brave martyrs of pulwama mr  modi proceeded to blame the indian national congress  the leading opposition party  for the creation of pakistan in 1947 and claimed that the congress partys electoral manifesto speaks the same language as pakistan more than 70 years after independence  indian governments  mostly led by the congress party and now by the b j p   have refused to repeal several draconian laws introduced by british colonial rulers  including a particularly egregious law that defines what constitutes sedition or treason in its manifesto  the congress party promised to remove the sedition law  which has been much abused and is seen as a relic of a colonial state  the congress has said it wants to do away with the sedition laws  mr  modi said pakistan too wants this  it wants a free hand for those who want to work against india  the prime minister was raising the nationalist pitch and repeating what he has honed in his five years in power  branding all dissent and disagreement with his views as a bid to weaken the nation  follow coverage of the indian elections in the new york times   a tactic that mr  modi and his party have used in the hope of getting indians to shed their argumentative nature and conform to their interpretation of militant nationalism is an unprecedented exaltation of the indian armed forces  they seem to have taken a leaf out of the iranian playbook by seeking to create a cult of martyrdom by constant references to slain indian soldiers as martyrs  the usage has been amplified by a largely compliant mass media last week  yogi adityanath  who was appointed as the chief minister of uttar pradesh  the most populous indian state  in 2017 by mr  modi  described the indian army as modis army  mr  adityanath  a firebrand hindu ascetic  who faces many accusations of stoking and participating in religious violence  was only crudely stating what his leader had already conveyed in a calibrated and effective manner a few days after his modis army remark  mr  adityanath continued with the strategy of religious polarization by painting indias leading opposition parties as muslim parties that were fighting his hindu party  the samajwadi party has significant support among lower castes and muslims in uttar pradesh  and the bahujan samaj party has serious support among indias dalits and is headed by kumari mayawati  the first dalit woman to be a chief minister in india  the two parties have formed a coalition to fight mr  modis b j p  in these elections ms  mayawati responded by calling upon indias muslims  about 15 percent of the population  not to split their votes among various parties  as that would benefit the b j p  both mr  adityanath and ms  mayawati have been temporarily barred from campaigning by the election commission of india  which conducts the elections  for directly calling upon hindus and muslims for their votes  the hindu nationalists frame the threat posed by the muslim minority by associating them with pakistan and by raising the specter of an increased muslim population with illegal immigration of muslim migrants from bangladesh  who are described as infiltrators this fear of immigrants is the staple of right wing populists from president trump to prime minister viktor orban of hungary  but nowhere is the fear more imaginary than in india  where the hindu majority of 965 million dwarfs the muslim minority of about 170 million  and where the two communities have lived together for over 1 000 years  but for a man with mr  modis rhetorical skill  facts are easy to set aside amit shah  the president of mr  modis b j p  and his closest associate from his gujarat days  declared that if re elected  their government will throw out every illegal immigrant who is not a buddhist  a hindu or a sikh  that left muslims and christians and yet again on campaign trail  mr  modi  whom nobody would accuse of being bothered about minority rights  sought to use the persecution of hindu and sikh minorities in pakistan to whip up passions of hindu voters  the fundamentalists tortured our brothers and sisters in pakistan  is congress not a culprit for this  mr  modi said  our daughters are being tortured in pakistan even now  he added for mr  modi and his party  such rhetoric is the path to one more election victory  but the changes it sets in motion are not easy to reverse  the antipathy between hindus and muslims that he stoked in 2014 was manifest in the low grade violence and bigotry against the muslim minority over the next five years  the more permanent this antipathy becomes  the more it is likely to challenge the very fundamentals of indias democratic polity  which  however awkwardly  has so far managed to accommodate its diversity .
 what you need to know to start the day  get new york today in your inbox  everything haya konte had ever dreamed of for herself and for her family in america perished in a matter of minutes on april 13  2016 that day  ms  konte  a young undocumented immigrant  stepped out of an apartment in the butler houses  a public housing complex in the bronx  to get her two toddlers ice cream and to put clothes in the dryer at a laundromat across the street  she left the girls  aged 2 and 18 months  home alone with incense burning  she was under the mistaken impression a roommate was in the home at the time  she said a fire tore through the apartment while she was out  killing both children  ms  konte was charged with criminally negligent homicide its a feeling i cant forget  ms  konte said  speaking publicly for the first time about her daughters deaths and the criminal charges that followed  its something i will deal with for the rest of my life on feb  7  inside a third floor courtroom at the bronx hall of justice  ms  konte stood at the defense table flanked by her lawyer and an interpreter  her head was dropped  her shoulders were slumped forward  she tried to fight back tears  but failed between sobs  ms  konte  29  pleaded guilty to two counts of criminally negligent homicide in the deaths of her daughters jainabu jabbie  2  and adama jabbie  18 months  as part of the no prison plea deal  she also agreed to voluntarily leave the country  the guilty plea had taken more than two years to negotiate the deaths of jainabu and adama rattled the city  but struck a particular nerve with a segment of working class new yorkers familiar with the challenges of juggling parenthood  work and routine responsibilities the case also fed into a wider national debate over what constitutes negligence in the era of helicopter parenting  some states  for instance  have passed laws making it illegal to leave a child alone at home or in a car  but others have pushed back  passing free range parenting laws that set the bar higher for charging parents with neglect  like many other states  child neglect laws in new york are broad and include any action that results in a childs death or serious harm the authorities have said no adult was present when the incense came in contact with a couch  sparking the blaze  one child was lying on the couch and another was sitting on the living room floor  she said the bronx district attorneys office ultimately determined ms  kontes actions went so far beyond what a reasonable parent would do to keep her children safe that she had committed a crime  the loss of these two young girls is a devastating consequence of their mothers seemingly innocuous actions  the district attorney  darcel d  clark  said at the time the bronx district attorneys office declined to comment on the decision not to seek a prison term  the offense is punishable by up to four years in prison in an interview with the new york times  ms  konte described being haunted by her decisions that day  her life has unraveled since the fire  which also injured 10 other people  including three firefighters born in france  ms  konte was raised in a small village in gambia  she was 23 when she arrived in new york in 2012  seeking a better life as she left behind a poor economy and an oppressive regime at home  she found work as an on call hair braider in salons she said she entered the united states with a passport  but she had remained in the country illegally  officials said she said she had met a taxi driver  bully jabbie  online before arriving in the united states  they married  and their first child  jainabu  was born in 2014 life was good  ms  konte said through a translator at the bronx mosque where she worships  i was happy to be a mother but soon after the birth of their second child  adama  ms  konte said her husband began to change  he stopped helping as much with the children  she said  and most of the child care fell to her the family was sharing an apartment with a friend who allowed them to stay temporarily in a third floor unit at the butler houses on webster avenue in the claremont village section of the bronx  ms  konte  pregnant with their third child  said her husband had tried to find a new place for the family to live  when he failed to do so  it became a point of contention in their marriage ms  konte said she remembers each detail from the day of the fire with raw clarity she was four months pregnant  that morning  she had walked across the street to webster laundromat with her two daughters  she filled the washing machines with clothes before returning to the apartment once inside  ms  konte said jainabu spotted an ice cream truck from the window  mommy  ice cream  ms  konte recalled the little girl saying she looked out the window  but the truck had left that evening  a second ice cream truck pulled up in front of the building  ms  konte ran down to catch it  but she missed it  she said  her husband  she said  was praying in a mosque she then returned to the laundromat to put her clothes in the dryer  leaving the girls inside  her imam  musa kabba  of masjid ar rahmah  said she was away from the apartment for up to 40 minutes before fire trucks arrived  she said she rushed out of the laundromat at the sound of sirens and fainted at the sight of one of her daughters being carried out of the building by firefighters i couldnt take it  ms  konte said the fire prompted intense debate on social media  some expressed sympathy for ms  konte  saying the loss of her children was punishment enough for her carelessness  while others harshly criticized her as a mother and said she should be charged with a crime  there were no earlier reports of neglect  or complaints that she had left her children alone for her part  ms  konte said the fire was an accident and that she loved her children  her cousin  mohamed gumaneh  said  if she knew this would happen she would not even do the laundry since the fire  ms  konte and the daughter she was carrying at the time  who is now 2  have been living in a shelter in the south bronx  ms  konte and her husband divorced last year ms  konte arrived at court earlier this month with her daughter  who resembles jainabu  the restless toddler looked on as ms  konte pleaded guilty for the deaths of her sisters christine scaccia  a senior prosecutor in the bronx district attorneys office  told justice ralph fabrizio in state supreme court that prosecutors had met with ms  kontes ex husband and he found the plea to be acceptable  mr  jabbie could not be reached for comment ms  konte said during the interview that she felt rushed into making a decision to take the plea offer  she also said she had been scared about going to trial some community leaders and city officials questioned the bronx district attorneys decision to bring criminal charges against ms  konte theres no punishment greater than what she actually lost  councilman rory lancman  a candidate for queens district attorney  said  adding  and the knowledge that she maybe could have prevented it  why would banishment be appropriate  theres no point to it chris gottlieb  co director of the new york university family defense clinic  said prosecutors had overreached  most of the time when parents lose a child we sympathize with them  she said but mark a  bederow  a defense lawyer and former manhattan prosecutor  said as a legal matter it was clearly negligent for ms  konte to have left her two young children home alone  the charges were appropriate  he said ms  clark was also criticized for not filing criminal charges against a public housing maintenance worker who provided false information in safety reports and lied about the smoke detectors in ms  kontes apartment hours before the fire ms  konte is expected back in court march 27 for sentencing she has not decided where she and her daughter will go when they leave the country this disaster happened by mistake  mr  kabba said  she has faith that a better life is coming  im praying for her .
tijuana  mexico  pushed beyond their limits by prolonged waits in dangerous and squalid conditions in parts of northern mexico  thousands of caravan members who had been waiting to seek asylum in the united states appear to have given up  mexican officials said  dealing president trump an apparent win after a humbling week for his immigration agenda about 6 000 asylum seekers who had traveled en masse  many of them in defiance of mr  trumps demands that they turn around  arrived in northern mexico in late november as part of a caravan that originated in honduras  since then  more than 1 000 have accepted an offer to be returned home by the mexican government  the officials said  another 1 000 have decided to stay in mexico  accepting work permits that were offered to them last fall  at the height of international consternation over how to deal with the growing presence of migrant caravans mr  trump resorted on friday to declaring a national emergency after he failed to secure funding from congress for a border wall that he said would block migrants from entering the united states  but the data from mexican officials suggested that harsh policies he has introduced to crack down on asylum seekers may already be achieving some of its intended effects added this week to new policies that are bearing down on asylum seekers  which include tight limits on the number of people who can apply for the status each day and a heightened standard of proof to qualify  was the extension of a rule that certain asylum seekers must wait in mexico for the full duration of their legal cases  which can take years  read the first edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  the requirement originally applied only to adults  but the department of homeland security expanded it to include families with children as well among those who have been dissuaded  at least for now  is natali  32  who asked to be identified only by her first name because she feared for her safety  speaking from her modest apartment atop a steep hill in western tijuana  she explained that she and her husband had fled their home in el progreso  honduras  after she witnessed a murder carried out by a local criminal gang  soon after  she began to receive threats in the mail warning her to keep quiet once in mexico  they heard about the increasingly long odds of receiving asylum in the united states  and feared more than anything that officials there would return them to their home country  rather than crossing the border  they decided to seek humanitarian visas to remain in mexico legally for at least one year  and have slowly begun to build a life she still believes she might ask for asylum in the united states  but is realistic about her chances  i like tijuana  she said  its a very pretty city and theres a lot of work  more than anything  she fears the united states would deport her back to honduras mexican officials said the data on people who have deferred or given up their quest for asylum in the united states reinforced an idea that is often raised by mr  trump  that many caravan members are not truly desperate for protection what happened is that many people came on an adventure  trying their luck  said cesar palencia  tijuanas chief of migrant services  when they realized that it was hard to cross and the conditions in mexico were also difficult  among many factors  they decided to return home the honduran caravan ballooned in size as it swept through impoverished villages  drawing a swarm of national media attention and an eclectic mix of participants  many came from poverty  lacking education and resources  and said they were unfamiliar with the complex set of laws that would ultimately determine who would be granted legal status in the united states  and who would not immigrant advocates said that hype and false promises had attracted a group that was somewhat unrepresentative of typical asylum seekers  but they pointed to the roughly 4 000 members who had successfully entered the united states and had at least requested protected status to argue that most had legitimate claims michelle bran  the director of migrant rights and justice at the womens refugee commission  warned that while mr  trumps tough policies may discourage the undeserving  they might also endanger people who need protection  she said they would likely drive vulnerable migrants into the arms of human traffickers  who promise to provide passage into the united states it may look like its working in the short term  ms  bran said  but i dont think its a long term solution  its driving people further into the shadows and thats exactly the opposite of what we want when they arrived in mexico  many of the caravan members had been living in squalor  sleeping in tents or lean tos inside the benito jurez sports complex  a downpour devastated the grounds  and those who remained fled to a new expansive shelter called barretal on the outskirts of tijuana  once packed with 2 500 people  that location also recently closed because it had shrunk to fewer than 200 it is not the same as when we had barretal and benito jurez  said esme flores  an immigrant rights advocate at the san diego office of the american civil liberties union  it really feels that the population has moved on on friday  all that remained of the formerly bustling migrant quarter around the barretal shelter was a small camp around the corner  only partially covered by a tin roof  the conditions are far from comfortable  but the occupants said it was better than sleeping on sidewalks most were not yet ready to give up trying to enter the united states  but knew of others who had  elde rodriguez  26  said he had left honduras hoping to send money back to his wife and daughter  believing that he would not qualify for asylum  he tried last week to cross the border illegally but he and a friend were unable to find their away across and turned back theres enough work here in mexico  and you can live on that if youre alone  but you cant make enough to send money home  and thats the point about all this  he said  if i cant get in  ill just keep trying while tijuana appears to be emptying  large groups of migrants have accumulated in other areas along the border as a result of the new policies  after a riot the day before  authorities in mexico said on friday that they would disband a group of 1 400 central american asylum seekers who had been waiting in the city of piedras negras to cross the border into eagle pass  tex   according to news reports the trump administration has said that the latest policy requiring asylum seekers to wait in mexico  which it called migrant protection protocols  is a vital response to a crisis at the border  kirstjen nielsen  secretary of the department of homeland security  has said the policy aims to alleviate a humanitarian crisis on the border and secure the united states  introduced as a pilot program across the border from san diego  the administration plans to expand the policy into texas border patrol apprehensions of families along the southwest border remain near all time highs  though there was a slight downward turn in january  as is often the case  according the latest government figures  customs and border protection said more than 1 800 central american parents and children crossed the border illegally on monday  the largest number of families recorded on a single day  and like other asylum policies of this administration  the remain in mexico policy has already drawn legal scrutiny  leaving its future uncertain on thursday  the american civil liberties union and two other groups sued the administration on behalf of 11 asylum seekers who were required to wait in mexico  claiming that the policy  which was introduced last month at the san ysidro port of entry  near san diego  violates united states and international laws the lawsuit was filed in federal court in the northern district of california on behalf of migrants from guatemala  honduras and el salvador who feared for their lives in mexico  according to the complaint one of them was robbed at gunpoint and told by the assailant that he would be killed if he was seen again  two others said that they had been threatened by local residents wielding rocks or sticks  another plaintiff said he had to bribe a police officer to avoid arrest asylum seekers in mexico face a

new rule that became known as the asylum ban because it significantly restricted the locations where people could request the status  that policy remains enjoined by a federal court  the supreme court declined to reinstate it like members of the caravan  many of those who continue to come to the united states each day lack a comprehensive understanding of the system they are entering ela marina rodriguez  49  and her daughter  dua ventura  16  arrived in tijuana about three weeks ago and were taken to the small shelter by a man whom they had been traveling with  ms  rodriguez said she had heard on the news that bringing her daughter would guarantee them admission into the united states  and the two thought if they could make it through the journey they would have an opportunity for a better life thats why we came all this way  she said  ive dreamed of doing this my entire life but i was afraid  hiding through the desert and the mountains  i never had the courage before  until we heard they were giving papers to families her eyes grew wide when she heard from a reporter that some asylum seekers are being made to wait in mexico  she sighed heavily and replied  i dont know  i dont know  i dont want to be here ms  rodriguez said that honestly  yes she would cross illegally if that is what it takes to get into the united states  but if she is unable to gain entry to the united states  she said  she would likely turn back to honduras  i mean  what else can you do in that case .
washington  in an effort to stem the flow of central american migrants coming into the united states  the trump administration has focused on limiting who can apply for asylum and instituting detention policies that officials hope will deter people from seeking refuge in the country  on tuesday  attorney general william p  barr issued an order that could keep thousands of migrants seeking asylum in jail while they wait for their requests to be evaluated by a judge asylum is a legal process by which people fleeing persecution in their home country may seek to live in safety in the united states  international treaties and federal law require the government to evaluate a claim for asylum from anyone who enters the united states  whether that person arrives legally  through a port of entry or illegally by crossing the border and being apprehended people who are already in the country legally may apply for asylum directly with an agency called united states citizenship and immigration services  migrants who arrive illegally and were apprehended  or have been told they will be deported  may ask for asylum as a way of avoiding being sent home soon after asking for asylum  migrants are usually interviewed by a trained asylum officer to determine whether they have a credible fear of persecution in their home country on account of race  religion  nationality  membership in a particular social group or political opinion  if the officer determines that there is a significant possibility that the migrants will be able to prove such persecution  a court date will be set for a final determination about whether they will be granted asylum more than 75 percent of migrants pass the initial screening because of congressionally mandated rules that set a fairly low bar for approval to ensure that persecuted people have the opportunity to apply for refuge in the united states  trump administration officials argue that the credible fear screening should be far less generous migrants who pass a credible fear screening after being apprehended trying to cross the border illegally have in the past been released from detention to wait for their final hearing  a huge backlog in immigration court cases  approaching 900 000 cases  has meant that some asylum seekers must wait years for their claim to be heard  after a period of time  the migrants are given permission to work legally while they wait the trump administration has tried to keep more asylum seekers in detention while they wait for their day in court  in part because officials argue that many migrants disappear before their hearing  becoming permanently undocumented immigrants  the tuesday night decision about bail by mr  barr is part of that effort to prevent asylum seekers from getting out of jail under federal law and court rulings  families and unaccompanied children who seek asylum may not be detained for longer than 20 days  so most are released from detention to await their asylum hearings mr  trumps decision last summer to separate migrant children from their parents at the border was an attempt to get around those restrictions  once the children were separated and sent to shelters  the parents were subject to rules that allowed authorities to detain them for longer periods of time a federal judge in california halted the practice last summer and the president issued an executive order reversing the policy of routinely separating families after an uproar in which critics called it inhumane  cruel and evil  mr  trump has publicly said he has no plans to go back to family separations people seeking refuge in the united states must show that they have a well founded fear of being persecuted if they were to return to their own country  that is often demonstrated through direct testimony about the situation they expect to face if they return home  as well as other evidence of the situation they faced before coming to the united states immigration judges typically deny 80 percent of the applications  weeding out fraudulent claims and ineligible applicants  when the process was devised  there was a fairly short period between the initial screening and an appearance in immigration court  but that has changed significantly  and a backlog of hundreds of thousands of cases has led to asylum seekers waiting years to appear in court yes  although the trump administration is trying to change that  currently  if an immigration judge approves a migrants asylum request  the migrant is eligible to receive public welfare benefits  such as food stamps and medicaid  in some cases  the amount of benefits or the amount of time the benefits are available varies from state to state the trump administration  however  has proposed a new rule that could deny public benefits to legal immigrants  including those granted asylum  last year  the trump administration announced that if immigrants used public assistance  such as a section 8 housing voucher  they could be denied a green card  forcing some immigrants who are legally in the country to choose between their own welfare and the ability to live and work in the united states after one year  a migrant who has been granted asylum is allowed to apply for a green card to become a permanent legal resident in the united states the difference between the two types of migrants largely depends on where a person applies for safe haven  refugees make their application outside the united states  asylum seekers are people who are already in the country or arrive at an american port of entry  both must prove that they realistically fear persecution in their own country mr  trump and his aides have also been trying to reduce the number of refugees who can seek protection by coming to the united states each year  in the wake of the refugee crisis created by the syrian civil war  president barack obama had increased the cap on the maximum number of refugees to 110 000 before he left office  mr  trump has lowered the cap to 30 000 once people are granted asylum  the government does not track when they die or move out of the country  making it difficult to know how many people currently living in the united states are in the country because they were granted asylum at some point according to statistics from the department of homeland security  roughly 637 000 people were granted asylum between 1990 and 2017 .
welcome to crossing the border  a limited run weekly newsletter from the new york times  did you find it useful  send this to a friend  if someone forwarded it to you  sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox by manny fernandez in falfurrias  tex last week  president trump told reporters during his visit to san antonio that he was shocked to learn that migrants were dying in the south texas brush after crossing the border illegally i had no idea  mr  trump said  nobody has any idea how bad this is  he added  many  many are dying  that was what surprised me the president spoke at a private club last wednesday at 12 56 p m  at that very moment  186 miles to the south  deputy bianca mora with the brooks county sheriffs office was driving a patrol truck on a caliche road  she was responding to a report of a migrant body on a ranch  it was her second body of the day i dont know how to explain it but you get used to it  said deputy mora  25  i went to one last year and i didnt have enough body bags  i wasnt prepared for the amount of bodies that we found  i went initially for one  we picked up three brooks county is deep in south texas brush country  an immense swath of ranchlands thick with thorny shrubs  cactus and mesquite and oak trees  the county seat  falfurrias  has a population of 4 981  one ranch alone is 8 600 acres  more than 10 times the size of central park  brooks county is far north of the border  about an hours drive  but it is home to a busy border patrol traffic checkpoint  read more about those checkpoints here  migrants  led by smugglers known as coyotes  try to hike around the checkpoint  ill prepared for the days long journey in the harsh brush  sometimes without adequate water or food  hundreds of migrants have died on the private ranches in brooks county in recent years  making it one of the deadliest places on americas southwest border since january 2009  the bodies or skeletal remains of 642 migrants have been discovered in brooks county  they die from the cold in the winter and die from the heat in the summer  they die of dehydration  heat stroke  hypothermia  they die alone  sometimes they die together  like the five migrants whose bodies were found under a tree during a freeze one winter  eight bodies have been found so far this year  fifty were recovered in 2018 by the sheriffs office  down from 52 in 2017 and 61 in 2016 those 642 bodies are but a fraction of the border wide total  from october 1997 to september 2018  the border patrol recorded 7 505 migrant deaths in its nine sectors along the entire southwestern border  the actual number of border deaths is likely higher  because the border patrol figure includes only cases reported to the authorities no one knows how many were never found the sheriff of brooks county  urbino benny martinez  said he was not all that surprised that some people were unaware of what has been happening in his county  including the president of the united states its kind of that old thing  out of sight  out of mind  and if its not happening in your backyard  youre not going to pay attention to it  sheriff martinez said on the day the president spoke  the first call came in to the sheriffs office shortly before 10 a m   a few hours into deputy moras 12 hour shift  border patrol agents had called it in  the body of a woman  near a barbed wire fence in the back corner of a ranch  her skeleton was face down  she was carrying cash from honduras  mexico and the united states  prayer cards were found in the dirt around her  and in the pockets of her jeans the border patrol agents were following a group of illegals northbound  towards the highway  and the group crossed over the body and just kept going  deputy mora said  the agents came across it and called it out deputy mora was back in the office  writing up her report  when the second call came in shortly before noon  a worker had found the body of a man at another ranch  the man was lying face up  his arms extended out  on a sandy road known as a drag  a honduran id card was in his black wallet dr  corinne e  stern  who is the chief medical examiner of laredos webb county and who conducts autopsies for brooks county  said both bodies had not yet been positively identified  the woman was possibly a honduran missing person  the man was likely the honduran on the id  dr  stern said the most likely cause of death is dehydration  dr  stern said of both bodies relatives in honduras said they believed the man who was found last week was indeed the person on the id card  rudy donaldo martinez arias  21  a husband and father who lived in the northern honduran city of san pedro sula  relatives said they were told mr  martinez had died of thirst in south texas after the coyote abandoned him and other migrants he left our country  honduras  because the salaries are not enough here  maricela amador  24  mr  martinezs cousin  said in an interview using facebook messages  it is pure poverty  thats why people migrate to the united states without knowing what awaits them  he wanted to leave to find a good job where he could provide for his family mr  martinezs daughter is 3 years old  in january  he posted a selfie of the two of them on his facebook page  a relative posted a comment  remarking how beautiful the girl looked yes  thats right  mr  martinez wrote in

a federal appeals court said friday that the trump administration could temporarily continue to force migrants seeking asylum in the united states to wait in mexico while their cases are decided a three judge panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit issued a stay of a lower court ruling four days earlier that blocked the administrations protocol  the appeals court will consider next week whether to extend that stay  and allow the trump administration policy to remain in effect for longer the administration in december  announced its new policy  called the migration protection protocols  arguing that it would help stop people from using the asylum process to enter the country and remain there illegally  president trump has long been angered by so called catch and release policies  under which asylum seekers are temporarily allowed in the united states while they wait for their court hearings on monday  judge richard seeborg of the united states district court for the northern district of california issued an injunction against mr  trumps new protocols  saying that the president did not have the power to enforce them and that they violated immigration laws judge seeborg said in his ruling that the protocols did not include sufficient safeguards to comply with the department of homeland securitys obligation against returning migrants to places where their life or freedom would be threatened on friday  as judge seeborgs injunction was set to go into effect  a three judge panel for the ninth circuit issued the temporary stay in a tweet late friday night  president trump wrote  finally  great news at the border  he has previously criticized the ninth circuit  which is based in san francisco  saying that the court always ruled against him  while that is not always true  the administrations track record in the circuit has been poor the justice department  which appealed judge seeborgs decision  argued that the injunction would impose immediate  substantial harm on the united states  including by diminishing the executive branchs ability to work effectively with mexico to manage the crisis on our shared border the ninth circuit will consider next week whether to keep the stay  and mr  trumps protocols  in place during the appeal judy rabinovitz  the deputy director of the immigrants rights project at the american civil liberties union  who argued the case  said she expected that decision to come next week the question will be  can the government continue to implement the policy while it appeals it to the ninth circuit  she said  obviously  we dont think it should be able to she called the policy unlawful and cruel we think it should be stopped  she said lawyers for the justice department did not immediately respond to requests for comment the appeals courts decision comes as the nations immigration system may have reached a breaking point as migrants increasingly arrive at the countrys southwestern border with mexico the flow of migrant families has reached record levels  with february totals 560 percent above those for the same period last year  many are seeking asylum  in which they have the burden to show evidence of past persecution or testimony that establishes the well founded fear that they would face danger if they return home the trump administrations migration protection protocols were an attempt to deter migrants  mexicos government reluctantly agreed to house the migrants in december .
 read the latest edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  hidalgo  tex   the federal government will spend nearly  40 million to build and operate two new tent cities for migrant families and children in texas  as the trump administration scrambles to respond to a surge of central american asylum seekers at the southwest border kevin k  mcaleenan  the acting secretary of the department of homeland security  told reporters during a visit to south texas on wednesday that the temporary facilities are part of a strategy to ease overcrowding at border patrol detention centers  the two tent cities will be built in el paso and in the rio grande valley town of donna by april 30 as processing centers and temporary housing for central american families and unaccompanied children detained after crossing the border from mexico its clear that all of our resources are being stretched thin  said mr  mcaleenan  standing in front of a section of border wall in the town of hidalgo  the system is full and we are beyond capacity mr  mcaleenan spoke to reporters the day after attorney general william p  barr issued an order to immigration judges that they deny some migrants a chance to post bail  the order  which is expected to be challenged in the courts  could keep thousands more in jail indefinitely while they wait for their asylum requests to be resolved  and appeared to be another effort to discourage migrants from seeking asylum  but it could also add to the overcrowding in detention centers on the border when it goes into effect in 90 days for weeks  federal  local and nonprofit officials along the border have been struggling to handle a spike in asylum seekers from honduras  guatemala and el salvador  mr  mcaleenan  on his first trip to the border as acting homeland security secretary  said the numbers have become unmanageable in march  officials encountered or apprehended more than 103 000 migrants  the most in any single month in more than a decade  he said  yesterday  in one 24 hour period  we had over 4 800 people cross our border  a new record for the modern era  mr  mcaleenan said  almost 1 000 of them crossed in just three large groups  375 people in the largest of those groups over all  the flow of migrants is low compared with the record numbers in the 1990s and early 2000s  but the latest surge has raised a host of legal and logistical challenges  in the border patrols rio grande valley sector  the number of migrants apprehended so far this month is 8 928  already more than double what it was in april 2018  and in the el paso sector  the number arriving in april is nearly eight times what it was last april the federal government has a history of using temporary emergency housing to deal with influxes of migrants the obama administration also put migrants in tent camps  and in 2012  it turned a vacant dormitory building at an air force base in san antonio into living quarters for migrant youths  some of the trump administrations attempts to respond with similar measures have been met with widespread criticism the border patrol recently placed families in a fenced in encampment under a bridge in el paso with little hot food  that area was closed after an outcry from elected officials and migrant advocates  although hundreds of migrants were still being held in several tents next to a border patrol station last year  officials built a tent city at the tornillo border station  near el paso  to house unaccompanied children  the tornillo camp  with air conditioned tents with bunk beds on a patch of desert  was originally built to house 360 teenagers  it was rapidly expanded and at one point had about 1 500 there  costly and controversial  it was eventually shuttered the two tent cities now scheduled to open in el paso and donna will house hundreds of migrants at each site in structures that federal officials call soft sided facilities  according to federal contracting documents  the donna and el paso tent cities will operate for eight months and will have kitchen equipment  shower trailers  laundry trailers  office space and security cameras  the estimated cost of the two sites is  37 2 million it was unclear how long the families and children would be held at the sites  asked on wednesday if officials planned to detain migrant families for longer periods there  one border patrol official said they were bound by law to release families after 20 days but we are always looking for additional options to have in place to house people  said the official  rodolfo karisch  the border patrols chief patrol agent for the rio grande valley sector  right now  if you look at every border patrol station thats out here  were at overcapacity  so we do need some shelters here to help us house the people we have in custody federal officials have been trying various things to mitigate the demands placed on border cities  including taking migrants to bus stations and shelters run by nonprofit and religious groups in other towns  but that informal network of shelters is now flooded along the entire border on tuesday  the mayor of yuma  ariz   signed a proclamation of emergency as the city struggled to handle the growing number of migrant families released by customs and border protection officers there  the mayor  douglas nicholls  said he was seeking a fema type response  help from the federal emergency management agency or its equivalent to provide shelter  food and other assistance to the migrants mr  mcaleenan signaled the governments willingness to work with local officials and nonprofit groups  meeting with several mayors of south texas cities and touring a migrant shelter in the city of mcallen run by catholic charities  he did not take questions from reporters and did not comment about the yuma mayors actions one of the mayors who met with mr  mcaleenan  dr  ambrosio hernandez  a pediatric surgeon who is the mayor of the rio grande valley city of pharr  said the acting secretary was not there to sway anybody he did most of the listening  we did most of the talking  dr  hernandez said at the mcallen shelter  a former nursing home that on wednesday afternoon was packed with about 400 migrants  mr  mcaleenan met with the catholic nun who assists migrant families in south texas  sister norma pimentel  the executive director of catholic charities of the rio grande valley at this point  i dont know that we have any solutions that he proposed  she said  he said that he was going to work with us to make sure that for the solutions going forward  he would listen to what we have to say .
washington  in pursuit of a wall  president trump ran into one  a single minded drive to force congress to finance his signature campaign promise has left mr  trump right back where he started  this time seeking a way to climb over the political barrier in his way after trying to charge through it did not work as he inched closer to reluctantly accepting a bipartisan spending compromise without the money he demanded for his border wall  mr  trump offered no acknowledgment on wednesday that his pressure tactics had failed even as aides sought to minimize the damage by tamping down criticism on the right one call was made to lou dobbs  a favorite of mr  trumps whose fox business network show he often tries to catch live  another was placed to sean hannity  the fox host who regularly talks with the president  the message  mr  trump deserved support because he still forced concessions that he would never have gotten without a five week partial government shutdown even so  it was arguably the most punishing defeat mr  trump has experienced as president  and it left the white house scrounging for other ways to pay for a wall on the southwestern border and rethinking its approach to a congress now partly controlled by democrats  mr  trumps inability to reach a satisfying deal despite the negotiating experience he regularly touted on the campaign trail suggested that any aspirations of collaboration across party lines may be even more elusive than he had imagined we shut down the government for 35 days  we put america through this crisis  we jeopardized our economy  for what  said senator richard j  durbin of illinois  the second ranking democrat in the upper chamber and a member of the house senate committee that negotiated this weeks spending deal  totally unnecessary the agreement that lawmakers produced this week would allocate  1 375 billion for fencing along the border  even less than was on the table at one point last year  the senate plans to vote on the measure on thursday  followed by the house  mr  trump would not say whether he would sign it  but he seemed to be leaning toward it in the interest of avoiding another government shutdown at midnight friday with the wall  they want to be stingy  mr  trump complained about speaker nancy pelosi and other congressional democrats during an encounter with reporters on wednesday  but we have options that most people dont really understand those options involve diverting money from other programs and potentially declaring a national emergency to access further funds  in the end  aides said  mr  trump may even secure more money than congress denied him  but those options were just as available to mr  trump in december before the showdown that closed federal agencies while acknowledging disappointment in the agreement  the president and his aides characterized it as better than it seemed  citing money it will provide for overall border security  mr  trump argued that the shutdown had been useful because it educated the country about troubles at the border and  if nothing else  he has framed the national debate on his terms that did not completely assuage conservatives  representative mark meadows  republican of north carolina and the chairman of the house freedom caucus  contradicted the white house line and declared that the agreement was a bad deal for the president only in washington  d c   can we start out with needing  25 billion for border security measures and expect applause at 1 37  he said tuesday on fox news  i mean  only in d c  is that a winning deal mr  meadows and his allies were among those targeted by the white house in hopes of avoiding a more threatening conservative revolt  a meeting with members of his freedom caucus in the oval office was partly aimed at urging them to hold their fire in television interviews when talking about the bill  according to a person briefed on the effort and indeed  despite his complaints about the bill  mr  meadows made a point on wednesday of not blaming mr  trump  i think he handled it as well as anybody could handle it  given a dysfunctional congress  mr  meadows told reporters among those involved in the outreach  according to the person briefed on the discussions  was bill shine  a white house deputy chief of staff and former fox executive who in the west wing is seen as adept at getting some hosts at fox to respond to white house concerns since coming to office  mr  trump has missed several opportunities to make more progress on the wall  instead of mexico directly paying for a  25 billion  1 000 mile concrete barrier  as the president once said would happen  he has been seeking partial installments from congress  arguing that his new trade agreement with mexico will ultimately pay off enough to offset the cost  the partial installments have generally gone to replacing or repairing existing barriers  not to building the new concrete or steel walls mr  trump wants at one point last year  the president and democrats were close to a deal in which he would get all  25 billion for the wall in exchange for protections for 1 8 million young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children  but mr  trump ultimately turned away because he also wanted cuts to legal immigration that democrats would not accept in his budget request for this year  mr  trump asked for  1 6 billion  and the senate appropriations committee agreed on a bipartisan basis to give him that last summer  but the measure stalled until after the midterm elections in november by the time mr  trump met with ms  pelosi and senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  in december  they offered  1 375 billion  the president then insisted on  5 7 billion  and when he did not get it  much of the government was left without the funding to keep doors open during the shutdown  ms  pelosi took an even harder line  saying she would not spend a single dollar on mr  trumps wall  although she said she would provide money for other border security the deal reached this week returned to the same  1 375 billion available in december to pay for 55 miles of fencing along the border  although not walls based on the new steel or concrete prototypes mr  trump has promoted mr  trump and his aides claimed victory because they had gotten more than ms  pelosis zero dollars  and they noted that the agreement also included  23 billion for immigration and customs enforcement and customs and border protection  an increase from  21 billion last year  but democrats said much of the increase would go to their priorities  like more customs agents and humanitarian aid  not to mr  trumps either way  his aides are now focused on finding pots of money that  with the presidents traditional discretion  can be reprogrammed toward the wall  if that is not enough  he could still declare a national emergency to bypass congress  although such a move is opposed by many republicans and would invariably draw a court challenge as a result  some supporters of tougher border security said mr  trumps critics should not crow because the struggle is not over people say  well  the president lost  said james jay carafano  a national security analyst at the heritage foundation  the analogy here is if its a 10 round fight  trumps fighting 10 rounds  if pelosi wants to say at the end of round 1  i won that round  trumps like  yeah  maybe  but im fighting 10 rounds andy surabian  a former trump white house aide  said the details do not matter to the presidents base as much as his determination to fulfill his promise  his supporters dont care about how the rest of the wall is built  he said  they just care that the wall is ultimately built .
this article is part of david leonhardts newsletter  you can sign up here to receive it each weekday when i was in college  a fair number of my fellow students liked to describe themselves as socially liberal and economically conservative  this was the 1990s  when bill clintons third way was thriving  and i was attending a college  yale  where the student body was predominantly affluent when members of the national media  whose incomes also tend to be above average  describe the prototypical centrist voter  this is the same image they often have in mind  socially liberal and economically conservative but its a big myth  listen to the argument podcast every thursday morning  with ross douthat  michelle goldberg and david leonhardt  true  many high income voters are socially liberal and economically conservative  they arent particularly religious and generally agree with the democratic party on social issues  like abortion  affirmative action and immigration  on economic issues  though  these affluent voters lean to the center if not the right  they dont like talk of 70 percent marginal tax rates  and they favor cuts to medicare and social security  which they describe as entitlement reform  many commentators share these views  and they commit a classic version of the pundit fallacy  they confuse their own beliefs with the countrys  they fool themselves into thinking that socially liberal and economically conservative is a good campaign strategy  this is precisely the theory that seems to motivate howard schultz  the former starbucks c e o  now planning an independent run for president in reality  the american public is closer to being socially conservative and economically liberal than the reverse on the socially conservative part  more than half of americans say they pray daily  about 53 percent say abortion should be legal either only in a few circumstances or never  almost 70 percent say illegal immigration is a very big or moderately big problem  on some of these subjects  the answers can depend on the precise phrasing of poll questions  but you have to twist the data pretty hard to create a portrait of a secular  liberal majority on most social issues economic policy is very different  large majorities of americans oppose cuts to medicare and social security and favor expanded medicaid  they favor higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations  they favor a higher minimum wage and more aggressive government action to create jobs  no wonder  incomes for most americans have been growing painfully slowly for most of the past four decades schultz is correct that there may be room in american politics for a candidate who doesnt line up neatly with the two parties  but we already knew that  just consider the last businessman turned candidate who vowed to change politics donald trump won the republican nomination despite running well to the left of party orthodoxy on economics   as president  hes returned to the conservative orthodoxy   and he won the electoral college despite a set of social and cultural views  including racism  that social liberals rightly found odious obviously  im not at all happy about trumps presidency  but he is much closer to the median voter than schultz is  schultzs version of that voter is a fantasy related  for more evidence on socially conservative and economically liberal americans  see jonathan chait in new york magazine and michelle goldberg in the times  huffposts zach carter writes that schultz hails from an aging  elite enclave in which the conventional wisdom of the 1990s remains the foundation of all political truth  jeff greenfield  writing in politico  points out that a schultz candidacy relies on a second myth as well  that of true political independence among voters  in fact  most voters are partisans  whether they d admit it or not  elsewhere even if schultz isnt a serious candidate to win the presidency  he could affect the outcome  the likelihood that he would do so was the subject of much debate on monday nate silver argued that a schultz candidacy was likely to be irrelevant  hes probably about equally likely to draw from either major party candidate  silver tweeted others disagreed  the historians kevin kruse and julian zelizer argued that schultzs social liberalism made him unlikely to attract republican votes  and  thus  more likely to hurt the eventual democratic candidate  if schultzs goal is breaking free of the polarized politics of the trump presidency  he should understand that his independent candidacy could wind up prolonging it  they wrote for cnn my take  the chances that schultz will affect the outcome seem small  but theyre not nothing  and because the stakes  the potential of a second trump term  are so large  i think its irresponsible and self centered of him to run as an independent  he should run for one of the partys nominations  given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system  there is no way an independent can win  michael bloomberg  the former new york mayor who considered an independent run in 2016  said yesterday  if schultz does run as an independent  neera tanden of the center for american progress called for a boycott of starbucks  schultz still owns a large stake in the company for anyone interested in a more positive take on schultz than mine  try david frum in the atlantic .
el paso  texas  the battle of the border was an epic desert showdown between two gifted politicians  each marshaling around 10 000 people  one blessed with the truth  the other peddling lies  and yet  to donald trumps mystifying credit  the lie survived to fight another day  we tell some tall tales here in texas  but no texan is a match for this president as day broke here in my hometown yesterday  it looked like after years  mr  trumps lies about the border had finally run out  amid his showdown with democrats over his proposed border wall  which had already led to an unpopular 35 day long government shutdown  mr  trump was coming to el paso to make his case once again  build the wall  the people of el paso  with the local hero and presidential hamlet beto orourke as their public face  had a response  were safe not because of walls but in spite of walls  were safe not in spite of immigrants but because of immigrants ahead of the presidents visit  normally taciturn local politicians turned on mr  trump for falsely claiming in recent weeks that el paso  the second largest border city in america  was swamped by an immigrant crime wave until a fence went up  the english language daily  el paso times  proclaimed  local leaders ready to tell el pasos story  the spanish language daily  el diario  more startlingly heralded  el paso  national battleground  the officially nonpartisan mayor  dee margo  laid into mr  trump on twitter  outraged  el paso was never one of the most dangerous cities in the u s as air force one approached  winds whipped up to 50 miles per hour as people streamed toward the county coliseum  formerly a site for livestock shows and rodeos  where mr  trump held what amounted to his kickoff rally for the 2020 election  this is not trump country  after all  hed branded the entire border  where millions of americans live  a violent wasteland  business leaders groused that the president had been bad for business  endangering  70 billion in local trade with mexico while scaring away businesses with tales of immigrant mayhem  the county commissioners court is on the record opposing a wall cutting through downtown  el paso voted nearly 3 to 1 against him in 2016 for a moment  it seemed the president would finally get his comeuppance here  a definitive and undeniable repudiation of his monstrous and unpopular pet project on the merits  mr  trump should lose the battle hands down  the crime rate in el paso peaked in 1993  then it fell steadily for years finally settling at about 370 violent crimes per 100 000 people  lower than a city el pasos size  like  say  boston or the national average organized by some 50 local groups  the march for truth gathered at least as many or even more people than mr  trumps rally  winding its way to a field directly across from the county coliseum  some skewered mr  trump  sure  not today  satan  read one sign  but most people  like cathy benavidez  a retired social worker  came to defend their hometowns reputation  im just embarrassed by what trump has said because its not true  ms  benavidez said  her hand lettered sign said  in glitter  stop the wall  stop the lies  el paso has always been safe mr  orourke appeared in shirt sleeves  despite plummeting temperatures  but with his usual upbeat attitude  in a brief interview over the rising voice of a mariachi singer  he said  this is el paso so i want to take every opportunity to support the cause  the culture and the community he helped bring out 10 000 supporters  according to local organizers  maybe as many as 15 000  mr  trump brought 6 700 to the old rodeo arena  according to the fire department  with a few thousand more stamping their feet in front of the parking lot jumbotron  the truth  or at least the facts  made steady progress in el paso but that didnt stop the lies  like mr  trump claiming 35 000 people came to see him while just 200 went to see mr  orourke  there is nothing the president wont lie about  he even encouraged followers to chant finish that wall  though theres been no construction since he became president on any kind of wall he promised  just fences ordered up since 2006  i tried to count the lies during his speech but had to stop after 10  my stetson is off  the guy is a gifted and gratuitously generous liar thanks to a powerful border wall in el paso  texas  it is one of the safest cities  he insisted even after the uproar  and the crowd roared  of course  i had parked my car by the 18 foot bollard border fence a block away  there was no wall  just like there were no 10 000 maga fans milling around outside but the truth is plodding  getting its pants on  one leg at a time  while a lie races halfway around the world  as the old saw attributed to mark twain goes  mr  trumps tales of kidnappings and mayhem  too  are far more racy than the truth  el paso has problems  the international bridges carry tens of millions of people  cars  trucks and rail cars each year  theyre not getting inspected  but that is tedious  i grew up here and el paso does have a crisis  too much poverty and too little education  but that is boring mr  trumps lies are dime novel  pulp fiction  heart pounding  mesmerizing and thats where they derive their power  regardless  word came that evening that congressional negotiators would give mr  trump about  1 billion for more steel barriers  which he will call a wall and then declare victory  it will be anything but that the presidents biggest cheerleader  lindsey graham  is absolutely right when he says the wall has become a metaphor  and henri rafael  a trump fan i met at the rally  is absolutely right  too  a border wall is very much needed  but its not about the wall anymore  his friend in a pink maga hat  monica demoss  chimed in  these people need to go out and work the wall is about whatever you want it to be about  welfare  immigrants  race  class  socialism  you name it  it will never be an actual  30 foot wall from sea to shining sea  as mr  trump once promised  he is  in fact  losing on the merits  bit by bit  but he will still get his monument  a metaphor that just as effectively divides the nation  even if a real wall never divides the border here  in el paso ill hand it to the guy  no texan could tell a taller tale .
as long as washington remains unable to deliver comprehensive immigration reform  states will be left to decide how to deal with the millions of undocumented immigrants who are a part of their communities and the work force gov  andrew cuomo of new york and the now democratic led state legislature recently agreed to let undocumented immigrants apply for state financial aid to attend college  tapping a pool of talent and giving more young people a chance to fully participate in american life  there are an estimated 725 000 undocumented immigrants in new york state  making up more than 5 percent of the labor force in 2016  according to the pew research center  they pay  1 1 billion in state and local taxes each year  the institute on taxation and economic policy estimates almost 250 000 of them live in the suburbs and upstate  where people rely on cars to get to work and school  thats why the governor and legislative leaders have proposed legislation to let undocumented immigrants receive drivers licenses  as a dozen states and the district of columbia do under legislation pending in albany  applicants would no longer be required to show proof they are in the country legally  they could use foreign passports to establish their identity and obtain a standard drivers license  once  of course  they pass the same tests as everyone else though researchers say it is hard to isolate a single factor when studying road safety  law enforcement officials have said that knowing who is on the road is a clear benefit  william bratton  who served as police commissioner in both los angeles and new york  has supported such measures  saying they would reduce the number of hit and runs  increase the number of insured motorists and  by having identification on record  help fight crime and terrorism one 2017 study found hit and run accidents in california decreased by an average of 7 percent to 10 percent after undocumented immigrants were allowed to get drivers licenses  after new mexico approved similar legislation  the percentage of uninsured drivers fell to 9 1 percent in 2011 from 33 percent in 2002 issuing licenses to undocumented immigrants would also bring the state more revenue  the fiscal policy institute estimates new york could see about  26 million in fees for license applications and car registration  and the gasoline tax  opponents say the state should not make it easier for immigrants who are here illegally to work jobs they are not supposed to have  but the bill would reflect reality  undocumented immigrants are already driving on the states roads new york once allowed undocumented residents to drive  but after the sept  11 attacks  gov  george pataki  citing the threat of terrorist infiltration  issued an executive order requiring applicants to prove their legal status before obtaining licenses  in 2007  gov  eliot spitzer tried to restore these rights but backed off in the face of intense political blowback along with mr  cuomo  the assembly speaker  carl heastie  and the senate majority leader  andrea stewart cousins  have signaled support  but ms  stewart cousins may have a tough time persuading democrats from long island  where anti immigrant sentiment can be strong for those who have to work and raise their families in the shadows as they provide cheap labor for contractors  restaurants  farms and factories  a drivers license could change their lives aldo  a 40 year old mexican working illegally in construction and the food industry  lives with his wife and young son on staten islands south shore  far from public transportation  its an area the couple chose because the schools are good and its affordable  but he said driving in the area increases his chances of interacting with law enforcement  he stands out in a neighborhood where most residents are white  and there are few other immigrants  they know you dont have a license  he said of the police  and youre fearful keeping people like aldo fearful doesnt make anyone else safer  giving them the right to have a drivers license makes sense .

on sunday  united states immigration and customs enforcement agents arrested the rapper 21 savage  stunning his fans by declaring that he is a british citizen and has overstayed his visa  the arrest comes just months after the 26 year old musicians latest album  i am   i was  debuted at the top of the billboard 200 and just days after he sang on national television against president trumps policy on family separation  the rapper  who is also up for two grammys this sunday  now faces imminent deportation  within minutes of the announcement of his detention  the internet was flooded with memes making light of the news  and fans who thought he was born in atlanta seemed to believe that he had betrayed them their reactions have demonstrated what i have come to see  in my own experiences as a black son of immigrants  as an ingrained american inability to think about both blackness and immigration simultaneously and through a complex lens  according to ice  21 savage  born sheyaa bin abraham joseph  entered the country legally with his parents in 2005 when he was about 12 years old but remained after his visa expired a year later  his lawyers have said that he came to the united states much earlier  when he was 7  rather than being appalled at the arrest  many responded with wisecracks  as the washington post pop music critic chris richards reported  seemingly stunned by the strangeness of the breaking news  some of the citizens of rap twitter  as he called them  reflexively launched into joke torrents  superimposing 21s face onto images of buckingham palace guards and translating his lyrics into cockney slang  while some prominent musicians have come to his defense  many of the memes about 21 savage imply that despite his having lived in georgia since he was a young boy  his british origin somehow disqualifies him from claiming it as his home  they imply that he is somehow a lesser rapper  that his claim to hip hop and black american culture is now illegitimate  21 not a blood  hes a redcoat  a person commented on twitter  at first glance  these reactions could be viewed simply as harmless jokes  and maybe some just had a hard time conceiving that a rapper could be british  but their dismissiveness hit close to home with me  bringing up my own experiences in which similar attitudes have been all too prevalent  i remember the first time someone told me that i am not black  i was in middle school  a boy who had just found out that my parents were from ethiopia turned to me and said  wait  i thought you were black  i stared blankly  giving no response  nah  bro  youre african  i neither accepted nor denied this  a couple of months later  i was asked the same question  this time i replied  whats the difference  silence  a shrug  i was left not knowing who or what i was  feeling as though i was trying to fulfill a position i was unqualified for i faced this false distinction at home as well  the first time i heard the world black used like it meant something dirty  i was around 9 or 10 years old  this experience is common for children of the african diaspora  it was probably a holiday or someones birthday  and my family was gathered together  the men sat in the living room  their laughs bellowing through the walls  talking about politics  ethiopian and american   each louder than the other  suddenly  the conversation shifted to race  someone announced to a chorus of groans  i am not black  i am african  i am ethiopian  i know where i come from  and then my mothers swift rebuttal  here  our sons are black  whether you like it or not  this country doesnt care  yet again  i was left not knowing what to call myself or who i was  years later  i remember this conversation when i am being followed in a store  being ethiopian does not exempt or shield me from american racism it seems that a narrow view of the word black in an american context is preventing blackness from being allowed to coexist with other identities and racism from being allowed to coexist in conversations with other issues  especially immigration  in the case of 21 savage  the mocking comments also show a lack of full recognition for how often ices policies target black immigrants and how hurtful they can be  an ice spokesman has reportedly said that 21 savages whole public persona is false  through such claims  ice has tried to diminish 21 savages career because of his immigration status and by implying that his experiences as a black man in america  chronicled by much of his music  are invalidated because of his birthplace  21 savage has overstayed his visa  but  as his lawyers have pointed out  this was through no fault of his own  one of his lawyers has said that ice has known about his clients immigration status and his whereabouts since he applied for the visa that would make him legal here  at least a couple of years ago  he also noted that his client is clearly not a danger to the community  and in fact  his contributions to local communities and schools that he grew up in are examples of the type of immigrant we want in america  some have questioned the timing of ices move  given that the rapper had been convicted of felony drug charges in 2014  the conviction was reportedly later expunged   in the legal saga surrounding 21 savage  i found unexpected validation  here is a public figure who is very much black  and also an immigrant  an image that we dont see enough and that i could have used when i was younger and grappling with my identity  its clear to me that 21 savage is an immigrant and a black man  and neither invalidates the other  the foreign heritage of black immigrants like 21 savage as well as first generation children of african immigrants such as myself doesnt counteract their blackness  and vice versa  it is not our responsibility to choose one identity  the inability to recognize both simultaneously has kept some from viewing his case as critically as they should  we as a society should not view race and immigration status as mutually exclusive   although it took the arrest of a prominent black man by one of the most feared government agencies in our nation to get us here  we are now finally starting to have a conversation about the intersection of blackness and immigration .
ciudad jurez  mexico  near dawn on friday  the line of trucks waiting to cross the border from mexico into the united states stretched for more than three miles and wasnt moving arturo ornelas  a mexican truck driver  was four places from the front  but his choice position had not come without sacrifice  he had joined the line at 8 a m  thursday and had spent the intervening 22 hours slouched in  or stretching his legs alongside  his truck  carrying a load of copper wire from a factory in ciudad jurez  mexico  to a warehouse in neighboring el paso but now his goal was finally  seemingly within reach  and he could see the twinkling lights of the american city through the nearby border fence  on the other side of the puente libre  or free bridge so close  he muttered  yet so far president trump may have relented thursday on his threat to close the southwest border of the united states in punishment for what he has said was mexicos failure to control illegal migration  but for a week now the border has  in effect  been partly closed because of american staffing shortages  costing businesses millions of dollars a day  according to industry officials  and causing painfully long delays for people and goods trying to legally cross the border last week  the trump administration announced it was pulling 750 border agents from their normal assignments at specific ports of entry on the border  and reassigning them to help process the surge in migrants who have been crossing the border illegally and seeking asylum the redeployments have caused slowdowns in inspections  for passenger and commercial traffic  at key crossings along the border  including between ciudad jurez and el paso  tijuana  mexico  and san diego  nogales  mexico  and nogales  ariz   and nuevo laredo  mexico  and laredo  tex the delays  which began on march 29  have been particularly severe for trucks delivering commercial goods from mexico to the united states  with long waits fouling up production and delivery schedules on both sides of the border  according to the united states chamber of commerce  nearly  1 7 billion in goods and services flow across the border every day mexican trucking industry officials and other business leaders have reported millions of dollars a day in lost commerce and extra costs associated with the delays  some companies in mexico have been forced to slow or halt production as a result of the delivery delays  they said some firms have even resorted to shipping their products by air despite the significantly higher costs  manuel sotelo  a national vice president of the national chamber of freight transportation in mexico  said friday business and labor leaders have warned that if the delays persist  they could lead to the cancellation of contracts and to widespread layoffs mr  sotelo summed up the impact in one word  catastrophic the hardship has been particularly severe in ciudad jurez  a border city and major industrial center with more than 300 assembly plants covering a range of industries  including auto parts  cellphones  computers and household electronics in danger  280 000 factory jobs  the front page headline of el diario  a newspaper in the city  announced on friday in a letter to president andrs manuel lpez obrador of mexico on friday  the ciudad jurez chapter of the business coordinating council estimated that late deliveries would cost mexican firms  2 1 million in overtime per day the council also estimated that delays for trucks crossing from ciudad jurez to el paso had stretched to eight hours on average  but many truckers were reporting far longer waits mr  sotelo  who owns a trucking company  said that on wednesday he dispatched 15 tractor trailers to one of the crossings between ciudad jurez and el paso  when they arrived  at about 3 30 a m   there were already 200 other trucks in line  twelve of his trucks were able to cross  barely making the cutoff at 11 p m  when the crossing closed for the night  the other three had to wait until the following day under normal circumstances  he said  a truck can cross the border here within two hours business leaders said the only other border crisis that approached this one in severity was provoked by the sept  11 terrorist attacks  after that  we had waits of up to six hours during the following days  mr  sotelo said  today we are three times worse luis aguirre lang  president of index  a national manufacturing and export industry group  accused mr  trump of taking the mexican and american private sectors hostage to put political pressure on mexico  we are worried  he said the trump administration has characterized its redeployment of agents as a necessary step in dealing with an urgent crisis  especially in the region around ciudad jurez and el paso  which has been in the vortex of the illegal migration debate the united states border patrols el paso sector  which covers a 268 mile stretch of border through the two westernmost counties of texas  including el paso  and new mexico  has seen a huge surge in unauthorized migrants trying to cross this cause  and the resulting effects  came into sharp focus shortly after dawn on friday for hctor nez  a driver with a mexican trucking company he and his rig were in the middle of the three mile line of trucks waiting to cross the free bridge into el paso  he was killing time with a colleague outside their trucks  parked along a highway that runs along the rio grande  when suddenly they noticed something unfolding on the other side of the river  along the border fence at a gap in the fence  more than two dozen migrants were sitting in a row in the dirt  with several border patrol officials standing over them  in recent weeks  undocumented migrants  often seeking asylum in the united states  have waded across the river  barely a trickle of septic water in this location  and presented themselves to the american authorities permanently guarding the gap mr  nez  54  understood that this sort of unauthorized crossing between legal ports of entry was precisely what was contributing to the extraordinary delays he was enduring this week but he doled out his criticisms widely  he blamed mr  trump for choking us with his brand of politics  he blamed his own president  mr  lpez obrador  for not doing enough to halt illegal migration through mexico and he blamed the migrants for using mexico as a trampoline to the united states  illustrating his remark with a bunny hop but he also said he could empathize with the migrants  its a dream that everyone has  he said mr  nez gestured toward el paso  my dream is one day to have a tractor trailer on that side  he said  some day i want to arrive in the united states and say  im an american truck driver  thats my dream .

kellyanne conway  white house adviser  recently dismissed as a silly semantic argument questions about president trumps use of the word wall  is it concrete  steel  see through  a smart wall  slatted  piked  solar powered  a chain link fence or just a metaphor the semantics  however  are anything but trivial  if the white house and house democrats are to reach a deal to avert another government shutdown by the feb  15 deadline  they must first reach a rough dtente over what they are talking about  in particular  the definition of mr  trumps wall  and of border security  the democrats catchall description of their own approach theres no magic glossary telling you the difference between a fence and wall or a barrier  they are kind of interchangeable  said jeh johnson  who served as president barack obamas homeland security secretary from 2013 to 2017  there is a distinction between governing and political rhetoric  and people should not get trapped in the binary  mr  johnson said  the moment when we reach a compromise on the vocabulary is the moment we reach a compromise on the policy here is a glossary that could determine the fate of the debate in the beginning  there was a tweet  at 4 34 p m  aug  5  2014  mr  trump sent a message  secure the border  build the wall mr  trumps definition of wall has been a moving target since in the early days of the 2016 campaign  mr  trump said the wall should be built of precast concrete with no windows  no nothing  he now says that he always meant that steel and see through materials could work  too  and has  from time to time  mused about festooning the wall with solar panels  in december  he tweeted an image showing a puzzling rendering of a picketed steel slat barrier soon after taking office  the president commissioned eight prototypes of wall designs  four made of concrete and the remainder fabricated from steel and other materials  they ranged in height from 18 to 30 feet  the models were tested last year  and the results were inconclusive  according to leaked documents showing that all of them could be breached with a determined effort and the right tools  but trump administration officials say that the testing provided them with valuable information  and lessons learned were incorporated into an already built section of slatted 30 foot high bollard fence near calexico  calif as mr  trumps image of the wall changed  so did its price tag  he now wants  5 7 billion for the wall  but that number has bounced between  4 billion and  20 billion over the past three years  during the shutdown fight  he even suggested that he would accept an unspecified down payment  ms  nielsen  the homeland security secretary  was roundly mocked for dropping the the before wall  with critics likening it to the i love lamp scene from anchorman  in reality  ms  nielsen was trying to keep her request as vague as possible to facilitate a compromise  while staying nominally true to mr  trumps campaign promise she was lampooned  mr  johnson said  but she was really just trying to introduce the concept that a wall could be almost any kind of a barrier the fact that ms  nielsen felt compelled to use the w word indicated her concern about alienating members of mr  trumps base  who roar build the wall at his rallies  to that end  members of the presidents team have been quietly removing the word replacement from public statements about upgrades to existing border barriers  they instead insert the word new  according to an official familiar with the practice as part of the failed 2014 gang of eight effort to overhaul the nations immigration system  a coalition of senate democrats supported a  46 billion bill to expand the border patrol  with improvements to existing fencing  the bill was shot down by house republicans because it included a process that would have allowed many immigrants who entered the country illegally to remain in the country but the bill now stands as evidence to mr  trump and congressional republicans of how democrats in previous years voted to increase funding for barriers under the broad rubric of border security  when packaged with a path to citizenship  but mr  trumps political weaponization of the wall is now making such a compromise increasingly untenable for democrats  were not doing a wall  speaker nancy pelosi told reporters this month  does anyone have any doubt that were not doing a wall  the 2020 presidential campaign is making compromise even more difficult  senator kamala harris  democrat of california  who announced this week that she is running for president  declared the wall a medieval vanity project  then vowed to make opposition to it a centerpiece of her campaign the wall concept is an anathema to most democrats  said geoff garin  a veteran democratic pollster who works for priorities usa  a political action committee  they are more than willing to have a granular conversation about what is common sense and effective border security  but its not going to be a conversation about a wall in any sense that trump has used the word the word fence is  for the moment at least  less politically charged than wall  in 2006  a coalition of republicans and 90 democrats in the house and the senate  including mr  obama and mrs  clinton  then senators  passed president george w  bushs plan to add more than 700 new miles of double layered reinforced fencing  i am comfortable with barriers that involve vehicles  fences  senator jeff merkley  democrat of oregon  told cnn this week but what exactly is meant by fence  the southern border is already a crazy quilt of different border barriers of different sizes  different materials  installed in different eras  known  by and large  as fencing and they have different uses  urban chain link is meant to deter migrants on foot  an array of metal and concrete vehicle barriers have been strung in remote areas  and stretches of concertina wire are used to fill in gaps where there are no permanent structures and on top of structures where there are some  there are also dozens of variants  pickets  corrugated panels  berms  x shaped steel barriers  even planked walls placed along gulf coast beaches  in recent budget bills  democrats have insisted on a provision limiting the expansion of barriers to existing technologies  a move intended to frame any new construction as an old fence rather than a new wall  according to a senior democratic congressional aide back in 2006  ms  pelosi and other congressional liberals voted against the reinforced fencing bill  it is not clear they would support a similar measure even if it were part of a more extensive deal that included a reprieve for the young undocumented immigrants in the deferred action for childhood arrivals program  also known as daca senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  was one of those who supported the 2006 bill  and late last year offered mr  trump a  25 billion deal that included protections for daca recipients  and left open the possibility of more fencing  ms  pelosi did not agree to the proposal mr  trumps  5 7 billion request would pay for the installation of barriers on another 215 miles of border  in addition to an estimated 654 miles of fencing  much of it in the form of vehicle barriers  currently in place along the 1 900 mile border  that number would include installation of about 100 miles of barriers to keep out migrants  many from central america  seeking to enter the country on foot in the rio grande valley in texas  before the shutdown  republican senators  led by john cornyn of texas  proposed passing  1 6 billion in funding for 65 miles of that project the idea went nowhere at the time  but a handful of congressional democrats  including senator jon tester of montana  did not rule out supporting the plan in the future the walls we are building are not medieval walls  mr  trump said on jan  25 during his rambling rose garden announcement of the three week funding deal that ended the 35 day government shutdown  these barriers are made of steel  have see through visibility  which is very important  and are equipped with sensors  monitors and cutting edge technology  including state of the art drones  he told reporters it seems like an unlikely gateway to compromise  but some democrats believe the president was signaling his willingness to accept funding for new technologies  beyond steel and concrete two days earlier  representative james e  clyburn of south carolina  the third ranking democrat in the house  told reporters that he would be open to fulfilling mr  trumps  5 7 billion request if it were spent on a smart wall  targeted at improving border surveillance  the expanded use of drones and x ray technology to screen for weapons and drugs  as well as on the hiring of more border patrol agents mr  trump  aides said  is open to spending some of the money on similar improvements  his idea of a smart wall was inspired by the one built by israel on its border with gaza  which uses high tech surveillance equipment  including closed circuit cameras mr  trumps language has softened as the funding fight has intensified  and barrier now enjoys pride of place next to wall if the committee of republicans and democrats now meeting on border security is not discussing or contemplating a wall or physical barrier  they are wasting their time  he tweeted on wednesday a day later  he was back to wall only  lets just call them walls from now on and stop playing political games  a wall is a wall  he tweeted on thursday whether mr  trump was providing semantic cover for a compromise deal may depend on whether he is disciplined enough to tone down his messaging  his allies seem eager for him to do so it doesnt have to be a wall  representative kevin mccarthy  republican of california and the minority leader  told reporters on tuesday  physical barriers would be fine .
is the border wall ethical  president trump has suggested the wall is moral and those who oppose it immoral  his critics claim the opposite  to answer this  we have to consider its effect on humans  what harm could a border wall cause to immigrants and refugees  all of whom are equal to us in the eyes of god  some people who cross the border are in desperate search of work to support their families  a wall would probably drive them into more remote areas of the desert or mountains  possibly to their deaths  as the forces driving them  violence  persecution and extreme poverty  are more life threatening than a risky border crossing  in fact  close to 8 000 migrants have died in arizona and parts of texas since the construction of the san diego and el paso sectors of the wall in the mid 1990s the latest arrivals at our border are primarily asylum seekers from the northern triangle of central america  who  when they cross the border and ask for protection  are in compliance with both our domestic and our international laws  the refugee act of 1980 and the 1951 united nations refugee convention and its 1967 protocols a wall would prevent asylum seekers from asking for protection at any point along our border  their right under the law  and would leave many of them at the mercy of drug cartels and other criminal groups in northern mexico  more humane ways to achieve border security can be found to avoid these harmful consequences  through technology  additional legal avenues for entry and policies that address the factors pushing migration  you must also look at the intent of someone who wants to construct a wall in order to determine its morality  in this case  it is clear that mr  trump wants to deny entry to anyone crossing the southern border  even those who have a right to cross and seek protection and are no threat to us  the administration has just instituted a policy known as remain in mexico  which requires asylum seekers to stay in that country until their hearings  a process that could keep them vulnerable to organized crime for months or years mr  trump is not acting with concern for the impact of the wall on their lives  including those of children  who would remain subject to danger  he also ignores the adverse impact of the wall on the environment  landowners and border communities  like the harm it can cause to wildlife and vegetation  the livelihoods of ranchers and farmers and cross border commerce other policies his administration has pursued  including family separation  the rollback of asylum laws  family detention  the elimination of the deferred action for childhood arrivals program and termination of temporary protected status for most of its beneficiaries  show that the administrations intent is to rid the united states of as many immigrants  legal or otherwise  as possible the way in which mr  trump has argued for a wall also is instructive  in trying to secure funding  he has cast all immigrants as criminals and threats to national security by spreading misleading and inaccurate information about them  his justification for the wall is based upon lies and smears against the vast majority of immigrants who are law abiding and moral  but whom he paints as less than human the president likes to highlight violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrants  for example  but fails to point out that immigrants commit crimes  including violent ones  at a much lower rate than citizens  all americans grieve the harm caused when a violent crime is committed  that does not mean they agree that a border wall is the most effective way to prevent it  a wall itself is not immoral  but it can be constructed for an immoral purpose  president john f  kennedy and president ronald reagan both resisted the berlin wall  which prevented millions in the soviet bloc from seeking freedom in the west  it eventually came down immigration reform that is humane and honors our nations values must finally be enacted  and the root causes of global migration addressed  this is the moral direction in which the president should lead the nation .

julin castro  the former housing secretary and former mayor of san antonio  announced on saturday that he would run for president  one of the most high profile latino democrats ever to seek the partys nomination his first campaign stop will be in puerto rico  where he will speak on monday at the latino victory funds annual summit and meet with residents still struggling to recover from hurricane maria  later in the week  his campaign said  he will go to new hampshire when my grandmother got here almost a hundred years ago  mr  castro said at the plaza guadalupe amphitheater in san antonio  in the neighborhood where he was raised  im sure that she never could have imagined that just two generations later  one of her grandsons would be serving as a member of the united states congress and the other would be standing with you here today to say these words  i am a candidate for president of the united states of america mr  castros announcement had been expected for several weeks  he established an exploratory committee in december  two months after publishing a memoir  an unlikely journey  a familiar path for presidential candidates who want to play up their life stories and qualifications and  perhaps  get ahead of their biggest vulnerabilities  this month he also visited two of the early caucus and primary states  iowa and nevada he joins senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts  representative tulsi gabbard of hawaii  former state senator richard ojeda of west virginia and former representative john delaney of maryland on the list of democrats who have said definitively that they will seek for the partys 2020 nomination  that list is expected to grow considerably in the coming weeks and months in his speech on saturday  mr  castro emphasized education  calling for a national version of the prekindergarten program he established in san antonio when he was mayor  to fund the program there  he increased the citys sales tax  a politically risky proposition  especially in texas  but san antonio voters approved it his message was firmly progressive  he called for a higher minimum wage  denounced police killings of african americans  which he described as state violence  and embraced the black lives matter movement  he also condemned president trumps immigration policy  including the practice of family separation and the proposed border wall  and declared that his first executive order if elected would be to rejoin the paris climate accords  which mr  trump left george rodriguez  a conservative blogger  talk show host and fox news contributor whom texas republican leaders designated as their spokesman on the announcement  said after the speech that the discussion of immigration had stood out to him  mr  castro  he said  did not seem to be able to distinguish between legal and illegal immigration mr  rodriguez also argued that the san antonio pre k program  which was one of mr  castros chief accomplishments as mayor  had duplicated existing programs like head start  how much of an accomplishment that is is rather dubious  he said  read about what mr  castro and the other early entrants will be doing in the early days of the 2020 campaign  mr  castro  44  was raised in san antonio in a politically active family  his mother  rosie castro  was an activist with the mexican american political party la raza unida and frequently took julin and his twin brother  joaquin  now a congressman  to rallies and meetings  joaquin castro will be the chairman of julins campaign at the age of 26  mr  castro became san antonios youngest city council member  and after one unsuccessful campaign for mayor in 2005  he was elected to the citys top job in 2009  in 2012  he delivered the keynote address at the democratic national convention  the same platform that catapulted barack obama  then a little known state senator  to national prominence in 2004  mr  obama  as president  later chose him to lead the department of housing and urban development in a statement on saturday  the republican national committee previewed one of the main arguments it is likely to use against mr  castro  calling him a lightweight without the experience needed to be president mr  castro has brushed off concerns that he is not as experienced or as well known as many of the other likely candidates in my whole life  i dont think ive ever started out as the front runner  he told the new york times last month  i grew up in a neighborhood where nobody growing up there was the front runner at anything  so im not going to concern myself with who people think of as the front runner and who they dont among the democrats frequently mentioned as 2020 contenders  he is one of the youngest  if elected  he would be the third youngest person ever to become president  after theodore roosevelt  42  and john f  kennedy  43  the full field of candidates could include former vice president joseph r  biden jr   senators cory booker of new jersey  kirsten gillibrand of new york  kamala harris of california  amy klobuchar of minnesota and bernie sanders of vermont  and former representative beto orourke of texas  who ran a high profile but unsuccessful campaign against senator ted cruz last year surrounded by his supporters after the speech  mr  castro was asked whether he expected to face a fellow texan  mr  orourke  in the race  there will probably be 15 or 20 people in the race  so its going to be crowded  he said .
 read the latest edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  marco a  de la garza jr  spent nearly six years as a federal officer with customs and border protection  working on the front lines of americas southern border in arizona and doing his best to keep undocumented immigrants out of the united states a navy veteran  he was known for going the extra mile  one day  while off duty  he rushed out of a barbecue at his in laws house in sierra vista  ariz   when he spotted an undocumented man being chased by the border patrol  he tackled the runner and held him until the agents caught up few knew mr  de la garzas secret  he was undocumented  too the nations main border protection agency had hired an unauthorized immigrant to police the border  one of at least four cases of undocumented workers revealed to be working at federal immigration agencies in recent years mr  de la garza  38  was born in mexico  and had lied about his citizenship status and supplied his employer with a fraudulent texas birth certificate that falsely said he was born in brownsville  tex in retrospect  i fully understand now that i was being selfish in my desire to serve my country that i had so loved  he wrote after he was indicted by a federal grand jury on three counts of passport fraud and making false statements on his application for a federal law enforcement background check mr  de la garza agreed to plead guilty to one count of passport fraud  and the other two counts were dropped  on thursday he was sentenced in federal district court in tucson to one year of probation and a  1 000 fine  judge raner c  collins said his service to the country ought to count for something before the brief hearing  mr  de la garza was surrounded by friends and relatives  including his two daughters  aged 2 and 4  who are united states citizens  he stood quietly before the judge dressed in a black suit the trump administration has pushed employers to stop hiring undocumented workers  urging the use of electronic verification tools and document checks and conducting hundreds of workplace raids to arrest and deport unauthorized immigrants  the fact that one was working in its own federal ranks shows the difficulty of ascertaining work status in a nation where the labor of immigrants is considered crucial in many industries  there are an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country federal authorities also must field a work force that by design reflects the heavily hispanic communities across the southwest they are expected to police  agents sometimes have relatives  friends and neighbors whom they know or suspect are undocumented  in south texas  one of the most heavily traveled migrant corridors in the country  border patrol agents or their spouses have sometimes hired undocumented housekeepers  as do many of their neighbors mr  de la garzas deception was unusual for customs and border protection  the largest law enforcement agency in the country  with nearly twice the staff of the f b i  yet it was not unprecedented  there have been at least three other cases of undocumented people working as customs officers or border patrol agents who were prosecuted in federal court in recent years one of those cases involved oscar antonio ortiz  a border patrol agent in the san diego area  who first applied for work in the weeks after the terror attacks of sept  11  2001  like mr  de la garza  mr  ortiz was a mexican citizen with a fraudulent birth certificate who had also served in the navy  but once he was hired by border patrol  mr  ortiz got involved  along with another agent  in human smuggling  transporting migrants for money into the united states  sometimes in their border patrol vehicles  according to court documents  mr  ortiz  who had been assigned to the border patrol station in el cajon  calif   was sentenced in 2006 to five years in prison mr  ortiz was later deported and now lives in mexico  his lawyer  stephen p  white  said his client had believed  like mr  de la garza  that he was born in the united states  based on what his parents told him and the fraudulent birth certificate they had provided him he got security clearances  background checks multiple times and was as surprised as anybody else to find out that he wasnt a u s  citizen when he got arrested on the alien smuggling charge  mr  white said mr  de la garza worked at the port of entry in douglas  ariz   about 120 miles southeast of tucson  he lived with his wife and children about 40 miles west of douglas in the town of hereford  and appeared to relish his job  filling his home with mugs  clocks and other trinkets bearing customs or navy logos  he was born in matamoros  mexico  and lived for most of his childhood in mexico with his mother  moving to the south texas city of brownsville as a teenager  in 2003  at the age of 23  he enlisted in the navy and served on the u s s  greeneville  a nuclear submarine  he received an honorable discharge in 2008  and went to work for customs and border protection in 2012  earning a spot as a squad leader at the agencys basic training academy in georgia the authorities appeared to first learn that mr  de la garza was actually a mexican citizen around the time he applied for a united states passport in 2017 mr  de la garza wrote in a letter he submitted to judge collins that he had believed in his youth that he was american growing up  my parents told me that i was a u s  citizen  and my whole childhood i was led to believe this was true  he wrote  because of that  i grew up thinking i would do my duty one day and join the u s  military both of his parents tried to discourage that idea  and when  as a teenager in mexico  he asked for his birth certificate  he was told the truth  his mother  he wrote  told me that i had been lied to my whole life and i was and had been all along  a mexican citizen  i refused to believe that to be the truth  and still came to america with my u s  birth certificate that she had given me the birth certificate was a legitimate government issued document that was based on fraudulent information  prosecutors said that it listed brownsville as his place of birth in december 1980  in reality  he was born in mexico in october 1980 the midwife listed on the texas birth record was convicted in 1984 of conspiracy to make false statements on birth certificates  prosecutors said nonetheless  mr  de la garza used that birth certificate to claim american citizenship  including for his five year background check for customs and border protection in october 2016 and on his passport application in october 2017 citing his lack of any criminal history  federal probation officials recommended to the court that he serve one year of probation with no prison time  mr  de la garza told the judge in his letter that he hoped to one day legalize his immigration status  and his lawyer  matthew h  green  said that under the immigration and nationality act  he was eligible as a veteran to apply for citizenship one year after the date of his criminal conviction but it remains unclear whether mr  de la garza will be allowed to remain in the united states  he faces the possibility of being deported  but mr  green said that he had been told that immigration and customs enforcement officials decided against removal proceedings thats what we have to look forward to at this point  applying for naturalization in a year  he said in a letter to the court  mr  green said his client had one hope  mr  de la garza and his family ask only one thing from the united states  they ask for a second chance .
washington  democratic congressional leaders called on president trump on tuesday to reopen the federal government while they resolve differences with him over securing the southern border  in a formal response to his prime time address from the oval office that they dismissed as riddled with misinformation and fear mongering the president has chosen fear  we want to start with the facts  said speaker nancy pelosi of california  speaking from her office at the capitol beside senator chuck schumer of new york  the minority leader  as they delivered a joint response to the president she said mr  trump had rejected bipartisan legislation to reopen the government over his obsession with forcing american taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective wall  a wall he always promised mexico would pay for mr  schumer suggested that the presidents formal address to the nation  mr  trumps first from the oval office  had been a stunt  this president just used the backdrop of the oval office to manufacture a crisis  stoke fear and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration  he said the dueling speeches from opposite sides of pennsylvania avenue unfolded at the close of day 18 of a government shutdown over mr  trumps demand for  5 7 billion for a border wall that democrats have steadfastly opposed the democratic leaders decision to select themselves as the message bearers to counter the president underscores how a partisan power struggle in a new era of divided government is undergirding the discussions over resolving the shutdown  even as the paychecks of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and benefits for millions of americans hang in the balance mr  trump  who spent much of the first two weeks of the shutdown cloistered inside the white house saying little about it  is now using the powers of the presidency to focus public attention on his ominous immigration message in an effort to build support for the idea of erecting a large wall on the border with mexico  democrats  newly in control of the house  are steering clear of talk of the wall itself  and are instead working to focus attention on the damaging impacts of the shutdown we dont govern by temper tantrum  mr  schumer said  no president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down  hurting millions of americans who are treated as leverage appealing to mr  trump directly  he added  mr  president  reopen the government and we can work to resolve our differences over border security  but end this shutdown now senator bernie sanders  independent of vermont  who ran unsuccessfully for the democratic presidential nomination in 2016  used a response to the president he streamed live on youtube to brand mr  trump a liar  and ticked down a list of misstatements the president uttered during his address it gives me no pleasure to tell you what most of you already know  and that is that president trump lies all of the time  and in remarks tonight and in recent weeks regarding immigration and the wall  he continues to lie  mr  sanders said he went on to discuss the plight of millions of americans who lack health insurance  elderly people who have no retirement savings  millions more with crippling student debt and the specter of global climate change  arguing that those challenges were far more pressing than the one posed by illegal immigration we dont need to create artificial crises  mr  sanders said  we have enough real crises mr  trump is planning a trip to the border in mcallen  tex   on thursday  while democrats plan to bring up a succession of bills this week to reopen shuttered parts of the government  including the internal revenue service  to allow tax refunds to be paid  and the agriculture department  to ensure that food assistance and farmer support payments can be made the treasury department and the i r s  will come first  then agriculture and interior department programs  including the national parks  on thursday  followed by transportation and housing programs on friday we are going to  daily  urge and take efforts to open up the government  said representative steny h  hoyer of maryland  the majority leader  whatever problems confront us  they are exacerbated  not relieved  by shutting down government a group of senate democrats spent tuesday evening taking turns on the senate floor calling on senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  to bring up the house passed legislation to reopen the government  the dozen democrats  led by senator tim kaine of virginia and senator jeanne shaheen of new hampshire  plan to spotlight the harm from the shutdown on federal workers and those who benefit from government programs rather than donald trump putting on a political show tonight on tv and a political trip to the border tomorrow  i invite the president to come anywhere in virginia  maryland or the district and sit down with federal employees and explain this crisis and why they are not getting paid  said senator mark warner  democrat of virginia  we need to negotiate additional border security  i am all for it  but not holding hostage  literally  our federal employees and countless others in the house  the shutdown has proved a unifying issue for newly elected democrats who campaigned as fierce opponents of mr  trump  in a brief but scathing speech from the house floor  representative ayanna pressley  democrat of massachusetts  spoke directly to the president  uttering his name and earning a gentle reprimand from the presiding officer  who reminded her that lawmakers are barred from personally impugning the president or other elected officials you devalue the life of the immigrant  the worker and the survivor  ms  pressley said  this has nothing to do with border security  your shutdown  another trump generated crisis  has brought a tsunami of hurt to the american people .
starting as early as 2005  politicians have claimed to have discovered discarded prayer rugs  and perhaps even qurans or a lot of stuff written in arabic  at the southern border  hinting without evidence that islamic migrants were entering the united states through mexico and could pose a terrorism threat  mr  trumps tweet revived this long running and still unproved rumor  he was citing an interview in the washington examiner  a conservative newspaper  with one anonymous female rancher who lives on the border ive never seen any middle easterners  ive seen prayer rugs out here  but ive never seen any myself  the woman  whose face is obscured  said in a videotaped interview asma afsaruddin  a professor of islamic studies at indiana university  said that prayer rugs were meant to be kept clean and doubted that they would be deserted by practicing muslims standing in a clean place is a requirement of islamic prayer  she said  many of these rugs have images of the kaaba in mecca and other religious symbols on them  for all these reasons  they would not be just casually tossed around or carelessly discarded to be desecrated by others  the rancher also told the examiner that she had heard from border patrol agents that migration from countries other than mexico has really increased in the last couple years  but drastically even in the last six months  chinese  germans  russians  a lot of middle easterners  she continued  those czechoslovakians they caught over on our neighbor this last summer czechoslovakia split into two countries in 1993  of the more than 300 000 people apprehended at the southern border in the 2017 fiscal year  fewer than one half of 1 percent were from the countries the rancher listed  1 364 from china  two from germany  eight from russia  61 from countries the state department deems the middle east  one from the czech republic and one from slovakia  theres a lot of people coming in from not just from mexico  the rancher added  people  the general public  just dont get the terrorist facts of that  that claim echoes earlier ones from mr  trump  baseless warnings that unknown middle easterners had infiltrated a migrant caravan and that terrorists were pouring across the southern border nowhere in the white houses 25 page counterterrorism policy  released in october  was the threat of terrorists infiltrating the nations southwest border raised  and the state department  in a september report  said there was no credible evidence that terrorist groups had sent operatives to enter the united states through mexico the department of homeland security did not respond to requests for evidence of mr  trumps claims  the washington examiner report  like most of its predecessors over the past decade  did not include any photographic evidence of the prayer rugs in question and largely relied on hearsay  along the mexican border there have been stories of suspicious items picked up by local residents  including muslim prayer rugs and notebooks written in both arabic and spanish  former senator kay bailey hutchison  republican of texas  warned in a march 2005 speech later that year  former representative tom tancredo  republican of colorado  told cbs that  during a visit to the border in arizona  weve found copies of the quran  we have found prayer rugs  we have found a lot of stuff written in arabic  so its not just people from mexico coming across that border in 2014  david dewhurst  then the lieutenant governor of texas  invoked prayer rugs found on the texas side of the border in the brush  politifact texas rated his claim pants on fire  and noted that it could find only one photo of a purported prayer rug  presented by the conservative news outlet breitbart  that photo  eight scholars and religious figures said  looked nothing like a prayer rug  and it appears to have been removed from the current version of the breitbart article   perhaps  suggested gawker  the photo was actually of an adidas soccer jersey  in 2015  the right wing outlet judicial watch reported  based on unnamed sources  that muslim prayer rugs were recovered at an islamic state training camp eight miles away from the united states mexico border  federal and local officials in the united states and mexico denied those claims these persistent rumors promote the message that muslims inherently constitute a menace and danger to our safety  professor afsaruddin said  remember sinbad and his flying rug in the arabian nights  maybe that is what they are remembering  after all  the arabian nights prove that this is how arabs and muslims get around  talk about enduring stereotypes from the world of fantasy  the most recent news reports about prayer rugs on the southern border surfaced last summer  describing a scene in the fictional action film sicario  day of the soldado curious about the accuracy of a claim  email factcheck nytimes com .
london  in an apparent effort to bolster his case for a wall along the mexican border  president trump pointed on wednesday to examples of walls going up around the world  especially barriers built in europe  as proof that they work heres an assessment of those claims while governments around the world have built or planned to build 77 walls  about seven such barriers are not expected to materialize anytime soon  said elisabeth vallet  a researcher at the university of quebec in montreal who keeps a tally of such construction  seventy walls is closer to the truth  she said  europe has built about 1 000 kilometers  or just over 620 miles  of walls since 2015  ms  vallet said  the white house did not respond to questions about the source of the numbers the president cited in his tweet  some observers on social media speculated that he had been watching a report on fox business that examined the issue the night before what mr  trump may think of as a big  beautiful wall  whether made of concrete or steel slats  would not fit the definition in europe  most of the walls he referred to on the continent are  in fact  different styles of fences with masonry foundations  and not all of them were designed with migration in mind  countries like austria  bulgaria  greece  hungary and slovenia have built walls since 2015 to quell the flow of migrants arriving mainly from the middle east via the balkan route  but ukraine and the baltic states that share borders with russia have started raising barriers to mark their territories in response to perceived threats of invasion from their larger neighbor  almost a third of the walls in the world are designed to keep the neighbor out  ms  vallet said  much like the desert terrain along the united states border with mexico  the perilous seas  not walls  have been the main obstacle for people trying to get to europe  the continent has gone beyond building walls to impede the arrival of undocumented migrants  frontex  the european unions border agency  and national governments raised a security apparatus that is often referred to as fortress europe it includes naval patrols and surveillance on the mediterranean  where most migrants try to cross into europe  european governments work with countries like libya  morocco and turkey to try to deter migrants from attempting deadly sea crossings  last year  an estimated 150 000 illegal crossings were detected on the external borders of the european union  according to frontex   the same person may attempt the crossing and be counted in different locations   this was 25 percent less than in 2017  and the lowest level in five years still  far right politicians like prime minister viktor orban of hungary have promoted the specter of an impending migration crisis  accompanied by xenophobic rhetoric  to justify funds for border protection   read more about whether europe is still facing a migration crisis  the boosting and militarization of border security has led to a higher death toll for forcibly displaced persons  according to a report released in may by the transnational institute  a research and advocacy institute in another report on border walls  researchers at the institute looked at maritime barriers in the mediterranean and considered them as significant or more significant than land barriers on the european continent  walls have worked for politicians who used them as a means to mobilize supporters  but not to deal with the problem of migration  nick buxton  a researcher with the institute  said by phone  you can build more and more walls until youre a completely walled society  but all youre doing is making it more and more dangerous  he said  people will find ways to cross walls  the fence around the entrance of the tunnel providing the only land access to britain from continental europe has failed to deter illegal crossings  last year  about 500 migrants  10 times as many as in 2017  attempted to cross the perilous waters of the english channel from france  more than half completed the journey reports of smugglers operating around most of these points of access suggest to researchers that walls alone cannot solve the problem  every time you have a border fence and no public policy that is dealing with the root problem  it is as if you were inviting organized crime to the table  ms  vallet said  ms  vallet said she could not think of historical examples of walls that work  she noted that both the great wall of china and the maginot line in france  each built at great expense  ultimately failed to stop invaders  .
santa rosa de copan  honduras  hundreds of hondurans traveling in vehicles and on foot converged on the guatemalan border on tuesday  part of a new migrant caravan bound for the united states which president trump has already used as fresh ammunition in his fight for border wall funding the caravan began departing from the northern honduran city of san pedro sula on monday night  others set off throughout the day on tuesday  honduran authorities estimated that between 800 and 1 000 people were in the caravan  while officials from honduras national human rights commission put the range between 1 500 and 2 000 mr  trump  whose dispute with congress over his demand for  5 7 billion for a border wall between mexico and the united states has led to a partial shutdown of the federal government since dec  22  warned on twitter on tuesday about the new mass migration a big new caravan is heading up to our southern border from honduras  he wrote  only a wall  or steel barrier  will keep our country safe  stop playing political games and end the shutdown the new caravan is following in the footsteps of several other large migrant groups that left central america last fall and crossed guatemala and mexico  with thousands of participants ending up in or near the city of tijuana in northern mexico the trump administration has excoriated central american and mexican governments for failing to stop the caravans  which met little resistance at the various international borders they crossed on the way north in a show of muscle on tuesday  however  the honduran government vowed vigilance at its border with guatemala and said it had detained 60 minors without proper travel documents to leave honduras the border and the illegal crossings are reinforced  julin pacheco  the honduran security minister  told reporters on tuesday  if people are going to leave  they have to leave through legal  authorized points the mexican government has also vowed to harden its southern border to block the passage of any undocumented migrants in the latest caravan  olga snchez  the countrys interior minister  said that officials had identified about 370 illegal points of entry along its border with guatemala and planned to monitor them to prevent illegal crossings tens of thousands of hondurans and other central americans have migrated north in recent years  fleeing rampant violence and poverty  some have chosen to move in large  semi coordinated groups or caravans  offering participants a degree of security against the many perils that lurk on the migrant trail  including muggings  extortion and rape until last year  most caravans went largely unnoticed  but a migration that began in southern mexico last spring drew the attention of mr  trump  who warned that the group posed a threat to the united states sovereignty an even larger group set off from honduras in october  drawing the ire of mr  trump as well as international media attention  it was followed by other groups and by mid november  more than 6 000 migrants  nearly all from central america  had made it as far as tijuana hundreds of them have applied for asylum in the united states while others have tried to cross the border illegally  still others have decided to remain in mexico  availing themselves of the mexican governments offer of humanitarian visas and work permits  hundreds more  frustrated with their inability to cross legally into the united states  have been voluntarily repatriated to their homes in central america but neither the dashed hopes of so many from last years caravans nor mr  trumps threats seemed to discourage many of the participants in the latest caravan even though a wall is being built  thats not going to stop us  said junior aleman  17  who was walking with a group of about a dozen migrants through the mountains of western honduras on tuesday  the group had left san pedro sula on monday night and  through a combination of walking and hitching rides  were making their way toward the honduras guatemala border crossing at agua caliente he intended to try to cross illegally into the united states and head for virginia  where two of his aunts lived  there  he said  he planned to find a job  something that had been hard to come by in honduras theres no work and i want to help my family  he said .
offering traditional mexican food and social justice conversations  la morada in the south bronx is equal parts restaurant and refuge  run by an immigrant family from oaxaca  it is home to both fresh tostadas and a community book exchange the purple walls are adorned with posters denouncing deportations and neighborhood childrens art projects  and one member of the family once spent two weeks in an arizona immigration jail  by choice  as a form of political protest but on friday  an altercation between one of la moradas owners and police officers turned the haven into a hostile flash point  fracturing an often strained relationship between police officers in the 40th precinct and the community they serve in the south bronx the interaction resulted in the arrest of yajaira saavedra  a daughter of natalia mendez and antonio saavedra  who opened the restaurant in 2009  police also attempted to arrest her younger sister  carolina  25  but after carolina started showing signs of a panic attack  police did not carry out the arrest  according to the saavedra family a few hours later ms  saavedra  30  was released and her arrest voided after police determined she had not committed a crime as an undocumented immigrant  we are always on our toes when it comes to immigration raids and police raids   said ms  saavedra  who is a recipient of daca  or deferred action for childhood arrivals  the obama era program that protects undocumented immigrants who came to the united states as children  they both create terror accounts of the incident depict an ill fated encounter between police in the midst of a sting operation that ended with an officers safety in jeopardy and a community with deep seated distrust of all police activity la morada is situated in a part of new york city where homicides  fueled by entrenched poverty and rival criminal crews fighting over turf  stubbornly persist whereas some police precincts in new york now regularly experience no killings in a given year  the 40th precinct in the bronx  made up of the melrose  mott haven  and port morris neighborhoods  logged 14 in 2016  six in 2017  and eight last year to crack down on crime  officers in the 40th precinct are active in the area but have tried to limit negative interactions with residents to maintain public trust  according to the police there has been a significant decrease in the number of interactions with the public while crime has continued to decrease  according to lt  john grimpel  an nypd spokesman  we continue to correct conditions while at the same time using discretion and precision after the community fallout from ms  saavedras arrest  the 40th precincts community affairs unit said they were doing outreach to explain what happened and hear community members concerns  but that outreach does not always attract the community buy in the unit needs to change residents negative perception of the police we put ourselves out there  we make ourselves available to the public  but we dont receive the participation from the community we would like to see  said detective claudia mera of the community affairs unit the unit holds a meeting once every three months and invites area residents to bring up concerns still  there is no specific plan to address the incident at la morada members of the community believe the tactics they use have created a schism between law abiding residents and police officers who treat all residents as a possible threat ive been working in and with this community for two decades now and police brutality has always been an issue  relationships between the police department and the community have always been an issue  said alyshia galvez  45  a cultural anthropologist who works in the south bronx  the way yajaira was disrespected is the same way other members of the community are disrespected on a daily basis for the south bronxs immigrant community  a negative experience with the police is not just an issue of respect and trust  it also brings fears for their immigration status  for ms  saavedra  her arrest made that fear palpable it doesnt matter if i live in a sanctuary city  she said  when the incident occurred  i was just thinking that this could lead to my deportation it all began around 4 30 p m  last friday when an undercover officer from the bronx narcotics unit made a felony purchase of narcotics on the street outside the restaurant and the individual from whom she purchased the drugs began acting aggressive  according to a police spokesman noticing what appeared to be an arrest happening outside the restaurant  ms  saavedra began filming the incident on her phone  mindful of the stories she hears often from friends and customers of what she describes as prejudiced police practices in the neighborhood the police do not have a good relationship with the community  ms  saavedra said  we see them making unfair arrests  racially profiling us  so i started recording so if that happened it could be exposed as the undercover officer entered la morada for her own safety  another plainclothes officer approached ms  saavedras brother  marco saavedra  and asked him to momentarily close the restaurant to new customers  the siblings instead asked that the officers leave  explaining they did not want to be involved in any police activity i could tell the officer was getting frustrated  and thats when he said he would flip the place upside down if we didnt do what he told us to  said mr  saavedra the police officers then left the restaurant  returning minutes later with additional officers and handcuffing ms  saavedra ms  saavedra was trembling as she described her encounter on monday morning after community members filled the restaurant offering their support la morada is like the watering hole for this community  its our meeting point  and this family is an inspiration for us  said vanna valdez  a 31 year old resident who has lived in the neighborhood her entire life ms  saavedras parents opened la morada in 2009  after living in the united states for 17 years  when they came in 1992 after crossing the sonoran desert  their plan was to stay only one year  but settling into washington heights  her mother  natalia mendez  was impressed by the schools and the neighborhood so she sent for her children to come join them and begin life anew when she and her husband  antonio  opened the restaurant on willis avenue it became a neighborhood sensation  longtime neighbors and resident artists became regulars  mayor bill de blasio stopped by  the five moles ms  mendez prepared for her customers soon earned glowing reviews from critics who praised the familys ability to bring both oaxacan food and its sense of selfless reciprocity to the neighborhood but the critical need the restaurant filled  providing neighbors a safe  positive  community oriented space  also underscored the dangers that surrounded it the attention yajairas arrest garnered has made the incident a rallying cry for neighbors who have experienced similar interactions with the police and feel their voice is rarely heard on friday residents arrived at the precinct to demand her release while others went to la morada to comfort her family members  who were shocked by the way the officers treated yajaira this is the kind of thing i would see in mexico not here in the united states  a country that respect laws  said antonio saavedra  ms  saavedras father  where is the law  i dont see it here right now .
the federal government said this week it had effectively closed a teeming tent city for migrant children on the texas border  a facility that opponents of the trump administrations tough immigration policies had described as a juvenile prison but plans are now underway in florida to nearly double the capacity of a similar  unregulated detention center for migrant teenagers  federal officials confirmed this week the government plans to expand the number of children housed at a temporary shelter in homestead  fla   from 1 350 to 2 350 in january  according to a dec  26 letter from the department of health and human services outlining the plan a department spokeswoman confirmed the plans  but said that the facility still houses only 1 100 minors as of this week  as you know the numbers are unpredictable  lydia holt  the spokeswoman  said in an email  our job is to be prepared and have capacity when if needed like the tent city in texas  the facility in florida  adjacent to homestead air reserve base  is a temporary or influx shelter on federal land  thus  it is not subject to state regulations and inspections intended to guarantee child welfare  only to a loose set of health and human services guidelines in contrast  permanent shelters traditionally used to detain minors must abide by state requirements for staff vetting and training  as well as standards that ensure minors are educated and safe the number of children in federal custody has been shrinking rapidly since the trump administration last month eased a strict security policy that had delayed  often by months  the placement of newly arrived children with sponsors  typically relatives already in the united states the trump administration had required that everyone in a potential sponsors household submit fingerprints to the f b i  for a background check  which many families  some of whom are undocumented  were unwilling to do  coupled with a surge in unaccompanied teenagers arriving at the southwest border  mostly from central america  the policy prompted a shortage  and a scramble  for shelter beds to help handle the overflow  the government in june opened the camp at tornillo  tex   a collection of tents on a barren patch of desert about 35 miles southeast of el paso  it quickly grew to house more than 2 800 migrant teenagers  the camp had the look and feel of a military barracks  with what critics described as inadequate health care and education services children had little access to legal services  instead of several hours of schooling a day  as is offered at licensed shelters for migrant children around the country  children at tornillo were offered workbooks which they were under no obligation to complete  migrant advocates said the office of inspector general in november criticized the facilitys failure to conduct f b i  fingerprint background checks on staff  and also said it had too few staff members to provide sufficient mental health care eventually  the private nonprofit operating the sprawling desert site informed the government that it did not wish to extend its management contract  setting it up to close this tent city should never have stood in the first place  but it is welcome news that it will be gone  will hurd  the republican congressman who represents the southwest texas border region  wrote on twitter the number of migrant children under detention reached record numbers last year  an increase due to both the large numbers of children crossing the border and the roadblocks imposed by the trump administration to releasing them to family members the crunch has eased with the elimination of the policy requiring fingerprints of all adults in any household in which a migrant child is placed  fingerprints are now only required of the adult who is sponsoring the minor as of jan  13  about 10 500 migrant minors were held in more than 100 shelters across the country overseen by health and human services  down from about 14 700 in december  despite the recent decline  the number of children in federal custody remains substantially higher than a year ago  when about 7 550 were staying in shelters the news that federal officials plan a significant expansion at the homestead facility is a clear signal  immigration legal analysts say  that the trump administration is not changing its policy of holding migrant teenagers in detention  but is merely changing the location senator jeff merkley  a democrat from oregon who led a congressional delegation to tornillo last month and pressed for it to be shuttered  said that the expansion of homestead shows that the trump administration has not changed its fundamental strategy of deliberately hurting kids as part of its ongoing strategy of deterrence its a shell game of moving kids from one facility to another  mr  merkley said in a telephone interview the homestead site  about 30 miles south of miami  housed teenage migrants from june 2016 to april 2017  but closed after the number of children entering the country dwindled  it reopened in march 2018 amid the surge in arrivals and is now the countrys biggest detention site for unaccompanied minors the facilitys temporary or influx shelter status suggests that children will be kept there only briefly  but the tent city at tornillo was also intended to be a temporary home for a few hundred migrant children  instead  its population multiplied and the stay of many children dragged on for months the children at homestead sleep in dorms with bunk beds  take classes inside a massive tent and eat meals at a dining hall  some of the dorms are fashioned from former military barracks  as at other shelters  including state licensed facilities  the children are not free to leave the site  which is fenced and guarded homestead has the same maladies that tornillo suffered from  said holly cooper  a co director of the immigration law clinic at the university of california at davis ms  cooper will visit homestead next month with a team to assess whether it is in compliance with the terms of a 1997 consent decree  known as the flores agreement  establishing guidelines for the treatment of minors in government custody  we have received multiple complaints about the facility and will make the investigation of the conditions in homestead a top priority for the coming months  she said the miami dade county public school district has not been asked to provide teachers to work at the homestead facility  even though the district staffed classrooms when the shelter previously opened under the obama administration the schools superintendent in miami dade county  alberto carvalho  said that he raised a concern about the failure to provide certified teachers at homestead in a letter last summer to homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen  but that she did not directly address his question  it would appear to me that there is a continued inequity of the quality and standards of education provided to children in that shelter  mr  carvalho said federal officials said the government was committed to providing excellent care for migrant youths at the facility  and said all staff members receive f b i  fingerprint background checks  even though homestead is on federal property  we continue to maintain the high standards of care expected in our permanent shelters  ms  holt  the h h s  spokeswoman  said in a statement .
the deployment of active duty united states troops at the border with mexico will most likely be extended through september  the pentagon said monday the pentagons border mission had previously been scheduled to end on dec  15  and the defense department later extended the deployment into january  then came mondays announcement in a rare use of military force first announced in october  the trump administration sent about 5 900 active duty troops to join up with border patrol agents and national guard members  as a caravan of central american migrants made its way toward the united states the move was viewed by many as unnecessary political fear mongering as the midterm elections approached  border and military officials insisted the caravan was a serious threat on monday  the pentagon said that its assistance would continue through sept  30 at the department of homeland securitys request  and that the support would focus on mobile surveillance and detection and placing concertina wire between ports of entry its not clear exactly how many troops are currently at the border or how the number is expected to change  a pentagon official said in november that the number was expected to dip below the 5 900 initially deployed  the pentagon did not immediately answer further questions about mondays announcement the extension comes as a new migrant caravan was forming in honduras  and mr  trump and congresss differing visions on border security have led to the longest shutdown of the federal government in american history mr  trump continues to push for a wall to stem what he calls a crisis at the border but the reality is more complicated illegal border crossings have been declining for nearly two decades  and border crossing apprehensions in 2017 were at their lowest level in more than 45 years but a record number of families have tried to cross the border in recent months  and asylum claims have jumped as many migrant families say they fear returning to their home countries the troops  who are prevented by the posse comitatus act from engaging in law enforcement activities within the country  had been spread across small bases where they spent the initial weeks setting up concertina wire and other security barriers  later  the troops were also giving rides to border patrol agents and conducting more training .
washington  republican leaders are sharpening and poll testing lines of attack that portray democratic policies on health care  the environment and abortion as far outside the norm  in hopes of arming president trump with hyperbolic sound bites  some of them false  asserting that democrats would cause long waits for doctors or make killing babies after birth legal the blunt messaging underscores one of the biggest challenges facing democrats as they try to defeat the incumbent president  the need to define themselves and their ideas before mr  trump and his conservative allies do it for them the republican national committee has already begun polling in 16 states to assess ways to discredit ideas like medicare for all  which senator bernie sanders proposed in a bill this week  and build on the partys broader argument that democratic candidates like mr  sanders are promoting an extreme socialist agenda  social conservative leaders have met with white house officials to discuss calling attention to democratic sponsored legislation to loosen restrictions on abortion in the second and third trimesters  like one that passed recently in new york  make sense of the people  issues and ideas shaping american politics with our newsletter  the recent focus on health care and abortion follows well coordinated attacks on policies like the green new deal  which reduced the far reaching climate change proposal to a punch line with jokes about cow flatulence and putting farms out of business some democratic strategists said they have been taken aback recently by how successful mr  trump and republicans have been at setting the terms of the debate around liberal policy ideas  and they are encouraging their party to be more nimble and deliver a more concise and accessible message in a fight with mr  trump  they say  nuance is not usually the democrats best weapon what our side has to understand is that to fight trump its a battle for definition  said celinda lake  a top democratic pollster who has been working with left of center groups on a strategy to counter the messaging campaign from the right the democrats will issue a 61 page white paper that nobody in their right mind will pass on to their friends  she added  he uses a one sentence slogan  and his voters feel emboldened to share it  pass it on democrats say they expect an asymmetrical battle against an opponent who makes his own rules and possesses a singular ability to saturate the national conversation  this can cut both ways  especially on issues like immigration where his fitful threats to close the southern border may cast him as more of a crisis instigator than mitigator  in 2018  mr  trumps alarmist warnings about the central american migrant caravan and his exaggerated claims about immigrants and crime were divisive with many suburban voters and contributed to democratic victories that helped the party win the house still  the presidents purge of the homeland security department this week signals his belief that strict immigration enforcement is a winning issue for him  and while the wall he promised in 2016 remains unbuilt  he will continue to look for new ways to hold a hard line on border security it is not clear whether any of the republican messaging is having an impact on voters outside of the presidents so far unmovable base  but ms  lake said that as she surveyed likely 2020 swing voters  she was surprised to hear people in focus groups repeat false assertions made by the president and his allies  that democrats would end air travel in the united states and shut down dairy farms and beef production because of greenhouse gas emissions from cows its amazing the number of people who would volunteer that  she said  the actual language in the proposal calls for cleaner transportation and agriculture as much as is technologically feasible  the misperception about cows and airplanes originated with a now retracted fact sheet published by representative alexandria ocasio cortezs office that contained an ironic aside about getting rid of farting cows and airplanes republicans said they also saw medicare for all type proposals as a way to give their rallying cries on socialism more substance and potency  some plans  like the one put forward by mr  sanders  would largely eliminate private insurance plans  which republicans have found is overwhelmingly unpopular with the kinds of voters they need to win back  whos running for president in 2020  keep up with whos in and whos out with our candidate tracker  the debate thats going to play out in suburbs across the country is a choice between capitalism versus socialism  said ronna mcdaniel  the chairwoman of the republican national committee  when democrats talk about abolishing private health insurance  for example  most of my friends are on private insurance plans through their jobs or their husbands jobs  they dont want to lose that  they dont want to wait in line to get to the pediatrician whichever democrat wins the nomination will have to own their partys socialist agenda  she added  thats a debate that president trump is eager to have and knows he can win the republicans data on voters from the 2018 midterms showed that coverage of pre existing medical conditions was the top issue of concern  but here they face a serious disadvantage  they have no health care plan of their own but they have been testing messaging on health care with likely voters in the 16 states they believe will be the most competitive in 2020  these include ones mr  trump narrowly won like michigan  wisconsin and florida  as well as those he won by larger margins but have tilted more democratic lately  like arizona and north carolina  the r n c  found that when voters were told that medicare for all would eliminate private insurance and create a government run system paid for by higher taxes  independents  married women and union members disliked the idea by wide margins  among married women alone  nearly 60 percent disapproved mr  trumps own approach at labeling democrats has been inconsistent  he has yet to come up with the kind of indelible rhetorical device that he used repeatedly to brand his opponents in 2016  so far he has nothing like crooked hillary  little marco and low energy jeb  which delighted many of his supporters two years ago but he has occasionally made graphic and false claims that democrats support legislation that would allow executing babies after birth  as he said in a recent tweet  during a meeting at the white house before his state of the union address that included some conservative activists  mr  trump expressed amazement at comments by the governor of virginia  ralph northam  who had to clarify his defense of abortion in later stages of pregnancy after activists accused him of saying doctors should be able to kill a baby born alive during the procedure can you believe this governor  the president said  according to two people at the meeting  who said that he was surprisingly animated about the subject and vowed to keep mentioning it the centers for disease control says such late term abortions are extremely rare  only about 1 3 percent of abortions in the united states in 2015 were performed in or after the 21st week of pregnancy  the agency reported but anti abortion activists said the efforts in some states like new york and virginia to remove certain barriers to second  and third trimester abortions allowed them to present the issue to voters in a new and graphic light  democrats have struggled to defend the new legislation  privately some say they are not being persuasive in explaining the health situations the bills address while the other side accuses them of condoning infanticide while polls show that americans support allowing abortion in the first three months by wide margins  that support drops sharply when people are asked in general about the second and third trimesters   they overwhelmingly support exceptions if the mothers life is endangered  were in a totally different environment  said mallory quigley  vice president of communications for the susan b  anthony list  a group that opposes abortion rights and that plans to test messages on the issue with voters in the months ahead democrats say they cannot let mr  trump and other republicans go unanswered as they try to link the party to socialism  a term that americans view negatively over all  and to extremism in a broader sense  that has been the motivation behind republicans intense focus on two young  freshman members of congress  ms  ocasio cortez  the congresswoman from queens who calls herself a democratic socialist  and ilhan omar of minnesota  whose criticism of israel led the president and others to condemn her as an anti semite  some of ms  omars most vocal defenders have been self described democratic socialists even if americans say they like policies that are derivative of socialism  like social security  the term connotes very clear imagery to people in a very dog whistle kind of way  said jefrey pollock  president of the global strategy group  which advises democrats on messaging  then they attach faces to it  he added  and i think it can have resonance  and it has had resonance the effort on the right to elevate ms  ocasio cortez  29  as the most prominent socialist foil is something democrats are watching  mr  pollock said  she is  of course  six years away from being able to run for president  but they are still trying to make her the face of the party conservatives have extended this line of attack beyond candidates like mr  sanders  who identifies as a democratic socialist  they are using it on other 2020 contenders like pete buttigieg  the mayor of south bend  ind  laura ingraham  the fox news host  last week accused mr  buttigiegs father  who died recently  and who had taught at the university of notre dame  of being a committed marxist  who affectionately embraced the communist manifesto  she cited a washington examiner report as evidence democrats own research has found this approach to be effective with the republican base  which can be more aware of liberal policies like the green new deal than liberals are  when global strategy group and gba strategies surveyed fox news viewers last month  they found that republicans who watch fox are more than twice as likely as all other groups to have heard about the plan than democrats their verdict  seventy seven percent of them are very concerned about the influence of socialism in the democratic party .
in november  i became the first deferred action for childhood arrivals beneficiary to win the rhodes scholarship  the news was bittersweet in 2017 the trump administration rescinded the option for overseas travel for those with daca status  the dreamers who were brought to this country illegally as children  this means that when i leave the country in october to study at oxford with my fellow rhodes scholars  i may not be able to come back  this is a perpetual reality of being undocumented  i never know if i have a place in america  my home  even after receiving one of the most esteemed scholarships in the world my family left south korea during the asian financial crisis in 1997  i remember being whisked away in the middle of the night when i was 7 and boarding a flight for what my parents said was a magical place called america  at the time  i was unaware of the economic forces that had compelled my parents to make the journey to a new country we settled in a korean enclave in flushing  queens  the language  people  smells and flavors reminded us of home  and that helped ease our transition into our new life  my mother found work in a beauty salon  providing manicures and facials  my father was hired as a line cook in a korean restaurant  working 12 hour shifts six days a week  i started going to a school in a nearby korean church  i slowly began adapting to my new life  i found comfort in learning how to speak english  despite their demanding workload  my parents were resolute and nurturing  when my father learned that playing baseball was an american rite of passage  wed go out to the sidewalk in front of our apartment complex to play  he didnt know how to pitch  but he tried to teach me anyway  in 2012 i received daca status  which allowed me to apply to harvard  i graduated in december with a degree in biology and government  these days the conversation around immigration is centered on conspiracy theories and racially charged statements  im reminded daily that i dont belong here  and find myself having to justify why i should be allowed to remain  i can argue that i am smart  driven and able to contribute to this country  just like my fellow undocumented immigrants  we pay taxes to help keep systems such as medicare and social security solvent  systems that we may never directly benefit from  according to a  2017 study  91 percent of dreamers are employed and will contribute  460 3 billion to the gross domestic product over the next decade  over 65 percent of us are pursuing a degree in higher education and yet i resist citing my intelligence or abilities to defend my presence here  because a human being need not be a rhodes scholar to be treated with basic fairness and decency  a human being shouldnt have to be a genius or economically productive to have access to equal opportunity  we are your co workers  your friends  your classmates and your fellow americans  we work  learn and laugh alongside you  as i attempt to make sense of what it means to be an undocumented immigrant  i often retreat into the pusey archives at harvard to pore through the personal library of john rawls  rawls  considered the most important philosopher in the 20th century  concentrated on one crucial question  how can a society establish just institutions when there are seemingly irreconcilable differences among its members  he argues that we must recognize first and foremost those who stand among us  who are members of the union  and who therefore must be treated fairly  i plan to use my time at oxford to think about how undocumented immigrants can urge this country to recognize that we are american  we stand among you and we are embedded in this country  its practices and its institutions  i hope to start a dialogue about how we as americans can collectively forge a common identity that respects human rights when i step on that plane in october and leave the united states for the first time since i arrived 16 years ago  i will think of the bustling flea market on 41st street and union avenue in flushing  and of the smell of freshly made spicy tteokbokki rice cakes in korean eateries along northern boulevard that i pass on my way to the 7 train  these are my roots  these are the sights and sounds that nurtured me as i became the person i am today  walking through those streets has taken on a new meaning as i grapple with the knowledge that soon it may very well be the last time i do so  theres a korean adage that warns that  what becomes far from the eyes becomes far from the heart  yet i have no doubt that these sights and sounds will carry me and remain with me wherever i go  because thats the nature of home  it stays with you even if the country you call home wont accept you .
washington  immigrant advocates denounced it as cruel  the conservative right howled that it was amnesty what president trump billed on saturday as a compromise to end the countrys longest government shutdown pleased neither the democratic congressional leaders whose buy in he needs to strike a deal nor the core supporters whose backing has always been at the heart of his insistence on a border wall instead  in offering temporary protections for about one million immigrants at risk of deportation in exchange for funding for a wall  mr  trump did something rarely seen during his presidency  he tried to reach beyond his base of supporters  which polls have begun to show is losing patience with him as the partial shutdown drags into its fifth week  and speak to a broader swath of americans the saturday afternoon speech from the west wing was an attempt by mr  trump to  at the very least  shift the narrative of the past several weeks and show that rather than spoiling for a longer shutdown fight or making unreasonable demands  he was looking for a broadly acceptable way out of a morass he once boasted he was proud to wade into i think you could tell by the presidents remarks today  vice president mike pence said  that were reaching out yet in seeking to inch toward the center  mr  trump alienated portions of his hard right base  the core supporters he most depends on and the group he and his closest aides have most feared losing  that raised the possibility that  in his zeal to get out of an intractable situation  he may have landed himself in the worst of all worlds  without a clear solution or the support of his most ardent followers  read  trumps deal meets with skepticism among immigrants in texas the tensions and anger over the policy have been quietly playing out in the west wing as well  as jared kushner  the presidents son in law and senior adviser  fended off stephen miller  the architect of much of mr  trumps immigration agenda  mr  kushner has long been a proponent of protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the united states as children  while mr  miller has pressed for aggressive measures to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration in recent days  as white house officials had been working out the details of the compromise  mr  miller intervened to narrow the universe of immigrants who would receive protection  according to people familiar with the internal discussions who described them on the condition of anonymity while the original idea had been to include protections for as many as 1 8 million undocumented immigrants eligible for deferred action for childhood arrivals  the obama era program known as daca that protected those illegally brought to the united states as children  mr  trump ultimately proposed shielding only the 700 000 who are enrolled mr  kushner conceded in a briefing after the presidents speech that he did not see the proposal as a solution for the daca program  which mr  trump moved to rescind in 2017 at this moment in time  mr  kushner said  this is a good path forward many conservatives did not share that view trump proposes amnesty  the conservative commentator ann coulter said on twitter  we voted for trump and got jeb  she added  referring to jeb bush  who challenged mr  trump for the republican nomination in 2016 and supported a broad immigration overhaul that would have given undocumented immigrants a path to legal status still  in the eyes of many white house officials  the prospect that mr  trump could use the proposal to shift blame for the shutdown and pressure democrats to end the impasse was worth trying  mr  pence argued on saturday that the speech was a sincere effort by mr  trump to break the logjam  and he and other white house officials suggested that the measure could attract enough support to succeed from centrist democrats fed up with the shutdown and willing to side with republicans but such a coalition did not appear to be forming  and courting one bears considerable risk for a president who is most comfortable when he is defying convention  eschewing compromise and being hailed as a hero by supporters who often equate bipartisan deal making with weak kneed capitulation the vast majority of democrats knocked the approach  while many of them have pressed for measures to protect daca recipients and immigrants living in the united states under temporary protected status enacted when their countries were destabilized by war or catastrophe  most regard the proposal he put forth on saturday as woefully inadequate  it offers only three years of protections for the daca recipients and those who hold t p s   which the trump administration has also moved to end for several countries this is not an amnesty bill  mr  pence said  there is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal that was high on speaker nancy pelosis list of reasons to call the plan unacceptable that is unlikely to matter to the president  despite saying publicly last month that he would be proud to own a shutdown over the wall  and privately displaying confidence that his base would stick with him through the fight  mr  trump has been dismayed to find otherwise in recent days an npr poll released last week showed mr  trumps approval ratings down and the first cracks in backing among critical supporters  including whites without a college education and white evangelicals such pressure from what he has called the forgotten men and women who elected him and chant build  the  wall  at his arena rallies has swayed mr  trump before  including last year  when the conservative news site breitbart branded him amnesty don for considering a similar deal that would have provided  25 billion in wall funding for a path to legal status for those the daca program was created to help  the president ultimately abandoned that agreement  concerned about angering his base and after mr  miller and others advised him he should insist on additional immigration restrictions on saturday night  breitbart panned mr  trumps latest idea with the headline three year amnesty  most of border remains open .
tijuana  life in tijuanas largest migrant shelter has begun to take on the familiar rhythms and sounds of a central american neighborhood  early in the morning  adults rise and get ready to go to work  children dress for school  mothers gather huge bundles of dirty clothes for the days wash  vendors hawk coffee we are getting used to this life  said norma prez  40  who left honduras in a migrant caravan bound for the united states about two months ago with her 5 year old son for weeks  they walked from central america up to the mexican border with the united states  fleeing poverty and violence  all along the way  president trump described the migrants as a danger  as invaders trying to crash their way into the united states  but they didnt stop their trek north when they arrived at the border  tijuana was not ready for them  the conditions were deplorable  and the migrants were surprised they would not be able to apply for asylum right away  twice  groups of migrants approached the border fence and were repelled by border patrol agents using tear gas and pepper spray but now  life for many of the new arrivals has settled down mexicos new president  andrs manuel lpez obrador  has begun to make good on promises to create alternatives to immigration  and he has already rolled out a plan to increase wages along the united states mexico border and the migrants themselves have begun to create a sense of community in the shelters here  like the citys largest  known as el barretal  they said they have no intention of turning back mr  trump should personally go to honduras so he can see with his own eyes that we simply cant go back  that there are no jobs  no companies  nothing  ms  prez said so she is settling in at el barretal  a concert venue turned into a shelter where tents are lined up in orderly rows on the clean concrete floor  for the thousands of migrants like her in el barretal and 18 other tijuana shelters  this is home  for now as she waits for her chance to apply for asylum in the united states  ms  prez has decided to apply for a temporary humanitarian visa in mexico  that will let her find a job in tijuana and support herself and her child for as long as necessary  she said rodolfo figueroa  an official with the national immigration institute  a government agency  said most of the migrants who arrived in tijuana with the caravan and who applied for humanitarian visas have been approved  in total  2 200 visas have been awarded in little over a month  he said  about 1 300 migrants have either been deported or voluntarily returned to their home countries  he added early on a typical morning in the el barretal shelter  migrants who already hold a temporary mexican visa head to work at a nearby market as meat and poultry vendors  others make their way to jobs as truck drivers  construction workers or laborers in the citys electronics manufacturing plants the shelters manager  leonardo nery  said the number of people living there had dropped from 3 000 a month ago to around 1 000 as some migrants found their own living arrangements in town  others have crossed over to the united states or returned home  he said around 10 a m   loudspeakers inside el barretal announced that buses sent by the mexican federal government had arrived to take anyone interested in mexican humanitarian visas to an immigration office  the same voice reminded migrants to gather any trash and place it in the available cans around noon on most days  english classes start inside a small white tent with bright blue carpets covering the concrete floor  puzzle pieces are spread on tables  along with drawings and crayons  posters with names of colors hang on the walls darwin bardales  an 18 year old honduran  has been working as a volunteer in the shelters english school it feels good to do something for the others  especially the kids  he said  after all  we are all in the same vulnerable situation the children usually take classes in english and spanish  learning to read  to color and to eat healthy foods  this friday  the classes got a late start  the arrival of donated teddy bears and piatas had the childrens full attention until a female voice boomed from the loudspeaker hello everybody  its your teacher  the voice said  its time for class  kids adult migrants scattered around the camp cheered in response food is cooked and distributed both by private aid groups and by mexican marines twice a day  rice  soup and sandwiches  it is a bare bones existence  but friendships have developed and at least one wedding took place in a downtown shelter early on friday  jos daniel castro  44  was already busy managing what has become the shelters corner shop  where he sells cigarettes  potato candy  soup and other basics around the clock mr  castro left honduras in mid october  now he buys supplies in tijuana every morning  and he earns about  20 a day reselling them  enough to buy his own food  he said  having been deported from the united states three times  he plans to stay in mexico indefinitely  working as a vendor  he said i can work here and make a little money  he said  that is already more than i can say about back home  in the end  all we wanted was to work and help our loved ones back home taracio prez stood nearby holding bottles of soda  hoping for customers we are fighting  and hustling  said mr  prez  who also scrubs floors in a downtown tijuana restaurant  the dream was and is the united states  but it has all become so difficult and dangerous for us that the best thing to do is work while we wait for things to get better their first few days in tijuana last november were chaotic  and a bitter disappointment  migrants said  the trump administration had limited the number of asylum applicants that could be seen in a day  separated parents from their children  sent troops to patrol the frontier  and even  starting last month  shut down the federal government in a bid to get funding for a border wall housed initially in an open air sports complex  the migrants saw a torrential downpour turn the ground to mud around their makeshift tents  children started to get sick and adults grew dispirited but to many  those hardships felt temporary  and less threatening than the conditions they had left at home  and life at el barretal is a definite step up from those first  soaking days elisabeth ponce  38  was putting the last touches on her makeup before she started her days work  she came from honduras and now has a job inside the shelter  handing out toiletries  medicine and other basic supplies she fled honduras  like so many others  fearing for her life after being threatened by criminal gangs  joining the caravan was a drastic decision  it meant leaving behind her four children and venturing outside her country for the first time  knowing she had no one to help her if she ever got to the united states now she knows she may never get the asylum she is applying for  and that crossing illegally is dangerous  but she remains resolute i am going to try  regardless  she said .
oakland  calif   nearly nine months after the trump administration officially rescinded its policy of separating migrant families who have illegally crossed the border  more than 200 migrant children have been taken from parents and other relatives and placed in institutional care  with some spending months in shelters and foster homes thousands of miles away from their parents the latest data reported to the federal judge monitoring one of the most controversial of president trumps immigration policies shows that 245 children have been removed from their families since the court ordered the government to halt routine separations under last springs zero tolerance border enforcement policy  some of the new separations are being undertaken with no clear documentation to help track the childrens whereabouts images of crying mothers and children at the border last year prompted an intense backlash across party lines  with all four living former first ladies and melania trump expressing horror at the policy  but despite president trumps june 20 executive order rescinding it  the practice was never completely suspended under the original policy  most children were removed because parents who illegally crossed the border were subject to criminal prosecution  the recent separations have occurred largely because parents have been flagged for fraud  a communicable disease or past criminal history  in some cases relatively minor violations  years in the past  that ordinarily would not lead to the loss of parental custody  read the latest edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  the new separations are taking place amid an unprecedented influx of migrant families from across the southern border that has highlighted the failure of the trump administrations hard line policies to deter them  the border patrol detained 76 103 migrants in february  an 11 year high for that month  among those intercepted were about 40 000 members of families  two thirds more than in january in congress last week  democrats grilled kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  over the separation policy  citing research that has found that separations from parents can inflict long term psychological harm on children family separations also sometimes occurred under the obama administration  but only rarely and in extreme cases in which a childs safety appeared to be at risk customs and border protection officials say the separations are legal under the parameters set by the court and are intended to protect children  who they say may be threatened by human trafficking or by adults pretending to be a parent to capitalize on the advantage that gives them under american immigration laws c b p  does not declare that a parent poses danger to a child arbitrarily or without merit  the agency said in a statement  it said agents will maintain family unity to the greatest extent operationally feasible  separating children only in the presence of a legal requirement set out in written policy or an articulable safety or security concern that requires separation but opposition to the new separations has been growing from both outside and inside the federal government  at the health and human services departments office of refugee resettlement  which oversees the care of separated children until they can be reunited with their families  some officials have tried to resist receiving children referred to the agency by the border patrol according to an official who was not authorized to discuss government business and spoke on the condition of anonymity  staff members have in some cases raised questions with border patrol agents about separations with what appear to be little or no justification  in some of those cases  border agents have refused to provide additional information  the official said  or if additional documents were provided  they were sometimes redacted to the point of illegibility the official  along with another staff member at the department of homeland security  the border patrols parent agency  said that some separations were occurring with no formal notification to the refugee resettlement office  both officials said they had been made aware of concerns about an apparent inconsistency in standards applied by border agents when determining whether a family should be separated the failure to keep accurate records suggests that more children could have been separated than the 245 accounted for by feb  20 in official records the new york times reviewed several cases of children who have been separated since the policy was officially ended  and learned of many others through the lawyers who handled them  some of the new separations  the review showed  occurred in families with a parent who had a drunken driving conviction in the past  or a 20 year old nonviolent robbery conviction  in one case  a parent had been convicted of possession of a small amount of marijuana donna abbott  vice president for refugee and immigrant services at bethany christian services  a contractor that accommodates migrant children in temporary foster homes until they can be reunited with family members  said most cases of family separations do not list detailed reasons  making it difficult to evaluate whether they were appropriate for example  some files state only that the parent was suspected of having gang affiliations or a criminal history  without additional information  is it trespassing or is it murder  ms  abbott said in december  a mother traveling from el salvador with her three children was arrested and put on a bus to an immigration detention facility in arizona while her children  ages 5  8 and 15  were sent to foster care in new york the woman  deisy ramirez  38  said it was nearly six weeks before she talked to her children they were devastated  said ms  ramirezs sister  silvia ramirez  who was trying to persuade the government to allow her to take the children to live with her in seattle while her sister was in custody  they couldnt understand why they were separated  she said on march 1  ms  ramirezs eldest daughter was transferred to a hospital after threatening to take her own life  silvia ramirez said  and she remained there even after her mothers release from detention last week i never imagined this could happen  deisy ramirez said on friday  her voice breaking  all i want is to hold my children and to be with them her lawyer  ricardo de anda  said he had received no response to his formal request for a reason for the separation  he suspects it may be connected to the fact that ms  ramirez had been deported from the united states more than a decade ago  he sent government lawyers a series of emails  ultimately securing her release on saturday  the day after her release from the arizona detention facility  ms  ramirez was preparing to fly to new york to reunite with her children border agents removed 3 year old ashley ramos from her father after they were detained last month in arizona  he was swiftly deported to guatemala and the girl was sent to a shelter the childs mother  silvia maribel ramos  who had been separated from the pair during their journey from guatemala when mexican police pulled her and other migrants off their bus for questioning  arrived in arizona a few days later  only to learn from authorities that her child was gone they told me they had no idea where she was  that i would find out after being released  said ms  ramos  who is staying with relatives in oakland  calif the child was located nearly two weeks later  she said  after her husband contacted guatemalan authorities back home  now ms  ramos is struggling with the paperwork required to recover ashley  my daughter cant understand  she just weeps and begs to be with us  she said in late january  victor antonio marin was separated from his 4 year old son  whose mother is deceased  after they were detained near calexico  calif  according to his lawyer  bob boyce  mr  marin had a 20 year old nonviolent robbery conviction in the united states that did not involve the use of a weapon  he served time and was deported back to el salvador now mr  marin remains locked up in an immigration detention center while his child is in a shelter in texas ruben garcia  who runs a network of migrant shelters in el paso  said that immigration authorities this month dropped off a distraught 18 year old woman from guatemala the woman said she had given birth less than a week earlier and had been separated from her baby  child welfare authorities had come to the hospital to take the child  who was a united states citizen  immigration agents took the mother back to a detention cell where she waited for several days  the babys first two weeks were spent away from the mother  who finally regained custody after interventions from multiple legal aid groups  mr  garcia said since mr  trump ended the family separations under zero tolerance on june 20  about 2 700 children have been reunited with their parents  still  thousands more children who were separated before the policy officially went into effect have not been accounted for  according to the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services  the investigators cited the lack of an efficient tracking system the american civil liberties union requested that the government locate the families  and on friday  judge dana m  sabraw ruled that they should be included in the pending litigation over protecting and reuniting separated families the hallmark of a civilized society is measured by how it treats its people and those within its borders  the judge wrote in his opinion some families affected by the earlier zero tolerance separations continue to face repercussions a 9 year old guatemalan boy named byron xol has been shuffled among four shelters since he was dragged away from his father at the border nine months ago  while the policy was still in place after his father was deported to guatemala  the boys parents decided that the child should remain in the united states for safety reasons  with the help of a lawyer  they designated an american family in buda  tex   to care for him but authorities have refused to allow byron to join the family  citing an anti trafficking policy that bars a child from being released to a nonrelative sponsor unless the sponsor has a verifiable relationship with the child going back at least a year detentions and deportation proceedings have also resulted in family separations far from the border christy swatzell  an immigration lawyer in memphis  said that two of her clients who crossed the border without authorization and were released to await the outcome of their cases were told by immigration and customs enforcement to leave their children at home ahead of their monthly check in with the agency  when they showed up at the i c e  office  they were detained and transferred to an immigration facility in louisiana one of the clients  francisca yanes  33  is the mother of a 6 year old girl who is physically disabled  i was in tears  telling them about my daughter  but it didnt matter  said ms  yanes  whose child  paola  remained in the care of family members for the entire 45 days she was in detention the guatemalan migrant was released on a  7 500 bond set by the court after her lawyer filed a motion on her behalf  what we are seeing is that families are being effectively separated  said ms  swatzell  just not at the border anymore .
washington  president trump warned on wednesday that he reserved the option of declaring a national emergency to build his border wall without congressional approval the president  speaking a day after his address to the nation that even some supporters conceded was unlikely to increase public support  headed to a luncheon meeting on capitol hill where he faced the urgent task of persuading wavering senate republicans that he could still come to an accord with democrats on border security and end the partial shutdown of the federal government asked whether he was still considering declaring a national emergency  an extraordinary measure rarely used by presidents absent an urgent security threat  mr  trump said  i think we might work a deal  and if we dont  i may go that route  i have the absolute right to do national emergency if i want  read about whether mr  trump can use his emergency powers to build a wall  mr  trump was scheduled to meet later wednesday afternoon with democratic and republican congressional leaders at the white house in an effort to break the deadlock  so far  democrats have held firm to the position that the president must agree to reopen the government before they will engage on the larger issue of border security legislation and his proposed wall the president insisted that he maintained tremendous republican support  even as nearly a half dozen republican senators have said directly or strongly suggested that they wanted to reopen the government  then have the debate about the wall i think we have tremendous republican support  mr  trump said  the senate has been incredible  mitch mcconnell has been incredible  he said  referring to the senate majority leader the president  who has refused to sign any bill to fund the government that does not include  5 7 billion for the wall  also said some democrats were moving to his point of view  although he did not offer any names the fact is that there is tremendous support  he said if i did something that was foolish  like gave up on border security  the first ones that would hit me would be my senators  theyd be angry at me  he said  the second ones would be the house  and the third ones would be frankly my base and a lot of republicans out there and a lot of democrats that want to see border security mr  trump is scheduled to travel to southern texas on wednesday to dramatize his call for a wall  the democratic members of congress in that area of texas  and several of the republicans there  have said a wall along the entire texas border is not necessary this is not a fight i wanted  mr  trump said  i didnt want this fight .
 what you need to know to start the day  get new york today in your inbox  new york city will spend at least  100 million to ensure that undocumented immigrants and others who cannot qualify for insurance can receive medical treatment  mayor bill de blasio announced on tuesday  seeking to insert a city policy into two contentious national debates the mayor has styled himself  in his 2017 re election campaign and during his second term  as a progressive leader on issues like education and health care  and as a bulwark against the policies of president trump  particularly on immigration in making the announcement  first on national television  mr  de blasio appeared to be trying to heighten that contrast and thrust his efforts on behalf of undocumented new yorkers into the national debate over immigration  hours before mr  trump was to go on television tuesday night to make his case for a border wall everyone is guaranteed the right to health care  everyone  mr  de blasio said during a news conference at lincoln hospital in the bronx  we are saying the word guarantee because we can make it happen new york city already provides health care to the uninsured and the undocumented through its hospital system  a roughly  8 billion behemoth whose history of service to the poor  regardless of an ability to pay  can be traced to the founding of bellevue hospital in the 18th century  a person without medical insurance has long been able to go to a city emergency room and get care  free of charge  or to seek a primary care physician but the financially challenged system did not work well to connect patients to doctors  mr  de blasio said  he promised a streamlined approach  complete with a hotline and dedicated membership card  and one that would be focused on the primary care doctor  rather than the emergency room we were only covering them in the sense that they could go to the emergency room  the mayor said  it was not a way to live the announcement came as proponents of universal health care coverage have increasingly looked to local governments  rather than congress  to make meaningful progress in the short term  also on tuesday  gov  jay inslee of washington said he would seek to create a public option in the state a day before  gov  gavin newsom of california  on his first day in office  announced his plan to move toward a single payer system for that state  as mayor of san francisco  mr  newsom oversaw the creation of a health care system in that city in 2007 the top health official who created the san francisco program  mitchell h  katz  is now the head of new york citys hospital system and will oversee the citys effort  branded as nyc care  its a much bigger and more compassionate vision  said mr  katz  comparing new yorks proposed program to the much smaller one in san francisco the mayor was quick to say that the plan would not be a substitute for any universal health care at the state level or a national single payer plan  but  aides said  it was something the city could do immediately and on its own  without approval from the state legislature  which is weighing some form of universal health insurance for new york state indeed  the mayors proposal is a mix of insurance and direct spending  and mr  de blasio said it would take about two years to get it fully running  the city already has a kind of public option for health insurance for low income new yorkers  through an insurance plan run by city hospitals known as metroplus the new proposal would improve that coverage  which already insures some 516 000 people  and aim to reach more of those who are eligible  such as the young and uninsured  and others who qualify but have not applied it would also provide additional direct city spending  at least  100 million per year when fully implemented  officials said  for the citys hospital system to support care for those without insurance  the city estimates the uninsured population to be about 600 000 people  including as many as 300 000 undocumented residents  a major component of that effort would be improving customer service  including the phone line  to help those with questions about their care part of the goal of nyc care  aides to the mayor said  was to direct people to medical care earlier  before they seek more expensive services in an emergency room  while providing them with better health care the effort is also aimed at getting some of the so called young and invincible uninsured population into the health care system  either through the citys insurance plan or through its hospital system it appears that the mayor is ramping up outreach so that more people can avail themselves of services  regardless of ability to pay  that have been made available to them by health and hospitals for decades  said andrew rein  the president of the nonpartisan citizens budget commission  the details are critical  he added  we still need to learn more the  100 million would go to both establishing the customer service component and hiring additional doctors and nurses  but officials could not provide a breakdown of how much would be spent on each  indeed  details of how those seeking care could do so under the new plan were not immediately clear  nor was an exact start date mr  katz said that the rollout would begin in the bronx and that the city would start enrolling people in the nyc care program this summer  the borough was chosen because the health care needs were greatest  he said such endeavors can be difficult for the city to implement quickly  mr  de blasio oversaw the creation of a municipal identification card for undocumented immigrants in his first term  but last week  he said that an ambitious goal of providing metrocards to about 800 000 residents whose incomes are below the federal poverty line would fall far short of that goal initially  starting this month with cards for only about 30 000 people  or about 4 percent of the total mr  de blasio said that the nyc care system will also employ what amounted to a membership card in the city program  they will have a card that will empower them to go to that doctor whenever they need  he said the citys hospital system has been under severe financial strain and running deficits for years  the current financial plan for city hospitals anticipates budget shortfalls of more than  156 million in

said that the hospital system  which has received significant infusions of city money during the de blasio administration  was now in a very cash strong position  she said more details would be provided during a forthcoming budget briefing advocates for immigrants and health care analysts were encouraged by the plan  even if many were still looking to albany  where debate over health care is

los angeles  creating yet another roadblock to the trump administrations efforts to deport ineligible migrants  a federal appeals court ruled on thursday that immigration authorities can no longer swiftly deport asylum seekers who fail an initial screening  opening the door for thousands of migrants a year to get another shot in the federal courts to win asylum in the united states the ruling broadens constitutional protections for undocumented immigrants at the border and opens a new legal gateway for some of them to appeal for permission to stay in the country  even when an asylum officer and an immigration judge have made a determination that they do not have a credible fear of persecution in their homeland the historical and practical importance of this ruling cannot be overstated  said lee gelernt  deputy director of the american civil liberties unions immigrants rights project  who argued the appeal on behalf of a sri lankan migrant who had been turned away at californias border with mexico in 2017  he said the ruling reaffirms the constitutions foundational principle that individuals deprived of their liberty must have access to a federal court after dropping precipitously over five decades  the number of migrants intercepted at the southern border  the key indicator of how many undocumented people are entering the united states  is soaring again  driven by an influx of families from central america fleeing violence and poverty  immigration authorities received more than 99 000 requests for asylum interviews during the 2018 fiscal year  including more than 54 000 submitted at the southwest border  read the latest edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  president trump has said that migrants are exploiting the asylum system by making baseless and fraudulent claims in order to remain in the united states  and his administration has taken a number of steps to make the process harder  including narrowing the grounds for winning asylum  limiting the number of asylum seekers who can be processed at the border each day and requiring some applicants to wait in mexico while their cases make their way through the courts in 2016  the most recent year for which data is available  an estimated 7 200 migrants were denied permission to apply for asylum after their initial interviews and were placed in expedited deportation proceedings  an analysis by the transactional records access clearinghouse at syracuse university found that in june 2018  only 15 percent of initial asylum reviews found that the asylum seeker had a credible fear of persecution  about half the proportion that had prevailed a year earlier thursdays court decision will most likely send that trend in the other direction  legal analysts said this is a historic decision  said stephen yale loehr  an immigration scholar at cornell law school  but the government will surely appeal this to the supreme court the opinion  from the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit  extends constitutional habeas corpus guarantees to those applying for asylum at the border and provides that they can seek a hearing in the federal courts before being summarily deported  though the court did not specify what standards the courts must use to evaluate such petitions the ruling applies to asylum seekers in the nine western states included in the courts jurisdiction and  because it conflicts with an earlier ruling rejecting such legal protections in the third circuit  the issue is likely to be resolved ultimately by the supreme court  in the meantime  legal analysts said  the courts decision is likely to have sweeping implications for immigration deterrence efforts by enabling thousands to remain in the country while they seek the court review under current procedure  every migrant who arrives at the border and expresses a fear of persecution in his or her homeland is referred for an interview with an asylum officer  those who succeed in convincing the officer that they have a credible fear are allowed to enter the country and proceed with their asylum cases in the immigration courts  those who dont can request a review by an immigration judge  but it is usually cursory and favorable decisions are rare  there is usually no access to a lawyer  and no opportunity to challenge the decision  deportation quickly ensues in the case before the appeals court  vijayakumar thuraissigiam  a member of sri lankas tamil ethnic minority  was arrested about 25 yards north of the border near san ysidro  calif   and told an asylum officer that he was fearful of returning to his homeland  the officer found no credible fear  and that finding was upheld by a supervisor and an immigration judge mr  thuraissigiam was in deportation proceedings when he filed a habeas corpus petition in the federal court  he argued that the asylum officer had failed to elicit important background about his case  including that he had been detained and beaten by sri lankan army officers on two occasions  and at one point had been lowered into a well and nearly drowned  he also said there were communication problems between the translator and both the asylum officer and the immigration judge as a result  his lawyers argued  he was deprived of a meaningful right to apply for asylum a district court judge in los angeles rejected that argument  but the three judge appeals court panel  sitting in san francisco  held that even though an asylum seeker may lack the right to a full trial in immigration court  the constitution requires a more complete review than what immigration law currently provides at its historical core  said the 48 page opinion written by judge a  wallace tashima  the writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of reviewing the legality of executive detention  and it is in that context that its protections have been strongest .
washington  president trump raised the possibility on friday of declaring a national emergency to allow him to build a wall along the southwest border without congressional approval  hours after department of homeland security officials requested additional support to erect temporary barriers between the united states and mexico mr  trumps comments followed a contentious meeting with democratic leaders at the white house  it failed to produce a deal to end the two week partial shutdown of the federal government  a funding lapse that began with the presidents insistence that congress allocate  5 6 billion for the wall we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly  mr  trump told reporters in the rose garden when asked about an emergency declaration asked if his claim was intended to scare democrats into making a deal  he replied  i never make threats  president trump took the public stage this week clearly intent on framing the conflict on his own terms  under the national emergencies act of 1976  presidents are allowed to take unilateral action in times of crisis  provided they notify congress  specify the circumstances that necessitated the declaration and document all uses of executive authority that are covered by the emergency officials at the homeland security  justice and defense departments have researched the issue for mr  trump  however  no emergency order has been drafted or approved  one official with knowledge of those plans said the homeland security department submitted an official request for assistance from the pentagon on friday  a defense department official said  but the military has yet to determine what resources are needed and if any additional troops are required for the mission  the official said the moves come as the president finds himself trapped between a central campaign promise to build a wall and rising anxiety among republicans over political damage inflicted by a shutdown that mr  trump has defiantly owned speaker nancy pelosi has ruled out paying for a border wall  even at a much lower funding level  despite suggestions by mr  trump that the government shutdown could last months or even years administration officials have been scrambling to tackle the legal and logistical problems involved with steering previously allocated funding toward any project that can be described as a wall  a fence or a barrier the definition of a wall has grown ever more elastic the white house and homeland security officials have been pushing the pentagon to continue to use military troops at the border  mainly to install  extend and repair a section of concertina wire used to stop immigrants from entering unmanned sections of the southwest border mr  trump tweeted last month that the military will build the remaining sections of the wall  a reference to several hundred miles of fencing along the border the temporary troop deployments are just one of many recommendations that the homeland security secretary  kirstjen nielsen  and her staff have made to the pentagon one possible solution  in the absence of new congressional allocations  is figuring out a way to steer contracts already planned for army corps of engineers projects toward some kind of barriers  but lawyers at the homeland security and justice departments have yet to determine if doing so could withstand court challenges  two senior administration officials said mr  trump spent the holidays at the white house to demonstrate his determination to secure new border funding  yet he has struggled to dramatize his cause  as stories of federal employees and other americans suffering from the effects of the shutdown pile up on thursday  homeland security officials abruptly canceled a scheduled press briefing by kevin k  mcaleenan  the commissioner of united states customs and border protection  when mr  trump decided that he wanted to appear in front of the cameras himself  he did so  in the white house briefing room  with border patrol and other immigration enforcement employees who had been meeting with him in the oval office it was completely off the cuff  art del cueto  a border patrol agent in the room with mr  trump  said shortly after leaving the white house  i dont know who in the room  it may have been him  that was like  we should go out there and do a presser  so we did mr  del cueto and other members of the border patrols labor union have met with mr  trump several times in his presidency  so frequently  they said  that they could not remember the number of times they had been to the oval office separately  on friday  mr  trump in a tweet denied as fake news a new york times article reporting that he was considering nominating former senator jim webb  democrat of virginia  as his next defense secretary  defense secretary jim mattis resigned last month to protest mr  trumps decision to withdraw troops from syria .
president trump has tried to halt the arrival of undocumented migrants by beefing up border security  limiting who qualifies for asylum and  for a while  separating migrant children from their parents at the border  however  figures released on tuesday suggest that those measures are failing to deter tens of thousands of migrants from journeying over land to the united states indeed  after shriveling to the smallest total in five decades  the number of migrants intercepted at the southern border  the best indicator of how many undocumented people are entering the united states  is soaring again border authorities detained nearly twice as many migrants  268 044  in the first five months of the fiscal year that started in october than were detained in the same period the previous year to understand whats happening  its important to look at who is coming  what is driving them and how the answers to those questions have changed over the years   read the latest edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  in the past  undocumented immigrants were overwhelmingly single men from mexico who slipped into the country undetected to find work and send money home  but immigration from mexico has plummeted in recent years  in fact  more mexicans are leaving than arriving in the united states  mexicans are less compelled to come because there are more opportunities in their own country and they have smaller families to support central american families have become the new face of undocumented immigration in the first five months of the fiscal year that began in october  the border patrol detained 136 150 people traveling in families with children  compared with 107 212 during all of fiscal 2018 a trend toward family migration from central america that began when barack obama was president has endured  after temporarily dipping during mr  trumps first year in office   more than 76 000 migrants cross in a month  read about the breaking points  many central americans live in fear  el salvador  honduras and guatemala have among the worlds highest homicide rates  arriving migrants report that they have faced extortion  and want to prevent their children from being recruited by street gangs but murder rates in the northern triangle countries have been declining in recent years  and economic imperatives are believed to be the most important push factor for the majority of recent arrivals  more than 90 percent of the most recent migrants are from guatemala  according to the newly released data  the majority hail from impoverished regions  including the western highlands  where conflicts over land rights  environmental changes and depressed prices for crops like maize and coffee are undermining the ability of farmers to make a living  read about the treatment of detainees with medical conditions  migrants generally lack understanding of united states immigration law  but they appear to be informed about the basics the majority know to request asylum at the border  either at an official port of entry or when they surrender to border agents shortly after sneaking into the country from mexico they know that they are unlikely to remain detained if they travel with a child and that they have a better shot at fending off deportation when they come with a child by law  the government cannot keep migrant families in holding facilities at the border for more than 72 hours  it must either transfer them to an immigration detention facility suitable for children or release them  the government has been letting thousands of detained migrants go free each week because it lacks enough beds to hold them in family detention facilities  immigration and customs enforcements three residential family centers  two in southern texas and one in pennsylvania  can accommodate 3 326 parents and children the largest share of migrants arrive in texas  but there appears to be a growing number who are entering through remote areas of arizona and new mexico in the spring of 2018  the trump administration tried to discourage parents from traveling with a child by prosecuting everyone who crossed the border illegally  even those who were traveling with children  a policy known as zero tolerance  this resulted in children being removed from their parents and placed in shelters across the country the policy drew widespread condemnation  prompting the president to halt the practice in late june  but customs and border protection officials believe that the various legal rulings preventing families from being detained have helped solidify the message to smugglers  who roam villages offering to guide people to the united states  that adults who come with a child are protected from deportation whether they sneak into the country in remote areas or enter the country through a port of entry  most migrants are trying to petition for asylum in 2008  just under 5 000 applicants claimed they had a credible fear of persecution  the first legal step toward obtaining asylum  to avoid being returned to their homeland  last year  nearly 100 000 claimed a credible fear the trump administration contends that people are flooding the asylum system with invalid claims  in recent years  immigration judges have granted less than 20 percent of asylum requests  a proportion that is even lower for central americans many asylum seekers from central america claim they have been victims of gangs  which is harder to prove than political and other types of persecution  poverty is not among the grounds for receiving asylum if they are denied  asylum seekers can be deported  but since many are released while their case is pending  some never return to court and evade deportation  .
mcallen  tex   she trembled as she sat on the witness stand  she kept her head down and avoided looking at the man at the defense table only a few feet away in the blue carpeted courtroom in the texas border city of mcallen  she was identified only by her initials  m m u t  she had come from honduras  she told the court  and the smugglers who helped her cross the border had placed her with about a dozen other migrants at a stash house near mcallen  the man in charge was known as el gordo  the fat one when one of the migrant women escaped one morning  el gordo forced m m u t  to go with him in his truck to search for her  she testified  he drove her to an unoccupied trailer some distance away he raped me  she said it was a small  nearly whispered moment one day in 2017 in one of the busiest federal courthouses on the southwest border  it was also a  metoo moment for a category of women whose long history of sexual assault has gone largely unpunished for decades  undocumented women rarely get the chance to face their accused rapists in court  attacks are most often never reported  and if they are  the perpetrators are often never found  read  the hidden nightmare of sexual violence on the border this case was different  the woman had agreed to testify  and the man she said attacked her was in custody  facing sentencing on a different charge  adan hernandez nunez sat facing his accuser in court one other thing was different  the federal judge hearing the case was a native of the texas border region  a woman  and the daughter of migrant farmworkers i wanted more than anything else for her to feel that the court had listened to her as a human being  judge micaela alvarez said later  in an interview the federal prosecutor  alexandro benavides  urged m m u t  to go on with her story  while that was happening  did he tell you anything  he asked he told me that if i ever said this  that he would kill me  she said she stopped talking  im afraid  she said softly  read the newsletter  yes  there was duct tape  the harrowing journeys of migrants across the border  sign up for crossing the border here judge alvarez reassured the witness that federal marshals were in the courtroom to keep everyone safe this judge had seen several cases like this  before being nominated to the bench in texas southern district by president george w  bush in 2004  judge alvarez had been a social worker for the states child protective services  she is a native of the nearby border town of donna and  out of hundreds of federal judges around the country  one of only 29 latinas on the federal bench you can take as much time as you need  judge alvarez told the witness  i can assure you that you are safe here when the witness was ready  mr  benavides  the prosecutor  asked her if she saw the man she knew as el gordo in the courtroom thats him  she said as she pointed at mr  hernandez nunez and then she said  again  im afraid she began crying  judge alvarez stepped down from the bench  walked to the witness stand and crouched down next to her  she called mr  hernandez nunezs lawyer over so he could hear she said later that it was the first time in her 14 years as a federal judge that she had left the bench to console a witness mr  hernandez nunez had already pleaded guilty to harboring an undocumented alien and was headed to federal prison  the question at the sentencing hearing that day was for how long prosecutors hoped for a stiff sentence because of the rape accusation  but mr  hernandez nunez  now 32  denied the attack  and investigators were unable to locate either the stash house where m m u t  said she was held  or the trailer where she said the rape occurred norman e  mcinnis  the federal public defender  reminded the judge that investigators had declined to pursue sexual assault charges against his client in state court  if they really felt like this was injustice  then they could have pursued other charges  he said judge alvarez  having heard the arguments from both sides  started speaking  she found the victim to be credible  she said  and she said the woman was not alone  she had seen a number of migrant women coming forward lately with allegations of sexual assault  beginning to break a silence that has long been part of the price of crossing illegally into the united states i dont know if it was because those instances have increased  or maybe the victims are more willing to step forward now because  you know  theyve lost some of that fear  she said in the courtroom  certainly the victim here  you know  demonstrated a lot of fear judge alvarez said she found the penalty recommended under the federal sentencing guidelines  about two and a half years  to be too short  she sentenced him to four .

lima  ohio  it is an obsession he cannot seem to shake senator john mccain of arizona has been dead for seven months  but president trumps feud with him is very much alive  and in front of a military audience at a tank plant here in lima  ohio  on wednesday  he took it to a new level he said he gave mr  mccain the funeral he wanted  and i didnt get thank you  exaggerating the role he played in honoring the senators death four days before his 82nd birthday he blamed him for a war in the middle east that mccain pushed so hard  he said that mccain didnt get the job done for our great vets and the department of veterans affairs  and he was blunt in saying that his animosity toward mr  mccain was not going to change i have to be honest  ive never liked him much  mr  trump said  about 10 minutes into a freewheeling speech that was ostensibly about the resurgence of manufacturing jobs  hasnt been for me  ive really  probably never will the long  antagonistic history between the president and mr  mccain  in his youth a navy pilot and prisoner of war celebrated for his bravery and later known as a maverick in the republican party  dates to the early days of the 2016 presidential campaign  mr  trump  who never served in the military  said mr  mccain was not a war hero  adding  i like people who werent captured mr  trump was reacting to the senators accusation that he riled up crazies with inflammatory remarks about illegal immigration across the mexican border  his attack on mr  mccain  the partys 2008 presidential candidate  horrified his own aides and led republican leaders to denounce the outsider who was already disrupting their party  it also proved to be an early example of mr  trumps ability to remain undamaged by any self created controversy now  months after mr  mccains death in august  mr  trump suddenly cannot stop talking about his old adversary  outraging mr  mccains supporters and creating another divide  if only temporary  between himself and congressional republicans his attacks began over the weekend  when the president used his twitter feed to berate mr  mccain for his role in giving the f b i  a dossier of unverified information about mr  trumps connections to russia that was compiled by a former british spy  a dossier the f b i  already had  he brought up mr  mccains vote against repealing the affordable care act  he claimed that mr  mccain  a former prisoner of war  was last in his class at the naval academy  when mr  mccain actually graduated fifth from the bottom on tuesday  seated in the oval office next to president jair bolsonaro of brazil  mr  trump told reporters that he was never a fan of mr  mccain  and never would be  and on wednesday  mr  trump reiterated all those reasons in a diatribe that was part of a week that mr  trump seems to have dedicated to airing personal feuds he has spent days criticizing george t  conway iii  the husband of kellyanne conway  one of his top advisers  who has been raising alarms about the presidents mental health and calling him unfit for office via his twitter feed  on his way to ohio  mr  trump called mr  conway a whack job  capping two days of back and forth with the spouse of one of his most loyal and longest serving aides but his relentless fixation on mr  mccain was more reminiscent of an election year feud mr  trump escalated against a gold star father  khizr khan  who spoke at the democratic national convention  and  brandishing a pocket constitution  challenged mr  trump for smearing the character of muslims  republicans once again denounced mr  trump when he continued to attack mr  khan and his wife  who mr  trump implied was forced against her will to stand silently by her husbands side during the emotional speech the feud with mr  mccain  however  has carried into his presidency  even after the man who was considered an elder statesman of the senate learned he had brain cancer and eventually died planning his funeral  mr  mccain made it clear that the president would not be welcome  leaving mr  trump to fume when his two immediate predecessors  barack obama and george w  bush  eulogized mr  mccain in a service at washington national cathedral  the presidents response was to stall on issuing any proclamation of praise  or ordering flags to be flown at half staff to commemorate the senators death his posthumous attacks have been cheered at the presidents make america great rallies  but at the army tank plant in lima  where mr  trump said a third of the work force is made up of veterans  the denunciations drew no cheers  and they once again resulted in rare criticism from mr  trumps own party on wednesday  senator johnny isakson  republican of georgia  called out the presidents string of recent comments about mr  mccain its deplorable what he said  mr  isakson said in an interview with georgia public broadcastings political rewind radio show  adding  it will be deplorable seven months from now if he says it again  and i will continue to speak out he joined senator mitt romney  republican of utah  who had criticized the president on tuesday  i cant understand why the president would  once again  disparage a man as exemplary as my friend john mccain  heroic  courageous  patriotic  honorable  self effacing  self sacrificing  empathetic  and driven by duty to family  country  and god  mr  romney wrote on twitter other republicans  like senator mitch mcconnell  the majority leader  however  were more muted in responding to mr  trumps latest attacks  choosing to emphasize their support for mr  mccain rather than confront the president but at least one democratic presidential candidate used the moment to demand change in the white house this vietnam vet was brought to tears when hearing the stories of the president going after john mccain this week  as well as the lack of focus on mental health for kids in this country  senator amy klobuchar  democrat of minnesota  wrote on twitter  with a picture of her embracing a veteran mr  mccains family  meanwhile  responded in his stead this is a new bizarre low  mr  mccains daughter  meghan mccain  said on the view on wednesday  i will say attacking someone who isnt here is a bizarre low  my dads not here  but im sure as hell here she added  i think if i had told my dad  seven months after youre dead  youre going to be dominating the news and all over twitter  he would think its hilarious that our president was so jealous of him that he was dominating the news cycle in death as well mr  mccains widow  cindy mccain  for her part  shared on twitter a hateful message she received after mr  trumps most recent attacks  in which the sender wished that ms  mccains daughter chokes to death mark salter  mr  mccains closest political adviser and a harsh critic of the president  said all of mr  trumps personal attacks against critics were of a piece the problem isnt trumps disrespect to john and his family  its trump  he said  hes unfit for the office  and most members of congress know he is  i hope this latest evidence of that convinces more people that he cant be ignored .
tijuana  mexico  hoping to convince american immigration officials that his life is in danger  selvin alvarado sorted through photographs of men who he said have threatened to kill him mr  alvarado said he fled honduras last fall after exposing corruption in his hometown and was followed into mexico by an armed group  once he reached the united states  he believed he would be safe  even if that meant being detained while waiting for asylum i prefer 1 000 times being jailed  he said last week at a shelter south of the united states border  than being dead instead  as part of a newly expanded trump administration policy  mr  alvarado  29  a father of two  was sent back to mexico  he has been waiting for weeks to be summoned for an asylum hearing in california hundreds of asylum seekers are expected to be blocked from waiting in the united states each day under the so called remain in mexico policy  which american officials describe as a deterrent to illegal immigration officials at the department of homeland security said the policy also aims to ease overcrowded detention facilities as they grapple with a recent surge in migrants along the southwestern border  the policy is being challenged in federal court the crisis at our border is worsening  and d h s  will do everything in its power to end it  kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  said this week  sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  on thursday  an official from mexicos foreign ministry said it was unclear how many asylum seekers might be turned away from the united states under the policy  which he said the trump administration had expanded without its consultation  the official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a delicate diplomatic issue about 633 central american asylum seekers have been turned away since january  unable to prove sufficient fear of being tortured and persecuted in mexico  it is a shift from earlier guidelines  which allowed migrants who convinced the authorities that they had a credible fear of returning to their home nations to remain in the united states while their asylum cases were being considered stories of fleeing violence  extortion and corruption in their home countries do not meet the new standard for entry  many migrants are also unable to obtain lawyers to represent them in court without first meeting them in the united states mr  alvarado said he was considering sneaking into the united states if his asylum claim was further delayed ill have to do it illegally  mr  alvarado said  holding photographs of the men who he said pursued him from honduras  through guatemala and into tapachula  mexico  ill have to give up everything for the most part  the policy has been rolled out slowly and quietly when it began at the san ysidro port of entry in california in late january  only men traveling by themselves from central america were told to wait in mexico as their asylum cases wound through the american legal system  the policy has since expanded to stop entire families from waiting in the united states  although unaccompanied children and mexican citizens will be allowed to enter it is now being enforced at border ports at calexico  calif   where president trump traveled on friday to tour the border  and el paso  ms  nielsen has directed her department to expand the policy to other legal crossing points from mexico the number of border crossings are nowhere as high as in the early 2000s  when as many as 220 000 migrants crossed the border in a month  ms  nielsen estimated last month that border officials had stopped as many as 100 000 migrants in march  up from 76 000 in february a state department report released last month acknowledged the possibility that the migrants were no safer in mexico from the same gangs that threatened them in central america than they had been at home that is constantly on the mind of daniel nuez  who was working as a security guard in honduras when gang members opened fire in october  severely injuring several of his colleagues mr  nuez fled to the united states border  where he asked for asylum in calexico  but he was recently sent back to the mexican city of mexicali to wait for his immigration hearing the closest american immigration court is 30 minutes away  but mr  nuez was told he had to report for his hearing at the san ysidro port  a nearly three hour drive he has no car  is sleeping in a shelter with about 370 other people and is trying to figure out how to get to san ysidro  i was thinking about that  he said last week  scratching his head  how i was going to manage in a lawsuit filed in february in federal court in san francisco  the american civil liberties union accused the government of violating immigration law by returning asylum seekers to mexico  the trump administration has maintained it has broad discretion over removal proceedings jacqueline

kidnapped by another cartel in mexico  he escaped after 15 days and he went to the united states border to seek asylum immigration authorities diverted him to tijuana  last week  he appeared in immigration court in san diego  where ms  scott argued that he had a fear of persecution in mexico  he was sent back again i told them everything  but they didnt seem to care  the migrant said in a text message that was viewed by the new york times  which is withholding his name for security concerns some migrants face additional delays from immigration judges who insist they find legal counsel before their cases can move forward denis rostran  of honduras  said he called 10 lawyers who were listed on a document that department of homeland security officials gave to him when he was sent back to tijuana  none answered  mr  rostran said he has slept some nights on the street and has been robbed twice a department of homeland security official said it was committed to ensuring migrants have legal assistance at no cost to the government  the agency also is not forcing migrants to return to mexico who would more likely than not be persecuted or tortured there  the official said twenty shelters and churches in tijuana are housing around 3 000 migrants  and have almost reached their limit  said esmeralda siu  the executive coordinator of the migrant defense coalition  in the mexican state of baja california  many of the migrants are awaiting their court dates  she said  and do not expect to leave soon that means that newly arrived and future migrants will have few  if any  options for shelter theres no city  no state  that has sufficient resources to prepare for this  said gustavo magallanes corts  the director of migration affairs for baja california  theyve allowed these people to return  but cut the resources for migrants  which has led to chaos  every day a shelter calls me and says  ive run out of food but many of the waiting migrants are determined to keep hope many people say theyre doing this just so we get tired and give up on our cases  said daniela diaz  19  who said she left el salvador after a member of the ms 13 gang threatened to rape and kill her  she has been living in a shelter in tijuana since late january she is frustrated that following the rules and asking for asylum at a legal port of entry  instead of sneaking into the united states  have resulted in a system of immigration purgatory theres a lot of people throwing themselves over the wall  ms  diaz said  and were doing this the fair way .
hi  welcome to on politics  your guide to the day in national politics  im lisa lerer  your host a lot has been made of the new democratic majority in the house  theyre young  female  diverse  outspoken all the focus on democrats made us curious about what being in the new congress looks like from the other side of the aisle representative dan crenshaw  a former navy seal with no prior experience in elected office  has emerged as one of the stars of the new republican class  he survived a crowded primary race and a runoff for the republican nomination last year  en route to winning his houston area district but real fame came shortly after the election  when mr  crenshaw  who wears an eye patch because of an injury he suffered in afghanistan  appeared on saturday night live to rebut the comedian pete davidson  who had mocked mr  crenshaw as looking like a hit man from a porno movie  the two offered a sincere plea for civility  and a political star was born since then  mr  crenshaws staunch support for president trumps border wall and his fiery presence on social media have some republicans calling him the conservative answer to alexandria ocasio cortez we recently talked with mr  crenshaw about the wall  social media and civility in politics  the interview was conducted before mr  trump agreed on a border deal  but we decided to leave in those parts of the conversation  because the debate over the wall isnt going away anytime soon  as usual  our interview has been edited and condensed for clarity lisa  you came into congress in the middle of the shutdown  was that frustrating  i mean  youre here to make a difference  presumably  and you enter in a stalemate  dan crenshaw  the frustrating part for me is why we were shut down  you cant just be mad at a shutdown  you do have to take a side  and in the end  this shutdown boils down to  5 billion over basically extending the authorizations weve had in the past  thats whats frustrating  that were actually arguing over that well  its about the wall  right  sure  to me  its frustrating that we cant come to a deal  i mean  the idea of a government shutdown  its a consequence of our system  the president is under no obligation to sign the spending bills that congress gives to him  and once that happens  once he says no  then youre supposed to negotiate  so the frustrating part was to see how the democrats refused to negotiate that didnt really make it out into the media very much because  i mean  we can say it all we want  but the media  generally speaking  the cnn pundits and the new york times  will generally call it the trump shutdown  because he owned it initially  i get that  but once he owned it  he asked to negotiate  and i think thats a pretty fair ask  he did not have anyone to negotiate with  so that was frustrating  to watch that play out from the inside now  it looks like maybe the deal will be less money for the wall  or some kind of fencing the semantics over wall versus fencing  first of all  are highly misleading  trumps plan has been what normal people would describe as fencing for a long time now  i get that he still calls it a wall  but thats because in our english language a normal person would go up to what we have on the border right now and say its a wall  or a fence  and theyd both be right what were actually talking about is steel bollard fencing  again  its a mass misinformation campaign by the other side on this  and thats been amplified by a lot of the media  is that were just talking about 2 000 miles of  like  concrete wall  its so unbelievably false i want like a giant reset button to be like  o k   lets start the debate over  because i wasnt here when we started the debate  now i am  id like us to be very honest about what were talking about sounds like youre describing a messaging problem for republicans  i dont have all the answers  but i think the way id describe the right way to message is to help people understand the why behind the what  its like  why do i believe we need extra fencing down the southern border  and in a deeper why than just  hey  its security and murders and crime  some of thats true  but it leads us into a debate about how much crime and how much drugs the why is  we enforce our laws  and because we believe in our own sovereignty  and i believe that illegal immigrants shouldnt be able to cut in front of legal immigrants  thats a better why traditionally in washington  there was an idea that as a new member you come in and keep a low profile  you  and other freshmen  are clearly taking a different approach  why  there was no  like  decision point  they listen to me because i just have a large following  and yeah  i got famous on national tv theres a sequence of events that drew us here  its like  you know  why is a o c   alexandria ocasio cortez  famous  its just that story of beating joe crowley  once that hooks people  and youve got that following  thats sort of self perpetuating  there isnt really a rule  necessarily  that the leadership tries to keep freshmen from talking youve used some of that platform to call for a return to civility  what does that look like for you  it just looks like  dont question the other peoples character you can be pretty sharp  particularly on twitter yeah  i can be sharp  but what i never say is  you know  let me give an example of what they do to us all the time  you cant say that because youre a white christian man  thats not civil  thats avoiding the debate of ideas and attacking a person because of who they are  thats not o k i will attack ideas very hard  i am not shy about that one bit  so i dont want people to think that because i had a call for civility that that means i shy away from debate and that im agreeable  thats not the case  what is the case is that i will not question who you are as a person you can say that your ideas are bad for america  and frankly un american  but dont say the person is a traitor  thats the line that we should aspire to  at least in the short term do you think the president crosses that line well  lets see  im trying to think of some examples lyin ted  liddle marco  horseface  i can keep going yeah  those are examples  sure so name calling  in general  is bad  and then what i see from the other side is like  if youre calling someone a racist  bigot  homophobe  and they have their list  right  and thats terrible  you know what  with everything happening in virginia right now  are we all on social media calling him a racist  no  actually  were saying you did something racist  see  thats the difference  to say someone is a racist  versus saying you did something or said something that could be perceived as racist you think theres a way to unwind this new tone just be part of the solution and not part of the problem  thats the only way  read the latest edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter from the times about life where the united states and

suppose one night there is a knock on your door  you open it to find 100 bedraggled families shivering in your yard  exhausted  filthy  terrified  the first cry of your heart would be to take them in  but youd know there were too many but youd still do something  youd rally your neighbors and the local authorities and put some system in place  some way to provide immediate care  figure out who these people were and how  within your means  you could lift them up and this is precisely what the u s  has failed to do in handling the refugees who are flooding across the southern border  there is nothing remotely like an adequate system in place to handle the hundreds of thousands of people fleeing violence in central america or seeking economic opportunity  and there is no prospect of a plan being put in place from either republicans or democrats and in that way the border crisis is paradigmatic of our politics right now  both parties are content to adopt abstract ideological postures  neither is interested in creating a functioning system that balances trade offs and actually works  in the age of trump  national politics is showbiz  self righteous performance art to make the base feel good about itself the trump show is all about toughness and cruelty  the administration adopted a zero tolerance policy that was supposed to deter potential immigrants  it failed miserably  roughly 103 000 unauthorized immigrants reached the u s  mexico border in march  twice as many as in march 2018 aside from baring his fangs  trump is uninterested in processing the extra refugees  the facilities are overwhelmed  over 800 000 people already have their cases pending  new asylum seekers are held for a couple of weeks  dumped out on the streets  and most will wait until 2021 to get their formal hearings  my colleagues michael shear  miriam jordan and manny fernandez cite the words officials are using to describe the situation  operational emergency  systemwide meltdown  the system is on fire the field is wide open for the democrats to come forth with a decent plan  but on many issues the 2020 democrats arent really having a primary campaign  theyre having a purity test  the candidates are not sure if they can deviate from wherever the social media warriors have defined the leftward edge  so the democratic show consists of indignant generalities intended to sound radical while changing nothing many democrats in congress are denying there even is a crisis on the border  the only democratic candidate with an immigration plan so far is julin castro  who wants to repeal a 1929 provision that made illegal entry a federal crime  others gesture toward the open border crowd with policies like eliminating ice  this is trumpian extremism reversed immigration is one of those issues on which the extreme positions are wrong  because the correct answer means balancing competing goods on the one hand  these people are our neighbors  many of them come to us with harrowing stories of husbands murdered  daughters raped  mass extortion  its our obligation and joy to reach out to them with a hand of solidarity  its barbarism to send them back to lawlessness on the other hand  many who are coming across seeking asylum do not qualify for it  when they get their hearings  only 20 percent win the right to stay in the united states because theyd face persecution in their home countries  many come for traditional economic reasons  the murder rate in el salvador has fallen in half since 2015  while the number of asylum seekers has skyrocketed the u s  cannot take in everybody who wants to come  so the first task is to set priorities  the victims of violence and persecution get top priority  then those being systemically denied their basic rights because their country has become a failed state  then those seeking economic betterment then you create a system to implement those priorities  over the short term do the things any practical mayor would do  build new detention centers at the border  expand the capacities at the ports of entry  expand the number of judge teams  to speed through the backlog  create an orderly release procedure coordinated with humanitarian agencies  increase the number of counselors so refugees can navigate the system  vet children in their home countries for refugee status so they dont have to make a fruitless trip over the long term  you help build better police and justice systems in the home countries  you cooperate with mexico to jointly tackle this challenge we face together  you might shift to a more skills based immigration system while increasing the number of refugees we take in each year designing a practical response that wins widespread support is  in theory  not hard  but it requires starting with a certain question  what can we do to help them  much of todays politics starts from a different question  what posture can i adopt that will reflect well on me  what can i say to prove im manly or woke this is what happens when the politics of practical action get replaced by the politics of performative narcissism .
with president trumps border wall tied up by his fight with congressional democrats  and public opinion about the wall mixed  kris kobach wants to take matters into his own hands fresh from his defeat in the race for kansas governor  mr  kobach  the former kansas secretary of state  is involved in an audacious new project  a privately funded wall along the mexican border mr  kobach  a hard line ally of president trump known for his strident stand on immigration  has long advocated a tough border policy he is currently an advisory board member of we build the wall inc  a nonprofit group that has collected more than  12 million toward the effort  mr  kobach says the group has obtained the presidential seal of approval for the private initiative president trump gave the undertaking his blessing in a telephone conversation wednesday night  according to mr  kobach  the white house press office did not respond to requests for comment  mr  kobach  52  says the group will begin construction soon on its first section of the wall on donated property  likely in texas  and that the work can be completed cheaply and efficiently by the private sector the private wall idea is an outgrowth of a plan started in december as a gofundme campaign by brian kolfage  a disabled air force veteran living in florida who says the impetus for his project was mounting public frustration over the governments failure to reach an agreement on border protection after raising nearly  20 million  the organization was forced to contact donors because it hadnt reached its initial goal of  1 billion  at that point  contributions would be automatically returned to donors unless they opted back in  mr  kobach said that efforts to retain contributors had been very successful  with 94 percent of those contacted transferring the money into the new effort mr  kobach  who is considering a 2020 run for the united states senate seat being vacated by pat roberts  said he is currently an unpaid adviser to the organization but added that he might take a major administrative role as the project grows  asked whether he would be compensated at that point  mr  kobach said he was not sure we caught up with mr  kobach this week by telephone  his remarks were condensed and edited for clarity  q  i understand that youre on the board of an organization thats promoting a private wall  can you tell me what the goal is  a  the goal is to facilitate construction of a border wall on private land with private funds along the southern border in conjunction with federal government efforts to construct the wall  have you done any work to see how much thats going to cost  we believe we can build the wall  or build sections of the wall  for well under half the price that the federal government is projecting and perhaps as low as a quarter of the price  quite often the federal government purchases things at prices higher than individuals in the private marketplace  do you have a location in mind right now  do you have landowners who will donate land for this  we have landowners who are inviting us already  well be hopefully breaking ground within weeks  but i dont want to give the names yet  we havent selected where were going to start  it doesnt require the donation of a large amount of land  the landowner retains the land  its not like we build the wall and take possession of the land do you think theres a groundswell of support for this i do think theres a groundswell of support  its an objective that people conceive of very easily  its not rocket science  its not super high technology to construct border barriers democrats have proposed other kinds of mechanisms for securing the border  technology  drones  radar we already have drones and sensors on the border and they seem to think that having more is adequate  drones dont stop people from coming across the border  they merely tell you that someone is coming across the border  i dont think the people who are proposing the drones only are serious about stopping the flow of illegal immigration what are people in kansas telling you in kansas  support for the wall is very strong  we havent done any polling or outreach on the specific question of we build the wall organization  but certainly support for building a wall or a series of barriers on the border is very high have you reached out to people at homeland security  are they on board with this idea i have not personally but i believe others in our organization have  we intend to cooperate and to the extent possible collaborate with the department of homeland security  the objective is to assist and to create a system of sections that ultimately connect and serve one another i talked with the president  and the we build the wall effort came up  the president said the project has my blessing  and you can tell the media that do you see this as an alternative to a federal project i see it as a supplement to a federal project  the  5 7 billion would not secure the entire border  even if democrats gave the president everything hes asking for in the current discussion  there will be hundreds of miles of gaps collectively that still wouldnt be secured  so these private efforts will help supplement and fill in the gaps that still exist after  if and when the president is able to complete the sections of wall that hes proposing  some people might say securing the border is a government function just like air traffic control it is correct that securing the border is a government function  but when the government fails  it has a specific and significant impact on individual landowners  so the failure to secure the border affects me in kansas indirectly and it affects you in new york indirectly  but the landowner who has the ranch right on the border is affected in a way that is 1 000 percent greater than what you and i would experience  the biggest effects are litter and security  the traffickers  as theyre bringing their migrants through  theyre constantly dumping clothing  food containers and trash on the ranchers land  and then theres an environmental impact  but the biggest impact for individual landowners is security sounds like youre looking at this from the standpoint of private property rights and the rights of private landowners exactly  in this project the rights of private landowners intersect perfectly with the objectives of the u s  government  ostensibly  members of both parties say they want to secure the border  the landowner needs to secure the border because of the damage being done in terms of litter and in terms of public safety and in terms of trespassing i have heard stories of landowners who like the open border because theyve made friends with people who live on the mexican side and theyre neighbors in that case if a landowner doesnt want to have any fencing or barriers on his project  he wouldnt be someone we would be working with .
president trump has been eager to show progress on construction of his long promised wall on the border with mexico  so eager that on wednesday he sent a tweet showing the building of steel fencing in southern new mexico with the video sped up to add a sense of both efficiency and urgency he retweeted himself on thursday with the all caps proclamation the wall is under construction right now  this is misleading the government has built about 700 miles of wall and fencing along the border since 2006  the barriers  damaged by migrants trying to get through them or by the elements  need periodic repairs the section of the barrier that mr  trump showcased this week was not new construction  but rather replacement for existing fencing  the money for the steel slatted barrier came from a congressional appropriation in 2017  not from newly authorized spending in the recent deal that averted a government shutdown  or from money the president is seeking to take from other federal projects under his national emergency declaration from last week a construction contract for the replacement bollard fencing was awarded on jan  22  2018  to a company in montana  according to a news release from united states customs and border protection  the area of the border wall replacement will be a 20 mile section of existing vehicle barrier located just west of the santa teresa port of entry and extending westward in new mexico  the release said  the existing barrier will be replaced with an 18  to 30 foot high bollard style wall the contract called for the project to be completed in about 390 days  the agency also highlighted the benefits of the see through characteristics of the bollard wall mr  trump noted that the project finished ahead of schedule whether there will be new wall or fence construction in that area is an open question  new mexico is among the states suing the trump administration to challenge his emergency declaration curious about the accuracy of a claim  email factcheck nytimes com .
as president trump declared a national emergency on friday to bypass congress and build his long promised wall  he again painted a portrait of a lawless  chaotic border and cited arguments about the effectiveness of the kind of barrier he has in mind that were not rooted in facts illegal border crossings have been declining for decades  while families are overwhelming an immigration system devised to handle single men  a border wall would not prevent them from seeking asylum  which is legal  research does not show that immigrants commit more crimes than native born americans  and a wall would do little to prevent drugs and human trafficking at the border  as official ports of entry are the main route into the united states for both cumulatively  mr  trumps unsupported or misleading statements undercut his rationale for declaring an emergency  a step that is widely viewed as testing both constitutional and political norms and is sure to draw legal challenges  mr  trump is correct that there were 23 murders in el paso last year  compared with more than 1 200 murders in ciudad jurez  mexico  but the disparity predates the existence of border barriers separating the two towns in 2007  the year before border fencing construction began  el paso reported 17 murders while jurez recorded about 320 homicides  before the drug war between cartels escalated in 2010  after the barriers were largely completed  el paso recorded five murders before the number increased to 16 a year later  that same year  murders in jurez topped 3 600 before declining to over 2 000 in 2011  mr  trump was referring to the flow of drugs across the border and disputing arguments that most smuggling takes place not in remote areas where a wall might be built but through authorized border crossing points  or ports of entry  the relevant statistics come from mr  trumps own agencies  not democrats  data from customs and border protection shows that 80 percent to 90 percent of heroin  cocaine  methamphetamine and fentanyl is seized at ports of entry  marijuana is the exception   the drug enforcement administration noted that a small percentage of all heroin is seized at areas between ports of entry you can  for example  the justice department recently detailed how an international sex trafficking ring committed visa fraud to transport women from thailand into the united states and coerce them into the sex trade  about 80 percent of human trafficking victims passed through official ports of entry  according to a decades worth of data collected by the counter trafficking data collaborative  the polaris project  a group that works to prevent human trafficking in the united states  said in a statement that out of nearly 50 000 cases it has handled  the vast majority of victims arrive through ports of entry  israel built a wall along its border with egypt in 2013  and it has proved to be effective  israeli officials have said that illegal crossings decreased to 12 in 2014 from more than 16 000 in 2011  a 99 percent reduction whether that example could be applied to the united states is another matter  as politifact has reported  the border between israel and egypt is much shorter than the united states mexico border  along flat land as opposed to mountainous terrain  israel also invested in technology and manpower to guard its border mr  trump is right that previous presidents have issued 58 national emergency declarations since 1978  30 of which are still in effect  but those declarations have largely dealt with crises and conflicts abroad examples include blocking transactions with the taliban  prohibiting the importation of diamonds from sierra leone  placing restrictions on north korea and allowing faster treatment during the swine flu outbreak in 2009 mr  trumps declaration  however  is extraordinary in that it addresses a domestic policy issue and involves redirecting money without the approval of congress the funding deal passed by congress on thursday authorized  1 375 billion for border fencing  which is less than the  1 6 billion that senators proposed last june and that mr  trump rejected  asked about his reaction to the reduced funding  mr  trump misleadingly cited comments made by speaker nancy pelosi at a news conference in january  while the government was still partially shut down  ms  pelosi jokingly said that she would agree to give mr  trump  1 for his border wall  but ms  pelosi and democrats have consistently drawn a distinction between the wall and border security  referring to employing technology enhancements and additional personnel as well as barriers  at that same january news conference  ms  pelosi and other democrats promoted a bill that included  1 3 billion for border fencing and would have temporarily reopened the government  mr  trump also repeated four other claims about immigration and his border wall that the new york times has previously fact checked  curious about the accuracy of a claim  email factcheck nytimes com  .
as congressional negotiators were wrestling their way toward a compromise bill to fund the federal government this week  one sticking point emerged  the demand by democrats to reduce the number of beds for immigrants detained by immigration and customs enforcement  and while the details are complicated  democrats claim that the legislation  which president trump is expected to sign friday  will bring the number of beds to 40 520  down from 49 057 but while well intentioned  the list of problems with the immigrant detention system is long  if the democrats get their way  they will likely make conditions much worse for the tens of thousands of undocumented migrants and asylum seekers in limbo on both sides of the border cutting back beds highlights two major objections to the detention system  first  the system is an integral component of a private prison industrial complex owned by a handful of companies  whose profits rely on mass incarceration  second  because of the trump administrations criminalization of prospective asylum seekers and undocumented migrants  the vast majority of detainees are either central american families fleeing horrific violence or law abiding central american and mexican members of american society  about 58 percent of detainees have no criminal record  and only 20 percent have been convicted of serious felonies  including selling marijuana  we have spent the last few years researching migrant flows into the united states  and this data is consistent with research our team has conducted with roughly 300 returned central american and mexican migrants  for the most part  central americans were detained after crossing the border as they awaited an asylum hearing  while the majority of mexicans spoke of being raised in the united states  playing by the rules and being apprehended for minor traffic violations  speeding  a broken taillight or driving without a license  none of the handful of deportees who were found guilty of more serious crimes had languished in immigration detention  they had been summarily deported after serving time in federal prison detention facilities also hamper the ability of both prospective refugees and undocumented migrants to gain asylum or to successfully plead their case to remain in the united states  such facilities limit inmates communication with the outside world  a situation further compounded by their remote location  and once locked up  detainees are deprived of the means to earn the income required to hire the professional lawyers they need to have a realistic chance of success the treatment migrants receive in detention centers is inhumane  while the traumas that detained children face are well documented  the adult immigrants we interviewed also told countless stories of abuse  including racist taunts  physical aggression and the deprivation of their most basic needs  jason  a young man voluntarily traveling back to mexico by bus  was apprehended on the bus and detained because his visa had expired two weeks earlier  he was sent to a detention facility  he told us of begging for food  only to have a guard toss a burrito onto the floor of a fly infested cell that reeked of excrement  israel concha  a young man stopped for speeding and separated from his pregnant wife  described an immigration hearing in which he was prevented from even touching his newborn son such stories make it easy to see why democrats pushed to shrink ices capacity to detain people  but cutting back on capacity will not solve the abuses of immigration detention  in fact it is more likely to make things worse  a fact that democrats have quietly conceded by allowing ice to adjust the facilities capacity if they need to  which is why republicans claim the actual number of beds allowed is much higher   it is foolhardy to imagine that  in response  the trump administration will simply detain fewer people  in order to guarantee them all a bed  if anything  it will double down its enforcement of existing policies  rendering the lives of detainees even more of a living hell increasing numbers of prospective asylum seekers  subjected to the remain in mexico policy  would be dispatched to dangerous tent cities in mexican border towns to wait their turn  undocumented immigrants would be herded into increasingly cramped quarters or into county jails where conditions are even worse  florizel  an undocumented mexican teenager and convert to mormonism whom we interviewed  described being apprehended and held in a county jail surrounded by pedophiles and murderers  they left me in the cell for like almost like a whole day without water without food  and it was really cold  i would ask them  hey  but i didn t do anything  and they would just tell me to shut up  friggin mexican despite its horrors  many apprehended undocumented immigrants opt for detention as the least awful option  those without a criminal track record are typically given a choice  they can leave the united states voluntarily  or be placed in detention to fight their removal  the vast majority of people we interviewed chose detention because they want a chance to defend themselves and cant face the prospect of upending their entire lives by leaving  mr  concha opted for detention with the faint hope of preserving his life in the united states  i wanted to fight til the end  he told us  i had a company and all my family was here  i wanted to know the final outcome instead of wondering all my life  what if i would have fought  what if i did have a chance  what if the laws change to the extent that democrats are serious about immigration reform  restricting beds is more a gimmick than a solution  absent the comprehensive reform desperately needed  democrats should use their new political capital to protect migrant rights  that means demanding more humane treatment at detention centers  guaranteeing the right to asylum for refugees from the region  assuring due process for the majority of undocumented migrants who are upstanding members of our society  and requiring that ice focus its resources on detaining and deporting only those migrants who have committed truly serious crimes  we know what is needed  what we lack is the political will and commitment to push forward an agenda that restores humanity and legality to a broken and corrupt system .
 president trump said he is considering releasing migrants in so called sanctuary cities  read the latest here  washington  president trumps top aides considered an idea to pressure immigration agencies to release apprehended migrants into so called sanctuary cities represented by democratic lawmakers  according to several people familiar with the proposal the idea was floated in an email by a top white house policy adviser in november  when mr  trump was furiously condemning migrant caravans from central america headed toward the southwestern border  the people  including two government officials  said in the email dated nov  16  with the subject line sanctuary city proposal  may davis  the deputy white house policy coordinator  raised the idea with officials from the department of homeland security  immigration and customs enforcement and customs and border protection ms  davis suggested that migrants who had been apprehended and were slated to be released into border towns could instead be taken to one of several sanctuary cities  which limit how local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration officers the proponents of the idea inside the white house argued at the time that it would help with overcrowding at nonprofit shelters in border towns by transferring the migrants to cities that already embrace the idea of having more immigrants  one official said once there  the migrants would be released onto the streets  potentially sending a message to the democratic politicians who oppose mr  trumps immigration agenda and his demands for a wall along the border with mexico the idea has been raised by one to two principals that  if we are unable to build sufficient temporary housing  that caravan members be bused to small  and mid sized sanctuary cities  ms  davis wrote to the officials at the agencies  she added  there is not a white house decision on this matthew albence  the acting deputy director of ice  objected to the idea  telling the white house that there would be liability issues if a migrant were injured during transport  he also raised concerns that the agencys budget had not been appropriated for that purpose in an email  mr  albence responded that the proposal would create an unnecessary operational burden on the department and added that he did not know how paying extra to transport migrants to another location was a justified expenditure mr  albence is in line to run ice after the departure this week of ronald d  vitiello  whom mr  trump pushed out because the president said he was not responding to the surge of immigrants in a tough enough fashion this was a suggestion that was floated and rejected  which ended any further discussion  a spokesman for the department of homeland security said in a statement on thursday evening in a statement from the white house  an official called the proposal a nonstory and said that these are illegal aliens already being released and sent to u s  communities every day the administrations position is that we want to deport  not release  illegal aliens  the official said the plan to transport migrants to sanctuary cities  which was first reported thursday evening by the washington post  did not go into effect  according to the officials but the white house did raise the idea again several months later  in february  suggesting that releasing the immigrants into the sanctuary cities would be a way of punishing democrats for resisting budget requests for more money to detain undocumented immigrants  according to one person familiar with it a white house official denied that punishing the democratic lawmakers was the primary purpose of the idea  the official said that it was an effort to deal more efficiently with migrants who were already going to be released but at that time  officials at the department of homeland security once again raised significant concerns about the ideas legality  and the proposal was not carried out a spokeswoman for speaker nancy pelosi  democrat of california  who represents san francisco  one of the most high profile sanctuary cities in the country  condemned the idea on thursday night the extent of this administrations cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated  said ashley etienne  a spokeswoman for ms  pelosi  using human beings  including little children  as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable  and in some cases  criminal ms  etienne added  the american people have resoundingly rejected this administrations toxic anti immigrant policies  and democrats will continue to advance immigration policies that keep us safe and honor our values mr  trump has frequently  and harshly  criticized sanctuary cities  saying their actions are a violation of federal immigration laws and allow violent criminals who are undocumented immigrants back onto the streets instead of being deported during his campaign for the presidency  mr  trump often cited the case of kate steinle  who was killed by an undocumented immigrant in san francisco  he mentioned the case during a key immigration speech in 2016  months before the election another victim is kate steinle  mr  trump said  gunned down in the sanctuary city of san francisco  by an illegal immigrant  deported five previous times  and they knew he was no good as president  he has continued to lash out at sanctuary cities  in remarks in the east room in january 2018  mr  trump said that sanctuary cities were the best friends of gangs and cartels one person familiar with the proposal to transport migrants to sanctuary cities said that none of the proposals came directly from stephen miller  the architect of the presidents immigration agenda and the top domestic policy adviser in the white house but the person said that department of homeland security officials understood that mr  miller was a chief advocate of the idea  mr  miller did not respond to a request for comment on thursday night but mr  albence said in a statement issued late thursday by the department that as the acting deputy  i was not pressured by anyone at the white house on this issue i was asked my opinion and provided it and my advice was heeded  he said  the email exchange is clear  and suggesting that it indicates inappropriate pressure is inaccurate the ideas existence was revealed as mr  trump and mr  miller have begun to purge the immigration agencies of officials they believe have not worked aggressively enough to prevent the surge of migrants at the border and to advance the presidents hard line immigration agenda in addition to mr  vitiello  mr  trump pushed out kirstjen nielsen  the secretary of homeland security  and claire grady  the acting deputy secretary of the department  the president also appears poised to oust two other top immigration officials at the department in the coming days a senior administration official told reporters this week that when it comes to the administrations core priorities on immigration  many of them have been moving too slowly or moving in the wrong direction at immigration agencies .
after prompting the longest government shutdown in history  president trumps divisive proposal for a border wall has taken a back seat in recent days for negotiators in congress who are seeking to avoid another crippling closure  the latest talks have focused on another immigration issue that has exploded in recent months  record numbers of migrants being held in cramped detention centers under orders to end the process that the president calls catch and release  the authorities have arrested and jailed tens of thousands of migrants since mr  trump took office  and republicans would like it to stay that way democrats argue that ordinary immigrants around the country are being unnecessarily plucked from their families and jailed  and newly arrived migrants are being forced to wait unreasonable lengths of time in harsh detention centers at issue is how much money the budget should provide for detention  without more money  the authorities will have to scale back on arrests well be releasing gang members  well be releasing individuals convicted of domestic violence and drug crimes  said matthew albence  deputy director of immigration and customs enforcement  we will not be able to respond to as many calls as we do today  and in fact  in many of these calls  were going to tell them  just release them  because we have no choice democrats point out that more than a quarter of current ice detainees are not subject to mandatory detention under the law both republicans and democrats are citing competing data to claim that the new budget proposal advances their goals  heres what the plan really says months of brinkmanship between congress and the white house over the border wall have distracted from the issue of detention  which has now reached a breaking point  with the authorities being urged by the white house to arrest more immigrants than they can currently afford to detain with little support for a robust border wall on either side of the aisle within congress  republicans and democrats have moved on to detention  which is also expensive  and has implications for recent border crossers as well as immigrants with firmly established roots in the united states mr  trumps strict enforcement agenda has pushed the population of detained immigrants to the highest levels in history  with the authorities sweeping into immigrant heavy locales to arrest vast numbers of the undocumented  as well as immigrants who have violated the terms of their visas  usually through criminal convictions   making them deportable under sweeping policy changes introduced by mr  trump  ice has gone after immigrants who were once not targeted  repopularizing workplace raids  arresting community leaders  and using previously frowned upon tactics to ferret out anyone who can be expelled from the country  as a result  the average daily population in immigration detention for the 2019 fiscal year has reached 45 890  ice currently has funding to house only 40 520 people republicans are saying that they secured money for 5 000 additional immigration detention beds  while democrats are saying that they managed to bring down detention numbers by 17 4 percent  technically  both are true  heres why both parties agreed in the proposal to fund an average daily population for 2019 of 45 724 ice detainees  or about 5 000 more than the 2018 budget provided  allowing republicans to claim their success but in order to reach that average by sept  30  the last day of the fiscal year  ice will gradually have to decrease its detained population to 40 520  which represents about a 17 percent decrease from the 49 057 who are currently detained republican aides suggested in internal communications that the number of detained immigrants could reach 58 500 under the proposal through a process called reprogramming  which allows agencies to adjust their budgets to address unforeseen emergencies under reprogramming  federal agencies can take money that has been appropriated by congress for specific matters  and use it to fund other things  and though it is meant to be used sparingly  the department of homeland security has often used reprogramming to fund extra detention beds though it is a common tactic  democrats argue that the amount of money that would need to be reprogrammed in order to reach 58 500 detention beds   750 million  would be unprecedented and they argue that the congressional committees that are now controlled by democrats would never approve such a large amount the department of homeland security has historically deferred to such committees for approval before reprogramming funds  though it is not technically required the deal provides funds for  1 375 billion in physical barriers along the border  far less than the  5 7 billion that mr  trump requested for his border wall  the money could be put toward 55 miles of new fencing  using only currently deployed designs the proposal also provides funding to revamp holding facilities that are used by customs and border protection  which came under renewed scrutiny after the deaths of two young migrant children around christmas and it would refund obama era programs that were eliminated under mr  trump  which had provided alternatives to detention for certain immigrants  those who had been enrolled in the programs were allowed to roam freely  using gps ankle bracelets and other incentives devised to make sure they showed up for court .
corqun  honduras  the farmer stood in his patch of forlorn coffee plants  their leaves sick and wilted  the next harvest in doubt last year  two of his brothers and a sister  desperate to find a better way to survive  abandoned their small coffee farms in this mountainous part of honduras and migrated north  eventually sneaking into the united states then in february  the farmers 16 year old son also headed north  ignoring the familys pleas to stay the challenges of agricultural life in honduras have always been mighty  from poverty and a neglectful government to the swings of international commodity prices but farmers  agricultural scientists and industry officials say a new threat has been ruining harvests  upending lives and adding to the surge of families migrating to the united states  climate change and their worries are increasingly shared by climate scientists as well gradually rising temperatures  more extreme weather events and increasingly unpredictable patterns  like rain not falling when it should  or pouring when it shouldnt  have disrupted growing cycles and promoted the relentless spread of pests the obstacles have cut crop production or wiped out entire harvests  leaving already poor families destitute central america is among the regions most vulnerable to climate change  scientists say  and because agriculture employs much of the labor force  about 28 percent in honduras alone  according to the world bank  the livelihoods of millions of people are at stake last year  the bank reported that climate change could lead at least 1 4 million people to flee their homes in mexico and central america and migrate during the next three decades the united states has allocated tens of millions of dollars in aid in recent years for farmers across central america  including efforts to help them adapt to the changing climate but president trump has vowed to cut off all foreign aid to honduras  guatemala and el salvador because of what he calls their failure to curb the flow of migrants north critics contend the punishment is misguided  though  because it could undermine efforts to address the very problems that are driving people to abandon their farms and head to the united states if donald trump withdraws all the funds for honduras  its going to generate more unemployment  and thats going to generate more migration  said mara esperanza lpez  the general manager of copranil  a coffee growers cooperative here in western honduras  and thats going to result in more abandoned farms coffee cultivators in the region are at particular risk of disruption because the crop is highly sensitive to weather variations fredi onan vicen pea  the coffee farmer whose brothers  sister and teenage son have already given up and joined the exodus north  reached over and tore a leaf off one of his plants it was a mottled yellow and brown  signs of coffee rust  a disease whose spread has been influenced by climate variability  as much as 70 percent of his crop  planted across five acres in a pine forest  had been affected  he estimated  and there was little chance he could salvage it climate change is destroying some farms  said mr  vicen  41 beyond that  some of his healthier plants had begun to blossom nearly two months ahead of schedule because of a heavy unseasonable downpour  throwing the entire growing cycle into doubt this is not something we predicted  mr  vicen said average temperatures have risen by about two degrees fahrenheit in central america over the past several decades  making the cultivation of coffee difficult  if not untenable  at lower altitudes that were once suitable that has forced some farmers to search for land at higher altitudes  switch to other crops  change professions  or migrate some very fine families that have been producing quality coffee for a long time are now facing the decision of whether to stay in coffee  said catherine m  tucker  a professor of anthropology at the university of florida who has done research in honduras for more than two decades some climate scientists say that in the absence of long term meteorological data  it is hard for them to say with certainty whether the increasing variability is caused by long term changes in the regions climate  but  they say  they are leaning in that direction its becoming so unusual  its almost certainly climate change  said dr  edwin j  castellanos  dean of the research institute at the universidad del valle de guatemala  a university in guatemala city  and one of central americas leading scientists in the field of climate change climate change is rarely the sole factor in the decision to migrate  violence and poverty are prime drivers  but climate change can be a tipping point  farmers and experts say small farmers are already living in poverty  theyre already at the threshold of not being able to survive  mr  castellanos said  so any changes in the situation may push them to have enough incentives to leave the outlook for the region seems bleak  reduced yields of coffee and subsistence crops like corn and beans could significantly increase food insecurity and malnutrition  by some predictions  the amount of land suitable for growing coffee in central america could drop by more than 40 percent by 2050 the number of coffee producers in the area where mr  vicen lives has dropped by a quarter in the past decade  to about 9 000 from about 12 000  partly because of pressure from climate change  said marlon danilo meja  the regional coordinator for the honduran coffee institute  an industry trade group a vast majority are small producers  managing less than about nine acres each  he said jos edgardo vicen  37  one of mr  vicens brothers  had weighed migrating for years  he had worked in the coffee fields since he was a boy  continuing the family tradition  in this part of honduras  coffee is a major crop  with an increasing amount bound for north america  europe and asia but after a rust outbreak and other pressures in recent years  including plunging commodity prices  the younger mr  vicen said he could no longer earn enough from his harvest to cover production costs he headed north with his 14 year old son last august  crossed the border illegally and settled in texas  a brother and a sister  driven by similar circumstances  left honduras soon afterward and also sneaked into the united states for the small producer  i promise you  theres no way to get ahead  said mr  vicen  who now works in construction and sends remittances home to support his wife and daughter when he was younger  harvest time was like a party  he recalled  now  there are only losses  no profits fifteen producers from the vicens coffee cooperative  more than 10 percent of its members  have migrated to the united states in the past year  said ms  esperanza lpez  the general manager of the cooperative  they have joined thousands of others from villages in hondurass western highlands stephanie leutert  director of the mexico security initiative at the university of texas at austin  said that government statistics on apprehension of migrants at the southwest border of the united states in recent years reflect a sharp increase in people from western honduras after large caravans of migrants arrived last fall in tijuana  mexico  a united nations survey found that 72 percent of those surveyed were from honduras  and 28 percent of the respondents had worked in the agricultural sector the exodus of farm workers has worsened already serious labor shortages in western honduras  some industry leaders in the region joke that if the caravans in recent months were the laborer caravans  the next wave will be the grower caravans coffee farmers have been scrambling to adjust to the changes  learning which species are more resistant to plague and drought  and branching out into other crops  like cacao  avocados or trees that produce construction grade wood nongovernmental and public private initiatives have also taken root in coffee growing regions of central america and around the world to help guide farmers  some have received the backing of the worlds biggest coffee sellers  like starbucks  tim hortons and lavazza  trying to ensure their future supply yet even the application of best practices is no guarantee that everything will be fine the weather is crazy  said carlos pea orellana  58  a farmer and member of a local coffee cooperative  everythings out of control he owns 12 acres of land but can afford to farm only about five  he gets by with income from a tomato greenhouse he built with the cooperatives help  and with remittances from two sons who migrated to the united states after struggling through the rust crisis of 2012 13 theyre helping to revive the farm  he said at his ramshackle ranch one recent afternoon  its really difficult now he turned to his youngest son  carlos  12  and saw a future migrant  pointing a leathery finger  he said  youre next  right  mr  pea chuckled  the boy squirmed  saying nothing .
 what you need to know to start the day  get new york today in your inbox  facing serious overcrowding in immigration courts  federal authorities in new york adopted a high tech solution last year  immigrants would be kept in detention centers for their legal proceedings  appearing before judges only by videoconference now  a new lawsuit claims that the policy infringes upon immigrants constitutional rights in a deliberate attempt to speed up and increase deportations the lawsuit  filed on tuesday in the federal district court in manhattan  asserted that detained immigrants could not fully communicate with their lawyers and participate in proceedings when their only interaction with immigration court was through video as a result  the lawsuit said  immigrants who might otherwise be granted the ability to stay in the united states instead could be deported  the suit cited several instances when videoconferencing had harmful effects on immigrants and their hearings one immigrant spent three extra months in detention because his jails one videoconferencing line connecting inmates to immigration court had been double booked another was afraid to testify about his sexual orientation because immigrations and customs enforcement officers at the detention facility where he was being held were listening as he spoke to the court in a videocall the interpreter for a third had difficulty understanding an immigrant as he sobbed through his two hour testimony  because his words were muffled over the audio feed of the videoconference ice has justified videoconferencing as an efficient way to address the backlog at the immigration court on varick street in manhattan an ice spokeswoman said she could not comment on pending litigation but the lawsuit said the videoconferencing was merely pretext for the true reasoning behind the policy  limiting due process  access to the courts and counsel for immigrants in an effort to rush deportations and deport more people immigration courts have been overwhelmed by cases for over a decade  but the suit put a spotlight on efforts under the trump administration to tackle the backlog by speeding up proceedings  the strategy has drawn criticism from immigration lawyers  advocates and judges  who argue that expediting proceedings can rob immigrants of a fair trial to address overwhelmed dockets  former attorney general jeff sessions announced in april 2017 that the department of justice would bring on an additional 125 immigration judges  at least 44 of whom have been hired mr  sessions also imposed policy changes the justice department called common sense reforms to increase the efficiency of immigration courts but immigration lawyers argued that prioritizing speed has come at the expense of due process this push toward efficiency over due process is particularly trumpian  andrea senz  the supervising attorney at brooklyn defender services  said  the videoconferencing policy in new york is part of a larger trend of addressing the backlog by focusing on what the government or ice thinks is faster or cheaper  instead of giving people full and fair hearings  ms  senz said the plaintiffs in the federal suit include brooklyn defender services  the legal aid society and the bronx defenders  all of which offer free legal services to immigrants facing deportation as a part of the new york immigrant family unity project  a program funded by the new york city council  low income people in immigration detention do not otherwise have a right to a lawyer if they cannot afford one in previous years  judges frequently used their discretion to close some cases they deemed low priority  to take them off their dockets indefinitely and reduce the backlog but mr  sessions restricted judges ability to do so  arguing in a decision in september that closing certain cases was not a free floating power an immigration judge may invoke solely to create space on their docket  advocates said this has added to the backlog in june  the ice field office in new york announced the policy in which detained immigrants would appear in court by videoconference instead of being brought to the court on varick street at the time  ice officials presented the policy as a security measure  after a group of demonstrators gathered outside the court to protest the administrations zero tolerance immigration policy the announcement also came three days after president trump suggested that people who came into the united states illegally be sent back to their home countries without due process  the suit noted when somebody comes in  we must immediately  with no judges or court cases  bring them back from where they came  mr  trump said on twitter even when the varick street protests ended  the new york policy remained in place  the use of videoconferencing is more efficient  providing an economic savings to taxpayers  while continuing to ensure the safety of ice employees  the court  the public and the detainees  an ice spokeswoman said in a statement in december videoconferencing is sometimes used in regions where judges are hours away from the jails  prisons and detention facilities where immigrants are held to help expedite procedural matters  such as scheduling hearings or accepting documents a 2015 study by the u c l a  law professor ingrid eagly found that deportation proceedings of detained immigrants heard by videoconference were adjudicated more quickly  in fewer days and with fewer trials  than those heard in person  but detained immigrants whose cases were heard through videoconferencing were also more likely to be deported in new york  the introduction of videoconferencing for all proceedings meant that lawyers could no longer conduct on site interviews to determine if a detained immigrant was eligible for free legal services  discuss how a client wanted to proceed in their case  or review strategies and clarify facts confidentially videoconferencing does not always paint a complete picture of a detained immigrant  said judge amiena khan  speaking as the executive vice president of the national association of immigration judges  the judges union  sometimes its more difficult to interact  to judge eye contact and nonverbal cues like body language  all of which are critical to making determinations about an immigrants claims  ms  khan said the suit  which is seeking class action status  claimed that it was also more difficult for detainees to follow proceedings by video  especially when there were technology failures or when people required translators  who could not do simultaneous interpretation unless the immigrant appeared in person additionally  the suit contended that a shortage of videoconferencing lines and the failure of the technology had resulted in immigration judges routinely delaying scheduled proceedings or adjourning them altogether when lines were not available  prolonging immigrants detention .
to the editor re trump declares national emergency to build border wall  nytimes com  feb  15  if some migrant workers and asylum seekers illegally crossing the southern border constitute a national emergency  then what to think of the tens of thousands of americans lost to gun violence each year  the growing number of americans without access to affordable health insurance and the existential threat of our increasingly extreme climate if republicans in congress do not immediately rebuke this reckless and unconstitutional subversion of congresss own power of the purse  and if the increasingly partisan federal judiciary signs off on this obvious abuse of authority  then a dangerous precedent has indeed been set and in that case  i very much look forward to a democratic president declaring a state of emergency to ban assault weapons after the next school shooting  to create a universal medicare opt in for the uninsured  and to impose a large scale reordering of our fossil fuel based economy after the next devastating wildfires or hurricanes republicans will rue this latest capitulation to this lawless president  yet perhaps the country will come to be better off for it nikhil singhshelton  conn to the editor how much waste of time  money and energy is it going to take for this country to come to its senses and demand that president trump and congress get serious about the business of government mr  trump has conjured up a national emergency where none exists and has tied the entire country in knots for months over a useless wall he wants to build on our southern border to protect us from imaginary threats  meanwhile  nothing is being done about the issues that will eventually have real consequences for the country if this isnt dereliction of duty  i dont know what is stuart mathnew yorkto the editor to paraphrase that famous quote  first the president came for the justice department  but the republicans in congress did not speak out because they were not part of the justice department  then the president came for the free press  but the republicans in congress did not speak out because they were not journalists and now the president has come for you  congress  he means to usurp your power over appropriations  the most fundamental constitutional power granted to you by the framers  will you leave it to the courts to defend your prerogatives  hoping that there are still some judges and supreme court justices left who are free of trumpian influence  or will you finally  finally speak out for yourselves  forcefully and with one unified voice  nancy starknew yorkto the editor there is no better demonstration of president trumps failure at leadership and governance than his reliance on his emergency declaration powers in order to assemble the funds necessary to build his wall i am reminded of the spoiled kid who resolves to take his ball home because he cant win the game by playing by the rules  in this case  our constitutional separation of powers  of course  it is his teammates  the republicans in congress  who stand to lose the most because they are no longer in the ballgame  they have kowtowed to their neighborhood bully once too often and may as well go home themselves if mr  trumps border wall truly had merit  the case to be made would be straightforward  instead we have a president who must desperately make stuff up to stay in a game that he doesnt know how to play don kruppsan diegoto the editor senator marco rubio says  if today the national emergency is border security  tomorrow the national emergency might be climate change  conflating a fabricated emergency with a true emergency not only fails to make his point but also shows that mr  rubio does not consider climate change urgent michael ettingerrhinebeck  n y  to the editor the real national emergency is that donald trump believes he is an autocrat and subject to neither constitutional restraints nor existing law  arthur bradley eisenbrey iiigrosse pointe woods  mich .

any onetime mafia investigator who listened to the trump fixer michael cohen testify wednesday would have immediately recognized the congressional hearings historical analogue  what america witnessed on capitol hill wasnt so much john dean turning on president richard nixon  circa 1973  it was the mobster joseph valachi turning on the cosa nostra  circa 1963 the valachi hearings  led by senator john mcclellan of arkansas  opened the countrys eyes for the first time to the mafia  as the witness broke omert  the code of silence  to speak in public about this thing of ours  cosa nostra  he explained just how organized organized crime actually was  with soldiers  capos  godfathers and even the commission  the governing body of the various mafia families fighting the mafia posed a uniquely hard challenge for investigators  mafia families were involved in numerous distinct crimes and schemes  over yearslong periods  all for the clear benefit of its leadership  but those very leaders were tough to prosecute because they were rarely involved in the day to day crime  they spoke in their own code  rarely directly ordering a lieutenant to do something illegal  but instead offering oblique instructions or expressing general wishes that their lieutenants simply knew how to translate into action those explosive  and arresting  hearings led to the 1970 passage of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act  better known as rico  a law designed to allow prosecutors to go after enterprises that engaged in extended  organized criminality  rico laid out certain predicate crimes  those that prosecutors could use to stitch together evidence of a corrupt organization and then go after everyone involved in the organization as part of an organized conspiracy  while the headline grabbing rico predicates were violent crimes like murder  kidnapping  arson and robbery  the statute also focused on crimes like fraud  obstruction of justice  money laundering and even aiding or abetting illegal immigration it took prosecutors a while to figure out how to use rico effectively  but by the mid 1980s  federal investigators in the southern district of new york were hitting their stride under none other than the crusading united states attorney rudy giuliani  who as the head of the southern district brought charges in 1985 against the heads of the citys five dominant mafia families ever since  s d n y  prosecutors and f b i  agents have been the nations gold standard in rico prosecutions  a fact that makes clear precisely why  after mr  cohens testimony  president trumps greatest legal jeopardy may not be in the investigation by the special counsel  robert mueller what lawmakers heard wednesday sounded a lot like a racketeering enterprise  an organization with a few key players and numerous overlapping crimes  not just one conspiracy  but many  even leaving aside any questions about the mueller investigation and the 2016 campaign  mr  cohen leveled allegations that sounded like bank fraud  charity fraud and tax fraud  as well as hints of insurance fraud  obstruction of justice and suborning perjury  the parallels between the mafia and the trump organization are more than we might like to admit  after all  mr  cohen was labeled a rat by president trump last year for agreeing to cooperate with investigators  interestingly  in the language of crime  rats generally arent seen as liars  theyre rats precisely because they turn states evidence and tell the truth  spilling the secrets of a criminal organization mr  cohen was clear about the rot at the center of his former employer  everybodys job at the trump organization is to protect mr  trump  every day most of us knew we were coming and we were going to lie for him about something  that became the norm rico was precisely designed to catch the godfathers and bosses at the top of these crime syndicates  people a step or two removed from the actual crimes committed  those whose will is made real  even without a direct order exactly  it appears  as mr  trump did at the top of his family business  mr  trump did not directly tell me to lie to congress  thats not how he operates  mr  cohen said  mr  trump  mr  cohen said  doesnt give orders  he speaks in code  and i understand that code whats notable about mr  cohens comments is how they paint a consistent  and credible  pattern of mr  trumps behavior  the former f b i  director james comey  in testimony nearly two years ago in the wake of his firing  made almost exactly the same point and used almost exactly the same language  mr  trump never directly ordered him to drop the flynn investigation  mr  comey said  but he made it all too clear what he wanted  the president isolated mr  comey  with no other ears around  and then said he hoped mr  comey can let this go  as mr  comey said  i took it as  this is what he wants me to do  he cited in his testimony then the famous example of king henry iis saying  will no one rid me of this turbulent priest   a question that resulted in the murder of that very meddlesome priest  thomas becket the sheer number and breadth of the investigations into mr  trumps orbit these days indicates how vulnerable the presidents family business would be to just this type of prosecution  in december  i counted 17  and since then  investigators have started an inquiry into undocumented workers at mr  trumps new jersey golf course  another crime that could be a rico predicate  mr  cohens public testimony itself  where he certainly laid out enough evidence and bread crumbs for prosecutors to verify his allegations  mentioned enough criminal activity to build a racketeering case  moreover  rico allows prosecutors to wrap 10 years of racketeering activity into a single set of charges  which is to say  almost precisely the length of time  a decade that michael cohen would have unparalleled insight into mr  trumps operations  similarly  many mafia cases end up being built on wiretaps  just like  for instance  the perhaps 100 recordings mr  cohen says he made of people during his tenure working for mr  trump  recordings that federal investigators are surely poring over as part of the 290 000 documents and files they seized in their april raid last year indicting the whole trump organization as a corrupt enterprise could also help prosecutors address the thorny question of whether the president can be indicted in office  they could lay out a whole pattern of criminal activity  indict numerous players  including perhaps trump family members  and leave the president himself as a named  unindicted co conspirator  such an action would allow investigators to make public all the known activity for congress and the public to consider as part of impeachment hearings or re election  it would also activate powerful forfeiture tools for prosecutors that could allow them to seize the trump organizations assets and cut off its income streams the irony will be that if federal prosecutors decide to move against president trumps empire and family together  hell have one mans model to thank  his own tv lawyer  rudy giuliani  who perfected the template to tackle precisely that type of criminal enterprise .
look at the numbers  and something of a mystery emerges regarding the trump administrations claims of a surge of uncontrolled arrivals net migration across the southern border is at historic lows  border apprehensions of unauthorized arrivals were at the lowest in modern record in 2017 and 2018  apprehensions are up this spring  but still far below the highs of the 1980s  1990s or early 2000s yet processing centers and detention centers are filling  some to near capacity  straining to meet even basic medical needs of migrant families  images from the border show women and children huddling in overcrowded facilities the answer  immigration experts say  is that the crisis isnt primarily caused by the number of arrivals  but by trump administration policies that disperse them to a handful of centers and that treat families who voluntarily surrender as invaders  creating the appearance of an invasion far from being unique to the trump administration  it is merely the latest in a pattern across western democracies  where anti immigration sentiment is driving demand for harsh policies that may not only fail to reduce arrivals  but to also make the problem look even more uncontrolled and overwhelming the causes of that self reinforcing cycle may run far deeper than policy mismatch or even matters of immigration economic dislocation and demographic change have provoked feelings of lost control and lost status among some whites  however real or imagined  it is a combination of forces  research suggests  that taps into deep seated instincts to seek safety in a familiar group identity  and to try to reimpose control those feelings tend to focus on borders  even if undocumented immigration is not actually up  and policies that deliver on desires for a strict response can make the problem appear worse  deepening fears of chaos and of being overwhelmed this feedback loop  building in the united states and europe since long before the latest upticks in arrivals  may be a major driver of the populist revolt  and it is playing into the growing global conflict between old style national identities  imagined as homogeneous and fixed  and a world that no longer aligns with them migration is really tough because  as catherine dauvergne said  its the last bastion of sovereignty  said jaya ramji nogales  an immigration scholar at temple universitys law school  at points in history where the demographic shift is changing  thats an easy thing for people to be scared of some 30 years ago  the united states constructed a wall on its southern border between the san ysidro crossing  which links san diego with tijuana  and the pacific ocean this had an unintended effect  it funneled some migrants onto interstate 5  which cut through the barriers  when a handful were hit by cars  transit authorities posted now infamous yellow signs showing a silhouette of a dashing family  widely known as immigrant crossing signs that gave the impression of utter chaos at the border  said douglas s  massey  a princeton university immigration scholar  but nothing had really changed  we were just hardening the border and pushing people into different places the signs fed into a nationwide backlash against unauthorized immigration  mr  massey said  leading the clinton administration to fund more border walls and nearly double border patrol agents but rather than reducing arrivals  this pushed them into desolate routes across the arizona deserts  crossing sparse ranch lands rather than dense cities  the migrant flows came to look far more numerous  mr  massey said  which made a big impression and fed the narrative that there was this new invasion now  that cycle may be playing out again policies meant to deter arrivals are putting them into a handful of centers  concentrating numbers in a way that makes them appear overwhelming  the policies have also put asylum claimants and families  who take some time to process  into facilities designed to house unauthorized migrant workers who can be deported quickly at the same time  the increase may appear larger than it actually is because a greater share of arrivals are voluntarily surrendering  hoping to apply for asylum  this is a right guaranteed under international law  but administration policy functionally treats them like undocumented immigrants  and even criminals  that feeds perceptions of a surge and creates the overcrowded conditions at detention centers the numbers arent that big  but if youre treating families as criminals and arresting them  holding them  the system cant handle that  said mr  massey  the princeton scholar  it makes it look like theres absolute chaos at the border  but the chaos is because we dont have policies that fit the problem a similar cycle has played out in europe and australia  tightened european union land borders  for example  led more refugees to travel by boats  when they sank  as many did  the horrifying episodes deepened europeans sense of chaos the surge of arrivals to europe in 2015 and 2016 was an undeniable crisis  but it also hit on much deeper issues  that may help explain why it also fed into fears around immigration in the united states psychological research suggests that fears about uncontrolled borders may be tied to deeper fears about loss of identity or loss of control human beings desire the sense of safety they get from a strong  familiar group identity  though white people in western countries remain politically and culturally dominant  rising diversity has left some feeling that their status is under threat this is perhaps why heavily white areas where children are likely to be less well off than their parents had been are especially likely to support mr  trump  according to a gallup study fear that ones in group will decline in relative power  whatever the cause  can make people feel a sense of loss of control  leading them to cling more firmly to their ethnicity and to see outsiders as a threat  it also tends to make people more nationalistic and more skeptical of immigration  according to a recent study of voters in the united states  britain and poland  which found that this fear predicted support for brexit and for mr  trump the border  as perhaps the most obvious symbol of national identity and territorial protection  is a natural focal point for those fears  and so to many people  it feels true that there is a wave of uncontrolled immigrants and chaos at the border  even if arrivals are low in historic terms and many of the migrants are simply families seeking asylum it may also feel urgently necessary to reimpose order but stricter border policies tend to attract more attention and controversy  and can end up making immigration fears seem even more salient  as the news shows desperate people huddled in makeshift camps  creating the impression of a swamped border  the cycle repeats these sentiments align near perfectly with the drivers of right wing populism  a sense of lost control  a desire to reassert order and a narrowing national identity  and that populist sentiment can feed back into itself global immigration flows are expected to increase over the long term due to climate change  deepening economic disparities and technology assisted ease of travel  demographic trends  though easily overstated  are already making western countries more diverse a populist sentiment that calls for resisting this long underway change is likely to only heighten awareness of it  much like the strict border policies that tend to worsen the appearance of disorder the resulting policies can have the opposite of their intended effect when the clinton administration stepped up deportations  it relocated american born gangs like ms 13 to central america  where they flourished in an environment of poverty and state weakness  today  many central american families are fleeing that gang violence for the united states  in response  mr  trump has cut aid to three countries most threatened by gang violence these policies can bring significant harm to the migrants and refugees that they target when you have women and children behind fences under a bridge  thats bad optics  mr  massey said  referring to makeshift migrant detention practices in texas that left children sleeping on gravel and under mylar blankets  its causing a lot of human damage .
las vegas  president trump on saturday again declared that the united states was full and called its asylum system a scam  tying his push to close the countrys borders to undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers to an entreaty for jewish voters to support his re election campaign our systems full  our countrys full  mr  trump said  speaking to an audience that included descendants of holocaust survivors  jews in red skullcaps emblazoned with trump in white thread and people carrying israeli flags  you cant come in  our country is full  what can we do  we cant handle any more  our countrys full  you cant come in  im sorry he was met with raucous applause and cheers at the republican jewish coalitions annual leadership meeting in las vegas  underscoring how many conservative jewish voters  alarmed by rising threats of anti semitism and energized by his pro israel policies  have embraced a president with a history of trafficking in anti semitic tropes  including remarks that he has made before the coalition fresh from a visit on friday to a california border town  the president doubled down on his attacks on migrants seeking asylum at the border  the administration has recently toughened its policy for accepting asylum seekers  with stories of fleeing violence and corruption no longer meeting the standard for entry the asylum program is a scam  he said  describing people who look like they should be fighting for the u f c   with large muscles and face tattoos  some of the roughest people youve ever seen mr  trump has sought to paint himself as a chief supporter of israel  trumpeting the fulfillment of his promise to move the american embassy to jerusalem and his decision to recognize israels authority over the long contested golan heights  vice president mike pence  in a speech later saturday  called the president the greatest friend of the jewish people ever to sit in the oval office like the lawmakers who spoke before him  representative lee zeldin of new york  one of two republican jewish representatives  and representative kevin mccarthy of california  the minority leader  the president framed democrats as unwilling to combat anti semitism republicans believe that we must never ignore the vile poison of anti semitism  mr  trump said  he brought the crowd to its feet by introducing timothy matson  a police officer wounded during the shooting in october at the tree of life synagogue in pittsburgh in condemning anti semitism  all three men singled out representative ilhan omar  the freshman democrat from minnesota and one of the first two muslim women elected to congress  who for weeks has fended off accusations of anti semitism over comments critical of israel special thanks to representative omar of minnesota  mr  trump said  expressing gratitude to other attendees  including sheldon g  adelson  the billionaire casino magnate and prominent republican donor  and his wife  miriam  oh  i forgot  she doesnt like israel  im so sorry  ms  omar herself was recently the target of death threats  this week  federal agents arrested a new york resident  patrick w  carlineo jr   after he reportedly called her office  described her as a terrorist and promised  in an expletive laden threat  to put a bullet in her skull  ms  omar later responded on twitter by quoting a prayer of forgiveness  my lord  forgive my people for they do not know mr  trump also appeared to blur the lines between the american jews in the audience and israelis  referring at one point to prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel as your prime minister and warning that congressional democrats could leave israel out there all by yourselves at one point  he asked the crowd  how the hell did you support president obama  how the hell did you support the democrats  reminded by the audience that members of the republican jewish coalition did not  in fact  support mr  obama  he laughed before conceding  you guys didnt  thats right a few protesters were escorted from the arena early on in the speech  chanting jews are here to say  occupation is a plague  according to ifnotnow  a jewish organization that issued a statement afterward  logan bayroff  a spokesman for j street  the liberal jewish organization  said the presidents remarks about immigrants and minorities were extremely discordant and extremely disgusting to the majority of jewish people but the crowd of supporters in the ballroom at the venetian hotel and casino were enthusiastic as the president delivered a cornucopia of boasts  complaints and exaggerations typical of his campaign rallies  efforts to overhaul trade deals with mexico and china  and his pledge to build a border wall  cheers of four more years rang out after mr  trump left the presidents claims about the countrys capacity to support more immigrants echoed an argument he made on friday during his visit to a border town in california  backing down from a threat to close the legal ports of entry between the united states and mexico allies of the president have argued that he is right to push to overhaul the process  with the surge of families turning themselves in to border patrol agents at the ports of entry or in between them what you see happening here is an abuse of asylum laws  senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina and a close ally of the presidents  said in a brief interview after mr  trumps speech  if asylum is going to be that everybody who is economically impoverished can come to america  there will be no way we can handle the flow bottom line is  he added  we accept refugees .
so donald trump is a champion of women  who knew hed been hiding that facet of himself diabolically well all these years  as he grabbed them by parts of their bodies that newspapers try not to mention and showed them special derision on twitter  comparing stormy daniels to a horse and omarosa manigault to a dog  a shallow  casual observer might rush to judgment and conclude that he didnt fully respect the opposite sex but his remarks and bearing during his state of the union address on tuesday night surely corrected that impression he beamed at the rows of women in white  female house members who were seated together and dressed in a single hue to make a statement about their progress and their strength it was to them that he targeted his assertion that no one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women  who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year he then addressed them even more directly  exactly one century after congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote  we also have more women serving in congress than at any time before indeed we do  there are 102 in the house  but heres the thing  that group includes 89 democrats and just 13 republicans  history was made courtesy of the party that he worked hard in the midterms to defeat  that he works hard all the time to diminish and that he repeatedly trolled in the rest of his remarks on tuesday night  if hed had his way and sway  those rows of white would have been sparser  but he neither exhibited any awareness of that nor made any resolution to improve his partys stubbornly miserable record of recruiting and promoting female candidates instead he basked in the womens  and the democratic partys  accomplishment as if it were his own  thats great  he told them  really great  and congratulations its nice to be trump  his bragging is unencumbered by his past  his self satisfaction crowds out any self examination  what he needs isnt a fact check  its a reality check  because his worst fictions arent statistical  theyre spiritual he pretends to care about matters that dont move him in the least  he feigns blamelessness in situations where hes entirely culpable and takes credit in circumstances where he has more to apologize for  he presents himself in a positive light  as one kind of person  when his actions paint him in a negative light  as a different character altogether  many of his biggest lies are to himself the state of the union address was a herky jerky testament to that  i say herky jerky because it was six or eight or maybe 10 speeches in one  caroming without warning from a plea for unity to a tirade about the border  from some boast about american glory under trump to some reverie about american glory before trump  yes  it existed    from a hurried legislative wish list to a final stretch of ersatz poetry that read like lines from a batch of defective or remaindered hallmark cards  as much as trump needed modesty  his paragraphs needed transitions but there was a leitmotif running through the disparate patches  and it was trumps readiness to reassemble recent history and reinvent himself if you didnt know that he was a champion of women  then you probably also didnt know that he saved us from war with north korea  he alone can fix it  and according to him  he did fix it  or is fixing it  never mind what his intelligence chiefs told the senate intelligence committee just last week  they had doubts about his supposed success on that front  he doesnt  so hell cling to his version  its the one that flatters him on tuesday night trump suddenly cared about diversity and minorities  and abandoned much of the divisive lexicon that he had used over the first two years of his presidency  most memorably when he attached a fecal epithet to countries with largely black populations on tuesday night he ached for americans with h i v  or aids  i cant recall them being on his radar much before  but i do recall that he or other members of his administration worked to expel transgender people from the military  appoint homophobic judges and argue against civil rights protections for l g b t  americans on tuesday night he excoriated wealthy americans who benefit from undocumented immigrants even as those immigrants  supposedly  diminish less wealthy americans  he made no acknowledgment of his own use of undocumented immigrants at the trump golf resort in bedminster  n j  two of them  in fact  were invited by democrats to the speech on tuesday night he said that we americans must never ignore the vile poison of anti semitism or those who spread its venomous creed  and he himself has not ignored those who spread it  rather  he has defended and encouraged them  by accepting their support during his campaign  by re tweeting them  by insisting that some of the white nationalists who marched in charlottesville  va   and railed against jews were good people on tuesday night he called for comity  he yearned for bipartisanship  at least when he wasnt modeling the opposite  we must reject the politics of revenge  resistance and retribution  he said  and it was like an alliterative butcher declaring that we must reject red beef  he urged that we rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens  as neighbors  might he try out some of that rekindling on his twitter account  which  even in the hours before his speech  was a font less of love than of spite  president  heal thyself but most incongruous of all was his feminism  closeted until tuesday night  he framed his concerns about illegal immigration in terms of migrant women being sexually assaulted on the way north to our border with mexico or sold into prostitution by traffickers and then there was the shout out to women in the workforce  during it  female house members stood  and some pumped their fists in the air  he registered surprise at first  followed by satisfaction  as he seemed to realize that their moment could also be his moment  that he could  for this one instant  hallucinate mutual respect and pantomime common cause  that he could just slough off all his sins and latch on to a spurious grace dont sit yet  he told them when he feared that they would end their celebration too soon  before his next great pronouncement  youre going to like this even the newly  briefly  falsely sensitive version of trump couldnt lose his bossy streak  or stop hungering for  and predicting  the next round of applause .
washington  faced with limited options and a looming deadline to prevent another government shutdown  president trump is moving toward accepting a border security deal that would fall well short of his once firm demand for  5 7 billion in funds for a wall along the southwestern border house and senate conferees were nearing an agreement that could offer the president  1 3 billion to about  2 billion in funding for border security  that funding  still subject to change  could include money for some physical barriers  such as bollard fencing  and result in a deal as early as monday were 95 to 98 percent done  said senator patrick j  leahy of vermont  the ranking democrat on the senate appropriations committee mr  trump has told allies that he would grudgingly accept a border security figure of about  2 billion  but house democrats remain publicly opposed to spending that much on physical barriers  it is still not clear how much of the final allocation would go toward new fencing  according to three people briefed on the negotiations throughout the talks  democrats have insisted that a border security compromise not be overly reliant on physical barriers  said evan hollander  the communications director for the house appropriations committee  we will not agree to  2 billion in funding for barriers the effort to find a funding compromise is an end game of sorts for high stakes negotiations between house democrats and republicans hoping to avoid another government shutdown  the longest one in american history  which stretched from december through most of january  left the presidents approval ratings at new lows and exhausted lawmakers the final package is likely to include multiple spending bills  including one for the department of homeland security that has border security funding as well as six others that would keep the government operating  and disaster relief to help communities recover from last years natural disasters  according to an appropriations aide but the final agreement still has wrinkles to iron out while democrats want to keep funding for border barriers as low as possible  members of the conservative house freedom caucus  which had earlier pushed mr  trump to take an uncompromising line on wall funding  met with him on thursday and indicated that any number even slightly above  2 billion would satisfy them  for now senator mike lee  republican of utah  told party colleagues at a lunch and in private conversations over the past few days that the president had told him  i can live with  2 billion  according to a senate aide who witnessed one of the exchanges  a spokesman for mr  lee  conn carroll  said the remarks were misinterpreted  and the senator was speculating about steps that could be taken to persuade the president to move below his  5 7 billion demand beyond that  negotiators remain far apart on the number of beds for families detained at the border with mexico  there currently are enough funds allocated for 40 520 detention beds  under the control of immigration and customs enforcement  democrats asked to limit the number of beds to 35 520 for the remainder of the fiscal year  and to increase funds for alternatives to the practice of family detention  republicans want substantially more beds disputes like that were part of why democratic aides on friday played down the likelihood of a quick deal  the democrats last official offer on funding for barriers was a little more than  500 million  although privately they acknowledge they are likely to go higher regardless of where the talks land  the funding under discussion is another significant compromise for mr  trump as he struggles to fulfill his campaign promise that he would build a wall at the southwestern border  in december  he publicly dismissed a proposal for  2 5 billion as insufficient  undercutting vice president mike pence  who had floated the prospect by democrats mr  leahy  a member of the bipartisan house senate committee negotiating the deal  declined to elaborate on any details  citing the need to keep the continuing talks private he said that he  along with staff and other members of the 17 member committee  planned to stay in washington this weekend to negotiate the final details and prepare to sign off on it on monday  because of procedural rules in the house  it is seen as the last possible day for lawmakers to unveil a deal that would prevent a government shutdown before the feb  15 deadline over the past several days  negotiators have begun discussing the potential placement of new barriers  some of it likely to be bollard fencing  made of sturdy  steel slats  in specific locations on the border that have seen significant increases in illegal crossings  according to two republican aides the walls we saw were really heavy fences  said representative kay granger of texas  the ranking republican on the house appropriations committee  describing a trip to the border she took this week  she told reporters that after speaking with border patrol agents  she would support bollard fencing on sections of the border in an interview  ms  granger expressed optimism that bollard fencing would satisfy the president because he has described its spaced  steel slates in the past  including in his state of the union speech on tuesday theres no one that said we should put a solid wall across our southern border  she said and ms  granger said she was heartened by speaker nancy pelosis assurance that she would support any bipartisan compromise that emerges from the negotiating committee it didnt change anything  she said  chuckling  we all just started breathing better the presidents supporters  however  present a different challenge i dont know  ms  granger said when asked how best to convince mr  trumps base that an emerging deal would be acceptable on thursday  richard c  shelby  republican of alabama and the chairman of the senate appropriations chairman  told fellow republicans that a one on one meeting with mr  trump in the oval office this week left him optimistic i think we are going to get a deal  mr  shelby said  according to one of the attendees democratic lawmakers are bracing themselves for some opposition from the partys most liberal flank over funding for ice and other enforcement agencies the presence of representatives lucille roybal allard of california  a member of the progressive caucus  and henry cuellar of texas  a moderate member of the hispanic caucus from a border district  among others on the committee  provided some reassurance to democrats but on thursday  a handful of freshman democrats held an emotional news conference foreshadowing their resistance to any deal that does not reduce funding for ice  immigrant detention and other components of enforcement at the border budgets really are a statement  a statement of our moral values  said representative ilhan omar  democrat of minnesota  her voice cracking as she recalled her own experience as a refugee  we cannot have a budget that doesnt uphold our values .
algona  iowa  for nearly two decades  representative steve king pummeled republican primary challengers  dispatched democrats  even a former iowa governors wife  and glided to victory in his conservative district  he spent little energy on fund raising  put few controls on his racist language and made little effort to hold town halls with constituents then in november he was re elected by just 10 000 votes in what he called the nastiest  most dishonest political gauntlet that any iowan has been put through  two months later he was stripped of his committee assignments and rebuked by the house for comments that seemed to endorse white supremacy  now the nine term iowa republican is under attack from both the left and the right far from folding  though  mr  king is returning to basics  reasserting an aggressive presence in his northwestern iowa district  scheduling events in every county and holding as many as three town halls in a week  where constituents pack in  then linger to take photos and shake hands this is a really important part of our civic activity  mr  king told constituents crowded into a room in a library here in algona  a northern town of about 5 000  we have always done so  we just havent always told you that the winds have shifted  even republicans concede things are different than theyve been before  said craig robinson  a former political director of the republican party of iowa  steve king can only be so good for so long  a lot of eyes were opened when they saw just how close he came to losing that seat in the last election cycle hoping to win over prominent conservatives tired of putting out mr  kings fires  three republicans  widely considered the most serious challengers mr  king has faced in years  have already pledged to run in the 2020 primary race  including an assistant majority leader of the iowa state senate  randy feenstra  who represents one of the most conservative swaths of the district the campaign arm of the house democrats has also put a target on his back  and the state democratic party has deployed an organizer to set up a ground game for next year  the earliest democrats have ever begun such efforts in a district that backed president trump by nearly 30 percentage points we see him being held accountable  we really put a spotlight on something that was overlooked for a very long time  said j  d  scholten  the democrat who lost to mr  king in november  youre seeing his reaction to things where he hasnt been held in check for years regardless of scrutiny  steve king will be steve king  last week  he declined to answer a question at a town hall here asking whether a white society is superior to a nonwhite society because the query was so hypothetical  at another town hall last week  he complained that hurricane katrina victims  who were mostly black  asked for help for only themselves  not their neighbors  while iowans take care of each other the cedar rapids gazette issued a scathing editorial accusing mr  king of choosing to embarrass iowans with inflammatory rhetoric for many western iowans  thats part of his appeal hes a straight talker  said art cullen  the pulitzer prize winning editor of mr  kings hometown newspaper  the storm lake times  he aint afraid of the man  he aint afraid of the system  thats powerful the system is clearly against him  house republican leaders removed mr  king from his committee assignments in january  after comments he made to the new york times questioning why white supremacist was considered offensive  a number of powerful party leaders  including senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  and representative liz cheney of wyoming  the no  3 house republican  suggested he should resign  and the house overwhelmingly passed a resolution disapproving of mr  kings statements even before then  in october  the head of the house republican campaign arm at the time  representative steve stivers of ohio  all but jettisoned mr  king just a week before his election  declaring  we must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms mr  king has long made remarks denigrating immigrants  and they were long overlooked  republican presidential candidates genuflected toward him as a kingmaker before the critical iowa caucuses  republican house leaders ducked and dodged rather than answer for mr  king as he enmeshed himself in one scandal after another  retweeting a nazi sympathizer  saying young unauthorized immigrants have calves the size of cantaloupes because theyre hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert  displaying a confederate flag and adopting white nationalist language such as we cant restore our civilization with somebody elses babies but his close race in november signaled to members of his own party that voters patience may be wearing thin  mr  feenstra announced his primary challenge a day before mr  kings incendiary comments on white supremacy were published  then raised  100 000 in the next 10 days  according to the des moines register today  iowas fourth district doesnt have a voice in washington because our current representatives caustic nature has left us without a seat at the table  mr  feenstra said in january mr  kings younger son and spokesman  jeff king  was quick to fire back  telling the register that mr  feenstras challenge amounted to misguided political opportunism  fueled by establishment puppeteers and the lies of the left republican strategists say the conservative tilt of mr  kings district and his entrenched presence will make for an uphill battle even for conservative challengers like mr  feenstra  but in a presidential year  when a wide open democratic field and antipathy toward mr  trump will energize liberals  republicans should be worried there will be a lot of republican activists who will defend him until the very end  mr  robinson said  but i think when we get closer to primary day  peoples opinion might change  because he barely held on last time  and i think it would be concerning  especially in a presidential year  that republicans could lose this seat  which would be unfathomable before 2018  the last scare mr  king faced was in 2012  when democrats pumped resources behind their challenger  the former iowa first lady christie vilsack  she mustered less than 45 percent of the vote this time democrats face something of a conundrum mr  scholten  a 39 year old former minor league baseball player  must decide whether to run again for the house or shoot higher  senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  flew him to washington to discuss challenging senator joni ernst  republican of iowa  according to democrats familiar with the meeting the dilemma im having right now is that democrats won the house  and so in order for us to pass some of these things  we need to have at least one senator from the state of iowa be a democrat  mr  scholten said  its difficult because king is the most vulnerable he has ever been  but do we advance the things that im fighting for if i go back to the house seat the decision may not be all mr  scholtens to make  mr  schumer and his staff have also made overtures to state senator liz mathis and freshman representative cindy axne  and it is also unclear whether another breakout democratic candidate exists in the fourth congressional district mr  kings supporters say he has been unfairly treated by the national news media  and they praise him as a steadfast ally of agriculture and an anti abortion crusader  confronted with the question about white societies at the town hall meeting  mr  king demurred  but his rambling anger ended with a proclamation of his belief that life begins at conception  and left his questioner agreeing with him ask anyone who talked to him  didnt you think he was kind of like your crazy uncle  mr  cullen said  didnt you kind of like the guy when he was talking about white supremacy many will answer yes .
americans are frustrated by the inaction of their federal government on comprehensive immigration reform and border security  so are we  we both represent districts on long island  and we have both worked on immigration related issues for over 25 years  one of us  representative suozzi  from the perspective of immigrants rights as a mayor  as a county executive and now as a member of congress  the other  representative king  from the perspective of border security as a former county comptroller  and now as a congressman and former chairman of the house homeland security committee we come at this from different points of view and different parties  but with a shared commitment to finding a solution to our countrys border security issues  together  we have found common ground to address the problems faced by undocumented immigration and the need for robust border security for more than 30 years  our government has failed to solve these problems  this year  the american people endured the longest government shutdown in american history when lawmakers and the president failed to reach a spending deal that centered around border security and immigration along the united states and mexican border the national emergency regarding immigration reform  however  is not on the border  but in the nations capital  we must work together  across party lines  to address these matters in a way that receives bipartisan  bicameral support  and gives the president legislation he feels he can sign on long island  we have one of the 10 largest populations of undocumented immigrants from central and south america  as well as countless unaccompanied minors  many have been in our communities for decades living productive lives  attending school with our children  working six days a week and going to church on sunday it is our duty  as elected officials  to provide solutions to the problems  not sound bites to the press  that is why we are proposing a realistic set of reforms that would offer legal protection for five million undocumented people and  alongside it  enough funding to make our border secure first  our plan would create a path to citizenship for approximately 1 9 million immigrants brought by their parents  without documentation  when they were 18 or under  the so called dreamers  to be eligible  they must have graduated from high school  have no record of criminal activity  and be either in the military  working full time for at least three years or attending college we would extend similar coverage to the 400 000 people who were invited to america and given temporary protective status after facing natural disasters  violence and extreme poverty in their home countries finally  relatives of dreamers  of t p s  recipients and of others who are undocumented  approximately 2 7 million more people  would be eligible for three years of protective status  renewable indefinitely  if they have been in the united states for a significant number of years and have no record of criminal activity taken together  this represents five million people  next  to qualify for protection  an undocumented person would be required to pay a  2 000 fee  if each of the five million paid that amount  our plan would generate  10 billion some of that money  in turn  would be used to cover the administrative costs of this new program  we figure those costs would be  1 4 billion the remaining  8 6 billion would be split evenly   4 3 billion would pay for additional physical structures along the united states mexico border  as proposed by the department of homeland security  and  4 3 billion would go to aid to el salvador  guatemala and honduras to help prevent further out migration from those countries  as well as to radar technology  improved ports of entry  immigration judges  border patrol personnel and humanitarian assistance along the border  as recommended by the department homeland security for far too long  many people living in our country have been living in fear  and many others have grown frustrated by the inaction of our elected officials  the undocumented have lived in the shadows  facing the daily anxiety of potential deportation  even as they try to participate in our american communities  as legislators  we know what we have to do  we must stand together and pass legislation that will help secure our borders while giving undocumented immigrants a path to permanent residency without the fear that at any moment they may be deported .

antelope wells  n m   the border patrols tiny base in the southwest corner of new mexico is so remote that the wind howls through the surrounding basin where mountain lions still stalk their prey but that hasnt stopped thousands of central americans from journeying in recent weeks to the rural outpost and other isolated points along the southwest border  launching increasingly desperate bids for asylum in the united states in a two day span in january  362 migrants surrendered to the border patrol in antelope wells  overwhelming the small bases capacity to process asylum requests  last week  a new group of 306 migrants arrived at the same location  including children in need of immediate medical care  a situation officials in new mexico say is without precedent prompting these trips to ever more remote border locations are not only the nearly 700 miles of border wall and fencing built since 2006  but the trump administrations increasingly rigid immigration policies aimed at deterring the flow of migrant families  mostly from central america  that have streamed in from mexico since 2014 over the past year  the government has limited the number of asylum seekers who are allowed to present their cases each day at certain ports of entry  stationed agents on bridges to turn asylum seekers away and launched tear gas at migrants attempting to cross the border near san diego the administration went even further last week  announcing that it would start requiring some asylum seekers to wait in mexico while their applications are processed  which can take years  officials plan to implement the new policy at the san ysidro border crossing near san diego before expanding it to crossings in arizona  new mexico and texas taken together  these moves effectively have forced some central american migrants to wait for months to apply for asylum  sometimes sleeping on the street or in crowded shelters in mexican border cities frustrated and increasingly desperate  thousands of families have lately been opting to pay smugglers to take them to remote border stations where they can surrender quickly to american officials and hope to be allowed to remain in the united states while their asylum claims are processed in december  which saw a record number of families arriving at the border  27 518 migrants traveling in families were apprehended in areas outside normal border stations  the el paso sector  which includes the suddenly busy area of rural new mexico  saw a 1 866 percent increase in family apprehensions during october and november of 2018  compared with the same period a year earlier pushing migrants toward remote desert locations puts them at higher risk of dehydration  heatstroke or hypothermia  most are choosing the more dangerous crossing routes because they have been foreclosed from seeking asylum at the more widely traveled border crossings  said fernando garcia  director of the border network for human rights in el paso  how else to explain the desperation of thousands of people making it to the middle of nowhere just so they can surrender to border patrol trump administration officials have argued that the new policies are an attempt to discourage migrants from even attempting the dangerous trips through mexico where they are especially vulnerable to extortion and human trafficking  officials contend that existing legislation encourages parents to bring children along on the journey katie waldman  a spokeswoman for the department of homeland security  laid blame on the federal government having to comply with the flores agreement  a 1997 legal settlement aimed at preventing lengthy detentions of migrant children  and subsequent legislation codifying parts of the settlement into federal law we continue to call on congress to address this humanitarian and security crisis that entices smugglers to bring families across the border  ms  waldman said border patrol officials have put forward various theories about why crossings at remote locations are climbing that have nothing to do with the administrations policies  kevin mcaleenan  commissioner of customs and border protection  said in a conference call with reporters in december that smugglers could be trying to hold down the transit fees they pay to other criminal organizations with sway in northern mexico by dropping migrants near remote locations like antelope wells in an interview in el paso  jose romero  a supervisory agent in the border patrols sector that oversees operations in new mexico  offered another explanation  claiming that mexican cannabis smugglers were trying to distract agents in the field by flooding remote stations with asylum seekers our adversary is no idiot  mr  romero said  adding that while agents were arresting 247 migrants in antelope wells one january day  traffickers were trying to smuggle hundreds of pounds of marijuana across the border in another location  now they know where our weak spots are  he said the administration has not been unmindful of the hazards of migrants venturing into little traveled regions  partly in an attempt to deter such crossings and what government officials describe as meritless asylum claims  the administration tried last year to refuse to accept asylum applications from anyone who had not entered the country at a legal border crossing  but that policy was blocked by the courts  and antelope wells  though remote  is a legal border crossing just how dangerous such crossings are became apparent in december  when jakelin caal maquin  a 7 year old girl from guatemala  died in united states custody after she and her father crossed the border in a group of 163 migrants that surrendered to agents at antelope wells  only a few weeks later  an 8 year old boy from guatemala  felipe gmez alonzo  died after crossing the border about three miles west of the paso del norte port of entry in el paso but the numbers have only continued to grow  since the start of the 2019 fiscal year  the border patrol said  it has found at least 24 groups of 100 or more migrants that had crossed around the bootheel  the sparsely populated area where new mexicos border with mexico dips southward like a cowboy boots heel at the end of a 45 mile road from the decaying hamlet of hachita that runs through grazing lands dotted with creosote bushes  the border patrol has maintained a small presence at antelope wells for decades  a sign says the base is open from 10 a m  to 4 p m  the population of antelope wells  once 2  sometimes soars all the way into the high single digits when more than a handful of agents are deployed here for weeklong assignments at another remote point to the west in arizona  the border patrol reported that 376 migrants had tunneled through the sandy soil under the border fence near yuma  earlier this month and then surrendered to agents  the group  which included dozens of children  ranks among the largest groups of families and unaccompanied children ever arrested on the border with mexico immigration activists say the increase in remote crossings is just the latest development in a decades long effort to push immigration out of urban areas  tracing back at least to operation blockade  a clinton administration initiative in 1993 to curb unauthorized crossings in the city of el paso  border fencing erected in southern california and arizona in recent years drove some of the biggest migration flows toward the rio grande valley in texas  where the river marks the border and many migrants are able to cross with a short boat ride busy border crossings like the one in mcallen  tex   now have relatively elaborate infrastructure set up to handle newly arrived families seeking asylum  but no such facilities exist in this stretch of rural new mexico  raising fears that the recent deaths of the two guatemalan children wont be the last the grim cost of united states immigration policies is hardly new  law enforcement authorities have found the remains of about 8 000 migrants who have died while crossing the border with mexico since the 1990s  and while undetected illegal border crossings have fallen sharply over the past decade  hundreds of migrants continue to die making the attempt each year at least 413 migrants were found dead along the border in 2018  according to a preliminary count by the international organization for migration  up from 412 in 2017 and 399 in 2016 were seeing the increase in people crossing out here  and were afraid  said amanda adame  39  a cattle rancher whose family lives in hachita  about 45 miles north of antelope wells  were fearful for the families that are going across and fearful for our own safety still  humanitarian groups say they are waging an uphill battle to save lives along the border  some cite the conviction in january of four volunteers from the unitarian universalist church in tucson on charges of abandonment of property after they left caches of food and water in an arizona wildlife refuge where migrants have died while crossing into the united states asylum seekers shouldn t have to cross in the middle of the desert  said justine orlovsky schnitzler  a member of the advocacy group no more deaths in tucson  this is the newest stage of policies that have been sentencing migrants to death for decades .
president trump wants  5 7 billion to build a wall at the southern border of the united states  nancy pelosi thinks a wall is immoral  the fight over these slats or barriers or bricks shut down the government for more than a month and may do so again if mr  trump isnt satisfied with the way negotiations unfold over the next three weeks but lets be clear  this is a disagreement about symbolism  not policy  liberals object less to aggressive border security than to the walls xenophobic imagery  while the administration openly revels in its political incorrectness  and when this particular episode is over  well still have been fighting about the wrong thing  its true that immigrants will keep trying to cross into the united states and that global migration will almost certainly increase in the coming years as climate change makes parts of the planet uninhabitable  but technology and globalization are complicating the idea of what a border is and where it stands not long from now  it wont make sense to think of the border as a line  a wall or even any kind of imposing vertical structure  tearing down  or refusing to fund  border walls wont get anyone very far in the broader pursuit of global justice  the borders of the future wont be as easy to spot  build or demolish as the wall that mr  trump is proposing  thats because they arent just going up around countries  theyre going up around us  and theyre taking away our freedom in the jungle  a play about a refugee camp in calais  france  a kurdish smuggler named ali explains that his profession is not responsible for the large numbers of migrants making the dangerous journeys to europe by sea  once  i was the only way a man could ever dream of arriving on your shore  the smuggler says  but today  migrants can plan out the journeys using their phones  it is not about this border  its the border in here  ali says  pointing to his head  and that is gone  now president trump is obsessed with his border wall because technology has freed us from the walls in our heads for people with means and passports  its easy to plot exotic itineraries in a flash and book flights with just a glance at a screen  social feeds are an endless stream of old faces in new places  a carefree colleague feeding elephants in thailand  a smug college classmate on a babymoon in tahiti  that awful ex hanging off a cliff in switzerland  a friends parents enjoying retirement in new zealand likewise  a young person in sana  yemen  or guatemala city might see a sister in toronto  a neighbor in phoenix  an aunt in london or a teacher in berlin  and think that he  too  could start anew  foreign places are real  another country is possible if you zoom out enough in google earth  youll see the lines between nations begin to disappear  eventually  youll be left staring at a unified blue planet  you might even experience a hint of what astronauts have called the overview effect  the sense that we are all on spaceship earth  together  from space i saw earth  indescribably beautiful with the scars of national boundaries gone  recalled muhammed faris  a syrian astronaut  after his 1987 mission to space  in 2012  mr  faris fled war torn syria for turkey ones freedom of movement used to be largely determined by ones citizenship  national origin and finances  thats still the case  but increasingly  people are being categorized not just by the color of their passports or their ability to pay for tickets but also by where theyve been and what theyve said in the past this is what is happening on that front already a 2017 executive order barred people from seven countries  including five with muslim majorities  from entering the country  an older rule put in place during the obama administration compelled anyone whod even just visited seven blacklisted nations to obtain additional clearance before traveling to the united states  even as the trump administrations policy has met with legal challenges  it means that the barrier to entering the united states  for many  begins with their data and passport stamps  and is thousands of miles away from this country  the trump administration would also like to make it harder for immigrants whove received public assistance to obtain citizenship or permanent residence by redefining what it means to be a public charge  if the administration succeeds  it will have moved the border into immigrants living rooms  schools and hospital beds the walls of the future go beyond one administrations policies  though  they are growing up all around us  being built by global technology companies that allow for constant surveillance  data harvesting and the alarming collection of biometric information  in 2017  the united states announced it would be storing the social media profiles of immigrants in their permanent file  ostensibly to prevent twitter happy terrorists from slipping in  for years  customs and border protection agents have asked travelers about their social media  too the electronic frontier foundation has said these practices can chill and deter the free speech and association of immigrants to the united states  as well as the u s  persons who communicate with them  in other words  its no longer enough to have been born in the right place  at the right time  to the right parents  the trail of bread crumbs you leave could limit your movements its possible to get a glimpse of where a digital border might lead from china  look at its continuing experiment with social credit scoring  where a slip of the tongue or an unpaid debt could one day jeopardize someones ability to board a train or apply for a job  when your keystrokes and text messages become embedded in your legal identity  you create a wall around yourself without meaning to the berkeley political theorist wendy brown diagnoses the tendency to throw up walls as a classic symptom of a nation states looming impotence in the face of globalization  the flashy sports car of what she calls a waning sovereignty  in a recent interview for the nation  professor brown told me that walls fulfill a desire for greater sovereign control in times when the concept of bounded territory itself is in crisis  they are signifiers of a loss of a national we and national control  all the things weve seen erupt in a huge way  walls are a response to deep existential anxiety  and even if the walls come down  or fail to be built in brick and stone  the world will guarantee us little in the way of freedom  fairness or equality  it makes more sense to think of modern borders as overlapping and concentric circles that change size  shape and texture depending on who  or what  is trying to pass through its far too easy to imagine a situation where our freedom of movement still depends entirely on what has happened to us in the past and what kind of information were willing to give up in return  consider the expedited screening process of the global entry program for traveling to the united states  its a shortcut  reserved for people who can get it  that doesnt do away with borders  it just makes them easier to cross  and therefore less visible that serves the modern nation state very well  because in the end  what are borders supposed to protect us from  the answer used to be other states  empires or sovereigns  but today  relatively few land borders exist to physically fend off a neighboring power  and countries even cooperate to police the borders they share  modern borders exist to control something else  the movement of people  they control us those are the walls we should be fighting over .
washington  jared kushner  the presidents son in law  was confident in his ability as a good faith negotiator who could find a compromise to end the government shutdown his pitch to democratic lawmakers was simple  he told them he was the person who could land this plane buoyed by his success in helping pass a criminal justice bill  mr  kushner  a senior white house adviser  agreed to take the lead when the president asked him to find a way to end the monthlong stalemate  he hoped his experience winning over democrats skeptical of the trump administration during negotiations for that measure would produce a similarly successful conclusion but negotiating a broad immigration deal that would satisfy a president committed to a border wall as well as democrats who have cast it as immoral proved to be more like mr  kushners elusive goal of solving middle east peace than passing a criminal justice overhaul that already had bipartisan support for one  mr  kushner inaccurately believed that moderate rank and file democrats were open to a compromise and had no issue funding a wall as part of a broader deal if jared kushner thinks there is any daylight between house democratic leadership and rank and file members on this issue  then the extent that he lands this plane it will land in the alamo  said representative hakeem jeffries  democrat of new york and democratic leaders like senator chuck schumer  party officials said  did not believe that mr  kushner had the power to circumvent stephen miller  a senior policy adviser to the president  in meetings  they also noticed  mr  kushner appeared to prop up mr  miller as an expert on immigration  noting that mr  millers reputation as a hard liner was out of sync with his reasonable nature on friday  president trump did what mr  kushner had privately insisted was not an option on the table  he folded standing in the rose garden  mr  trump announced he was ending the standoff  during which he had failed to convince democrats to fund a  5 7 billion border wall  and was reopening the federal government for three weeks it was a stunning setback for the president and for mr  kushner  who had told colleagues that public opinion would move to their side and that speaker nancy pelosi would emerge as the one who looked unreasonable and intransigent mr  kushner had advised the president against declaring a national emergency  which would enable him to get funding for his wall without approval from congress  instead  he ultimately pushed mr  trump toward the announcement he made on friday  supporting it as a way to buy more time to reach a deal mr  trump  white house aides said  has been frustrated at everyone around him for not delivering a deal he can accept  and he has become wary of his son in laws advice on this issue  the aides said this account is based on interviews with more than a dozen congressional officials  white house aides and people involved in the immigration debate on capitol hill  aides said  mr  kushner had positioned himself as the person who could sell the president on a compromise  casting himself as a facilitator who did not lobby for details of any proposal but simply wanted to find a solution that both sides could claim as a victory mr  kushner has told mr  trump that he should spend the next three weeks trying to achieve a broader immigration package  that challenge has eluded both parties for years  but mr  kushner has suggested to colleagues that it is worth trying for  according to west wing aides the president appears to have internalized the advice  21 days goes very quickly  mr  trump wrote on twitter on saturday morning  negotiations with democrats will start immediately  will not be easy to make a deal  both parties very dug in  the case for national security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the border   through dialogue  we will build the wall but democrats said they do not believe that mr  kushner will have better luck drafting a larger deal in the next few weeks  unless hes able to convince his father in law to abandon his obsession with building a medieval border wall  then hes not going to be successful in finding a bipartisan agreement  mr  jeffries said sarah huckabee sanders  the white house press secretary  however  noted that mr  kushner was still seen internally as one of the administrations most successful negotiators  pointing to his involvement with the criminal justice bill as well as the new north american trade deal  jared is a key player in the administration and will continue helping the president accomplish his top priorities  she said in an email but for now  mr  kushner appears to have few allies  occupying what people close to him describe as a no win position mr  kushner finds himself with little sway over democrats  who consider the substantial changes that the white house keeps proposing for asylum seekers to be poison pills  and conservatives are not convinced mr  kushner is the right person to negotiate a deal  they recognize he has mr  trumps ear  but worry he does not understand the fault lines of the debate or what proposals will anger mr  trumps base  one proposal that was reviewed  which would give green cards to 700 000 undocumented young immigrants  enraged conservatives within the white house  several aides said  mr  kushner is not interested in opinions that vary from his  and tends to view people who disagree with him as problems  closing them out of discussions  people close to mr  kushner  however  speaking on the condition of anonymity  have described him as working well with west wing colleagues  particularly the legislative affairs director  shahira knight  a veteran of capitol hill but even mr  kushners allies concede that when it comes to immigration  he has not grasped the emotional nature of the fight the way he did when he tackled the criminal justice overhaul  an issue that was personal because of his fathers own incarceration mr  kushner  allies said  sees the  5 7 billion request for border wall money as reasonable  and has compared it to one month of troop deployments in afghanistan  he views ms  pelosi as trophy hunting  or trying to take down the president politically with the shutdown allies of mr  kushner say that not all of his discussions with democrats have been publicized  and that he has gained trust partly because he keeps his conversations confidential  but on capitol hill  many democrats said discussions on immigration have been scarce senator dick durbin  democrat of illinois  was given no notice about mr  trumps announcement last weekend in which he offered temporary protections for young undocumented immigrants in exchange for wall money  according to a congressional aide  senator joe manchin iii  democrat of west virginia  heard from mr  kushner only once  when he phoned before the presidents prime time address from the oval office to warn him that the moment would move public opinion to the presidents side  mr  jeffries  who worked closely with mr  kushner on criminal justice reform  had no conversations about forging a bipartisan immigration bill some democrats  however  gave mr  kushner credit for at least trying to keep a dialogue going  even if it did not result in a compromise we disagreed on the issue  but talking is essential in a divided government  especially if we want to solve any problems  said representative josh gottheimer  democrat of new jersey .
san antonio  donald j  trump got brenda hernandezs hopes up in 2016 when he indicated that he had a heart for young undocumented immigrants like her  who were brought into the country by their parents  but her hopes were dashed when mr  trump became president and ordered an end to the federal program known as daca that shields her from deportation after the presidents latest announcement on saturday  that he was proposing to end the standoff over the partial government shutdown by  among other things  temporarily extending that shield  ms  hernandez just shrugged i dont trust trump  i dont believe him  she said as she hoisted her 3 year old son onto a swivel chair at the d   h beauty salon in san antonio  the blue collar shop  with rows of wooden chairs in the waiting area  is a favorite among immigrants in the city  but in the hours after mr  trumps white house address  his latest offer of an immigration deal was finding little support  read  in trumps immigration announcement  a compromise snubbed all around in exchange for  5 7 billion to erect a barrier along the border with mexico  mr  trump said he would agree to extend protection for three years for the roughly 800 000 immigrants who benefit from the deferred action for childhood arrivals program  which covers people brought into the country illegally as children  the president held out the hope of similar relief for 300 000 immigrants living in the united states with temporary protected status  known as t p s   after fleeing earthquakes and other disasters in their own countries i am here today to break the logjam and provide congress with a path forward to end the government shutdown and solve the crisis along the southern border  mr  trump said  calling his offer a common sense compromise both parties can embrace but many of the clients waiting their turn for a  6 haircut or shave at the d   h salon  in a strip mall in the northern part of the city  greeted mr  trumps announcement with skepticism  if not downright indifference  most expressed deep reservations about a border wall  deeming it a waste of money eliseo castillo  60  an undocumented immigrant from mexico  said an extension of dacas protections from deportation  and its offer of work permits  could benefit his 26 year old son  he said his son had relied on the program for years to get a drivers license and a job and to live without the fear that even a minor misstep  like driving with a broken taillight  could land him in deportation proceedings but mr  castillo  a construction contractor who relies on a steady flow of workers from latin america  said he wondered what would happen to his business if a reinforced border wall halted the flow of workers  he said he is already having trouble hiring enough laborers the fact is  there is not an american who wants to mix cement  do carpentry and heavy work  said mr  castillo  who employs 18 people to lay down foundations for houses in san antonios expansive subdivisions mr  castillo  who wears cowboy boots and bluejeans and keeps his silver hair in a braid  has called texas home since the 1980s  but he harbors no illusions about legalizing his status  at least as long as mr  trump holds the highest office in the land waiting his turn for a haircut in paint splattered trousers that gave away how he earns his living  jose ramos  63  a naturalized american born in mexico  said he had no faith that mr  trump  whose favorite sport is blaming immigrants for everything  which is not right  would ever keep his word this isnt a deal  mr  ramos said  trump is just offering to give back what he already took away democrats in washington have criticized the president for offering to extend daca and t p s  protections  when it was he who had ordered those protections revoked  some have called the offer a nonstarter because it did not include any long term solutions  like a path to permanent legal status or citizenship for daca recipients  who are known as dreamers but many people in san antonio never had much faith that such solutions were even possible with mr  trump as president indeed  some in the city wonder how much the president knows about the border speaking with reporters on saturday  mr  trump cited the city as a place that had benefited from building a border barrier  you look at san antonio  you look at so many different places  they go from one of the most unsafe cities in the country to one of the safest cities  immediately  immediately  he said but san antonio is 150 miles from the border  and has no wall alicia alaniz  47  the stylist working at station 7 in the salon  rolled her eyes and said that the only thing she could agree with in mr  trumps statement was the notion that the immigration system was broken we need immigration reform  it would benefit the country and everyone who lives here  said ms  alaniz  a legal permanent resident who emigrated from mexico  people just want to work the right way  and support this country that has brought them many blessings president obama introduced daca in june 2012 as a temporary reprieve for young unauthorized immigrants  at a time when congress was in a stalemate over immigration policy  to qualify for daca protection  immigrants must have lived in the united states for much of their lives and meet certain other requirements  like passing a background check and completing high school on the campaign trail  mr  trump vowed to eliminate any program that mr  obama had created by executive action  including daca  a stance that generated deep anxiety among the dreamers but in december 2016  shortly after winning election  mr  trump softened his position were going to work something out thats going to make people happy and proud  he told time magazine  they got brought here at a very young age  theyve worked here  theyve gone to school here  some were good students  some have wonderful jobs  and theyre in never never land because they dont know whats going to happen once in office  however  mr  trump appointed one of the fiercest opponents of the daca program  senator jeff sessions of alabama  as his attorney general  mr  sessions rescinded daca in september 2017  but the action was challenged in court and has yet to take full effect  while the courts decide the programs fate without work permits provided under the program  young immigrants would face cascading  and possibly dire  consequences  they would lose their jobs  drivers licenses and the chance to attend college at in state tuition rates friday was the last day the supreme court could accept an appeal and schedule any arguments on the daca litigation in its current session  and the court let the day pass without addressing the trump administrations bid to kill the program  that ensures that daca will survive at least until the courts next session  which begins in october when the administration made its bid to end the program  i worried about what i would do  i was so sad  said ms  hernandez  who works these days for a casual dining chain known as zoes kitchen  but with the issue tied up in the courts  she said she has simply had to get on with her life  now  i dont even think about it  she said her daca permit expires in a year .
washington  for the last month  president trumps public schedule has mostly been a sparse document  the one issued for tuesday  for instance  listed only his daily intelligence briefing and lunch with the vice president  no new policy announcements  no new cabinet appointments as the partial government shutdown enters its 33rd day  democrats accuse mr  trump of hostage taking tactics  but among the hostages has been his own presidency  other than his single minded pursuit of a border wall  mr  trump has all but put on hold advancing the rest of his agenda  it has become  as one administration official put it  a one issue white house there are important things that arent being addressed  said william a  galston  who served as a domestic policy aide to president bill clinton  but the wall has become the singular issue for mr  trump because he has become convinced that his presidency is on the line  its easy to come up with a list of things on the domestic front that he should be worrying about  mr  galston said  but its just as easy to understand why hes not senate leaders briefly raised hopes of a possible cease fire in the shutdown on tuesday by agreeing to hold votes on a pair of measures this week  but it appeared unlikely that either would draw the 60 votes necessary  mr  trump is eager to deliver his state of the union address in the house chamber next week as originally scheduled  the most prominent platform a president has to set the terms for the coming year  but speaker nancy pelosi has suggested it might be postponed or canceled if government agencies remain closed white house officials said they were operating on the assumption that the president would still give the speech at the capitol next tuesday unless expressly disinvited  but if that were to happen  they had alternative options  like a televised speech delivered in the east room of the white house  the address is being written to unveil a variety of policies  not just discuss the border dispute  which is one reason it is so important to mr  trump the standoff has already forced mr  trump to cancel a trip to europe to meet with global business leaders in davos  switzerland  at a time when the world economy faces a possible slowdown  the president has made no evident progress in filling a series of senior vacancies nor has he produced the tax cutting plan he promised last year  he has done nothing in weeks to publicly promote priorities like fighting opioid abuse or bolstering the economy there is this frustration that the shutdown is interfering with the ability of republicans  i assume democrats feel the same way  to advance the agenda  said lanhee j  chen  who was chief policy adviser to mitt romneys republican presidential campaign in 2012 and is now at stanford university and yet  given the new era of divided government  he added  im not sure how quickly any agenda would be moving even if the government were open  thats a sad testament about where we are as a country many of mr  trumps agency leaders and senior advisers  of course  are still at work  his trade negotiators are focused on brokering an agreement to ease the tariff war with china  and mr  trump himself met with a visiting official from north korea to pave the way for a second summit meeting with its leader  kim jong un  as early as next month but at a time when a president is typically finishing a collection of policies in connection with the state of the union and previewing them to build public support  some of mr  trumps aides acknowledge that the president and his senior team have been almost entirely focused on the border dispute indeed  administration officials said the situation had the unintended benefit of making it easier for mick mulvaney  the newly installed acting white house chief of staff  to settle into his job because he did not have as many issues to juggle the president  who made no public appearances on tuesday  has kept his primary attention on the fight for the border wall for weeks  making only two unrelated out of town trips since the shutdown began  an unannounced stop in iraq to visit troops at christmas time and a quick flight to dover air force base in delaware last weekend to pay respects to the returning remains of four americans killed in syria  even a day trip to new orleans to address farmers turned into another public pitch for the wall still in his inbox are a slew of important vacancies to fill  including defense secretary  interior secretary and chief of staff  his attorney general  united nations ambassador and environmental protection agency chief are all serving in an acting capacity while waiting for senate confirmation votes of his nominees  the white house on tuesday sent 51 judicial nominations to the senate  returning names that had gone unacted on last year mr  trump expressed no urgency when asked by reporters recently about all the acting officials in the upper echelon of his administration  i like acting  he said  it gives me more flexibility left uncertain is how mr  trump may pursue other goals  he vowed before the midterm election to pass a middle class tax cut in the new congress but has said little about it since then  he also vowed to pull out of the north american free trade agreement to pressure congress to pass his newly negotiated replacement but has yet to do so he has similarly talked about collaborating with ms  pelosis democrats  who just took over the house  on possible bipartisan initiatives like rebuilding the nations roads  bridges and other infrastructure or bringing down the cost of prescription drugs  neither of those ideas has come up lately and it is hard to see the current impasse establishing the sort of trust that might lead to across the aisle cooperation moreover  any bitterness or ill will that lingers once the current shutdown is resolved  assuming it is  may complicate future financial negotiations when the debt ceiling needs to be raised to keep the country from defaulting on its obligations and when the current fiscal year is over at the end of september that may depend on how the border fight turns out  some optimists see the potential for an eventual deal between mr  trump and democrats that includes money for his wall in exchange for permanent revisions to immigration laws protecting many of those who have lived in the country illegally for many years hopefully  in the end  we can turn an awful situation into a legislative accomplishment for both sides  said representative josh gottheimer  democrat of new jersey and a leader of the bipartisan problem solvers caucus  who met recently with the president others are not so sure  mr  trump has been willing to subordinate the rest of his agenda to the border wall  analysts said  because it is so central to his political identity and his campaign for re election next year the president believes that the wall represents his contract with america  certainly his contract with his supporters  said mr  galston  who is now at the brookings institution  he regards it  and i think probably accurately  as the issue that did more than any other to propel him to the white house that being the case  he added  this government shutdown is not over a peripheral issue that overshadows other issues  it is the most important issue  at least from the perspective of the president .
san diego  with a mother and her three children facing deportation  the immigration judge wanted to make sure the woman understood the charges against her  but even with the help of an interpreter speaking in qanjobal  a mayan language  magdalena lucas antonio de pascual appeared to comprehend little what language do you speak  judge philip s  law asked the reason why i left my country  she replied through the translator i came across the border illegally because i needed to  she later told the judge i am going to ignore what you just told me  because thats not what i asked you  he said  i am trying to explain the process and your rights throughout the 50 minute hearing  the misunderstandings kept coming ms  antonio de pascual is one of many migrants coming into the united states from remote areas of central america who only speak indigenous languages  an increase in the number of these migrants is adding to delays in a court system that is already overwhelmed by a backlog of more than 800 000 cases  now the courts do not have enough interpreters to serve them  pushing the system to its limits  many lawyers  interpreters and advocates say united states immigration officials provide interpreters in as many as 350 languages over all  including mandarin  creole  punjabi  arabic and russian  but mam  kiche and qanjobal  all indigenous to guatemala  have each become one of the 25 most common languages spoken in immigration court in the past few years in san diego  a qanjobal speaker had her asylum hearing pushed back for more than a year because no interpreters were available  in another case  a man whose primary language is mam was unable to explain that his family had been killed in his guatemalan town  which could be a basis for asylum  his lawyer said  the problems have seeped into the criminal courts as well  in the case of one man accused of a misdemeanor battery  the court interpreter  who was speaking in ixil  did not ask him if he was competent to stand trial  as the judge instructed  but instead told him to pray to god  according to a complaint filed in wisconsin state court ashley tabaddor  an immigration judge in los angeles and the president of the national association of immigration judges  said the lack of interpreters was contributing to even more delays its a colossal waste of our time to now have to reorganize hundreds of thousands of cases to deal with language issues and then theres no interpreter  ms  tabaddor said the small number of interpreters who do have a basic grasp of indigenous languages are still often ill equipped to help  they must explain legal terms that are difficult to comprehend in any language and there are significant differences between regional dialects with migrants who cannot understand or be understood  lawyers and immigration experts say  there is no way to ensure fairness in court we have an entire infrastructure set up where the default language is spanish  but there are thousands of people coming to the southern border who cant communicate that way  and they basically become invisible  said blake gentry  a researcher who estimates that as many as a third of the migrants crossing the border through arizona do not speak spanish immigration courts across the country have seen a steady rise in speakers of indigenous guatemalan languages in the last five years  according to the justice departments executive office for immigration review  which oversees the court  and they are only the most recent additions to the list  which for several years has routinely included zapotec  mixtec  ixil and popti  languages from southern mexico and central america the lack of interpretation for indigenous people has been a problem for a long time  said odilia romero  a zapotec interpreter who has been an activist with the binational front of indigenous organizations for the last 20 years  but what we see now is something entirely different  we have entire populations showing up with languages that we have not seen in the united states before the court may provide an interpreter so they have fulfilled the requirement  but that doesnt mean there is any real understanding  she said although many immigration courts have spanish interpreters on staff  they rely on private contractors for interpreters of indigenous languages  nearly all in person interpreters come from one virginia based company  sos international  which has an  80 million contract with the federal government the government could not say how many interpreters are available in specific languages and relies on sos international  which did not respond to multiple inquiries  a spokeswoman for the executive office of immigration review said the court tries to accommodate all non english speakers and constantly monitors the cases nationally to meet new needs but getting interpreters to court is hardly a given  with so few of them in such high demand  they have to be arranged weeks or even months in advance  judges are often forced to rely on interpreters by phone  making it difficult to hear and impossible to understand body language  and interpreter shortages are plaguing courts across the country  including new york and chicago even when interpreters are in court  it is routinely difficult to explain legal concepts to the migrants  particularly to the vast majority who do not have a lawyer  and because many indigenous interpreters do not speak english  they must use relay interpretation  with the judges english first being translated into spanish before being translated to the indigenous language in many cases  said ms  tabaddor  the immigration judge  migrants who speak only rudimentary spanish try to get by in that language  sometimes out of shame or a belief that spanish will help them convince united states officials that they should be allowed to stay the problem extends to lawyers  who often cant speak to their clients  carmen chavez  the executive director of the casa cornelia law center  a nonprofit immigration legal service in san diego that helps match clients with interpreters  said that of the more than 2 000 cases the group handled last year  roughly a quarter of migrants from latin america did not speak spanish it is constantly difficult to find someone who is qualified to interpret for these cases  she said even among interpreters certified to work in the courts  there is little oversight  and advocates worry whether interpreters and those who hire them are competent since immigrating to los angeles from guatemala in the 1990s  policarpo chaj has worked as a kiche interpreter for lawyers  doctors and other businesses  mr  chaj said he has repeatedly heard of lawyers trying to hire anyone they meet who speaks kiche and spanish speaking a language is not the only thing that makes you qualified to be an interpreter  he said  you have to understand the law  you have know how to write  you have to know how to ask something concrete  you are dealing with peoples rights  it is your moral responsibility to make sure they understand exactly what the judge is saying its possible for migrants to not encounter a single person who speaks their language on their path through the immigration system  making it all but impossible to give officials information  while most agents working along the mexican border and in detention centers speak at least basic spanish  few know any indigenous languages  officers often grow frustrated and accuse these migrants of being uncooperative  leaving them even more confused  lawyers and advocates say children who do not speak spanish are especially isolated  shelter workers say  they are left without the ability to speak with counselors and are more likely to act out  then are punished or medicated  parents who only speak an indigenous language often cannot communicate that they have been separated from their children even migrants with lawyers are often forced to depend on their bilingual children for further help in court  ms  antonio de pascual struggled to explain her situation through the court interpreter  the family arrived last summer  meeting her husband who has lived in the san diego area for several years  she enrolled each of her children in school  and her 8 year old daughter refused to miss class for the court hearing  ms  antonio de pascual  who is illiterate  said she could not remember what forms she signed or questions she answered when she spoke to united states officials near the border last year ms  antonio de pascuals initial hearing had already been postponed because no interpreter was available  as this recent one ended  she asked the judge to give her six months to save money for a lawyer  saying that would be too much time  the judge said he wanted her back in court in june and expected her to begin looking for a lawyer immediately when she was dismissed  her 12 year old son  who speaks limited spanish and qanjobal  took the stack of court documents  placing them inside his small green backpack  he said he planned to spend the afternoon calling the phone numbers listed for pro bono lawyers who might take their case .
el paso  over the last month  i have traveled in three congressional delegations to el paso and southern new mexico  we heard from federal law enforcement  toured detention centers and border patrol stations  and listened to human rights and legal advocates who have worked with migrants for decades  some of us even saw where felipe gmez alonzo  an 8 year old guatemalan who recently died while in custody  and his father were apprehended obviously  el paso and its metropolitan area  including ciudad jurez  in mexico  is just one point along a very long border  but everything we saw demonstrated why president trumps call for a wall is simplistic and misguided  while there is indeed a crisis on the border  its not the one the president describes  and  in fact  his solution will only make things worse  the border runs for 2 000 miles  some of it runs through impassable terrain  some alongside cities like el paso  about 700 miles of it already has a wall  in other words  the border may look like one long  thin line on a map  but in reality it is much more complicated  nor are those arriving at the border the threatening mass of humanity mr  trump imagines  for one thing  there are a lot fewer people being apprehended  down 60 percent from a decade ago  and these days the majority are seeking asylum  their legal right  and while drugs do flow across the border  most of them come through ports of entry  its not just mr  trump who fails to appreciate these facts  as ive come to learn as an el pasoan and now a member of congress  so does the department of homeland security  despite receiving more money than all other federal law enforcement agencies combined  the department has not adapted to changes in migrating populations and patterns  before giving it another penny  congress must understand why instead of developing a nuanced response to the facts on the ground  this administration has chosen incompetence and cruelty as its approach  the consequences are already apparent for example  one reason more migrants are coming across the border through the desert  then requesting asylum  may be that they are being unfairly rejected at official border crossings or being forced to languish in mexico while their applications are being considered at a deliberately slow pace  a tactic called metering  many choose not to wait  and make a desperate  risky choice  and some die as a result and because federal law enforcement agencies have failed to adapt to this changing population  agents are ill equipped to handle the asylum seekers once they do arrive  those agents are used to chasing after single mexican men determined to evade capture  they are now dealing with central american families  fleeing their countries and running to  not from  the agents  some carry very small children  all are being crowded into small  inhumane cement cells for days at a time i am not blaming the agents  during one of our visits to an el paso sector station  agents were up front with us about how unprepared they were to care for the large groups of people they apprehended  they had to buy burritos from a vendor down the street  then warm hundreds of them in a single  small microwave that eventually burned out  then there was the mother who  in our presence  asked for a cup of water for her toddler  only to be told that the facility was out of cups  what a terrible situation for the mother  holding an exhausted  thirsty child in her arms  and what does that do to the agent who has to say no to her during flu season  agents in el paso had to dispense medication to their charges  imagine keeping track of dozens of prescriptions intended to be dispensed every few hours  and all of this was keeping agents from what they were trained to do  track and apprehend bad guys when i ask agents what they worry about most  i hear stories like this  not pleas for a wall  other times they ask for better cellphone coverage and updated radios to use in rural areas  in urban areas with busy ports of entry  they ask for more personnel and newer equipment  there arent enough immigration judges  they dont have enough independence  and the laws on the books dont reflect modern realities the agents may not be to blame  but the agencies sure are  local immigration activists said their main concern was inadequate communication from federal law enforcement  which left their organizations scrambling when the local immigration customs enforcement office releases hundreds of migrants in need of temporary housing into the nighttime streets of el paso  when we talk about a crisis along the border  this is what it looks like  desperate families overwhelming agents who get little direction or support from their local offices  let alone washington  this year  congress needs to investigate the inability of a well funded agency to adapt  why supervisors ignored the alarms raised by their agents on the ground  how two children  felipe gmez and 7 year old jakelin caal maquin  died as a result  and how we best address the root causes of changed migration president trump and his base wont end their obsession with border security until theres not a single undocumented crosser  an impossibility  for them  of course  this isnt about border security  its about nationalism and isolationism  for the rest of us  its about finding a humane solution to a humanitarian challange .
my first encounter in america was with a luggage cart  in the summer of 1992  when i landed at kennedy airport  i carried with me a travel bag filled with books  it was so heavy that it could not be checked in at my originating airport in casablanca  morocco  without putting me over the weight limit  since i couldnt afford the excess baggage fee  i brought the bag with me on the plane  where the flight attendant helped me hoist it into the overhead bin  in new york  i hauled it down the jet bridge and through passport control  my hands blistering from the effort  relief washed over me when i saw a row of carts  i tried to get one  only to discover that it required three dollars to unlock  i remember thinking  what kind of a heartless place is this i didnt have three dollars  or a five or a ten  the money i did have was in the larger denominations i had received at the currency exchange office where id traded in my meager savings  i began to doubt whether i would make it to the terminal from which my flight to california was scheduled to leave  then a voice behind me called  do you need help with that  a middle aged man in a baseball cap picked up my bag and carried it for me to the terminal bus  all the way to my next gate  other people stepped in to help  this wasnt a heartless place after all  i thought  americans were more than willing to lend a hand to a stranger i am no longer a stranger here  in the 20 odd years since i arrived at kennedy  i have had ample time to learn about this countrys history  culture and politics  although my plan had been to complete a graduate degree in linguistics and return to morocco  chance intervened  i met an american  we fell in love  got married  now  im an immigrant  there is nothing extraordinary about this condition  i share it with millions of others  yet hardly a day goes by when i am not reminded that to be an immigrant is to have crossed a threshold  to see the world from two vantage points at once  to perceive it in shades of gray rather than in black and white when i hear elected officials talk about immigrants  they seem to be speaking about figments of their imagination  conjured up to illustrate talking points  the president rants about criminals  rapists and terrorists  then uses them as justification for building a wall  separating families at the border  jailing refugee children in tent camps and banning people from five muslim countries  the presidents critics  meanwhile  portray newcomers to this country as singularly talented people who start new businesses  serve in the armed forces  innovate new technologies  run for congress or otherwise get the job done by casting immigrants as either heroes or villains  these politicians reveal that they view immigration as a law enforcement issue  the reality is much more complicated  like other species on this planet  human beings are a migratory type  when they suddenly find themselves in desperate need of physical safety or economic opportunity  they leave home and start over somewhere new  it has always been this way  the earliest stories we tell ourselves are stories of displacement  adams fall from eden  moses flight from egypt  muhammads hegira to medina  trying to stop this process through the building of walls strikes me as both ineffective and unnatural  like trying to stop a river from flowing i use the simile deliberately  scientists predict that over the next decade the earth will warm by 1 5 degrees  and perhaps as much as two degrees celsius if we fail to take drastic and sustained action on climate change  even under the best case scenarios  we will witness huge hurricanes  wildfires  droughts and other severe weather events  the consequences will be dire  loss of homes and livelihoods  hunger and disease  probably conflict  but eventually dislocation  as much as it is an economic  a social and a foreign policy issue  migration is a climate issue those who are safe from displacement  at least for the moment  must confront the roles they want to play in this unfolding global story  what responsibility do people in america  for example  have toward those who live in places that have been ravaged by wars the american government has started or abetted  what responsibility do they have toward those who have benefited least from industrialization but stand to suffer most  and how do they plan to adapt to global migration  in christchurch  new zealand  last week  at least 49 people were killed during friday prayers by a white nationalist who released a manifesto railing against muslims and immigrants  as refugees and migrants rebuild their lives in new places  both the intolerance and the resilience of their host communities are revealed in order to have a fruitful conversation about immigration  we have to set aside antiquated ideas about barbarians at the gate and thoroughly rethink our approach to the inevitable displacements that will take place in our lifetimes  the overwhelming majority of immigrants are neither dangerous monsters nor exceptional achievers  they are ordinary people who find themselves  for a range of personal or political reasons  pulled or pushed to leave home  whether they will be met by kind strangers or by an enforcement machine as faceless and indifferent as a luggage cart is a choice that americans still have the luxury to make .
the internet expands the bounds of acceptable discourse  so ideas considered out of bounds not long ago now rocket toward widespread acceptability  see  cannabis legalization  government run health care  white nationalism and  of course  the flat earthers  yet theres one political shore that remains stubbornly beyond the horizon  its an idea almost nobody in mainstream politics will address  other than to hurl the label as a bloody cudgel im talking about opening up americas borders to everyone who wants to move here imagine not just opposing president trumps wall but also opposing the nations cruel and expensive immigration and border security apparatus in its entirety  imagine radically shifting our stance toward outsiders from one of suspicion to one of warm embrace  imagine that if you passed a minimal background check  youd be free to live  work  pay taxes and die in the united states  imagine moving from nigeria to nebraska as freely as one might move from massachusetts to maine  farhad manjoo answered your questions about this column on twitter  theres a witheringly obvious moral  economic  strategic and cultural case for open borders  and we have a political opportunity to push it  as democrats jockey for the presidency  theres room for a brave politician to oppose president trumps racist immigration rhetoric not just by fighting his wall and calling for the abolishment of i c e  but also by making a proactive and affirmative case for the vast expansion of immigration it would be a change from the stale politics of the modern era  in which both parties agreed on the supposed wisdom of border security and assumed that immigrants were to be feared  as an immigrant  this idea confounds me  my family came to the united states from our native south africa in the late 1980s  after jumping through lots of expensive and confusing legal hoops  we became citizens in 2000  obviously  it was a blessing  in rescuing me from a society in which people of my color were systematically oppressed  america has given me a chance at liberty but why had i deserved that chance  while so many others back home  because their parents lacked certain skills  money or luck  were denied it when you see the immigration system up close  youre confronted with its bottomless unfairness  the system assumes that people born outside our borders are less deserving of basic rights than those inside  my native born american friends did not seem to me to warrant any more dignity than my south african ones  according to this nations founding documents  we were all created equal  yet by mere accident of geography  some were given freedom  and others were denied it when you start to think about it  a system of closed borders begins to feel very much like a system of feudal privilege  said reece jones  a professor of geography at the university of hawaii who argues that democrats should take up the mantle of open borders  its the same idea that theres some sort of hereditary rights to privilege based on where you were born i admit the politics here are perilous  although americas borders were open for much of its history  if your ancestors came here voluntarily  theres a good chance it was thanks to open borders  restrictions on immigration are now baked so deeply into our political culture that any talk of loosening them sparks anger people worry that immigrants will bring crime  even though stats show immigrants are no more dangerous than natives  people worry theyll take jobs away from native workers  even though most studies suggests that immigration is a profound benefit to the economy  and theres little evidence it hurts native workers  and if we worry that theyll hoover up welfare benefits  we can impose residency requirements for them but these are all defensive arguments  and when youre on defense  youre losing  for opponents of the presidents xenophobic policies  a better plan is to make the affirmative case for a lot more immigrants economically and strategically  open borders isnt just a good plan  its the only chance weve got  america is an aging nation with a stagnant population  we have ample land to house lots more people  but we are increasingly short of workers  and on the global stage  we face two colossi  india and china  which  with their billions  are projected to outstrip american economic hegemony within two decades how will we ever compete with such giants  the same way we always have  by inviting the worlds most enthusiastic and creative people  including the people willing to walk here  to risk disease and degradation and death to land here  to live out their best life under liberty a new migrant caravan is forming in honduras  and the president is itching for the resulting political fight  heres hoping democrats respond with creativity and verve  not just no wall  not just abolish ice  instead  let them in .
president trump has shut down the government to get money for a border wall that he says will stop illegal immigration  but the fact of the matter is that thats not all he wants to stop  during the three day shutdown last january  he demanded a 40 percent reduction in legal immigration  arguing that america has been swamped by immigrants  theres a limit to how many people a nation can responsibly absorb into their societies   he has declared he is not alone in invoking this boogeyman  that america is being overwhelmed by a flood of immigrants has become conventional wisdom across the political spectrum  presented in books from  on the right  reihan salam of national review  the son of bangladeshi immigrants  in the center  francis fukuyama of stanford  whose mother immigrated from japan  and on the left  jefferson cowie of vanderbilt university  who actually counsels his fellow progressives not to fear more immigration but by any reasonable metric  the idea that america is experiencing mass immigrationis a myth  the reality is that we desperately need to pick up the pace of immigration to maintain our work force and economic health you could argue that mass immigration  a vague term with no set definition  is happening in lebanon and jordan  primary destinations for refugees escaping syrias civil war  lebanon  which had about 4 4 million people in 2010  has admitted in just a few years around one million syrian refugees  which works out to around 23 percent increase in its population in america  by contrast  there are about 44 million foreign born people who now constitute about 13 7 percent of the population  according to the pew research foundation  this is close to the historic high of 15 percent at the turn of the 20th century  why is that considered a meaningful benchmark  because at that time the united states  responding to nativist and union pressure  embraced strict border controls  essentially ending what had until then been an open borders policy literacy tests were instituted in 1917  and the 1924 johnson reed act imposed national origins quotas limiting visas to 2 percent of the total number of people of each nationality in the united states as of the 1890 census  the purpose of this legislation was to cut back immigration overall  especially from eastern europe and asia  and it succeeded spectacularly congress finally eliminated these quotas  which had widely come to be regarded as racist  in 1965  and immigration subsequently picked up  but immigration opponents have made the 15 percent foreign born figure a tipping point  as if it were based on science instead of being an arbitrary historical event  if it were indeed a tipping point  countries would regularly experience a backlash once the immigrant population approached that level  that is far from the case americas share of the foreign born ranks 34th among 50 wealthy countries with a per capita gross domestic product of over  20 000  the united states netted five new immigrants  authorized and unauthorized  per 1 000 people from 2015 to 2017  united nations figures show  compare that to the figures in two other english speaking liberal democracies  canada let in eight  and just announced that its going to admit over a million new immigrants over three years   and australia 14  all in all  the foreign born are now over 20 percent of canadas population and 28 2 percent of australias  more than double americas figure   and yet they havent inspired the sort of public condemnation of immigration that often occurs in the united states  america has also taken in a relatively modest numbers of immigrants over the last half century  in 1965  when congress got rid of national origin quotas  americas foreign born made up around 5 percent of the population  over two decades from 1980 to 2000  this proportion rose to 11 1 percent  from 6 2 percent  not insignificant but not particularly noteworthy but then the rate of increase slowed to a crawl  rising from 11 1 percent in 2000 to 12 9 percent in 2010 and then barely inching to 13 5 percent in 2016  in other words  in six years  americas foreign born population inched up 0 6 percent  yet the more americas  modest  immigration decelerates  the more the mass immigration trope accelerates a good yardstick for whether a country is admitting too many or too few immigrants  beyond the political mood of the moment  is its economic needs  if america were admitting too many immigrants  the economy would have trouble absorbing them  in fact  the unemployment rate among immigrants  including the 11 million undocumented  in 2016  when the economy was considered to be at full employment  was almost three quarters of a point lower than that of natives  how can that be evidence of mass immigration the truth is that america is a low immigration nation  demographic trends in america point to a severe labor crunch thatll become a huge bottleneck for growth unless the country opens its doors wider it has long been clear that the dropping fertility rates of native born white americans meant that the generations coming after the millennials were on track to be much smaller  from 2015 to 2035  the number of working age americans with domestic born parents is expected to fall by eight million  furthermore  the census bureau in 2017 quietly revised downward its population forecast for 2050 by a whopping 50 million people from its 2008 estimates  as jack goldstone  a political demographer at george mason university  pointed out  why  because immigration from mexico dwindled after the great recession at the same time that hispanic fertility rates dropped by a quarter as well  at the current rate that america is admitting immigrants  this means that the total work force will grow only 0 3 percent per year  unless american birthrates pick up suddenly and expand the work force  an unrealistic assumption given that the country just set a record for low fertility  or the productivity of its dwindling work force quickly doubled  only slightly less unrealistic  says mr  goldstone  the united states will be staring at real g d p  growth of less than 1 6 percent per year in less than a decade  all else remaining equal america should be admitting a million more immigrants per year  more than double the current number from now until 2050  this still wont add up to mass immigration because it would put americas foreign born population that year at around 26 percent  less than australias is today fifteen years ago when i was writing about immigration for the conservative editorial page of the detroit news  the myth that america was being overwhelmed by immigrants had retreated mostly to nativist activist circles  just because it has spread now does not mean its true  its a myth that should be killed before it kills the american dream .
washington  standing before a diverse new class of house democrats  in the shadow of their new female speaker  president trump showed on tuesday how he planned to govern in a divided washington the answer  judging by his words  is no differently than he did before mr  trump briefly acknowledged nancy pelosi as madam speaker  but dispensed with even perfunctory congratulations  he all but ignored the midterm elections that swept the republican party out of power in the house  and he vowed that the united states will never be a socialist country  likening the progressive democrats in the chamber to the discredited leader of venezuela the president did issue a call for bipartisan cooperation  and he invoked the heroism of world war ii to celebrate a shared history  but on the issues that have rived washington during mr  trumps turbulent presidency  he did not give an inch whether it was the border wall  which he insisted would be built  abortion  where he tried to fan conservative anger over comments made by virginias governor  or the investigations of his presidential campaigns ties to russia  which he dismissed as ridiculous and partisan  mr  trump chose to appeal to his political base rather than trying to build bridges to democrats if there is going to be peace and legislation  he declared  setting out the terms of his engagement with congress  there cannot be war and investigation  it just doesnt work that way save for the majesty of the setting  the presidents adherence to his script  and a single unscripted moment when mr  trump tipped his hat to the scores of democratic women elected to congress last november  parts of this state of the union speech could have been drawn from one of his make america great again rallies mr  trump warned of a new wave of invading caravans from central america  spoke of grisly crimes committed by illegal immigrants and accused what he said were wealthy politicians who oppose his immigration policies  presumably including ms  pelosi  of favoring open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards no issue better illustrates the divide between americas working class and political class than illegal immigration  he said in front of him  however  the divide was between the mostly male republicans  who applauded his red meat lines  and the democrats  many of them women  who were clad in white to signify the womens suffrage movement mr  trump delighted in his role as the dismantler of democratic legacies  he boasted of eliminating a very unpopular provision of obamacare  withdrawing the united states from the disastrous iran nuclear deal and renegotiating the catastrophe known as nafta as for how the republicans and democrats might work together  mr  trump revived his proposal for infrastructure legislation  calling it not an option but a necessity  but he offered no details and breezed through the proposal  which is less popular among republicans  in barely three lines  half as much time as he gave his campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs even mr  trumps conciliatory phrases carried a partisan sting  he said  for example  the agenda i will lay out this evening is not a republican agenda or a democrat agenda  using a shortened form of democratic that some republicans favor as a mild slur against the opposing party for a president whose party lost 40 seats in the house three months ago  and who just lost a battle with ms  pelosi over the 35 day government shutdown  mr  trump behaved like the insurgent who rode into washington two years ago with a congressional majority and a mandate to upend the establishment he claimed credit for a long list of economic and national security achievements  some of which were almost comically exaggerated  if i had not been elected president of the united states  he said  we would right now  in my opinion  be in a major war with north korea in addressing congress on tuesday  mr  trump found himself in an identical position to his three immediate predecessors  barack obama  george w  bush and bill clinton  facing a hostile congress after a devastating midterm defeat how each confronted the moment offers a window into their presidencies  together  they stand as a stark contrast to the current occupant of the oval office in 1995  mr  clinton responded to the republican revolution of the previous november by pivoting to the center and giving credence to the small government agenda of newt gingrich and his fellow warriors  he admitted to missteps in his first two years in office  which had allowed his republican opponents to caricature him as a tax and spend liberal mr  clinton sketched a vision of a leaner  more efficient government  with fewer regulations and an overhauled welfare system  the conservative commentator william kristol marveled that it was the most conservative state of the union by a democratic president in history twelve years later  mr  bush opened his state of the union address with a warm tribute to ms  pelosi  who assumed the speakers gavel for the first time after democrats swept to power in the house in 2006  he spoke of the pride her late father  thomas dalesandro jr   a congressman from maryland  would have felt in seeing his only daughter  nancy  presiding tonight it was a grace note for mr  bush  who was fighting to salvage his legacy after midterm elections that served as a referendum on the iraq war and his bungled handling of hurricane katrina  mr  trump  by contrast  appeared to rush his opening remarks to deny ms  pelosi the chance to introduce him mr  obamas speech in 2011 came days after former representative gabrielle giffords was nearly killed in a mass shooting in tucson  a tragedy that muted the normally partisan tone  mr  obama seized on the fleeting comity to declare  each of us is part of something greater  something more consequential than party or political preference like mr  bush and mr  clinton  he appealed to republicans to find common ground  in his case behind a national project to make the united states more competitive in a rapidly changing global economy this is our generations sputnik moment  mr  obama said  urging americans to out innovate  out educate and out build the rest of the world mr  trump referred to outspending and out innovating major competitors  too  but he put it in the context of building nuclear weapons  after explaining why he pulled the united states out of the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty for presidents  state of the union speeches rarely grease the wheels of bipartisanship  mr  clinton clashed repeatedly with republicans after their congressional takeover  outmaneuvering mr  gingrich after he precipitated a government shutdown  though he made a historic deal on welfare overhaul that set the stage for his re election in 1996 mr  bush stuck to his troop surge in iraq  reaping unexpected gains  but with the exception of a deal with the democrats late in his term on the fiscal crisis  his legislative agenda was over by the time he spoke in 2007 mr  obamas call for bipartisanship went nowhere in the republican senate  where the leader  senator mitch mcconnell  vowed to make mr  obama a one term president  he failed to strike a grand bargain on fiscal policy with speaker john a  boehner  with both sides blaming the other for bad faith in the failed negotiation for mr  trump  the portents for cooperation seem even less promising  he offered no tangible compromise on the border wall  he faces a newly energized democratic party and he is heading into a presidential election year we must choose between greatness and gridlock  results or resistance  vision or vengeance  incredible progress or pointless destruction  mr  trump said the president implored his audience to choose greatness  but he gave them no road map for pursuing it .
washington  president trump has stepped back from declaring a national emergency to pay for a border wall  under pressure from congressional republicans  his own lawyers and advisers  who say using it as a way out of the government shutdown does not justify the precedent it would set and the legal questions it could raise if today the national emergency is border security  tomorrow the national emergency might be climate change  senator marco rubio of florida  one of the ideas critics  said this week  another republican  senator mitt romney of utah  told an interviewer that declaring a national emergency should be reserved for the most extreme circumstances mr  trump  who according to aides has grown increasingly frustrated over the refusal of democrats to bend and sees the shutdown as a road with no off ramp in sight  hinted on friday that the warnings were having an effect what were not looking to do right now is national emergency  he told reporters gathered in the cabinet room as the shutdown approached its fourth week  minutes later he contradicted himself  saying that he would declare a state of emergency if he had to as speaker nancy pelosi and senator chuck schumer  the minority leader  have proved immune to mr  trumps threats  the idea of using the presidents constitutional powers to declare an emergency has received close scrutiny in the white house because it would enable mr  trump to obtain the  5 7 billion he has sought for construction of a wall without the approval of congress instead  mr  trump would use his authority to transfer funds to the wall that were appropriated by congress for other purposes  toward that end  the army corps of engineers has been directed to study whether it can divert about  13 9 billion in emergency aide set aside for puerto rico  florida  texas and california  and with the money secured  the president could drop his opposition to the appropriations bills whose passage would end the shutdown that would allow mr  trump to say he had never backed down from his fight with congressional democrats or abandoned his pledge to build the wall even if the construction became tied up in legal challenges former white house aides  who noted that mr  trump did not focus on the wall during the first two years of his presidency  said the optics of fighting for the wall were more important to the president than erecting it but opposition has come from many republican quarters  some conservatives see it as an unacceptable extension of executive power  kellyanne conway  a white house aide  has said it would essentially give congress a pass  representative mike simpson  republican of idaho and a member of the house appropriations committee  said it was not clear to him that an emergency declaration would even lead to the prompt reopening of the government he called it a bad escape hatch that was going to anger many house members mr  trumps reluctance is also frustrating allies ginning him up to take action  if its a crisis  treat it like a crisis  stephen k  bannon  the former chief white house strategist  said in an interview  his best option now is to declare a national security emergency and get on with it on thursday  mr  trump traveled to the border in texas to dramatize his support for a wall but used a photo op along the banks of the rio grande on thursday only to repeat his familiar arguments for building it  he sidestepped the issue when sean hannity  the fox news host  asked him in an interview that night to detail what a national emergency would look like theres some compromise needed  mr  trump said but mr  trump  who allies said was eager to spend time at his mar a lago club in florida and resented the advice of aides to deliver an oval office address and travel to texas on thursday  is left with few good options as he searches for a way to end the political stalemate with democratic lawmakers  mr  trump is finding himself boxed in  in a familiar position when it comes to immigration issues  former aides say that is because he conflates legal and policy issues with public relations campaigns and does not anticipate an endgame in march  mr  trump was facing pressure to meet a deadline on a decision about what to do with immigrants who were part of the deferred action for childhood arrivals program  which allowed young adults brought to the united states illegally as children to avoid deportation and become eligible for a work permit racked by anxiety as he quizzed aides for advice  mr  trump turned to an adviser and asked  how do i get out of this in the end  mr  trump was saved  at least temporarily  by a federal appeals court ruling last year that he could not immediately end the program  mr  trump moved on in the opening weeks of his presidency  mr  trump issued an executive order banning citizens from seven majority muslim countries from entering the united states  that ban was almost immediately halted in court  a second  rewritten version  however  was upheld by the supreme court and was seen as at least a partial victory for the administration but mr  trump vented  privately and publicly  that the version that passed legal muster was watered down and p c   and made him look weak how mr  trump found himself in his most recent predicament can be traced back to september  when white house aides and conservative lawmakers urged the president to engage in a fight for wall funding  but he was told to postpone the fight until after the election  to avoid forcing vulnerable republicans in swing districts to take a politically perilous stance on the wall when he looked like he might compromise and support a bill that provided far less money for the wall than he asked for  conservatives like ann coulter excoriated him  describing him as gutless  and he backed down  soon he was telling mr  schumer and ms  pelosi during a televised oval office meeting last month that he would proudly own the shutdown  thrilling conservatives buoyed by the praise  and encouraged by the acting white house chief of staff  mick mulvaney  mr  trump decided to keep digging in but that encouragement for what played well in a viral television moment never led to a coherent strategy for a prolonged stalemate  according to a half dozen people in the white house or working with the administration on a way to end the shutdown mr  trumps allies insist that he is winning the political battle democrats are boxed in  said greg mueller  a conservative strategist  every time the president and g o p  go to the democrats with a fix  they say no  which positions them as obstructionists ignoring the problem  and opening themselves up for major troubles in 2020 senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina  who had tried and failed to find an alternative to reopen the government earlier in the week  emerged from a meeting with mr  trump on friday declaring that it was clear democrats dont want to make a deal and will never support border wall barriers and he encouraged the exact action many of his colleagues were warning against  mr  president  declare a national emergency now  he said  build a wall now mr  trumps aides said they expected the stalemate over the wall funding to be resolved by the time he delivers the state of the union address on jan  29  but the white house also has drafts based on the shutdown being over  or well into its sixth week .
washington  the trump administration said tuesday that it would summon tens of thousands of federal employees back to work without pay to get the government running amid a partial shutdown well into its third week  as the white house and increasingly agitated lawmakers on capitol hill cast about for a way to end the stalemate on a day of inertia and theatrics in washington  the partisan disconnect fueling the deadlock was on full  sometimes absurd  display  house democrats spurned an invitation by president trump to a bipartisan lunch at the white house  drawing howls of outrage from mr  trumps team  while democrats dismissed the steak and potatoes meal as little more than a photo opportunity  a group of house democratic freshmen marched across the capitol  with reporters in tow  to publicly confront senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  with demands to end the impasse  but mr  mcconnell was not in his office  so they left a note in between the choreographed scenes of non negotiation  republicans and democrats toiled privately to find a solution that mr  trump would accept  the talks were expected to continue wednesday  after the president issued yet another invitation to a group of centrists from both parties  the problem solvers caucus  who were scheduled to attend a meeting with him in the situation room senior administration officials  in the latest indication that they do not expect the partial shutdown to end anytime soon  made contingency plans to call back workers without pay  the federal aviation administration said it was bringing thousands of furloughed inspectors and other employees back to work  while the internal revenue service released a plan to have 46 000 of its 80 000 employees on the job for tax filing season  up from about 10 000 the interior department is bringing back at least 40 federal employees tasked to work on a plan to sell oil and gas drilling leases off the entire united states coastline in washington  the deadlock showed no sign of subsiding  in the house  some freshman democrats who won in districts carried by mr  trump in 2016 showed some sign of concern  they met on tuesday to talk about whether  and how hard  to push their leaders to negotiate with the white house maybe its an outlier view compared to some others in the democratic party  but i believe we have a responsibility to get in a room and negotiate  said representative elissa slotkin  democrat of michigan  who hosted the session in her office but the house democrats absence from mr  trumps lunch on tuesday was the latest indication that their party is standing firm for now against his demand that any proposal to reopen the government must include  5 7 billion for a wall on the southwestern border  white house officials  who had issued the invitation in the hopes of showing fissures among democrats  used the regrets only response to deflect responsibility for the prolonged shutdown  arguing that mr  trump was the one trying to end the impasse  a slew of recent polls have found that the public largely blames mr  trump and republicans for the continuing dysfunction unfortunately  no democrats will attend  sarah huckabee sanders  the white house press secretary  said in a statement about the lunch  she added  its time for the democrats to come to the table and make a deal speaker nancy pelosi of california and senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  have refused to negotiate over border security until the government reopens  but mr  trump has ruled out separating the two issues  while the democratic led house has passed several bills to end the shutdown  mr  mcconnell has said he will not advance the legislation knowing that the president will not sign it in a situation like this  where the president  in my view  is in the right place  trying to get the right outcome  as all of us have expressed  with regard to border security  of course not  mr  mcconnell said ms  slotkin would not say whether she agreed with ms  pelosis stance that no negotiation was possible until the government reopened  citing a confidentiality pledge she said members of the group had taken about their discussion  but she said she and her colleagues were walking around with copies of legislation co written by representative will hurd  republican of texas  and representative pete aguilar  democrat of california  that drew bipartisan support last year  the measure paired border security improvements with legal status for some undocumented immigrants brought to the united states illegally as children  sometimes called dreamers theres a lot of people who believe its important to work across the aisle  that we need a practical way forward  and they believe in figuring out practical solutions  ms  slotkin said  we know were not in charge  but we want to get caught trying to help she said she had called ms  pelosi on monday to relay complaints by her constituents over the weekend about the shutdown  and has also been talking quietly with republicans  whom she would not name  about how to find a way out of the stalemate yet democratic leaders expressed confidence that their members would not break from their leaders strategy  notwithstanding mr  trumps attempts to entice them is anybody surprised that the president is trying to get votes wherever he can get votes  representative steny h  hoyer of maryland  the majority leader  told reporters on tuesday  we are totally united  totally in a closed door meeting of house democratic leaders on monday  ms  pelosi and mr  hoyer said they had no problem with the idea of rank and file democrats meeting with mr  trump  ms  pelosi said such a session would give lawmakers a sense of what weve been dealing with in a series of tense meetings with the president in the situation room since the shutdown began  theyll want to make a citizens arrest  she added at one point  according to an official in the room who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversation was private in the senate  bipartisan efforts to forge a consensus appeared to have stalled as both sides agreed little progress was possible while the government remained shuttered a group of republican and democratic senators met privately on monday in the office of senator joe manchin iii  democrat of west virginia  to try to find a way out of the gridlock  but the talks yielded no breakthrough there was nothing there with structure to it except what do you think  how can we get people back  mr  manchin said  i think we all understand that you have to have immigration reform with security  that has to be done simultaneously  and i dont think that can be done while theres a shutdown the group included senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina  who tried last week to forge a compromise that would pair border security funding with legal status for certain groups of immigrants facing deportation  democrats in the room said no progress could be made on such a deal until the government was reopened  two officials familiar with the talks said  and republicans agreed what i would hope is that the president would reconsider and allow the government to reopen for a brief period while senators worked on a compromise  said senator lamar alexander  republican of tennessee  who attended the session but the president has repeatedly ruled out doing so  and privately told democrats this month that such a move would make him look foolish as the gridlock continued  the trump administration was searching for ways to lessen the pain of the partial shutdown for those affected  kirstjen nielsen  the secretary of homeland security  said she was working on legislation to ensure that the coast guard  the only branch of the military going without pay during the lapse in funding  would be compensated the acting director of the office of personnel management has been working with payroll providers to ensure that some federal workers going without compensation would receive back pay within a few days of when the government reopens  according to a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity without authorization to discuss the plan .
boulogne sur mer  france  there is disquiet along the cold  foggy quays of this major french fishing port facing britain captain after captain  returning to boulogne sur mer in squat fishing boats with the days haul of crab and sole  has the same story  their boats are being broken into the suspected culprits  according to the fishermen and local officials  smugglers  and their migrant clients  who are intent on reaching britain and are looking for vessels to cross the forbidding waters of the english channel  a few of the stolen boats have even been taken to sea since the start of europes migration crisis in 2015  the english channel has largely been seen as an unbreachable barrier  its shifting currents and volatile weather making any attempt to cross too dangerous but officials in boulogne sur mer  frances largest fishing port  reported a surge of these migrant crossings in the last three months of 2018  whether in a stolen fishing boat or  far more frequently  in small inflatable craft that set off in the dark from the miles of beaches lining the french coast this is something completely new for us  said marc bonnafous  who oversees the governments search and rescue operation in the channel waters from the lighthouse high above the sea here at cap gris nez  up the coast from boulogne  and it has absolutely exploded last year  around 500 migrants  10 times as many as in 2017  attempted the voyage across the channel  a trip of about 20 miles at its narrowest point  more than half made it across the relatively small numbers notwithstanding  the crossings have set off large concerns in britain  with headlines and anti immigration politicians calling it a crisis  this month  the french interior minister  after talks with his british equivalent  announced that patrols would be increased at the port to try to stop any crossing attempts along the quays in boulogne  the taciturn fishermen expressed surprise at the sudden intrusion of this new competitor for the sea this boat is my business  its my only enterprise  said jean marie baheu  as he glumly tried to fix a lock damaged in a break in on his boxy  40 foot fishing boat  the murex  someone had tried to smash into the captains cabin several nights before  damaging the door we just dont know what to do about this  mr  baheu said  fiddling with a screwdriver the quai gambetta  onto which deck hands from the murex were hoisting crates of freshly caught crab as the captain worked on his repairs  gives out directly on to the sea and is the preferred docking spot for the ports skippers  from here  they can unload their catch directly to the fish stalls run by relatives that line the waterfront but the quay is readily accessible from the town  and its exposure makes the boats vulnerable  twelve attempted break ins have been logged in recent weeks  said stphane pinto  the vice president of the regional fishermans committee weve never seen anything like this  said valerie arnout  who was at her stand on the quay selling sole and skate caught by her brother that morning  its really very disturbing the town  the largest fish processing center in europe  depends on its fleet for survival  so any threat to the boats is taken seriously  some of the fishermen are vowing to sit up all night in their boats  cradling their guns its the worry above all  ms  arnout said  were all very concerned about it around here as other routes to britain are blocked  the tunnel at calais is sealed up tight and french officials have taken a tough line on the camps that once flourished at its edges  regularly dispersing them  the frigid  treacherous waters of the channel beckon to the desperate migrants most of those attempting the crossing by boat are iranians  according to officials  in part because they have the means to pay the hefty fees demanded  in one recent case  a group of the migrants paid their smuggler 100 000 euros  around  115 000  officials said the english channel is one of the most heavily trafficked waterways in the world  with giant container ships and ferries whose wake could easily tip over the frail  inflatable skiffs typically used by the migrants  which is what makes the much more seaworthy fishing boats so attractive the risks are extremely high  mr  bonnafous said the currents are strong and constant  he added  and the water so cold that you would survive for less than an hour in a marine police photograph of a rescue off calais on dec  27  one man is clad in a t shirt  five of the 11 rescued had hypothermia so far  there have been no reported deaths from the crossings  but mr  bonnafous thinks it is only a matter of time  and as news of the successful crossings reaches more migrants  the number of attempts is likely to rise  increasing the odds of fatalities  there were 78 crossings and attempts last year  with the number spiking in november and december from the lighthouse where mr  bonnafous works  the white cliffs of dover  england  are visible in the distance  his colleagues are bent over radar screens tracking the crossings a boat taking what mr  bonnafous calls an erratic course will trigger an alarm among the rescuers  although it is often the migrants themselves who call the emergency number and ask to be rescued the distress calls often come in the early morning hours  leaving the rescue teams the nightmare task of finding the small boats in the dark  like looking for a needle in a haystack  mr  bonnafous said while the recent effort to steal mr  baheus boat failed  in a few cases the thieves have succeeded in november  17 iranians made off with the epervier  taking it from the docks of boulogne and sailing to dover  where they were arrested and on a dark night just before christmas  14 migrants  including several children  made it seven miles off the coast on a boat stolen from the inner harbor at boulogne  the st  catherine  before the motor gave out  the thieves had forgotten to open the cooling valves they completely fried the motor  said quentin gillon  who was sorting a tangled mass of ropes on the deck of the saint catherine  his cousins boat  and then the boat got stuck on new years eve  it was the turn of the caprice des temps  the police  making the rounds on the quay  arrested 17 people  including a mother and two children  before the boat was able to depart on christmas day  the dashboard of the don lubi  the boat belonging to mr  pinto  the regional fishing official  was ripped out  the thieves were trying to connect wires underneath to start the engine  they failed  but ruined the motor in the process  that same day  around 40 migrants made it across the channel mr  pinto said he was not unsympathetic to the plight of the migrants  but he was concerned both for their safety and his livelihood these nonprofits that are supposed to be helping the migrants  they should come down here on the quays and warn them not to risk their lives  he said .
washington  for months  president trump has been railing about the urgent need for a wall to protect against what he calls an invasion of illegal immigrants flooding across the southwestern border  but he has also been delivering another message  we need workers  he told a group of activists recently in other words  he wants more immigrants i want people to come into our country  in the largest numbers ever  but they have to come in legally  mr  trump ad libbed last month during his state of the union address comments like those from the president have ignited furious criticism from his hard line  anti immigrant supporters who accuse him of caving to demands for cheap foreign labor from corporations  establishment republicans and big donors while abandoning his election promise to protect his working class supporters from the effects of globalism this is clearly a betrayal of what immigration hawks hoped the trump administration would be for  said mark krikorian  the executive director of the center for immigration studies  which advocates cutting legal immigration by more than half  he warned that mr  trump was in danger of being not even that different from a conventional republican breitbart news  a conservative website that promotes anti immigrant messaging  published on thursday the latest in a series of articles attacking mr  trump for catering to big business at the expense of the americans who put him in the oval office  trump requests more foreign workers as southern border gets overrun  the site blared on its home page that mr  trump would advance the interests of the global elite ahead of our citizens would be a tragic reversal on any day  lou dobbs  the fox business network host  said in a televised rant against the president on wednesday evening  the white house has simply lost its way corporations and influential corporate conservatives such as charles g  koch and the u s  chamber of commerce have long urged the president to help them recruit the talent they need by expanding the number of workers who can enter the united states from other countries that has become more urgent as the economy has improved and as declining unemployment has made it harder for companies to find workers  to assuage their concerns  mr  trump has increasingly tailored his immigration talking points to cater to the needs of business executives like those who attended a business round table on wednesday at the white house were going to have a lot of people coming into the country  we want a lot of people coming in  and we need it  mr  trump said as he sat next to tim cook  the chief executive of apple  and other executives  we want to have the companies grow  and the only way theyre going to grow is if we give them the workers  and the only way were going to have the workers is to do exactly what were doing but that message runs counter to the hard line immigration image that mr  trump has carefully nurtured  most recently by shutting the government down for 35 days in a failed attempt to pressure congress to fund a wall on the mexican border mr  trump won the white house in no small part by embracing anti immigrant messaging that tapped into the economic fears of blue collar workers upset about losing their jobs to foreign workers  throughout the 2016 presidential campaign  he attacked undocumented immigrants as rapists and murderers and called for a big  beautiful wall along the border with mexico since becoming president  mr  trump has aggressively sought to crack down on illegal border crossings  increase deportations  cut the number of refugees allowed into the united states and make it harder for migrants to claim asylum  he has complained about drug dealers  gangs and members of central american caravans pouring across the border  and last summer  his administration separated thousands of migrant children from their parents in an effort to deter central american families from trying to seek refuge in the united states the harsh record  and comments by mr  trump that disparaged african nations in vulgar terms and suggested that haitian immigrants all have aids  has earned him the enmity of democrats and immigration activists  who call him a racist president it is unclear whether mr  trump will follow through on his recent  pro business messaging  many of the presidents aides  including stephen miller  his top immigration adviser in the white house  agree with the hard line activists about the need to lower legal immigration in 2017  mr  trump endorsed the raise act  a republican senate bill that would reduce legal immigration by as much as 50 percent  and the administration is currently considering a proposal to cut immigration by denying work authorizations  known as h 4 permits  to almost 100 000 spouses of immigrants who are brought in by companies to work legally in the united states but even so  some of the nations most hard line anti immigration activists have become increasingly nervous that mr  trump might waver on their primary concern  the need to shrink the number of immigrants who enter the united states each year  currently 1 1 million they argue that tight labor markets make it exactly the wrong time to allow more foreign workers to compete with americans  chris chmielenski  the deputy director of numbersusa  which lobbies for lower legal immigration  said companies should be pressured to hire more americans instead anything we do now to bring in more foreign workers could actually reverse some of the economic gains over the last four years  mr  chmielenski said  were absolutely concerned  we feel this isnt how he ran on the issue last week  in an effort to communicate that message directly to mr  trump  numbersusa began airing an ad on fox news channel in the hopes that the president would get the message that his supporters do not want to let in more than one million immigrants each year the majority of voters say the number should be cut to 500 000 or less  the ad said  americans want less immigration mr  krikorian  of the center for immigration studies  said that companies that no longer have access to foreign workers would have no choice but to turn to americans who are still struggling to find work  people with disabilities  teenagers  older people and even former convicts he also said that modest increases in wages for workers would evaporate if companies were allowed to simply tap an unlimited pool of lower paid workers from other countries if you want wages to go up  mr  krikorian said  you dont import more foreign labor business groups dispute that analysis  they argue that immigration expands the amount of business activity in the united states  adding jobs and increasing wages for the vast majority of american workers our country has benefited tremendously from welcoming people who have contributed to our economy  our communities  across the board  said james davis  a spokesman for the koch network  we want to welcome in everyone who wants to contribute to our society  we want to see more legal immigration todd schulte  the president of fwd us  a pro immigration advocacy group that started with backing from mark zuckerberg  a founder of facebook  said that immigrants and immigration increase economic growth  they increase economic productivity and they increase wages for the overwhelming number of native born americans mr  schulte  whose group has been highly critical of mr  trumps anti immigrant messaging and policies  welcomed the presidents recognition that legal immigration is a positive thing for the united states economy but he cautioned that mr  trump must be measured by his actions  not his words  he called on the president to halt the effort to deny the h 4 work permits to immigrant spouses he should stop trying to revoke the h 4 rule  mr  schulte said  increasing legal immigration would help native born americans  unfortunately  the record has been one bent on cutting overall immigration levels .

patrol agents in texas and new mexico a new york times review of records and dozens of interviews with migrants  agents  researchers and health workers suggest that some of these deaths were not anomalies  but rather signs of entrenched problems that have repeatedly put detainees with medical conditions at risk at respite centers like the one in mcallen  tex   that shelter migrants for a night or two after they are released from border patrol custody  doctors say the care provided by the agency has sometimes been so poor that they have had to send new arrivals straight to emergency rooms theyre not treated as if their health and well being is valued on any level  said dr  anna landau  a family medicine doctor who volunteers at a migrant shelter run by catholic community services in tucson  how do you send people who are clearly hurting  clearly in pain and suffering  how do you just move them through as if theyre just another number  as opposed to an actual human being migrants crossing the border from mexico may be injured scaling barriers  in vehicle accidents  by gunfire or from nearly drowning  they may be suffering from dehydration  heat exhaustion or communicable illnesses  from influenza to chickenpox  that often spread in conditions of close confinement  though none so far have presented what health officials regard as an unusual or alarming public health or infectious disease threat  some require medications for chronic diseases such as asthma  diabetes and high blood pressure  yet border patrol facilities until now have failed to provide comprehensive health screenings for those in their care  medications  including lifesaving prescriptions for such conditions as asthma  heart disease and infant diarrhea  are routinely confiscated  some migrants describe being left alone in concrete cells with broken bones and recent surgeries  their pain medication deeply inadequate in the coming days  the agency is expected to announce significant changes related to the health of migrants  including policies requiring border patrol agents to conduct more thorough interviews of each migrant who is processed through the system  and to refer all those who need care to a medical provider the agency is also building a large new processing center in el paso and adding  47 million to a private contract for migrant medical care were doing everything we can to ensure rapid medical care when needed  kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  said at the white house in january  the men and women of c b p  and ice are doing the best they can with what they have  but they dont have the facilities  the resources or the legal authorities to keep up with this crisis  read  the hidden nightmare of sexual violence on the border representative raul ruiz  a democrat from california who is also a physician  helped secure funding for additional measures to improve migrant health after visiting border facilities where he said he saw children coughing and sneezing and infants without diapers  all packed tightly into cells with little in the way of food  soap and other basics  the border patrol stations and those working there were unprepared  untrained and underequipped in dealing with the humanitarian needs of families  he said the moves come after years of warnings from both inside and outside government that were largely ignored by an agency that saw its primary mission as law enforcement  catching and deporting illegal border crossers  not nursing them back to health border patrol is a law enforcement agency  its not a humanitarian agency  said dr  alexander l  eastman  a senior medical officer with the homeland security department who is trying to put into place  for the first time  a comprehensive approach to the care of migrants across the department some health care workers said they have seen border patrol agents in the field prioritize enforcement of immigration laws over migrants urgent medical needs  ambulance crews near the border say they sometimes face delays at border patrol checkpoints in one case around five years ago  described to the times by two people who worked for an emergency medical response team in starr county  tex   a critically ill woman was driven across the bridge from mexico into rio grande city and loaded into an ambulance from a nearby hospital  a paramedic  sergio garza jr   began to help her with her breathing  but a c b p  employee  he said  opened the back doors of the vehicle and ordered the patient sent back  because she did not have papers to enter the united states mr  garza and the director of his ambulance company protested  to no avail  mr  garza grudgingly transferred the patient back to a mexican ambulance  which did not have trained personnel aboard  both he and the director recalled  mr  garza said he showed the patients husband how to squeeze an oxygen bag to try to keep his wife alive as she was driven toward a distant mexican hospital  she died on the way there  the emergency workers said for at least a decade  families and advocacy organizations have reported lapses in medical care for people in the custody of c b p  complaints filed over the past few years included a mother who gave birth prematurely and was later forced to stay with the baby in a dirty hold room  a detainee who was refused access to prescribed heart medication  and a woman who had heavy vaginal bleeding after a sexual assault and was not provided any medical attention the number of deaths remains unknown and is perhaps unknowable  the agency until december was not required to independently review or publicly report health related deaths in its custody  and the consequences of failing to address urgent medical needs often emerge after detainees are quickly passed on to another agency  or released in 2015  c b p  addressed some of the criticisms by establishing its first nationwide standards on transport and detention  however  the standards are nonbinding  the agency cannot be sued for not following them  and the subject of medical care in detention covers less than a page detention by customs and border protection is intended to be brief  72 hours or less  according to the standards  however that guideline is often broken  felipe gmez alonzo  the boy who died in december and had influenza  was in his sixth day of detention when he was taken to a hospital  according to a timeline provided by the agency at the hospital  felipe was found to have a 103 degree fever  he was discharged from the emergency room several hours later  and agents took him back to a temporary holding cell at a highway checkpoint  hours later  as the boy grew sicker  no medically trained agents were on duty there  he was returned to the hospital  but lost consciousness on the way children should not be held in c b p  holding cells longer than 24 hours  said kathryn hampton  a program officer for physicians for human rights and the author of a recent study that found that the focus on securing the border has come at the cost of migrants safety in some cases  border patrol agents take sick migrants to be seen at hospitals  but problems persist once they are brought back to c b p s crowded  ill equipped facilities sonia diaz castro  39  an asylum seeker from honduras  had fallen off the top of a 25 foot border wall as she entered the united states last year and was left barely able to move  with a broken elbow and pelvis border patrol agents in new mexico took her twice to local hospitals  and a doctor at one of them said he was promised by the agents that she would be given a wheelchair and have someone on hand to help her get around  she had neither  though she was barely able to move  she was left alone in a concrete cell  when she had to use the toilet  she was forced to drag herself across the floor using her broken arm i just felt like crying out  like the only thing i could do was cry  and when i think about it  it still makes me want to cry  ms  diaz castro said of the experience on a typical afternoon in early february  border patrol radios in south texas crackled with reports of bodies  people whose unauthorized crossing of the border had been detected by ground motion sensors and cameras on poles and tethered radar blimps agents responded as about 60 people from honduras  guatemala  ecuador and nicaragua  including mothers with children and some unaccompanied minors  clambered off rafts after crossing the rio grande  hefting bags and babies  they climbed a muddy dirt path that cut through spiny brushlands  walking toward the agents  who awaited them at a gap in the border wall ren reyes  a border patrol agent and emergency medical technician  eyeballed them for  he said  anything life threatening mr  reyes stopped briefly to ask parents about a boy with surgical scars on his head who was wearing a mask over his nose and mouth  he had a condition that causes too much fluid to build up in the brain  but he appeared stable  the kids look o k   mr  reyes concluded  his initial assessment of the entire group lasted less than five minutes the children would get a more thorough medical check at their next stop  one of two temporary detention facilities in an industrial part of mcallen  inside the agencys largest processing center for migrants  chain link fencing divides a vast warehouse with concrete floors into clusters of cells separating men from women and older children from parents  the site was opened in 2014 specifically for the temporary holding of families and unaccompanied children  when that site is full  an older facility with enclosed  jail like cells processes families several blocks away that afternoon  medical screeners sent a newly arrived 6 month old  victoria medina  to the hospital after noticing that she was sick with a fever  severe cough and diarrhea  hospital workers treated the baby and sent her back to c b p that night victorias mother  mayte medina  an 18 year old from honduras  lay on the bare floor of her chilly isolation cell under a thin mylar sheet and held on tight to her coughing baby  the fever broke  but the diarrhea continued  the bottle of medicine ms  medina had carried with her to treat it had been in her backpack  which was confiscated when she was taken into custody  i told everyone about it  everyone that saw her  ms  medina said  they never gave her anything ms  medinas relatively easy access to medical care was possible in part because she was apprehended in the heart of the rio grande valley  the most heavily trafficked way station for migrants in the united states  last year  more than 63 200 migrants traveling as families were apprehended there the border patrol facilities in mcallen are among the few in the country that have a small number of midlevel health professionals  nurse practitioners or physician assistants  on site  as government officials examine how they might expand medical services  those sites have been looked at as potential models but even in those places  providing care in a facility where the ultimate decisions are controlled by law enforcement authorities sometimes frustrates practice and strains ethics  a former contract health care worker at the mcallen sites  who was not authorized to speak on the record by her previous employer  loyal source  recalled several occasions when she had alerted agents that a patient needed to go to the emergency room  two or three hours later  she said  the patient was still there sometimes  she said  she blocked migrants with high fevers from being released to longer term detention facilities  but she also sometimes felt intimidated  as if she would be blamed for slowing down the flow she said that according to protocol  if a woman claimed that she had been raped  she had to be offered access to medical care to check for pregnancy  trauma and sexually transmitted infections  but that didnt always occur  she said in recent months  large groups of children and families have crossed into the united states  in remote desert areas lacking in medical infrastructure  including antelope wells  n m   where one of the fatally ill children  jakelin caal maquin  had arrived  a total of 15 border patrol stations or ports of entry that are within 100 miles of the southern border have no hospital within an hours drive  the times review found it is a perilous twist on a problem that has existed for years  after changes in border enforcement practices pushed furtive crossings into these areas some migrants encounter agents and turn themselves in  others spend days traversing vast ranchlands in extreme heat  hundreds die every year  agents often have to extract sick migrants from rough terrain to meet ambulance personnel  who may have to drive for hours to reach hospitals an earlier attempt to solve the problem led to the creation in 1998 of a unit trained in tactical rescues and emergency medical services that has performed thousands of medical interventions  a separate program trains regular agents as emergency medical technicians  over all  around 6 percent of border patrol agents can act as emergency medical services providers  still  the vast majority have only basic training  their protocols and equipment are limited  and they are not present everywhere their skills are needed where local emergency rooms are close at hand  border patrol agents tend to err on the side of caution  taking their charges for costly and sometimes unnecessary medical evaluations  several health providers said in other cases  the border patrol focuses on moving migrants quickly through the system  and many end up in shelters and clinics run by charities  such as the one operated by catholic charities in mcallen on a recent evening  dozens of migrants were dropped off at a shelter near the southern border of california  run by the san diego rapid response network  they stood outside  lined up near white tents under lights powered by a roaring generator  medical workers supported by the county screened them for communicable diseases and other conditions the rotating medical team diagnosed many untreated conditions that could spread  including 362 cases of lice  113 cases of scabies  22 cases of possible influenza  and four cases of chickenpox in the first two months of this year  the medical professionals referred 52 people to an emergency room one young man stood out that evening  he limped to the tent on crutches  in great pain  a metal fixator emerged from his lower left leg  swaddled in layers of bloodied gauze  the only medical record a nurse could find in his belongings was a single x ray showing a severe fracture he had sustained on his journey to the united states the man had undergone surgery on his leg at a nearby hospital and was returned to detention the previous night  now he was at the shelter  they just dropped him here  dr  kathy fischer  the doctor on duty  said with a note of incredulity in her voice  its kind of crazy .
donald trump wants more than a wall the president  once again  has created his own reality  manufactured a crisis  invented an invasion  criminalized immigrants  made up facts and  in a nationally televised speech on tuesday  argued for a new wall at the united states mexico border  how much more american blood must we shed before congress does its job  he asked from the white house mr  trump is not the first president to ask for money for a wall  george h w  bush  bill clinton and george w  bush built fences and walls along the southern border  barack obama maintained the resulting system of roughly 700 miles of physical barriers  so why dont we want mr  trump to build his wall  what is different the difference is that mr  trumps wall is a symbol of hate and racism  it would be completely useless  and it does not address any national emergency the  5 7 billion requested by the trump administration to build 234 more miles of walls and fences would be an enormous waste of time and money  beginning with the first  14 mile stretch of border fencing  built between san diego and tijuana in the early 1990s  undocumented immigrants have shown they can adapt very fast and move to areas with no border barriers  deserts in arizona and open areas along the rio grande in texas are now a favorite point of entry  the same thing would happen with a new trump wall we also know that almost half of all undocumented immigrants arrive by plane or with a visa  they come legally as tourists or visitors and simply overstay their visas  the tallest fence cannot stop that nor would a new wall prevent the flow of illegal drugs entering the country  as mr  trump claimed in his speech  most drug seizures happen at ports of entry  and as long as we have more than 28 million americans regularly using illegal drugs  we will have drug dealers in mexico and the rest of latin america moving their products to the most profitable market in the world the white house claims that 4 000 suspected terrorists were arrested along the southern border last year  that is simply wrong  a vast majority were detained at airports  just six were actually caught crossing illegally by foot i have recently traveled to the border in california and texas  and i can report that contrary to what the president said in his speech  there is no invasion  the undocumented population has not grown in a decade  in fact it has fallen to 10 7 million  and despite the presence of violent drug cartels on the mexican side  the american border towns are among the safest in the country what is undeniable is the humanitarian crisis in tijuana  but it is a crisis created in part by mr  trump  record numbers of desperate families  fleeing violence  corruption and extreme poverty  have been arriving in caravans to our southern border  instead of their asylum requests being promptly processed  as established by international and united states laws  only a few are allowed in every day  this policy of cruelty by design has unjustly affected children and the most vulnerable people in our hemisphere  these refugees certainly do not pose a danger to our national security there is no need for a new wall  except  of course  in mr  trumps mind  the closest he got to building his wall was in january 2018  when democratic senators negotiated a compromise for a wall in exchange for legislation on the deferred action for childhood arrivals program  then the white house unexpectedly walked away from the deal would the democrats revisit the offer  luis gutierrez  who recently retired from the house of representatives after 26 years  once explained to me that it was like paying a ransom for a kidnapping  if the white house brings up the deal this time  it will put the democrats in a moral dilemma  protect the dreamers  maybe including siblings and families  and  in the process  open the government  but the wall would be an essential element of any new deal it wont be easy  it is no longer 2018  things have changed dramatically  democrats control the house and the wall has become toxic  and then  there is the racist thing the wall has become a metaphor to mr  trump and his millions of supporters  it represents a divide between us and them  a physical demarcation for those who refuse to accept that in just a few decades  a majority of the country will be people of color this is about more than just a wall  mr  trump promised it in 2015  in the same speech in which he announced his candidacy  the same speech in which he called mexican immigrants rapists  criminals and drug traffickers  his goal was to exploit the anxiety and resentment of voters in an increasingly multicultural  multiethnic society  mr  trumps wall is a symbol for those who want to make america white again the chant build that wall  build that wall became his hymn  and an insult not just to latinos but also to all people who do not share his xenophobic ideals  the wall went from a campaign promise to a monument built on bigoted ideas  that is why most americans cannot say yes to it  every country has a right to protect its borders  but not to a wall that represents hate  discrimination and fear no  mexico will not pay for the wall  and it seems congress wont either  but the concept of america as an unwelcoming country to immigrants and uncomfortable for minorities is already here in a way  mr  trump already got what he wanted  he is the wall .
washington  when speaker nancy pelosi of california stepped to a microphone last week and pronounced president trumps border wall an immorality  most democrats cheered and nodded their heads but a few privately grimaced  worried that such stark terminology could make it more difficult for democrats and republicans to find their way out of an impasse over border security that has partially shuttered the government for three weeks  deprived about 800 000 federal workers of their pay and increasingly threatens beneficiaries of federal programs democrats  said one democratic lawmaker from a republican leaning district who insisted on anonymity to offer a candid assessment  cannot be seen by the public as calling border security immoral the divide illustrates why democrats are working to focus public attention on the painful costs of the partial government shutdown  vulnerable families going without food assistance  farmers forgoing crop payments  national parks trashed  and mr  trumps recklessness in courting it  rather than delving into the specific details of erecting a barrier on the southwestern border while mr  trump has launched an elaborate public relations effort to draw democrats into a debate over the wall itself  even the material to be used to construct it  democrats are just as determined to talk instead about a more universally resonant theme  the need to get the government open and functioning while negotiations continue it is at the heart of ms  pelosis plan this week to push through the house a series of bills to reopen shuttered federal agencies  including one that passed wednesday for the treasury department and the internal revenue service  among others  like the others poised to be approved this week in the democrat controlled chamber  it is expected to die in the republican controlled senate the goal  to win over more republicans in the house and raise pressure in the senate  where on tuesday  lisa murkowski of alaska became the latest republican to call for a vote to reopen the government as talks on border security continue for democrats  newly in control of the house  the shutdown fight has proved unifying  crystallizing a near universal belief in their ranks that congress should act as a check on the power of a president who has shown little regard for the law and has used his office to sow fear and misinformation on issues like immigration but while they are almost all opposed to the idea of a wall between the united states and mexico  which is unpopular among a majority of americans and strongly opposed by democratic voters  and which has been dismissed as ineffective by border security experts  democrats are less united about what form of border security they do support some of them  including senator chuck schumer of new york  the minority leader  voted in 2006 for 700 miles of fencing along the border  a position the white house has repeatedly sought to spotlight on tuesday  on the morning of mr  trumps address to the nation on the topic  representative steny h  hoyer of maryland  the majority leader  did not mention the word wall once in 11 minutes of opening remarks with reporters  he then sidestepped a question about the difference between fencing and other border security measures that democrats have backed in the past and the wall that the president is demanding i didnt answer it  maybe because i dont have an answer that i think is a really good answer  he finally conceded  fencing and walls have the same effect  one is supported by a large number of experts  but a large number of experts think neither are that effective the reality is that making a nuanced argument about border security  a highly technical and politically charged issue  is difficult and divisive  some democrats have learned that the hard way in recent days representative adam smith of washington  chairman of the armed services committee  seemed to break from ms  pelosis immorality remark during an interview sunday on abcs this week when he tried to explain his past votes for border barriers the wall is not in itself a bad idea  its just  its been done  mr  smith said  and what the president has not done is  he has not made the case that on the portions of the border where a wall has not been built  how is a wall going to actually enhance border security representative liz cheney of wyoming  chairwoman of the house republican conference  jumped on mr  smiths remarks  saying  thats a very different point than the one that speaker pelosi continues to make  which is that a wall is immoral when senator chris coons  democrat of delaware  said this week that mr  trumps recent talk of a wall made of steel slats rather than concrete was progress  he quickly clarified that he was not  in fact  buying into the presidents idea i said that it was a minor step  he told cnn on tuesday  i was accepting that steel slats are preferred by the department of homeland security over a concrete wall  i was not saying that i think that we should be pouring billions of dollars into a border barrier and ms  pelosi has also sought to press the more practical argument  on a card of talking points distributed wednesday by her office  democrats were instructed to emphasize that they favor smart  effective border security solutions  and to focus on mr  trumps tactics  there is no reason for president trump to keep government shut down over his demands for an ineffective  wasteful wall  the card said democratic strategists argue that mr  trumps failure to build broad public support for a wall that he has been demanding since the early days of his presidential candidacy has made it easier for democrats to stake out a unified message obviously  there are some democrats who talk about the wall being immoral or inconsistent with american values  but across the spectrum of democrats  there is an emphasis on the degree to which the wall is waste of taxpayers money and irrelevant to addressing the most important challenges we face with regard to immigration in the country  said geoff garin  a democratic pollster  democrats are being helped a little bit by trumps specificity in what hes looking for  he keeps talking about something that is very specific  and is something that more than half of all americans oppose nick gourevitch  a pollster and communications strategist who advised democrats during the midterm campaign on mr  trumps fear soaked immigration message  said democrats are sticking to the simplest and freshest argument they have to appeal to a public that does not focus on the finer points of border security policy the wall is unpopular  and the wall combined with the shutdown is even more unpopular  mr  gourevitch said most presidents dont lose in a wave election and then double down on the strategy that got them there  he added  but thats what this president seems to be doing .
mcallen  tex   when a president comes to town there are two realities  the one the white house hopes to create and the one that actually exists president trump arrived in this city on the mexican border on thursday to dramatize his desire for a border wall  a hardened position that has caused the partial shutdown of the federal government he surrounded himself with border agents  victims of horrible crimes  a display of methamphetamine and heroin  an ak 47 and an ar 15 rifle  and a trash bag stuffed with  362 062 in cash that had been confiscated by law enforcement officials in his view  it all added up to a single word  crisis  with a lone solution  building a wall  a point he emphasized in a discussion with the crime victims  law enforcement officers and mcallen residents that says it all  mr  trump said of the contraband  they didnt have to go very far  this is all very recent but there was another reality  the display of drugs  weapons and cash was mainly the product of law enforcement actions stopping criminals at international bridges  where most drugs are smuggled  and conventional ports of entry in a place where a wall is already in place  law enforcement officials boasted of apprehending criminals who had built a tunnel  the money was taken from a suspect who had overstayed a visa in a meeting on tuesday with network anchors before his prime time address to the nation  mr  trump had dismissed the trip to mcallen as a waste of time  a mere photo op  but he gamely went forward after arriving here early thursday afternoon a few miles south of mcallen  he stood near a bluff above the rio grande  with mexico in the near distance  there were more border agents  an array of military vehicles and a helicopter flyover for effect with agents saluting the commander in chief  the fox host sean hannity stood nearby  waiting for an exclusive interview hundreds of people lined a nearby highway  many waving signs backing mr  trump  the border agents who assembled for the meeting also gave him hearty cheers  one supporter was joe cantu  a former police chief from a nearby town wearing a make america great again baseball cap and t shirt theyre coming over in banzai waves  mr  cantu said of immigrants crossing into texas other signs told a different story  they said no wall  no hate  we are all immigrants and our only crisis is trumps failing presidency on the route from the meeting to the photo op along the rio grande  the presidents motorcade also passed numerous product distribution centers  large  low slung buildings that employ hundreds of people  those businesses are a product of nafta  the commercial agreement with mexico and canada that mr  trump has labeled the worst of all time  but that has transformed south texas over the last two decades the mcallen area is heavily democratic and the local congressman opposes the wall  as do many local officials  still  the scene was a draw i just wanted to get a picture  said veronica whitacre  a local city commissioner and mcallen native  its sad for south texas that people believe we live in a dangerous place  when i go places  people ask where i am from and i say mcallen  and people say  are you o k  the city is certainly o k  when it comes to crime  which is near a 30 year low  the president did not talk about that  youll have crime in iowa  youll have crime in new hampshire  youll have crime in new york without a wall  mr  trump said mr  trump did not discuss the significant increase in cases of children being separated from their families as a result of his hard line immigration policies  he spoke only a few blocks from a detention center  but did not go in  when asked by a reporter if he would visit it  the president said that he would like to  but that it would be up to the secret service  he did not go he also criticized democrats who have accused him of trying to manufacture a crisis to justify his  5 7 billion border barrier demand  whats manufactured is the word manufactured  the president said kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary who accompanied mr  trump to texas  reiterated the administrations position that what is happening along the border is a crisis those who claim it was manufactured  she said  insulted americans  to that  senator ted cruz  republican of texas  who joined the president and his entourage  added  when we see politicians go on tv and say the borders secure and there is no crisis  they are ignoring reality not to be outdone  dan patrick  the texas lieutenant governor  added  to those who say this is a manufactured crisis  its a manufactured cover up by your opposition democrats have insisted that the administration faces a large scale humanitarian problem that is a direct result of mr  trumps policy  but argue that a border wall is not the right solution and that mr  trump has failed to make the case that there is a true security crisis a local pastor sympathetic to the president emphasized during a round table discussion that the crisis was humanitarian in nature still  mr  trump said that he had a feel about things and could sense democrats moving toward his position i know you dont see it yet  but i have a feel about things  and i really believe the other side is starting to get it representative vicente gonzalez  a democrat whose district includes mcallen  was in washington while the president visited his hometown  but he closely monitored mr  trumps trip its all theatrics  mr  gonzalez said in an interview  before insisting that mr  trump was somehow trying to escape the government shutdown with a victory mr  gonzalez added  hes trying to land the plane  and i think he knows time is not on his side  so he came down to the border to try to make a final case .
how fitting is it that president trumps first oval office address  which he requested be televised live in prime time by every major network  was aimed at stirring up the american public about a crisis largely of his own making not that the border crisis is one of mr  trumps self serving political fictions  like the deep state or widespread voter fraud  it may have started out that way  but the situation has  with the presidents nurturing  become something far more tragic pursuing poorly thought out and even more poorly executed policies on the pretext of battling a nonexistent national security crisis  mr  trump has helped create a pressing humanitarian one  desperate migrant families being detained en masse at the border are overwhelming a system pushed beyond its limits by an administration that chose to ignore the implications of its actions  overcrowding  children falling gravely ill and  paradoxically  the haphazard release of throngs of detainees into border communities stretching from california to texas mr  trump is now invoking the urgency of the situation as a justification for pursuing more wasteful  hard line measures that most americans do not support  chiefly the ludicrous border wall over which he has shut down critical pieces of the government  the president and his enablers have been busily knitting together inaccurate data  misleading anecdotes  exaggerations and other alternative facts about the flow of criminals  drugs and terrorists across the southern border  he seems to hope he can paint a dystopian landscape of security threats and human suffering so dire that the american people will rally to his side and pressure congressional democrats to succumb to his demands for a towering wall  preferably concrete  but at this point  it seems  steel will suffice failing that  mr  trump has also been floating the possibility of stiff arming congress altogether  with his advisers increasingly anxious that republican lawmakers are poised to abandon them on the shutdown  the president has raised the threat of declaring a national emergency  which he thinks would allow him to command the pentagon to build his wall  such a move would prompt a swift and furious legal challenge  if not a full blown constitutional crisis  that could drag on indefinitely  it would  however  also give mr  trump a way to reach a wall free funding deal with congress without losing face  thus weaseling out of the shutdown box into which he has nailed himself the border wall began life as an applause line at mr  trumps rallies  and it has endured as the rare  perhaps even sole  policy objective that actually matters to him  the substance of true border security may not interest him much  but this symbol sure does  while mr  trump proved a wily campaigner and political street fighter  as president he has been painfully out of his element  two years in  he remains ill suited to the complicated  thankless  often grinding work of leading the nation  governance clearly bores him  as do policy details both foreign and domestic  he has proved a poor judge of talent  he prefers grandstanding to negotiating  and he continues to have trouble with the whole concept of checks and balances  while the republican base remains enamored of him  most of the electorate has grown weary of his outrages and antics which is why  with his wall on the line  mr  trump so desperately needs to convince the american people that they are facing an acute crisis  maybe even a bona fide emergency in times of trouble  an anxious public looks to its leaders  and the ability to telegraph strength  decisiveness and certitude assumes greater value than in periods of calm and prosperity  circle the wagons patriotism  maybe even a little jingoism  becomes more appealing  people long to feel protected with his demagogy  mr  trump managed to fuel a sense of insecurity and unease throughout his campaign  along with the idea that he alone could make america great again  in office  he has attempted to perpetuate that angst by proclaiming existential threats to the republic  be they migrant caravans storming the border  muslim terrorists flooding the airports or violent immigrants roaming the countryside  shutting down the government is only the most recent effort at getting what he wants by traumatizing the nation he has sworn to serve were mr  trump truly interested in securing the border  and easing the suffering his policies are making worse  there are immediate steps he could take  for starters  he could end this wretched shutdown so that the people responsible for protecting the border can get paid  immigration judges can return to processing asylum claims and  yes  the physical and virtual barriers already in place can be maintained and perhaps even improved beyond that  he would need to ease up on the my way or the highway swagger and sit down for a real discussion with lawmakers about how to address the deep dysfunction of this nations immigration system  none of which would be as sensational as grabbing some prime time airtime it would  however  be a sign that the president is at last getting serious about immigration concerns he has thus far done nothing but exacerbate .
as the government shutdown over president trumps demand for border wall funding moves through week three  the administration is looking to cut a deal with democrats by emphasizing the deepening humanitarian crisis at the border  a crisis caused in large part by this administrations inhumane policies  political grandstanding and managerial incompetence in a letter sunday to lawmakers  the white house laid out its latest proposal for addressing the border tumult  the administration called for more immigration and border patrol agents  more detention beds and  of course   5 7 billion to build 234 new miles of border wall  the white house also demanded an additional  800 million for urgent humanitarian needs  such as medical support  transportation and temporary facilities for processing and housing detainees translation  mr  trumps mass incarceration of migrant families is overwhelming an already burdened system that  without a giant injection of taxpayer dollars  will continue to collapse  leading to ever more human suffering the situation is an especially rich example of the trump doctrine  break something  then demand credit  and in this case a lot of money  for promising to fix it late last week  frustrated by his standoff with democrats  mr  trump even threatened to declare a national emergency in order to get his wall built without congresss approval  a move guaranteed to prompt a ferocious legal challenge any attempt to sell mr  trumps cruel immigration agenda with a veneer of humanitarian measures should be viewed with skepticism  this administration has long held that the best way to deal with asylum seekers fleeing the horrors of their home countries is to increase their suffering upon reaching the united states to discourage others from even trying  there is no question but that the administration remains ill equipped to cope with the fallout from its narrow fixation on deterrence  migrant children are being piled into holding cells where they fall ill  or worse  the number of detainees at immigration and customs enforcement facilities has swelled to unprecedented levels  requiring periodic mass releases  without preparation or planning  hundreds of migrants are simply dropped off at bus stations in border cities  the times found that  in the final week of december  some 600 migrants were unceremoniously released onto the streets of el paso mr  trumps spiteful choice to shut parts of the government is only making the situation messier  immigration judges are being furloughed  further slowing the processing of asylum requests  border patrol agents are working without pay  eroding morale  in perhaps the choicest twist of fate  some  300 million in new contracts for wall construction cannot be awarded until the shutdown ends  with democrats now controlling the house  the president is right to assume that he will need a new negotiating approach  but the answer isnt for lawmakers to throw good money after bad  or to try to prettify a retrograde agenda with humanitarian trimmings the trump administration is asking congress and the american public to embrace warped logic  that its policies are going to continue and that the only question is whether any money should be spent on measures to ease the suffering caused by those policies  after two years of watching this administration run amok  surely democratic lawmakers can come up with a better approach .
washington  stephen miller was furious  again the architect of president trumps immigration agenda  mr  miller was presiding last month over a meeting in the white house situation room when he demanded to know why the administration officials gathered there were taking so long to carry out his plans a regulation to deny welfare benefits to legal immigrants  a change mr  miller repeatedly predicted would be transformative  was still plodding through the approval process after more than two years  he complained  so were the new rules that would overturn court ordered protections for migrant children  they were still not finished  he added  berating ronald d  vitiello  the acting head of immigration and customs enforcement you ought to be working on this regulation all day every day  he shouted  as recounted by two participants at the meeting  it should be the first thought you have when you wake up  and it should be the last thought you have before you go to bed  and sometimes you shouldnt go to bed a few weeks after that meeting  the consequences of mr  millers frustration and the president he was channeling have played out in striking fashion mr  trump has withdrawn mr  vitiellos nomination to permanently lead ice and pushed out kirstjen nielsen  his homeland security secretary  the departments acting deputy secretary  claire grady  and the secret service director  randolph d  alles  are departing as well  and the white house has made it clear that others  including l  francis cissna  the head of united states citizenship and immigration services  and john mitnick  the departments general counsel  are likely to go soon mr  trump insisted in a tweet on saturday that he was not frustrated by the situation at the border  where for months he has said there is a crisis that threatens the nations security  but unable to deliver on his central promise of the 2016 campaign  he has targeted his administrations highest ranking immigration officials and behind that purge is mr  miller  the 33 year old white house senior adviser  while immigration is the issue that has dominated mr  trumps time in office  the president has little interest or understanding about how to turn his gut instincts into reality  so it is mr  miller  a fierce ideologue who was a congressional spokesman before joining the trump campaign  who has shaped policy  infuriated civil liberties groups and provoked a bitter struggle within the administration white house officials insisted to reporters last week that they had no choice but to move against administration officials unwilling or unable to make their agencies produce results  one senior administration official at the white house  who requested anonymity to discuss what he called a sensitive topic  said many of the administrations core priorities have been either moving too slowly or moving in the wrong direction but current and former officials from those agencies  who also requested anonymity to discuss contentious relations with the white house  describe a different reality the purge  they said  was the culmination of months of clashes with mr  miller and others around the president who have repeatedly demanded implementation of policies that were legally questionable  impractical  unethical or unreasonable  and when officials explained why  it further infuriated a white house set on making quick  sweeping changes to decades old laws in a twist  many of the officials who have clashed with the white house were the presidents own political appointees  who share his broad goal of limiting immigration into the united states  to that end  they have already succeeded in lowering the number of refugees allowed into the united states  imposing a travel ban on entry from mostly muslim nations  speeding up denaturalization proceedings  slowing asylum processing at ports of entry and developing proposals to limit work permits for spouses of high tech workers i dont think the presidents really cleaning house  said thomas d  homan  a former acting ice director and strong supporter of the presidents immigration agenda  i think hes setting the reset button a white house spokesman declined a request for comment  but even several of the most right wing  anti immigration groups have had a mixed reaction to the treatment of the immigration officials mr  trump and mr  miller have targeted the center for immigration studies tweeted that nielsen got tough at the end of her tenure  but it was largely too little  too late  the federation for american immigration reform wrote  under francis cissnas leadership  uscis has issued a steady stream of policy changes and regulations that are firmly in line with president trumps immigration agenda  removing him would be a huge mistake but it has not been enough for mr  miller and his allies in the white house feeling the constant pressure from mr  trump perhaps the greatest point of contention within the administration has been the asylum laws that are the root cause of the most vivid manifestation of the immigration issue  the hundreds of thousands of migrant families from central america who have surged toward the southwestern border  fleeing violence and poverty in a tuesday afternoon deputies conference call last year with about 50 or 60 officials from across government  mr  miller demanded to know why nearly all of the families seeking asylum were passing the first hurdle  a screening interview to determine whether they have a credible fear of persecution if they were returned to their home countries mr  miller and others in the white house were outraged that 90 percent or more of the applicants passed the first screening  a concern during the bush administration  as well  immigration judges ultimately deny all but about 20 percent of the asylum requests  but because of a backlog of hundreds of thousands of cases  many asylum seekers wait years for their case to be heard for the second time  giving them the chance to gain work permits  build roots and disappear in the united states to mr  miller  the asylum process was a giant loophole that needed to be plugged  and he faulted the asylum officers at citizenship and immigration services who were conducting the screenings for having a cultural bias that made them overly sympathetic to the asylum seekers  you need to tighten up  miller insisted immigration officials on the conference call did not disagree that too many migrants were granted asylum in the initial credible fear screening  but the rules for conducting the screenings were written into law by congress and designed to be generous so that persecuted people had a real opportunity to seek asylum  it was unclear  the officials said  what else the agency could do listening to mr  miller continue to hammer the issue  two people on the call recalled  it was almost as if mr  miller wanted asylum officers to ignore the law  at one point during the call  mr  cissna erupted in frustration enough  enough  stand down  he said but such pressure from the white house was hardly unique  according to officials from multiple agencies for instance  a federal judge last week ruled that the white house early in the administration had improperly pressured officials at citizenship and immigration services to terminate an immigration program for haiti called temporary protected status the judge said the decision in 2017 to end the program was contrary to the statute and indicated that the white house had strongly influenced the department more recently  white house officials pushed during one of the tuesday afternoon conference calls to have border patrol agents  instead of asylum officers  conduct credible fear interviews  the notion  they said  was that the border patrol agents could process interviews quickly and cut out the several day wait to schedule a meeting with an asylum officer many of the immigration officials recoiled at the idea  assigning agents to interview duty would pull them from their primary roles at the ports and along the border  even worse  asylum laws require interviewers to undergo up to two months of training that would strain the already understaffed border patrol stations but even if they could be trained  officials told the white house  the logistics would be a nightmare  cramped border patrol stations  many of which look like small  rural police stations  were not set up to conduct scores of two hour interviews with hundreds of migrants flooding into border communities each day when the idea leaked out in early april  immigrant rights advocates accused the trump administration of trying to prevent migrants from having a real chance at asylum border patrol officers are simply not qualified to do this  said eleanor acer  the director of the refugee program at human rights first  this will put unfit  untrained and unqualified agents in charge of determining who warrants potentially lifesaving protection in the united states to mr  miller and other white house officials  it was another instance in which the law and machinations of government were getting in the way of needed changes  and they think there are many others in november  as mr  trump railed publicly about the dangers of migrant caravans from central america  a top white house domestic policy adviser floated the idea of  taking migrants who had been apprehended to so called sanctuary cities represented by democrats  homeland security officials  who saw the idea as political retribution  resisted in an email  matthew albence  the acting deputy director of ice  said that it would create an unnecessary operational burden and that transporting the migrants to a different location was not a justified expenditure  lawyers at the department of homeland security  including mr  mitnick  also questioned the ideas legality the idea was dropped until last week  when news stories about the rejected proposal prompted mr  trump to say his administration was still considering the option mr  trump has also not given up on the idea of shutting down the southern border  a move economists have said would be catastrophic and halt nearly  1 7 billion of goods and services that flow across the border each day even as mr  trump retreated publicly and said he would give mexico a year to do more to prevent migrants from reaching the southern border of the united states  he has made it clear to his advisers privately that the closing was still on the table his insistence increased the friction with his top immigration officials  especially ms  nielsen  who tried to talk him out of closing the ports of entry and refusing to grant asylum  ms  nielsen explained why she could not do that  citing economic and legal issues  banning migrants from seeking asylum would be against the law when ms  nielsen did not give the president the answer he sought  he turned to kevin mcaleenan  the commissioner of customs and border protection  and asked him to stop migrants from entering the country  mr  trump told mr  mcaleenan that he would pardon him if he ran into any legal problems  according to officials familiar with the conversation  though he denied it in a tweet saturday night ms  nielsens refusal to shut down the southern border appeared to be the final straw for mr  trump  after forcing her resignation  he named mr  mcaleenan the acting secretary of the department but mr  miller remains unsatisfied  lately  he has made clear to immigration officials and others in the white house that he remains frustrated with the still pending regulation on welfare benefits for immigrants  after nearly two years of painstaking work and more than 200 000 public comments  the 447 page rule is on track to eventually be published and it is not clear that the political bloodletting is over  mr  cissna and mr  mitnick remain in bureaucratic limbo  having received neither their walking papers nor an explicit stay of execution  while mr  mcaleenan is now the acting secretary of homeland security  rumors persist that mr  trump may want someone else to be the permanent head of the department inside the immigration agencies  there is a persistent rumor that mr  trump may yet name an immigration czar to better coordinate  or  some believe  control  the sprawling immigration bureaucracy .
reynosa  mexico  as the human smugglers stalk the bus stations  migrant shelters and twisting streets of this mexican border town  they have no trouble collecting clients like julian escobar moreno the honduran migrant arrived in reynosa  mexico  intending to apply for asylum in the united states  but new policies north of the border have instead driven him into the hands of the citys smuggling cartels  whose business is booming i honestly dont want to cross illegally  but i dont really have a choice  said mr  moreno  37 the trump administration  which has partially shut down the federal government in a fight over funding for an enhanced border wall  has adopted a number of strategies over the last two years to deter migrants and persuade them to turn around  or not to come at all its latest effort is a policy that admits only a few asylum seekers a day  if that  at border crossings  as a result of this metering  migrants are now waiting on the mexican side of the border for weeks and months before they can submit their applications in reynosa and elsewhere  the delays caused by the policy are prompting many migrants to weigh the costs and dangers of a faster option  hiring a smuggler  at an increasingly costly rate  to sneak them into the united states in november  the number of migrant families apprehended attempting to cross the border skyrocketed to its highest levels on record  with some of those caught having turned to smugglers at some point in their trip what we have seen is that no one is getting across the border  said hector silva  the director of a center providing services to migrants that sits near the banks of the rio grande  which separates reynosa from mcallen  tex  this forces families  with all the desperation they feel  to go illegally the decision to endure a long wait or illegally expedite the journey to the united states is playing out not only in reynosa  where the crack of gunfire has become a soundtrack of the city  but across the long sweep of the united states mexico border  all the way to tijuana  where a crisis is unfolding as thousands of central americans wait their turn to cross the border a visit to a reynosa migrant shelter quickly makes it clear how many are considering the smuggling option im scared to go to the border crossing  because they will deport me  said maximo rene arana nunez  a guatemalan who arrived in reynosa a few days ago and is looking to cross  im stuck here until my family in the united states can save enough money to pay for a smuggler according to those recently deported  migrants who are attempting to cross and local officials  the price that smugglers can command is rising along with the demand for their services for those able to afford it  and willing to accept the risk  finding smugglers in reynosa is easy  the streets seethe with smuggling cartel agents  who openly pitch their services the dangers of an illegal crossing are not enough to dissuade migrants  they are fearful  but many feel they have no other recourse  for many  the calculation is predicated on a simple truth  what lies behind them is worse than what may lie ahead i dont have an option  i cant be there  mr  moreno said of his native honduras  our government is totally corrupt  and if the mexicans or americans deport me  im dead mr  moreno now works 12 hour shifts on the outskirts of the city  trying to save enough to pay for a smuggler for other migrants in the shelter  the equation was not necessarily of life or death  but of exchanging well known hardship for vaguer hope look  we know what the situation is in our country  said osman noe guilln  28  who reached reynosa with his partner shortly after their marriage  having treated the ride on the buses up from honduras as something of a honeymoon  we dont know what will happen when we cross mr  guilln gripped the hand of his wife  lilian marlene menndez  and allowed himself a smile  blind faith and economic need were enough for them  they did not know how grim and dangerous reynosa was before they arrived  only that it was the closest crossing from honduras and therefore the cheapest to reach yes  they had heard the angry rhetoric about migrants coming out of the united states  they said  and knew about the deportations and long waits at the border  but they didnt care desperation makes you do crazy things  mr  guilln said  i dont think anything would stop me  and certainly not a wall the couple  having priced out the next leg of the journey with local smugglers  said they had accepted the risks of continuing  the smugglers  or polleros  are known to kill or strand migrants who falter in their payments  and to extort those who have families that can mortgage homes or drum up more money in recent days  the couple was quoted a price of  7 000 apiece just to make it to the banks on the texas side of the river that appears to be on the higher end  many central americans recently have been quoted  5 500 to be ferried to reach the other side of the river  not long ago   4 000 was the going rate some of the migrants interviewed who were planning to try the smuggling route said they still intended to apply for asylum if and when they made it to the united states while the united states revised policy toward asylum seekers is primarily aimed at dissuading central american migrants from making the trip to the border  it is also affecting mexican policy and the lives of mexicans in border cities the mayor of reynosa  maki esther ortiz dominguez  noted that her city  in the state of tamaulipas  was already one of the most dangerous in mexico  she said she is worried the situation in reynosa could grow even worse  as migrants are either preyed upon by criminals or recruited to join their ranks this policy could at any moment detonate a new crime wave here  ms  ortiz dominguez said in the center of the bridge that connects reynosa with mcallen  the united states border patrol this summer constructed a new booth for prescreening people hoping to make it into american territory  at least two officers are on duty in the tiny structure  asking everyone who passes for their documentation more recently  mexican officials have begun acting as a first line of border defense  as people queue up to cross the bridge  mexican agents are now pulling central americans out of the line  demanding their paperwork and detaining them if they have not filled out the proper documentation some have languished for months waiting for family members to send money to pay the fee for the paperwork the new approach by mexican agents at the border was begun under pressure from the united states  said one mexican official in reynosa  requesting anonymity because this person was not authorized to discuss the decision publicly it was this new approach by the authorities in mexico that ensnared mr  moreno having been run out of honduras by the notorious 18th street gang for refusing to work for them  he believed he had a good case for political asylum in the united states and went to the bridge in reynosa so he could start the application process but moments after arriving with his pregnant wife and three children at the foot of the international bridge  he and his family were stopped by mexican officials and detained a few months ago  mr  morenos lack of proper paperwork would have been ignored by the mexican authorities  according to local officials and immigration lawyers  but mr  moreno was held in a cell for 20 days and his family was placed in a temporary shelter the lure of the smugglers in reynosa is not limited to central americans  mexicans  too  employ their services  although the cost is lower  the prices charged seem to depend on just how bad the situation is in a migrants home country on a recent day in a migration office in reynosa  a group of mexicans sat waiting to be processed after their deportations from the united states for the migration authorities  it is a job  said melvin gmez  18  who is from the mexican state of chiapas  for mexicans and central americans  immigration is a dream mr  gmez had just tried crossing for the fourth time the day before we have something to live for  he said  and that keeps us going .
washington  at first  he vowed to take the mantle for closing part of the federal government  then he blamed democrats  saying they now own the shutdown  by friday  president trump was back to owning it again  im very proud of doing what im doing  he declared two weeks into the showdown over a border wall  mr  trump is now crafting his own narrative of the confrontation that has come to consume his presidency  rather than a failure of negotiation  the shutdown has become a test of political virility  one in which he insists he is receiving surreptitious support from unlikely quarters not only are national security hawks cheering him on to defend a porous southern border  but so too are former presidents who he says have secretly confessed to him that they should have done what he is doing  not only do federal employees accept being furloughed or forced to work without wages  they have assured him that they would give up paychecks so that he can stand strong never mind how implausible such assertions might seem  the details do not matter to mr  trump as much as dominating the debate  after an oddly quiescent holiday season in which he complained via twitter about being left at home alone  poor me  he has taken the public stage this week clearly intent on framing the conflict on his own terms  president trump warned that he was considering declaring a national emergency to build the border wall  people close to the president described him as emboldened since members of congress returned to washington after the break  giving him not only a clear target to swing at but helping him focus on a fight that he is convinced is a political winner  one aide said mr  trump believes he has gained the upper hand in the public battle although surveys at first showed more americans blaming him for the shutdown than democrats  later polling showed the fault more evenly split  and the voters he cares most about  his core conservative supporters  are more enthusiastic than the public at large  he has told people that my people love the fight  and that he believes he is winning in the past three days  mr  trump has appeared in public three times to get his version of the story out while democrats celebrated their takeover of the house  at a lengthy cabinet meeting on wednesday  an appearance with border patrol union leaders on thursday and a news conference with republican congressional leaders in the rose garden on friday  he engaged in quintessentially trumpian stream of conscious discussions that ranged widely and unpredictably at one point  he argued that the soviet union was right to invade afghanistan in 1979 to stop terrorists  a revisionist version that provoked a strong reaction in kabul and earned a sharp rebuke from the often supportive editorial page of the wall street journal  which said  we cannot recall a more absurd misstatement of history by an american president at another point  mr  trump mocked india for doing no more in afghanistan than building a library  which generated headlines in new delhi about the jab at its prime minister  not to mention more head scratching because  according to indian news media  the country has not built a library in afghanistan in many years he repeatedly claimed that the new trade agreement he has negotiated with mexico and canada means that mexico really is paying for the wall  even though the pact has yet to be approved by congress and has no direct connection to border security  he has made misleading claims about how many terrorists might be coming across the border mr  trumps version of events differed even from the other people in the room at fridays meeting at the white house  when democratic congressional leaders emerged after two hours  they described a contentious session with no meaningful progress as the president threatened to keep the government closed for months or even years  when mr  trump emerged shortly afterward  he described a very  very productive meeting and predicted the standoff could be fixed very quickly two people briefed on the meeting said that white house officials viewed the conversation as the first civil discussion that had taken place between the two sides  and it left some of mr  trumps aides hopeful  indeed  mr  trump made a point of publicly saying nothing but relatively positive things about the democrats on friday optimistic that a deal really is within reach  the president said he would have vice president mike pence  kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  and jared kushner  his son in law and senior adviser  meet with democrats over the weekend but there were questions about his own side of the aisle  senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  unlike other congressional republican leaders  was not present for the rose garden news conference  hes running the senate  mr  trump explained  even though the senate had adjourned hours earlier and mr  mcconnells spokesman said the senator did not know about the news conference the president nonetheless was feeling energized by support he said he had received for the fight  including the very federal employees who are not being paid as a result of the partial shutdown a lot of people that you think are upset  and certainly theyre not thrilled  but they say  sir  do the right thing  we need border security  mr  trump said  and these are people that wont be getting paid as for his predecessors  he said  this should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me  and they all know it  some of them have told me that we should have done it by all public accounts  mr  trump had not spoken with his living predecessors since his inauguration until former president george bush died last month  mr  trump called mr  bushs son  former president george w  bush  to offer condolences  but the subject of the wall did not come up  according to mr  bushs office  a few days later  at the elder mr  bushs funeral  mr  trump encountered his predecessors for the first time since taking office  but he sat quietly without talking with them during the service the younger mr  bush built miles of wall and fencing along the mexico line while he was president  but said it could not cover the entire border and insisted that enforcement should be coupled with an overhaul of immigration law to permit many people in the country illegally to stay  former president barack obama has repeatedly criticized mr  trumps proposed wall  and former president jimmy carter has said technological improvements would be more effective at protecting the border the white house did not say afterward which presidents mr  trump was referring to  but a senior administration official said he was probably referring to public comments his predecessors have made about the need for border security  not necessarily for a wall specifically as he careened this week from subject to subject and assertion to assertion  an energized mr  trump seemed to be enjoying himself  he went on for more than an hour and a half on wednesday and another hour on friday should we keep this going or not  folks  he asked reporters at one point before noticing that it was a cold january day in the rose garden should we keep this going a little bit longer  he asked again  let me know when you get tired one thing mr  trump was not was tired .
 el chapo was found guilty on all 10 charges  read our latest story on his conviction  some of the drugs were hidden in passenger cars  concealed in trucks in cans of jalapeos or stashed in tanker trains with ordinary loads of cooking oil  others were sent beneath the border in sophisticated tunnels the 10 weeks of testimony at the trial of joaqun guzmn loera  the drug lord known as el chapo who was convicted on drug conspiracy charges on tuesday  revealed that his innovative smuggling network typically went through legal checkpoints  not isolated stretches of the border where a wall might be an obstacle president trumps plan to build a wall along the southwestern border was not mentioned at the trial  but it lurked in the background of mr  guzmns prosecution  a watershed moment in americas war on drugs the trial  in federal district court in brooklyn  was the first time that american federal prosecutors publicly revealed the inner workings of mr  guzmns sinaloa drug cartel  offering the most extensive details yet on the organizations structure  financing and distribution methods  in doing so  prosecutors relied on firsthand experts  a long list of mr  guzmns own former underlings and allies though mr  trump has primarily pitched his border wall as a way to stop illegal immigration  he has recently suggested that it would also help allay the cross border drug trade if we build a powerful and fully designed see through steel barrier on our southern border  the crime rate and drug problem in our country would be quickly and greatly reduced  he said on saturday  some say it could be cut in half he added  we can stop heroin but the guzmn trial indicated that stopping the flow of drugs into the united states might be more complicated than that  through the testimony of people who worked with mr  guzmn  prosecutors showed that his cartel for decades was endlessly creative  constantly inventing new methods to circumvent detection what youre hearing in this trial is what front line border workers observe throughout  said doris meissner  who served as the commissioner of the immigration and naturalization service from 1993 to 2000 and now works at the migration policy institute  a nonpartisan think tank ms  meissner added  the idea that people are walking drugs across the border as though they are illegal immigrants who would then be stopped by a wall across the border  that is not the pattern but some supporters of the wall have noted that a physical obstacle along the border is needed as a safeguard to ensure the frontier is sealed as much as possible its about checking all the boxes  sea  land  air  port of entry and the space between the port of entries  said james carafano  vice president for foreign policy and national security at the heritage foundation  a conservative leaning think tank  otherwise youre not implementing an effective border strategy  an effective strategy means that you create the most barriers possible  you dont just close off one so they have 99 others one thing revealed at mr  guzmns trial was that among his earliest  and favorite  smuggling methods was sneaking drugs across the border in normal looking passenger cars with secret compartments hidden in their chassis  witnesses described how he often split loads among several vehicles to help ensure that at least some of them made the journey undetected but mr  guzmn also used more dramatic and unusual tactics to transport drugs at one point  testimony at the trial showed  mr  guzmn sent tons of cocaine across the border in cans of jalapeos marked with the label la comadre chiles  the cans were stacked on pallets in the backs of commercial tractor trailers  which simply drove through official border entry points  to protect his product from being found  witnesses said  mr  guzmn often placed the cans filled with cocaine in the middle of the pallets  surrounded by cans with actual chiles proponents of the wall have said such a structure could help improve inspections at the border one of the big problems is we have too many people standing on guard between and at points of entry and not enough people doing inspections  analysis and intelligence  so the wall will certainly channel the flow into areas you can manage  analyze and search more thoroughly  said john p  walters  the former director for drug control policy for president george w  bush and the chief operating officer for the hudson institute  a conservative think tank  the wall itself does not stop all flow  but the wall becomes a way to stop all flow he added  im not saying a wall will do everything  but what im saying is  how do you try to stop it without a wall but mr  guzmns methods went beyond regular border crossings  one witness at the trial  tirso martnez sanchez  told jurors in december that he personally helped persuade mr  guzmn to use commercial tanker trains that traveled on cross border rail lines according to mr  martnez  cartel operatives first created front companies that appeared to be selling legal items like cooking oil  after shipping a few real loads of oil from mexico to various american cities to make it seem as if the company was legitimate  mr  guzmns workers then packed cocaine into secret compartments in the tankers and sent them over the border in the united states  other operatives received the trains at a network of secret warehouses  which  mr  martnez said  were located mostly on rail spurs so that the trains could be driven directly into them from major cargo rail lines sea routes were another  if a bit less frequent  means of moving drugs into the united states  this month  for instance  witnesses testified that mr  guzmn once sent a load of marijuana by boat from mexico north on the pacific ocean to the coast near san diego  the drugs were meant to be unloaded offshore by smaller boats  the shipment never reached san diego  and three of mr  guzmns workers were arrested the kingpin also sent bulk shipments of cash through normal border checkpoints in the opposite direction  from the united states to mexico  as early as 1989  in fact  one of mr  guzmns brothers  arturo guzmn loera  was briefly detained at the douglas  ariz   port of entry after border agents there found more than  1 million packed into the tailgate and side panels of his black ford bronco mr  carafano said he understood that drug smugglers would always try to find new methods  and that the wall would simply be part of the mix he added  it is part of the tool  but you have to do all three simultaneously  at the port of entry  on the border and you have to do it at sea  so youre creating just a series of bad options for the smugglers but then theres the matter of el chapos most famous smuggling method  tunnels early in the trial  jesus zambada garca  one of mr  guzmns top logistics chiefs  told jurors how workers had dug a tunnel in the early 1990s under an innocuous looking ranch house in agua prieta  mexico  that reached a warehouse in douglas the entrance on the mexican side  mr  zambada said  was hidden under a pool table that could be raised off the ground by hydraulic lifts  the lifts

president trump seems to think that his hard line immigration stance is a political winner  saying hes willing to keep much of the government shut down in order to get funding for his border wall  polls suggest voters dont see this mr  trumps way  and blame him  not the democrats  for the impasse  with democrats taking control of the house of representatives on thursday  he now has the excuse he needs to make a deal but if he doesnt compromise  if he instead continues to try to transform his once proudly pro growth party into the anti immigration party  he will threaten republican prospects for a generation  novembers midterm elections provided a clear indication that mr  trumps strident positions on immigration were not widely popular  ignoring the pleas of top republicans  the president made the elections a referendum on the issue  vowing to end birthright citizenship  sending the military to deal with a caravan of asylum seekers and championing fringe legislation to cut legal immigration in half  house republicans paid dearly for mr  trumps gambit  they lost 40 seats  mostly in suburban districts  many of which were longtime republican bastions whose younger  moderate  college educated and female voters turned out for democrats  in increasingly asian american orange county  calif   which voted for hillary clinton in 2016  the first time it had gone democratic since franklin roosevelt was president  republicans lost four house seats  they also lost suburban races in traditionally republican areas outside of dallas  des moines  houston  miami  philadelphia  richmond  va   and even salt lake city  those results suggest mr  trump may be doing to the national republican party what pete wilson did to the party in california in the 1990s  hard as it is to believe today  california once reliably voted republican in presidential elections  other than lyndon johnson  no democratic presidential candidate won the golden state in the four decades between harry truman and bill clinton  now  democrats control the entire state government and hold 46 of its 53 house seats and both senate seats what happened  mr  wilson  then governor  went after immigrants  championing proposition 187  a 1994 ballot initiative that barred illegal immigrant children from attending public schools and using other social services  though the measure passed after a contentious fight  it was a hollow victory  an injunction was granted three days after passage  and the measure was ultimately deemed unconstitutional  several studies have found that republican support of proposition 187 and other anti immigrant efforts alienated white and latino voters in california from the republican party  one of these studies  published in the american journal of political science  points out that proposition 187 actually reversed the trend of latinos increasingly supporting republicans  with no counterbalancing gain in party supporters from other groups  particularly non hispanic whites  the authors conclude that the results raise serious questions about the long term efficacy of racially divisive strategies for electoral gain  this study should be required reading for trump republicans  the hispanic portion of the united states population today is similar to the portion in california in the early 1990s  about 20 percent of the country is hispanic  in 1990  26 percent of californias population was  you dont have to be a political wizard to understand that alienating growing blocs of voters  not just latinos  but also other immigrants and younger people  is bad political strategy if national republicans want to avoid the fate of their 1990s california brethren  they must reject mr  trumps approach and make a republican case for immigration  prominent republicans who have criticized mr  trumps divisiveness  such as utahs incoming senator  mitt romney  should pick up this mantle my organization  the becoming american initiative  seeks to persuade conservatives that expanding immigration will benefit the country  members of our board  including william kristol  linda chavez and mona charen  have worked in the administrations of ronald reagan and george w  bush  they have seen firsthand how those presidents support for more open immigration systems was not just good for america  but also helped neutralize immigration as a political issue mr  reagan and mr  bush both called for more work visas  a policy that would allow foreigners to pursue the american dream while contributing to the economy  similar  immigration proposals  which would help ensure that mr  reagans shining city on a hill isnt surrounded by a wall  would appeal to the more than one quarter of the population who are either first  or second generation immigrants republicans should make common cause with immigrants on shared values like work ethic  family and faith rather than writing them off  judging by mr  trumps shutdown rhetoric  theyve got their work cut out for them  .

donald trumps dogged  captain ahab like obsession with immigrants and asylum seekers crossing the southern border is many things it is an open appeal to white nationalist xenophobia among the many members of his overwhelmingly white base  check it is a frustration that his oft promised new wall has yet to a single mile built  check it is a natural outgrowth of an intrinsic hostility to people who are hispanics  check but i believe that it is also something more sophisticated and tactical than that  it is a play to the other  smaller part of his base  the black and hispanic people who voted for him in 2016 because trumps path to victory was so impossibly narrow during the last election  and because he has done absolutely nothing to expand his base  he will need to hold on to all of the base he had it is worth remembering that in 2016  after years of the racist birtherism attack against president barack obama  after calling mexicans rapists and murderers and after promising over and over to build the wall  trump still won 28 percent of the hispanic vote  27 percent of the asian vote and 8 percent of the black vote  according to exit polls  it is important to note that in the cases where data is available  more minority men voted for trump than women  among black men  13 percent voted for trump compared with only 4 percent among black women  and among hispanic men  32 percent voted for trump compared with only 25 percent among hispanic women  trump wants to hold these numbers if not inch up a percent or two he has multiple strategies to do that among black people  especially black men  one was to have the spectacle of a black man  kanye west  in the oval office extolling trump as a father figure who makes him feel like superman because he didnt have a lot of male energy in my home another is to constantly remind black people  and the rest of america  that black unemployment is at a record low  a decline that began under obama  it must always be noted  indeed  as an associated press fact check pointed out  the most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under president barack obama  when it fell from a recession high of 16 8 percent in march 2010 to 7 8 percent in january 2017 but trump still touted in february  african american  hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded   as point of fact  black unemployment hit its low during trumps tenure but has ticked back up  additionally  trump signed the historic criminal justice first step act  which was a set of prison and sentencing reforms  i personally dont think trump cares much about criminal justice  particularly considering the way he has demeaned black lives matter  demonized colin kaepernick and encouraged police brutality of crime suspects  but this was his son in laws pet issue and trump loves nothing more than to say that he did something for minority communities that obama didnt there  you can see what the tent poles of trumps re election pitch will be to black voters  but he is also adding to that list his anti immigrant stance  suggesting to black voters that the competition for low wage jobs is a hunger games type blood sport  that when immigrants arrive they diminish black peoples economic prospects as trump said in january in an oval office address after shutting the government down because congress wouldnt fund the construction of his wall  all americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration  it strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages  among those hardest hit are african americans and hispanic americans that is a pitch to both blacks and hispanics already in this country  there is a real cleavage between second   third  and fourth generation hispanics and new arrivals my brother marvin used to work as an accountant in the federal prison system  the institutions would regularly house groups separately  to avoid possible conflict  two of those groups were mexicans who had been in america for a while and mexicans who were new arrivals  as my brother put it  a common refrain among the more established group was  theyll help you move a refrigerator for  5 as he understood it  it was all about the new arrivals causing embarrassment and downward pressure on wages  this friction rings true to me and has existed among other groups of immigrants during the first wave of the great migration of black people from the south to the north and west  some northern black people were also afraid that the newcomers would upset the delicate balance that they thought they had achieved with white people as kelly miller  the dean of the college of arts and sciences at the historically black howard university  wrote in a letter to the new york times in 1916 should the influx of negro laborers to the north  without proper restriction and control  be allowed to prejudice public opinion and thus reproduce southern proscription in the northern states  the last state of the race would be worse than the first add to this friction that although americans often think of hispanics as monolithic  they are anything but  hispanics in america come from multiple countries and territories  some born abroad  others born here  many of the asylum seekers at the border are from central america  how mexicans in california  cubans in florida or puerto ricans in new york feel about the influx may differ furthermore  we like to think of hispanics as non white  but hispanic is an ethnicity  and hispanics can identify as any color  many hispanics identify as white  they do so here and they do so in the home countries and territories  for instance  puerto rico is 99 percent hispanic and nearly seven out of 10 people on the island identify as white also  the longer hispanics are in the united states  the less they identify as hispanic  a 2017 pew study found that while 97 percent of foreign born hispanics in america identify as hispanic  only 50 percent of fourth generation or higher hispanics do i believe that trumps team  if not him  understands the fissures in this immigration debate and is using them a quinnipiac university poll last year found that 54 percent of blacks and 55 percent of hispanics thought immigrants illegal crossing of the border with mexico was an important problem   additionally  31 percent of blacks and 40 percent of hispanics believed in using the national guard to patrol the border with mexico  and 13 percent of blacks and 25 percent of hispanics supported the building of trumps wall a poll taken at the end of last month by quinnipiac found that 10 percent of black voters and 29 percent of hispanic voters said that they would definitely vote  or consider voting  for trump in 2020  thats in line with 2016 and it would be a mistake to simply write off 2016 because minorities  particularly young black voters  were unhappy about hillary clintons participation in championing the 1994 crime bill and because she used the phrase super predator the front runner among likely democratic candidates is joe biden  a man who co wrote the crime bill and was still bragging about it when he was obamas vice presidential pick  since then he has expressed regret the front runner among the declared candidates is bernie sanders  whose appeal among black voters last cycle was worrisomely weak and who shows some signs of having retained that weakness as the washington post reported  sanders held a rally in the gym of a century old black church in north charleston  s c   last month  the room was packed  but  of the more than 1 600 people who came to see the candidate  fewer than 40 were black democrats must attack the issue of black and hispanic voters head on and not as an afterthought  they cant go into 2020 thinking that the surge in voter turnout in the midterms is a ward against trump holding the numbers of blacks and hispanics he held in 2016  during the midterms  9 percent of blacks and 29 percent of hispanics voted for republicans  in line with trumps 2016 results white supremacy will use any tool at its disposal to survive frederick douglass wrote in my bondage and my freedom that slave owners would often grant the enslaved relief from work during the christmas holidays  but they would also encourage drunkenness and lasciviousness  and frown upon any slave who tried to put the time to productive use  this was psychological warfare as douglass put it  all the license allowed  appears to have no other object than to disgust the slaves with their temporary freedom  and to make them as glad to return to their work  as they were to leave it if white supremacy will use celebration to disgust  it will most definitely use desperation to divide .
president trump has adopted a blunt new message in recent days for migrants seeking refuge in the united states  our country is full to the degree the president is addressing something broader than the recent strains on the asylum seeking process  the line suggests the nation cant accommodate higher immigration levels because it is already bursting at the seams  but it runs counter to the consensus among demographers and economists they see ample evidence of a country that is not remotely full  but one where an aging population and declining birthrates among the native born population are creating underpopulated cities and towns  vacant housing and troubled public finances local officials in many of those places view a shrinking population and work force as an existential problem with few obvious solutions i believe our biggest threat is our declining labor force  said gov  phil scott of vermont  a republican  in his annual budget address this year  its the root of every problem we face this makes it incredibly difficult for businesses to recruit new employees and expand  harder for communities to grow and leaves fewer of us to cover the cost of state government  or if you look at a city like detroit  many of the citys problems would become less difficult if its population would start growing  said edward glaeser  a harvard economist  all sorts of things like the hangover pension liability become much more solvable if youre actually looking at new people coming in this consensus is visible in official government projections  the congressional budget office foresees the american labor force rising by only 0 5 percent a year over the coming decade  about one third as fast as from 1950 to 2007  that is a crucial reason that economic growth is forecast to remain well below its late 20th century levels and that  in turn  is reflected in the national fiscal outlook  there are now 2 8 workers for every recipient of social security benefits  a rate on track to fall to 2 2 by 2035  according to the programs trustees  many state pension plans face even greater demography induced strains in smaller cities and rural areas  demographic decline is a fundamental fact of life  a recent study by the economic innovation group found that 80 percent of american counties  with a combined population of 149 million  saw a decline in their number of prime working age adults from 2007 to 2017 population growth in the united states has now hit its lowest level since 1937  partly because of a record low fertility rate  the number of children born per woman  the united states increasingly has population growth rates similar to slow growing japan and western europe  with immigration partly offsetting that shift  the trump administration has portrayed the surge of asylum seekers at the southern border as a crisis  and applied aggressive tactics to deport undocumented immigrants already in the united states  but it has also announced plans to issue up to 30 000 additional h 2b visas for temporary workers that immigrants keep showing up here is a testament to our freedom and the economic opportunity here  said matthew kahn  an economist at the university of southern california  if immigrants werent trying to come  if they believed the united states to be full  that would be a problem  mr  kahn said a particular fear  said john lettieri  president of the economic innovation group  is that declining population  falling home prices and weak public finances will create a vicious cycle that the places losing population could find hard to escape he proposes a program of heartland visas  in which skilled immigrants could obtain work visas to the united states on the condition they live in one of the counties facing demographic decline  with troubled counties themselves deciding whether to participate although some of the areas with declining demographics are hostile to immigration  others  cities as varied as baltimore  indianapolis and fargo  n d   have embraced the strategy of encouraging it one of the key solutions is to welcome immigrants into these communities  said brooks rainwater  director of the national league of cities center for city solutions many parts of the country that are growing in population and that are more economically dynamic have depended on the arrival of immigrants for that success sun belt metros like dallas and phoenix have been built on the logic of rapid expansion  of quickly built homes  of poached employers  of new highways paved to ever newer subdivisions  their economic development strategy is growth  their chief input is people  the more  the better growth cities need immigrants to continue their growth  said joel kotkin  executive director of the houston based center for opportunity urbanism  which promotes policies to help cities grow  the older historically declining cities need immigrants to reinvigorate their economies  and the expensive cities need them because  frankly  white people  african americans and middle class people are leaving for more affordable areas as many industrial cities have lost population since the mid 20th century  americans have built whole new metropolises on land that was virtually empty then  the las vegas metropolitan area  with more than two million people today  had barely 50 000 in 1950  still  only about 3 percent of the countrys land is urbanized americas metropolitan areas remain among the least dense in the world  said sonia hirt  a professor of landscape architecture and planning at the university of georgia  nationwide  the united states has less than one third of the population density of the european union  and a quarter of the density of china factually speaking  the country is not actually full  thats impossible  ms  hirt said  the real question is  if you continue on the current path of immigration  does this bring more benefits than it brings costs economists  too  argue that countries  or even cities  cant really fill up  rather  communities choose not to make the political choices necessary to accommodate more people  at the local level  that means neighbors may be unwilling to allow taller buildings or to invest in more schools or improved infrastructure  at the national level  it means that politicians may be unwilling to take up immigration reform  or to address workers who fear unemployment  the presidents comments echo such local fights  were full has often been a motto for people to keep out poorer renters  minority households or apartment buildings  among both conservatives and liberals  the claim can be a way of disguising exclusion as practicality  its not that were unwelcoming  its just that were full when it comes to the economy  at least  the country looks more like one that is too empty than too full  .
mr  trump is repeating his widely debunked claim made in his state of the union address that el paso transformed from one of the most dangerous cities into one of the safest cities in the united states after the construction of barriers at the border el paso was never one of the most dangerous cities in the country  it has had a consistently lower crime rate than the average among more than 20 similarly sized cities  according to data from the federal bureau of investigation  in that group  el paso reported the second lowest violent crime rate in 2008  before the construction of border fencing  and after the barrier was completed  it held the rank while the violent crime rate did not change considerably the inaccurate claim has also drawn the rebuke of democratic and republican local politicians alike  including beto orourke  the former democratic congressman from el paso  and the republican mayor of the city i dont care if the mayor is a democrat or a republican  they are full of crap when they say the border barrier didnt help lower the crime rate  mr  trump said  again adding falsely  it didnt stay the same  it went way down before mr  trump took the stage  lawmakers in washington reached a tentative deal on border security that included funding for physical barriers at the border and the reduction of detention space for migrants democrats had sought to limit the number of detention beds under the control of immigration and customs enforcement  arguing that limiting the beds would force the agency to prioritize migrants with serious criminal records  matt albence  the deputy director of ice  said a reduction in the number of beds would mean the release of criminals whether or not ice would be forced to released hardened criminals is a prediction that cannot be fact checked  but available data suggests that most immigrants in detention have not committed serious crimes  records obtained by the transactional records access clearinghouse at syracuse university show that in june 2018  for example  ice held more than 44 000 migrants in detention facilities across the country  of these migrants  58 percent had no criminal conviction and 21 percent had committed minor offenses such as traffic violations or illegal entry while 18 percent had been convicted of serious crimes ice has disputed that breakdown but used a broader measure for its figures  the agency said 54 percent of detained immigrants had criminal records or faced pending charges  though it did not specify what crimes they were accused of committing mr  trump overestimated his crowd size and severely understated the number of people who attended a dueling rally held monday night by beto orourke  the former democratic congressman a spokesman with the fire department told the el paso times that the arena mr  trump spoke at was filled to capacity at 6 500 people  thousands more watched the rally outside  with a possible total attendance of 10 000  the spokesman said  noting that the department did not officially estimate the crowd outside estimates for mr  orourkes crowd have been far higher than 200 or 300  ranging from 7 000 to 15 000  several democrats have introduced proposals to increase taxes  but unless the 6 500 people in the room were all among the wealthiest americans  they would not be affected by these proposed tax hikes representative alexandria ocasio cortez of new york  suggested a top marginal tax rate of 60 or 70 percent incomes over  10 million  senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts  who is running for president  has proposed a wealth tax of 2 percent on people with a net worth above  50 million and 3 percent over  1 billion  and senator bernie sanders of vermont proposed an a top estate tax rate of 77 percent on inheritances over  1 billion for context  households in the top 5 percent earned an average income of  385 289 in 2017  according to the census bureau mr  trump was referring to the green new deal  a proposal to combat climate change released by ms  ocasio cortez and senator edward j  markey of massachusetts in its current form  the plan is a broad outline  introduced as a nonbinding congressional resolution  and proposes projects like expanding renewable power sources  upgrading energy grids and buildings  working with farmers and ranchers to reform the agricultural sector  and investing in clean transportation and high speed rail  the legislation emphasizes that it intends to meet these goals as much as is technologically feasible though the green new deal would significantly alter the transportation and agriculture sectors  it does not call for the elimination of cars  airplanes or cows outside the text of the legislation  however  a blog post on ms  ocasio cortezs website describing the plan did note  the green new deal sets a goal to get to net zero  rather than zero emissions  at the end of this 10 year plan because we arent sure that we will be able to fully get rid of  for example  emissions from cows or air travel before then her staff has since said retracted the post and said that it was incomplete and published by accident when president barack obama encouraged lawmakers to pass the affordable care act during his first term  he repeatedly promised that consumers would be able to keep their doctor or health care plan under the new insurance system contrary to mr  trumps suggestions  fact checkers and news outlets have called out mr  obama for failing to fulfill that pledge  the washington post noted in 2009 that the claim would not necessarily be true  factcheck org wrote in 2009 that the promise would not apply to everyone  politifact awarded mr  obama its lie of the year  its annual selection of the most egregious falsehood  in 2013  and the new york times called it a broken promise in a 2013 article on the front page in addition  mr  trump repeated at least eight other claims the new york times has previously checked curious about the accuracy of a claim  email factcheck nytimes com .
in barack obamas second term  with his legislative agenda dead in a republican controlled congress  the president turned to executive unilateralism on an innovative scale  on climate regulation and health care he used the presidential pen to pursue policies denied him by congress  and on immigration he made a more dramatic leap  claiming a power he himself had previously abjured  and offering a provisional legal status to about half the illegal immigrant population at the time i called this caesarism  an attempt to arrogate to the imperial presidency the kind of power over domestic policy that it already claims over foreign and military affairs  and because the decay of republics is an iterative process  where each faction builds on the norm breaking of its rivals  it was fairly obvious  well  to me  if not to his supporters  that obamas caesarism helped stoke the caudillo appeal of donald trump  who promised a cruder version of the same impatient executive ambition now  that caudillo spirit is taking legal form in trumps most serious power grab to date  the attempt to use a national emergency declaration  a power whose chronic abuse by presidents congress has never bestirred itself to check  to build the border fencing that the democratic party and his own political impotence have denied him  listen to the argument podcast every thursday morning  with ross douthat  michelle goldberg and david leonhardt  on the merits  anyone who opposed obamas moves should oppose this one as well  the scale of the policy change is smaller  but the defiance of congress is more overt  the legal foundation might be slightly firmer  as jell o is slightly firmer than a pudding  but the bad faith involved in the emergency claim is more extreme and in general  serious conservatives are opposing trump  vox co founder matthew yglesias recently snarked about right wing pundits who got overheated about caesarism and caudillos in the obama era  mentioning me and national review editor rich lowry as examples  but lowry has written sharply against the emergency declaration  and ill happily endorse his point  if obama was abusing his powers  then clearly so is trump but in terms of the general lure of presidential rule  the general declension of republican norms into imperial habits  i also think trumps caudillo act is substantially less dangerous than what his predecessors did here i differ not only from liberals who misremember obama as a punctilious norm respecter  but also from those conservatives fretting that trump is establishing a precedent for a future liberal president to impose a green new deal by fiat  not that they wont be so tempted  but i just cant imagine anyone looking at the political train wreck of trumps unilateralism and seeing a precedent worth invoking for presidential power to meaningfully expand  it is not enough for a president to simply make a power grab  that grab needs to unite his party  ideally it would also divide the opposition   it needs to be cloaked in enough piety and deniability to find support from would be referees  it needs to appear to be politically successful  and finally it needs to be ratified by the other branches of government  if only by their inaction this mostly happened with the post 9 11 war powers claimed by george w  bushs administration  there was pushback and resistance  but many democrats went along  bush won re election  and much of his war on terror architecture was adopted and expanded by the obama administration obamas attempt to play caesar in domestic policy had more mixed results  since the immigration power grab was tied up by the courts until trumps election rendered some of it a dead letter  but obama at least persuaded democrats and the media to go along with his caesarism  and he established precedents that a president hillary clinton would have undoubtedly embraced with trump  though  the only clear precedent being set is one of deplorable incompetence  hes taking unpopular action that divides his party and unites the opposition  hes doing so with a combination of brazen hypocrisy and nonsense rhetoric that makes the power grab impossible to cloak  hes guaranteeing himself an extended legal battle  and he isnt even accomplishing any obvious goal  theres a reason real immigration restrictionists are against this plan  except the personal one of saving a tiny bit of face this spectacle will not prevent some future president from abusing an emergency declaration more effectively  but the idea that trumps grab enables future abuses more than the moves that bush and obama made is extremely dubious  if anything  precisely because his contempt for constitutional limits is so naked and his incompetence so stark  trump has  modestly  modestly  weakened the imperial presidency by generating somewhat more pushback than his predecessors so the emergency declaration is not itself a constitutional emergency  rather  as often in the trump presidency  its a moment that illuminates how a more dangerous would be autocrat might someday act  its a weird foretaste  not the main event  a warning  not a crisis  a clownish interlude in the republics decline  not the rubicon itself .
washington  the  333 billion spending package congress passed on thursday will probably keep the government fully funded through the end of september  but it also delivers the most stinging rebuke of president trumps vision for a wall along the southwestern border and for overhauling domestic programs here is a look at what is in the package of seven spending bills  which fund nine federal departments and multiple agencies instead of satisfying mr  trumps demand for  5 7 billion to fund more than 200 miles of steel or concrete wall  negotiators settled on a significantly more moderate agreement   1 375 billion for 55 miles of steel post fencing  the president rejected a practically identical offer in december  prompting a record 35 day shutdown the agreement  tucked into a  49 billion bill funding the department of homeland security  includes restrictions on where fencing can be built in the rio grande valley and what can be used to build it  only existing technologies are allowed  effectively prohibiting a concrete structure or any new prototypes that administration officials might try to put into place  communities and towns along the border will also be able to weigh in on the location and design of the fencing one sticking point in the negotiations was beds in detention centers  which effectively dictate how many unauthorized immigrants immigration and customs enforcement can hold democrats say that by funding a daily average of 45 274 beds for detainees  officers will be forced to reduce the number of migrants in detention from about 49 000 to 40 000 by the end of the fiscal year  but with up to  750 million that can be shifted to detention centers and latitude for federal agencies in how money is used  republicans say the number of beds could increase to as many as 58 500 the bill provides for oversight of ice  and places numerous limits on the agency  outlining protections for pregnant detainees  requirements for publicizing data about who is in custody and prohibitions on destroying records more than  560 million will go toward drug inspection at ports of entry  and money has been set aside for 600 more customs and border protection officers  to address a backlog in the courts  the executive office for immigration review will receive  563 4 million  an increase of  59 million  for about 75 additional immigration judge teams the agreement also includes  415 million for humanitarian relief  medical care  transportation and food for migrants  along the southwestern border several federal agencies covered by the homeland security bill  the coast guard  the secret service and the transportation security administration among them  will receive funding increases and money for new equipment despite concerns that science agencies would take a hit under the trump administration  congress has continued to increase their funding  if incrementally the proposal provides  985 million to the national institute of standards and technology and  21 5 billion to nasa  including for activities related to moon exploration additional allocations include  77 million for addressing the opioid epidemic and billions of dollars to combat h i v   aids and other infectious diseases  including malaria and ebola while the president has made no secret of his isolationist views on foreign policy  the spending package adds hundreds of millions of dollars for international disaster assistance and foreign aid that includes nearly an additional  1 billion toward peacekeeping activities  an additional  96 million to support united nations missions  including in afghanistan  iraq and libya  and an additional  1 4 billion to respond to refugee crises overseas global nutrition programs will receive enough money to exceed the presidents budget request by  1 2 billion the agreement also rejected mr  trumps proposal to eliminate foundations including the asia foundation  the united states african development foundation  the inter american foundation and the united states trade and development agency after federal workers endured a 35 day shutdown  lawmakers were anxious to provide some relief to the some 800 000 people furloughed or forced to work without pay  though during the shutdown mr  trump issued an executive order freezing pay for federal civilian workers in 2019  fulfilling a pledge he made over the summer  congress agreed to secure an increase of nearly 2 percent for federal civilian employees the spending package also allocates  1 billion toward the 2020 census  and requires that the census bureau expand its efforts to reach hard to count communities  and it provides over  4 5 billion for initiatives like the community development block grant and the home program  which help build housing for low income individuals by wednesday night  negotiators decided to keep several issues out of the final spending package to ensure as much broad support as possible although the federal emergency management agency will receive more than  12 billion for disaster relief  lawmakers decided against including supplemental disaster relief for areas affected last year by storms  fires and other natural disasters other matters that remain unresolved include back pay for federal contractors who were caught in the middle of the shutdown and an extension of the violence against women act  which expires friday  although grants under the act are funded in the spending bill negotiators also plan to introduce legislation that would address mr  trumps efforts to curb immigration  it would do so by restoring the crucial protections under the temporary protected status program and offering additional protections to the roughly 700 000 young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children  known as dreamers .
washington  as congressional leaders urged their colleagues to support a bipartisan border deal  president trump said on wednesday that he did not want to see the government shut down at midnight friday  indicating that he was leaning toward signing the compromise legislation i dont want to see a shutdown  a shutdown would be a terrible thing  mr  trump said  later hinting that he had options that most people dont understand to build his border wall without congressional approval the remarks  which were made to reporters in the oval office as mr  trump met with the president of colombia  inched him toward embracing a bipartisan border deal that fell far short of his demands for wall funding  but without a shutdown as leverage  he appeared to have little choice but to sign it if it clears congress on capitol hill  17 negotiators rushed to turn the border compromise into voluminous legislation  while both speaker nancy pelosi  democrat of california  and senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  encouraged their troops to support it  the 1 159 page bill and a full report from negotiators were filed wednesday minutes before midnight  the senate is expected to vote on the measure on thursday  followed by the house both leaders acknowledged that the legislation would not satisfy every member  the border security agreement deprives mr  trump and his republican base of a victory on the wall  but it gives more money for border fencing and immigration detention than the left wing of the democratic party wanted at least one of the negotiators did not sign off on the spending package  representative tom graves  republican of georgia  who said on twitter that he felt that he did not have enough time to review the details  he did not rule out voting for it but with the effect of the last government shutdown  the longest in the nations history  still fresh  few were in the mood to risk another funding lapse as with all compromises  i say to people  support the bill for what is in it  ms  pelosi told reporters on wednesday  dont judge it for what is not in it  we have other days to pass other legislation speaking on the senate floor  mr  mcconnell said the outcome reflected the way it goes in divided government and warned against letting unrelated cynical partisan plays get in the way of finishing this important process the compromise measure  assembled by senior members of both parties on monday night  includes just  1 375 billion for new fencing along the border with mexico  far short of the  5 7 billion mr  trump sought for a steel or concrete wall  and less than was included in the deal he rejected in december  which prompted the shutdown but mr  trump got cover from a few allies in the conservative news media and the senate  with some lawmakers making a point of selling the benefits of the agreement to the president senator richard c  shelby  republican of alabama  the chairman of the senate appropriations committee and one of the senior members who helped put together the compromise measure  said on twitter that he spoke to mr  trump after signing off on the agreement he was in good spirits  mr  shelby tweeted  its a down payment on his border wall  this is only the beginning of a multi year effort white house officials are still looking at how to allocate additional money for the presidents signature campaign promise  and have considered pulling from army corps of engineers projects in california and puerto rico  but officials cautioned that nothing had been settled on as of late wednesday afternoon  lawmakers and aides were working to resolve lingering issues in the spending package  which includes funding for the department of homeland security and six unfinished spending bills representative henry cuellar  democrat of texas and one of the negotiators  said there were late discussions about where new fencing could be built in the rio grande valley  to address local and environmental concerns  something white house officials pushed back against  ultimately  the new barriers cannot be built in five areas  including the national butterfly center in mission  tex a number of extensions  including a provision that would provide back pay to federal contractors deprived of payments during the last shutdown  will not be included in the package because bicameral leadership negotiations did not result in an agreement  according to a senior democratic aide  a republican senate aide said party negotiators believed that back pay could be handled by the office of management and budget without congresss involvement the unfinished items also include an extension of the violence against women act  which is set to expire friday mr  trump said on wednesday that the white house had not seen the legislative text of the deal  and when aides do  well be looking for land mines most democrats indicated they would support the legislation  even before the text was finished  in part because it would stave off another government shutdown and included democratic priorities in the other six bills some of the priorities include a  1 billion increase for census funding  a  1 3 billion increase for housing programs and  500 million in funding for medical support  food and clothing for migrants in detention and alternatives to detention federal employees will also receive a 1 9 percent increase in pay  representative steny h  hoyer of maryland  the majority leader  told reporters  noting that he and other members would most likely pursue a higher number in the future  along with other unaddressed immigration priorities other liberal lawmakers expressed concerns about the funding levels for the number of beds for detained immigrants and immigration and customs enforcement  which some had campaigned to abolish im trying to maintain an open mind  but i need details  said representative veronica escobar  a freshman democrat whose district includes most of el paso the barriers are going to be an issue  she added  noting that she would prefer no funding for the department of homeland security until it is audited at least one legislator  representative juan vargas  democrat of california  said he would vote against the bill  criticizing the inclusion of new steel post fencing i think most people just want to get this thing over with  he said  im not one of those people for some democrats  the biggest issue is detention slots under the control of the trump administration  the agreement authorizes the department of homeland security to fund about 40 000 beds for detainees  many of them in centers run by for profit companies and ice near the border in texas  arizona and california house democratic aides described the language as a glide path from the current level of 49 000 detention beds to obama era levels of 35 000 or fewer but a summary of the provisions drafted by senate republican staff members placed the average number of beds funded under the deal at a much higher number  45 274  including 2 500 for families  and that could rise to as many as 58 500 beds  republican aides asserted in internal communications  because federal cabinet departments have latitude in how they use funds representative pramila jayapal  democrat of washington and a leader of the congressional progressive caucus  said she was likely to vote no on the measure because of what she believed was a lack of accountability around the detention system weve reduced that number over the next nine months  but the average daily population that were appropriating is still too high  she said  unless we have a guarantee from the administration that theyre actually going to listen to what congress does and our appropriated amounts  we still have a president using every tool at his disposal but the lawmakers who said they were inclined to vote against the measure were not actively seeking support for their position under the complex funding formula in the agreement  the department of homeland security would also have reprogramming authority to transfer as much as  750 million from other programs to detention slots democrats have argued that with a new house majority  they can provide harsher oversight than their republican predecessors and push back on that maneuvering within the department and other federal agencies were intent on making sure that this process reflects the congressional intent of where they should be on barriers  on beds  on all these issues that matter to us  said representative pete aguilar  democrat of california and one of the negotiators .
washington  president trump acknowledged tuesday that closing the southern border with mexico could damage the united states economy  but said protecting americas security was more important than trade in remarks from the oval office  mr  trump reiterated his threat to shut the border if mexico  americas third largest trading partner  cannot restrict a flow of asylum seekers trying to cross into the united states  but the presidents economic team  concerned about the damage from such a move  said it was looking for ways to limit the fallout if mr  trump does do so sure  its going to have a negative impact on the economy  mr  trump said  adding  but security is most important security is more important to me than trade  he said republican lawmakers  economists and business groups largely disagree with that assessment and warned this week that closing the border could cripple the flow of goods and workers and devastate american automakers and farmers  as well as other industries that depend on mexico for sales and goods closing down the border would have a potentially catastrophic economic impact on our country  senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  said in an interview  i would hope that we would not be doing that sort of thing mark zandi  the chief economist at moodys analytics  said that a full shutdown of the u s  mexican border of more than several weeks would be the fodder for recessions in both mexico and the u s mr  trumps economic advisers have briefed him on the potential financial damage from a border shutdown and started looking for ways to mitigate it  including possibly keeping certain trading avenues open larry kudlow  the director of the national economic council  said tuesday in a brief interview that the trump administration was trying to secure the border without harming the economy the question is  he said  can we deal with that and not have any economic damage  i think the answer is we can  people are looking at different options mr  kudlow added that the administration was looking for ways to allow the freight passage  some people call it truck roads there are ways you can do that  which would ameliorate the breakdown in supply chains  he said but business leaders say there is no way to contain the damage from even a partial shutdown of the 2 000 mile border that the united states shares with mexico  nearly  1 7 billion of goods and services flow across the border daily  as well as nearly a half million legal workers  students  shoppers and tourists  the u s  chamber of commerce said monday on tuesday  officials with the chamber called a partial border shutdown uncharted territory and said such a policy would have negative economic consequences  particularly for communities along the border we dont know whether that is feasible or not  said neil bradley  the chambers executive vice president and chief policy officer even if it is possible  a partial shutdown would still cause significant disruptions for industries that are highly integrated across the border  including automobiles  machinery and electronic equipment the north american auto industry will be crippled in a week  kristin dziczek  a vice president for the center for automotive research  an industry research group  said in a tweet mr  trumps pledge to close the border comes in response to what officials with the department of homeland security say is an increase in migrant families who are flooding americas immigration system  leading to overflowing detention centers and mass releases of migrants the president told reporters that if mexico cannot restrict the flow of asylum seekers trying to cross into the united states  and if congress cannot agree to several immigration restrictions that mr  trump has long pushed for  the border is going to be closed while 76 000 migrants crossed the border in february  that number is nowhere near the migration levels seen in the early 2000s  and a majority of the migrants crossing the border now are central american families looking for asylum  as opposed to mexican individuals looking for work  homeland security officials could quickly deport mexican individuals seeking employment  but  by law  they cannot swiftly deport central american families or unaccompanied children homeland security officials have said they expect the number of crossings to surpass 100 000 this month  and a senior department official said those traveling in and out of ports of entry were already feeling an effect  there was a three hour wait at the port of entry in brownsville  tex   according to the official  and there were around 150 trucks backed up and waiting to cross at otay mesa  in california on monday  kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  said she would divert up to 750 border patrol officials from ports of entry to areas in between the ports to handle large groups of migrants crossing the border  a senior homeland security official also said the administration could start closing traffic lanes at the ports the crisis at our border is worsening  ms  nielsen said  and d h s  will do everything in its power to end it senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina and one of mr  trumps external advisers  has been urging the president to ease off the threat  on tuesday  mr  graham portrayed mr  trumps latest broadside as less an eventuality and more a calculated bargaining position you are taking a bad problem and  by closing the ports of entry  you are creating another problem  he said during an interview  to the extent that he wants to redeploy resources to the points of entry to deal with the ungoverned spaces  that will create economic upheaval  but that will hopefully lead to a solution border activity makes up a relatively larger share of mexicos economy than the united states  meaning mexico would most likely have more economic damage from a border closing  mr  zandi said but that does not mean the united states would be in a winning position  communities across the country would probably see supply chain disruptions  product shortages  seizures in stock and bond markets and a plunge in already fragile business confidence  mr  zandi said  the disruption would be especially sharp in the border states of california  arizona  new mexico and texas  which all have mexico as their no  1 export market any closure could have far ranging implications for a wide range of industries  including automotive  electronics and apparel  that source small components and deliver their products on a just in time basis on both sides of the border it could also be devastating for the agriculture industry  since the north american free trade agreement began in 1994  american farmers have moved toward specializing in corn  soybeans  chicken  dairy  pork and beef to supply to mexico  while mexican farmers have specialized in fresh fruits and vegetables to send to the united states  any delays in deliveries of these products could lead to near immediate price hikes and empty supermarket shelves  which would hit low income mexicans and americans the hardest christin fernandez  the vice president for communications at the retail industry leaders association  said that slowing or halting screenings at major ports near the border would lead to product delays and potentially higher shipping costs the entire retail ecosystem is sustained on the expectation that americas retailers can provide consumers with the goods they want and need  when they need it  at the best possible prices  ms  fernandez said  if our suppliers are feeling the pain  retailers will feel the pain  and  ultimately  it is consumers that will bear the burden stock markets do not appear to be pricing in any risk of a border closure  the s p 500 was essentially unchanged on tuesday  and it remains near a six month high .
washington  house and senate negotiators on monday night agreed in principle to provide  1 375 billion for fencing and other physical barriers at the mexican border  part of a broader agreement that would stave off another partial government shutdown without funding president trumps wall the agreement would allow for 55 miles of new bollard fencing  with some restrictions on location based on community and environmental concerns  according to two congressional aides  who requested anonymity to disclose details of the private negotiations  that is a fraction of the more than 200 miles of steel and concrete wall that mr  trump demanded  and 10 miles less than negotiators agreed on last summer  before democrats took control of the house the deal  which must still pass the house and the senate  and secure mr  trumps signature  came together just before mr  trump  framed by banners emblazoned with finish the wall at an event in el paso  doubled down on his demands were building the wall anyway  he told the crowd  saying that aides had told him that the negotiators had made progress the funding for 55 miles of new fencing is a figure far lower than the  5 7 billion that mr  trump had demanded and marginally less than the  1 6 billion for 65 miles of pedestrian fencing in the bill that the senate appropriations committee had passed last year in december  the president  concerned about reneging on his signature campaign promise  refused to sign onto that legislation  forcing the nations longest government shutdown the negotiators also agreed to reduce the number of migrants and undocumented immigrants who can be held in detention  democrats demand for a limit on how much detention space could be used for unauthorized immigrants arrested within the united states had threatened to derail the negotiations over the weekend  but lawmakers agreed to waive the demand instead  lawmakers agreed to adhere to levels  set by a number of detention beds  established in the previous budget  that would fund 40 520 beds  a decrease of about 17 percent from current levels  which immigration and customs enforcement reached in recent months only by surpassing its funding caps privately  democratic aides admitted the provision could have no impact on the number of beds ice assigned for detainees  there is nothing to prevent trump administration officials from funding a greater number of slots in excess of the lower target number  and then securing congressional outlays to cover those expenses  as ice officials have done routinely in recent years  the aides said beyond the border barriers  the agreement  which primarily funds the department of homeland security  would provide  1 7 billion more for border security  including technology at ports of entry  more officers and humanitarian aid  sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  the republican and democratic leaders of the house and senate appropriations committees announced the agreement  which includes seven unfinished spending bills  after three private meetings on monday  disaster relief for areas affected by storms and natural disasters last year will not be included  and lawmakers said they would address it separately it is expected to be finalized as early as tuesday  well before the friday deadline when funding would again lapse for a number of federal agencies  with fears of another damaging shutdown  lawmakers seemed confident that they had the support of party leadership and that mr  trump would be willing to sign the agreement we think so  senator richard c  shelby  republican of alabama and the chairman of the senate appropriations committee  told reporters when asked about the likelihood of the presidents signature  we hope so the specter of another government shutdown this close  i thought tonight we didnt want that to happen  he added later senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  had urged him to get it done in negotiations  mr  shelby said  representative nita m  lowey  democrat of new york and the chairwoman of the house appropriations committee  said she had been in close communication with speaker nancy pelosi of california and expected her support she has confidence that i made the right decision  ms  lowey told reporters white house officials did not respond to requests for comment about the terms of the agreement  and the presidents conservative allies on monday night were already denouncing the deal  sean hannity  a fox news commentator and a confidant of the presidents  called it a garbage compromise pentagon officials spent the weekend readying for the possibility that mr  trump would declare a national emergency  something that his allies said he is still considering as a means to secure border wall funding but republican lawmakers remained optimistic that their agreement would hold this has been a difficult one  said representative kay granger of texas  the ranking republican on the house appropriations committee  i think everyone will say  good work a specific point of contention had been the number of detention beds under the control of ice  which had stalled talks over the weekend house democrats  urged on by immigration rights groups  had pushed hard  hoping to leverage white house fears of another damaging shutdown into a softening of the presidents hard line immigration policies that they say have torn apart families  wrenched productive workers from the communities they have lived in for years and infused a heartlessness into official american immigration policy the democrats goal was to cut the overall number of detention beds  including those occupied by asylum seekers and people caught at the border  from its current level of around 49 000 to 34 000  the number funded during the obama administration  democratic aides said  that  they say  would end sweeps and roundups  and force ice to focus on pursuing hardened criminals we started at zero on the wall  and we compromised a lot after that  and we are now asking them to change  too  said representative lucille roybal allard  democrat of california and a member of the 17 member house and senate conference committee tasked with hammering out a compromise mr  trump caught on  when mr  shelby presented him with the democrats demand  he rejected it quickly  according to two people briefed on the exchange these are the people coming into our country that we are holding and we dont want in our country  the president told reporters at the white house on monday  thats why they dont want to give us what we call the beds  its much more complicated than beds  but we call them the beds in private  republicans responded with a plan that would exempt many detained immigrants from the cap  including those people either charged with or convicted of crimes  including misdemeanor drug offenses and violent felonies  that  in turn  was rejected by democrats you have ice agents picking up mothers and fathers and children in their own neighborhoods  thats why the beds issue is so much more important than the wall  said ms  roybal allard  whose los angeles area district is 85 percent hispanic  the highest percentage of any district in the country the number of beds occupied by detainees fluctuates over time  influenced by a variety of factors  including ice enforcement policies and the flow of migrants at the border with mexico  the rate of that flow is unpredictable and determined by factors such as the performance of the economies north and south of the border  crime  gang activity and the business practices of coyotes paid to transport migrants from mexico and central america to california and the southwest the number of monthly apprehensions of migrants at the border has averaged 25 000 to 40 000 for most of the past decade  but has risen to about 50 000 over the past several months  according to statistics compiled by the department of homeland security if ice does not have enough room to place individuals and family members they detain  they must loosen their enforcement actions  creating a powerful motive for new migrants to enter the country illegally  trump administration officials say you cannot have border security  without strong interior enforcement  whether there is a wall there or not  said matt albence  the deputy director of ice  on monday in a conference call with reporters republicans closed ranks to blast the plan this is a poison pill that no administration  not this one  not the previous one  should ever accept  mr  mcconnell said on the senate floor  imagine the absurdity of this  house democrats want to set a limit on how many criminal aliens our government can detain .
as a political fight rages in washington over president trumps demand for  5 7 billion in border wall funding  there have been spirited acts of resistance on the united states mexico border  protests have been held  resolutions passed  and initiatives funded to help the very people the wall is aimed to keep out  this month  were launching a limited run weekly newsletter about life on the border  far from the tug of war of washington politics  sign up here to receive the first issue of crossing the border when it launches  bulldozers arrived last week near the national butterfly center in the rio grande valley of texas  signaling the trump administrations intention to begin construction on a steel and concrete barrier that would swallow more than two thirds of the 100 acre wildlife refuge and botanical garden  the nonprofit center  which abuts the rio grande  sits on the path of a six mile stretch of wall that has already been funded  federal government officials had said construction was scheduled to begin this month  despite an ongoing lawsuit filed by the center more than a year ago  said the centers director  marianna trevino wright  the center planned to file a restraining order to prevent workers from beginning construction on the wall  which would rise to 36 feet in some areas the federal government waived 28 environmental laws to expedite construction the rio grande valley is one of the most biologically diverse regions in the country and a major bird migration corridor  with more than 500 species recorded  in a gofundme campaign that has raised more than half of a  100 000 goal to pay for legal fees associated with ongoing litigation against the trump administration  the center s director wrote that the issue is not whether butterflies can fly over a wall  but whether private property  farms  businesses  homes  should be seized and destroyed for a project that does not serve the greater good or enhance national security in his state of the union speech last tuesday evening  mr  trump claimed the border city of el paso  tex   was once among americas most violent cities  until a powerful barrier was constructed  and then  immediately upon its building  it became one of the safest cities in our country but that is not true  before border fencing was erected in el paso  the city of about 680 000 residents had the second lowest violent crime rate among more than 20 cities of similar size  in 2010  after the barrier was built  that rate held that spot  residents and elected officials immediately took to social media to dispel the notion that border cities are dangerous  mr  trump is scheduled to hold a 2020 campaign rally monday in el paso  where about 26 percent of registered voters cast ballots for him two years ago  el paso is also the hometown of beto orourke  the democratic former congressman who has said hes considering jumping into the crowded field of candidates vying to challenge the president  few elected officials were enthusiastic about the presidents coming visit  with one  state representative csar j  blanco  issuing a statement that said the presidents fear mongering and lies have hurt our border economy and community  mr  blanco  a navy veteran and democrat whose house district 76 includes part of el paso county  said the city should not be rolling out the red carpet  so he can come lie in our backyard the citys republican mayor  dee margo  also quickly defended el paso  saying on twitter late tuesday night that the citys law enforcement officers kept the border community safe shortly before mr  trump appeared before congress last week to deliver a speech that would again include arguments for a border wall  new mexicos governor announced she had ordered a partial withdrawal of national guard troops from her state new mexico will not take part in the presidents charade of border fear mongering by misusing our diligent national guard troops  gov  michelle lujan grisham  a democrat  said in a statement  her decision was a reversal of her predecessors deployment of 118 national guard personnel last april  and in california on monday  gov  gavin newsom was expected to follow suit and order the withdrawal of nearly 400 state national guard troops from deployment along the border with mexico  under a general order that his aides said he planned to sign  110 california national guard troops would be redirected to support the states central fire agency  cal fire  and another 100 would work on statewide intelligence operations aimed at international criminal drug gangs in new mexico  about a dozen guardsmen will remain in the southwestern part of the state  ms  grisham said  to help with humanitarian aid for migrants who cross the border into the united states  she also directed the deployment of six state police officers to assist local law enforcement officers in hidalgo county  saying she recognized the countys legitimate concerns about the number of asylum seekers arriving in the state  hundreds of migrants have surrendered to the border patrol in new mexico in recent weeks  including children in need of immediate medical care  a situation state officials say is without precedent prompting these trips to ever more remote border locations  the nearly 700 miles of border wall and fencing built since 2006  and the trump administrations increasingly rigid immigration policies aimed at deterring the flow of migrant families  mostly from central america  who have streamed in from mexico since 2014  read  desperation of thousands pushes migrants into ever remote terrain gov  grisham took aim at mr  trumps proposed wall in a video that went viral this week about 20 000 people live in nogales  ariz   and close to another half million live across the border in nogales  mexico  a fence about 10 feet tall divides the two  but like most communities along the united states mexico border  their economies  cultures and daily lives are intertwined in november  the united states military descended on nogales and promptly got to work installing barbed wire at the port of entry and atop the international border wall  this month  the military added horizontal strands of wire to the united states side of the fence  from the top of the wall to the ground last wednesday evening  the nogales city council passed a resolution condemning the installation of the wire  calling it an indiscriminate use of lethal force that is typically only found in a war  battlefield or prison setting  with its sharp razor like blades  barbed wire is designed to entangle its victim as the razors slice cut deeply in to the flesh and would kill anyone who tried to scale the wall the city council said it wanted the federal government to remove the wire  and has vowed to sue the trump administration if that does not happen  the resolution came one day after mr  trump addressed the nation and implored americans to support his case for a border wall  barbed wire has been installed on fencing across arizona  texas and california  read  deployed inside the united states  the military waits for the migrant caravan in california  where about 105 miles of the states 140 mile border with mexico have some sort of fencing  elected officials have pushed back against the trump administrations pledge to fill in the spaces  residents of calexico  a small border town that recently saw the completion of renovations to a steel barrier  chafed at the barbed wire that also was installed  with one chalking it up to political propaganda from a white house that cannot fathom life along the southwest frontier earlier this month  gov  gavin newsom of california asked state lawmakers to provide  5 million in immediate funding to local charities that help asylum seekers  the aid would be followed by another  20 million over three years  intended to assist groups that have helped migrants who were dropped off by immigration and customs enforcement agents at bus stations  as the number of migrant families in recent months has overwhelmed the governments detention facilities  the trump administration has drastically reduced its efforts to ensure the migrants safety after they are released  stepping into the void has been a growing network of charities  expanding along the border from california to texas   read  as government pulls back

el paso  this tranquil city of bilingual trans border commerce is where lurid fantasy meets humdrum reality  president trump will come here monday  risking life and limb at our very dangerous southern border  that lawless frontier facing a tremendous onslaught  i can reassure the president  he will be able to gaze at mexico without breaking a sweat or putting his hairdo at risk trump will attribute the calm to fencing completed a decade ago and recently extended with what looks like junkyard metal  in his state of the union address  he claimed the barrier transformed el paso from one of our nations most dangerous cities into one of our safest cities  this was a lie it incensed the mayor  dee margo  who tweeted  el paso was never one of the most dangerous cities in the u s  it incensed representative veronica escobar  a democrat  who accused the president in a tweet of spreading falsehoods  for a city of its size  el paso has eased from pretty safe to super safe as its violent crime rate has dropped since the mid 1990s  the citys story is not a fence story margo  in an interview  said  i hope we have some adult behavior  egos are overriding common sense and i think its ridiculous  escobar told me  trumps wall obsession is his way of keeping a campaign promise to the core of his base  many of whom are xenophobic and some outright racist el paso is as good a place as any to grasp americas warped political discourse  the crazed way its abandoned rational debate of real problems for the sterile shrieking of tribes  the united states has a broken immigration system thats an affront to a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws  but nobody really wants to talk about why or how to fix it trump is exhibit a in the process  someone perceived early in his campaign that immigration was an issue around which a simple galvanizing argument could be advanced that trump might actually understand  build a wall from sea to shining sea  keep out mexican rapists  have mexico pay  and claim an invasion of brown skinned illegals has been stopped in the name of american jobs  security and identity  as for reality  forget it some version of this fear stoking fable will be repeated by trump on monday night at the el paso county coliseum  its no accident he has chosen this texas border city for his first make america great again rally of the 2020 cycle  the president will portray himself as the man standing between the country and the abyss of invasion  lawlessness and socialism  he will do so in the city of beto orourke  the charismatic former congressman weighing a presidential campaign  he will try to skewer democrats like orourke as immigrant huggers if trump were interested in facts rather rabble rousing mendacity and the theatrical stringing of concertina wire by military forces needlessly dispatched to the border  he might note the following  guatemala  el salvador and honduras  not mexico  are now the overwhelming source of northward migration  poverty  violence  corrupt governments  guatemalas vigorously supported by the trump administration  organized crime and longstanding mistreatment of indigenous peoples feed the flow  a marshall plan for central america would do more for border security than any barrier so would patient  respectful diplomacy  rather than wild outbursts  with the mexican government of andrs manuel lpez obrador  who holds the key to the porous mexican guatemalan border more than 600 miles of fencing already cover about a third of the border  trumps wild talk of his wall  drugs and terrorism is pure obfuscation  it ignores where a barrier might be useful  how narcotics come in  and the real sources of terrorist threats the united states border force has been placed in an impossible situation  it was trained to deal with single mexican males striving to escape capture  it now faces a different phenomenon  thousands of mainly guatemalan families a month driven northward on buses and intent on presenting themselves to border guards once in they do so in the social media transmitted knowledge that the zigzags of trump administration policy  including the cruel separation of thousands of children from their parents during the zero tolerance interlude  have ended in a situation where these families know they will be released within 20 days by ice and go to the back of an 800 000 person line awaiting their day in immigration court  thats a virtual guarantee of at least two to three years in the country  though the administration is trying to make them wait in a mexican limbo that could be nightmarish  these immigrants are no different from those who arrived at ellis island  they are fleeing misery and often violence in search of a better life  some are bona fide refugees legally entitled to protection  the united states  nation of migration and churn  must treat them with humanity  openness  not walls  has served the country and preserves its spirit the united states is also a nation of laws  trump has turned a serious dilemma into a theater of racist scapegoating and so served division  not needed immigration reform  no democrat could vote to finance his bigotry  plenty of democrats could vote for a secure border  trump won 25 7 percent of the vote in el paso  thats because people on the border understand the benefits of binational flux  they see through trumps chest beating america first to its un american core .
there are more than 48 000 people being held in immigrant detention in more than 200 facilities in the united states  more than two thirds of them  according to the national immigrant justice center  are confined by private companies  working on contracts with the federal government  those numbers have ballooned in the last two years under the trump administration  drawing new attention to the terrible conditions detainees are living in one feature of privately run centers  the voluntary work program  is the subject of six separate lawsuits  which say that privately run immigrant detention centers are coercing detainees into working for a dollar a day and punishing those who dont  the lawsuits demand  among other things  that the practice stop and that detained workers be paid minimum wage congress should not wait for these lawsuits to be decided  democrats have won the house  so even if they cant stop the presidents anti immigrant push  they can push to raise the obsolete and exploitative  1 a day wage  and  just as they have rejected mr  trumps request for  5 7 billion for the border wall  they should reject the request for  2 8 billion to expand detentions to 52 000 beds prison labor is nearly as old as the american prison system itself  and it is protected by the 13th amendment  which abolished slavery and indentured servitude except as punishment for a crime  this exception means that prisons can require their prisoners to work  even without compensation  but immigrant detention is civil confinement  not criminal  people held in these facilities are not charged with any crime  they are being detained while awaiting asylum or deportation hearings  under immigration and customs enforcements voluntary work program  however   immigrant detention centers need not pay workers more than one dollar a day  a rate set by congress in 1950 and codified in the 1978 appropriations act  it has never been increased or adjusted for inflation detainees say that the voluntary work program is not really voluntary  if they attempt to take a day off or refuse to work  staff members punish them by withholding essential items  threatening to move them to more dangerous housing units or locking them in their cells  wilhen hill barrientos  a guatemalan asylum seeker and a plaintiff in the lawsuit against corecivics stewart detention center in georgia  said that he had to either work for a few cents an hour or go without basic things like soap  which he could get only through the commissary according to mr  barrientoss lawsuit  one night a guard awakened him for the 2 a m  shift in the kitchen rather than his scheduled 10 a m  shift  when he refused  the guard threatened to move him to a violence plagued dormitory  so mr  barrientos acquiesced martha gonzalez  from mexico  was detained in three different corecivic prisons in texas from may 2016 to august 2017 as she awaited a t 1 visa  which is granted to victims of human trafficking  she worked in the kitchen and sorted clothing  when she once tried to take a day off  she told me  the prison staff then punished her by refusing to give her basic hygiene supplies such as sanitary pads and toothpaste  corecivic did not respond to ms  gonzalezs allegation but said that its work programs are completely voluntary and that detainees are subject to no disciplinary action whatsoever if they choose not to participate in the work program a representative for geo group called the lawsuits allegations baseless  saying that this is a strictly voluntary program and that geo group provides hygiene products free of charge upon request  private corporations hold less than 10 percent of the nations prison population  but more than 70 percent of people in immigration detention  the government pays them a fixed daily price per person  so they have an economic incentive to run their facilities as cheaply as possible  relying on detainees to cook meals  mop hallways  scrub toilets  mow lawns and even cut hair in 2016  corecivics revenue from stewart  where mr  barrientos and other detainees worked in the kitchen  was about  38 million  in 2017  contracts with ice comprised 25 percent of its  1 76 billion in revenue  for geo group  ice contracts comprised 19 percent of its  2 26 billion revenue in 2017  at the same time  the detention centers provide the barest minimum to detainees  while charging them exorbitant rates for necessities  in immigrant detention  a phone call can cost as much as  12 75 for 15 minutes  four ounces of toothpaste sells for  11 these two corporations have become the giants of the private prison industry  between 2016 and 2018  corecivic spent  2 8 million in lobbying and over  700 000 on campaign contributions while geo group spent  4 4 million in lobbying and  2 5 million on campaign contributions  each company also donated  250 000 to mr  trumps inauguration they blame the 1978 appropriations act for the low wages  as geo group puts it  the wage rates associated with this federal government program are stipulated under long established guidelines set by the united states congress  that is true  if congress instead forced these companies to pay the federal minimum wage  their profit margins would drop dramatically but the dollar a day rule has stalwart defenders in congress  in response to a class action lawsuit in which formerly detained immigrants said they were forced to work  18 republican congressmen sent a letter on march 7  2018  to the attorney general at the time  jeff sessions  the head of ice and the secretary of the department of labor  exhorting those agencies to help geo group defend itself  unless your agencies act to intervene in these lawsuits  immigration enforcement efforts will be thwarted  and the end result will be millions of dollars of unnecessary loss to the federal government in terms of additional expenses for immigration detention  they said  in other words  they worried that if the private prisons were forced to pay reasonable wages  the companies would pass on those costs to the federal government the lawsuits are not pushing to end the voluntary work program altogether  they understand that it allows people who are in detention to buy things they need and keep in touch with their families by phone  which becomes even more urgent as the number of families torn apart by detention increases  instead  the lawsuits are pushing for an end to exploitation and a fair wage for their work yes  paying detainees a minimum wage would make these facilities much more expensive to operate  but if privately run detention centers rely on a business model based on forced labor  perhaps they should not exist at all .
west palm beach  fla   president trump would not commit in an interview aired sunday to making public the results of the special counsels investigation into russias ties to his campaign  adding that it was time to get rid of the inquiry in the interview on cbss face the nation  mr  trump reiterated his belief that the attorney general would determine whether the public would see the results of the inquiry by the special counsel  robert s  mueller iii  but he would not say whether he would be comfortable with the results being made public i dont know  the president said  it depends  i have no idea what its going to say the law does not require the justice department to release a report  and mr  mueller has been silent on the issue  last month  trump advisers were pleased that william p  barr  mr  trumps nominee for attorney general  opened the door to the possibility that the special counsels report could be shielded from the public during a senate confirmation hearing mr  trumps wide ranging interview with margaret brennan  the shows host  was conducted days after the acting attorney general  matthew g  whitaker  said the investigation was nearing its end  and amid stagnant negotiations with democrats over mr  trumps demand for a border wall  mr  trump indicated at various points in the interview that he would use the power of his office to solve that matter and others facing his presidency among those matters  the president appeared to suggest  are national security and the military  he called the use of military force against venezuela an option  and he indicated that he would like to keep troops in iraq  a striking departure from his push to withdraw from afghanistan and syria  to keep an eye on iran its perfectly situated for looking at all over different parts of the troubled middle east rather than pulling up  mr  trump said  were going to keep watching and were going to keep seeing and if theres trouble  if somebody is looking to do nuclear weapons or other things  were going to know it before they do on the border wall fight  the president reiterated his belief that we have now set the table to take action after a short term deal to fund part of the government  a deal struck to end the longest government shutdown in history  expires on feb  15  in an interview with the new york times on thursday  mr  trump suggested that he had successfully made the case to americans that the problem at the border was enough to constitute declaring a national emergency  and that nancy pelosi  the house speaker  was doing a disservice to the country  both points he again made on sunday people that didnt have any idea  mr  trump said  they didnt have a clue as to what was happening  they now know exactly whats happening mr  trump is expected to make immigration a cornerstone of his state of the union speech  which is scheduled for tuesday  in the interview with cbs  mr  trump once again accused democrats  in particular ms  pelosi  of ignoring urgent problems at the border  which included human trafficking and what mr  trump called an invasion of human traffickers into the country though mr  trump seems intent on ignoring congressional negotiations  lawmakers insisted on sunday that they were still trying  senator richard c  shelby  the chairman of the senate appropriations committee and a member of the committee working to reach a deal  admitted that it was too early to say whether the negotiations could be successful i think that the president is dead set on keeping his campaign promise  mr  shelby  republican of alabama  said on cnns state of the union  he acknowledged that mr  trump probably had some legal merits for declaring a national emergency over the border wall  but he pleaded for the committee to be allowed to do its work if people leave us alone  mr  shelby added  well get this done by wednesday night he said that the committee had invited experts with knowledge of the southwestern border to testify this week on exactly what is needed for border security  mr  shelby expressed optimism that hearing from those experts could move us off of the semantic debate over a wall or fencing its a question of how do we get off the politics and on to the substance  he said other members of the bipartisan committee  representative henry cuellar  democrat of texas  and senator john hoeven  republican of north dakota  doubled down on their respective partys positions on fox news sunday  mr  cuellar  who represents parts of the border  dismissed the presidents reasoning for the wall as built on a false premise in the cbs interview  mr  trump fought back against criticism of his wall and other policies  he responded to warnings that his administration was risking a resurgence of terrorist groups by promising the rapid withdrawal of troops from syria and afghanistan by saying that he ran against 17 republicans and won ill leave intelligence there  mr  trump said  and if i see nests forming  ill do something about it last week  mr  trump showed similar defiance in suggesting that his intelligence chiefs go back to school for issuing a threat assessment saying that north korea was unlikely to give up its nuclear program and that iran is not  for now  taking steps necessary to make a bomb mr  trump said that he would ultimately rely on his own counsel if he disagreed with intelligence assessments the president also indicated that the power of his affectionate letter writing with kim jong un  the north korean leader  might persuade mr  kim to drop his nuclear plans  mr  trump has at least six letters from mr  kim that he enjoys sharing with people who visit him in the oval office we have had tremendous correspondence that some people have seen and cant even believe it  mr  trump said  now that doesnt mean were going to make a deal  but certainly i think we have a very good chance of making a deal other leaders did not receive such praise  mr  trump said that he had declined a meeting with nicols maduro  the embattled president of venezuela  days after the trump administration said it recognized juan guaid  the 35 year old opposition figure  as the countrys rightful leader i decided at the time  no  because so many really horrible things have been happening in venezuela when you look at that country  mr  trump said with his cabinet in flux  mr  trump dismissed as fake news the reports that senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  had asked mike pompeo  the secretary of state and his most visible emissary in negotiations with north korea  to consider leaving to run for a senate seat in kansas mr  pompeo confirmed that discussion over a week ago  the secretary of state said that he had appreciated the call  but that he had a very full plate the cbs interview was broadcast during the presidents first visit in months to mar a lago  his florida estate  where he spent saturday golfing with tiger woods and jack nicklaus  on sunday  the president hit the golf course again amid planning for his annual super bowl party the president told cbs that he loved to watch football  but that he would not encourage his youngest son  barron  12  to participate in such a dangerous sport .
washington  the pentagon is poised to send at least 2 000 more active duty troops to the southwestern border  defense department officials said tuesday  deployments that have already cost the military hundreds of millions of dollars and thrust the department into the center of the debate over border security and president trumps proposed wall the acting defense secretary  patrick shanahan  told reporters that the united states would be sending several thousand additional troops to provide more support for the department of homeland securitys border patrol efforts  defense department officials later said that they expect that number to be around 2 000 that would come on top of the 2 400 troops who are there now  bringing the deployed number at the border close to the high of 5 900 that it reached in the weeks surrounding the midterm elections in november the deployment of several thousand military troops to secure the southwestern border will total more than  600 million by the end of the fiscal year in september  pentagon officials also told the house armed services committee on tuesday the deployment of active duty troops through the end of january is estimated to cost  132 million  said vice adm  michael gilday  the director of operations for the joint staff  the cost of the national guards operations at the border through the fiscal year  he estimated  will cost  550 million since mr  trump declared what he called a national security crisis at the border that warranted the deployment of active duty troops  the defense department has sought to limit their role  but the administration has kept them in the mix  the additional troops will be used to install concertina wire and provide more surveillance of the border area  mr  shanahan said mr  shanahan replaced jim mattis  who resigned in december as defense secretary  in a rebuke of much of mr  trumps national security policy at one point last year  mr  trump described a wall of people to stop caravans of central american refugees and called for up to 15 000 troops to defend the border  the pentagon reluctantly sent 5 900  then cut that number quickly back to 2 400  the president also spoke of telling the military to respond to migrants throwing rocks as if they were rifles but the deployments can go only so far  the posse comitatus act  dating to reconstruction  bars american forces from engaging in law enforcement activities within the borders of the united states democrats say the deployments  especially the ones just before the midterms  were flagrantly political i am extremely concerned that we preserve the reality and perception that the u s  military is apolitical  said representative elissa slotkin  democrat of michigan  it is hard to feel it wasnt political given how close it was to the midterms representative bennie thompson  democrat of mississippi and the chairman of the committee on homeland security  upon being told that kirstjen nielsen  the secretary of homeland security  declined his invitation to testify on the issue of border security  cried foul your attempt to use the presidents recent shutdown as an excuse not to testify before congress prior to the impending shutdown is outrageous  mr  thompson wrote to ms  nielsen in a letter on tuesday appearing before the house committee for the first time since democrats took control this month  admiral gilday and john rood  the under secretary of defense for policy  defended the deployments and said the militarys presence have yielded very successful results we believe that our militarys presence and support has served to increase the effectiveness of operations at the border  admiral gilday said  adding that the defense department has a long history of supporting efforts to secure american borders were not trying just to have a photo op down there  he continued as negotiators from the house and the senate begin meeting this week to hash out a plan to secure the southwestern border and fund the government  republicans on the house armed services committee seized on the pentagons cost estimates to press for more border security funding were here at this moment in time because we failed to provide adequate resources to the department of homeland security  said representative paul mitchell  republican of michigan democrats on the committee remained skeptical it is unclear why this is an appropriate use of the militarys time and resources  said representative adam smith of washington  the chairman of the committee  it appears service members are laying concertina wire and performing other tasks that are better suited for civilian law enforcement agencies admiral gilday said active duty troops were deployed before the midterms because thousands of migrants were massing along the border  the trump administration chose to send troops because they could be deployed more quickly than the national guard  he said  the department of homeland security is currently tracking three migrant caravans containing 12 000 people moving toward the border  mr  rood said democrats pressed defense department officials to identify which projects would be affected if mr  trump declares a national emergency and moves funds to build a border wall  mr  rood declined to answer  and added that the department had only done the preliminary preplanning for such an event we are supporting our federal partners on the border  and that mission has been extended until september  said lt  col  jamie davis  a pentagon spokesman  we are currently sourcing the units involved and there will be an increase of a few thousand troops .
washington  hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to work on monday with a presidential promise of a paycheck very quickly but no guarantee that they will be working in three weeks  when a temporary stopgap of funding expires president trump and congressional democrats arrived at a short term agreement late on friday  reopening the government after 35 days and the longest government shutdown in history  lawmakers have until feb  15 to reach a compromise on the republican request for billions of dollars to be allocated for a border wall  a wall democrats have refused to fund referring to the odds that a deal could be struck over that time  mr  trump told the wall street journal on sunday  i personally think its less than 50 50  mr  trump said he would use emergency powers to fund the wall if an agreement could not be reached in a stark reminder that federal employees were returning to work with the knowledge that they might be forced to go without a paycheck once again next month  one federal agency  the department of agriculture  updated its employee information website and said  we will also leave some of the shutdown related material up for a period time  should you need to refer back to it richard nagle  a lawyer with the environmental protection agency in chicago  said returning to work after a mandatory furlough required some digging out its triage  he said  eyeing his email inbox  im going to go through the ones that are screaming for attention  i havent been on voice mail yet  but im sure thats capped out at 32 messages in the first hour of his day  one question seemed to be echoing through the halls  what did you do colleagues were sharing stories of how they passed the time while they were furloughed  pretty much everyone confessed to sleeping a little later than usual  basements were cleaned out  digital photos were organized  hardwood floors were scrubbed until they were gleaming some employees took road trips  visiting extended family in michigan or driving down to memphis  eight hours away  anything to stave off the boredom and anxiety of being home  unpaid  during a chicago winter as employees streamed into the office  managers stood in the lobby  handing out informational papers on things to know  how to apply for back pay  what to do if you forgot your passwords  some supervisors brought in sweet treats  there were nudges about projects that had been put on hold  and  in some cases  forgotten  and hurried meetings to figure out what could be accomplished before the next potential shutdown at a federal emergency management agency office in fort worth  some employees felt like they were racing against the clock theyre trying to get as much work as they can get done before flood season  tornado season and hurricane season  said steve reaves  a safety officer for fema who also leads the union for fema employees  with us  its do as much we can before they try to do this again senior officials on monday both welcomed their workforces and tried to reassure them about the weeks to come i encourage you all to take time to talk to each other about the past few weeks and be transparent with your supervisors about any hardships  brock long  the fema administrator  wrote in an email on monday morning  i also want to be clear that there is no higher priority than to guarantee  for those who missed paychecks  that you get paid as quickly as possible but mr  long acknowledged that reopening the government was not as simple as turning a light switch while there is important work to be done  i want to make sure that you are set up for success before jumping into your normal assignments  he wrote  please allow time for updates and reboots to computers  addressing expired passwords  syncing mobile devices  managing benefits and organizing your work space  supervisors have been provided checklists that should be helpful  again  please also take the time to listen and support each other ryan baugh  a department of homeland security statistician and a steward for the american federation of government employees  said the possibility that there could be another shutdown had a damaging effect  raising questions about what could realistically be scheduled  meetings  trainings  projects  given the uncertainty well work hard for three weeks  and then well see what happens  he said  you could still use the word hostage  were still the bargaining chip here the morning commute on monday in the washington area was once again bustling after an eerily quiet month of little road traffic during peak travel hours and open seats on trains and buses at a metro station near the environmental protection agencys headquarters in washington  a small group of environmental activists with the nonprofit group moms clean air force welcomed e p a  employees back to work with cinnamon rolls welcome back  cinnamon roll  elizabeth brandt  a field organizer for the group  chirped as employees rode up the metro escalator  ms  brandt  holding her daughters  valencia  5  and natalia  3  said that having grown up next to a toxic cleanup site in tacoma  wash   it was important to her to make sure the agencys workers knew their work was valued i dont often get a chance to thank people who do that work the way i thank our pediatrician and the people who give my kids shots  she said e p a  employees for their part said they were relieved to be back to work yet anxious that the reprieve from the partial government shutdown could be short lived most of us cannot afford to be without pay for a month  said denise walker  an agency lawyer  its very stressful for people the national park service reopened on sunday  but prospective visitors were encouraged to check with individual parks to make sure they were indeed receiving visitors  smithsonian museums and the national zoo were set to reopen on tuesday federal workers who had turned to food banks to feed their families continued to struggle to make ends meet as they returned to work on monday  some federal employees have been working without pay for weeks  and many federal contractors are not expected to be paid at all for the days the government was closed jamie rodny  an investigator at the housing and urban development office in los angeles  said she was both excited to return to work and scared she would be facing the same situation in three weeks  she was told she would not see a paycheck on monday  and said her branch chief told her that he had heard they might get paid on thursday ms  rodny  who works for the fair housing and equal opportunity division  which oversees the enforcement of federal housing laws  said she arrived at her office to find frantic emails and voice mail messages from people whose cases she was forced to drop when the government closed  now  as she returns these messages  she expects to hear that some of those complainants were evicted over the past 35 days or are facing debts because of the forced lull in their cases where do i start  she asked ms  rodny spoke at the womens march in washington earlier this month  after she was approached by her labor union  the national federation of federal employees  about the financial and emotional pain of workers affected by the shutdown  her family lives paycheck to paycheck  she said  and during the break in pay  they used their credit cards for as many purchases as possible  which resulted in her credit score dropping  she said they were able to make their mortgage payment because of donations they received through a gofundme campaign  she recently started an activist group called stop government shutdowns forever the president promised the 800 000 employees who had been furloughed or forced to work that they would be paid very quickly or as soon as possible  without providing a specific date  the white house office of management and budget directed agencies to prioritize pay and benefits after reopening some federal agencies worked through the weekend in an effort to get paychecks to their workers as soon as possible  the department of agriculture instructed its employees to file their time sheets by noon on monday and pledged to resume direct deposits into bank accounts by thursday  on sunday  the commissioner of the customs and border protection agency  kevin k  mcaleenan  addressed employees on twitter to say that the agency had already approved a majority of the timecards and pledged to work to make sure everyone is paid soon aware of the looming feb  15 deadline  some lawmakers are trying to pass a law that would outlaw future government shutdowns shutting down the government should be as off limits in budget negotiations as chemical warfare is in real warfare  senator lamar alexander  republican of tennessee  said on friday .
washington  the senate is poised as early as tuesday to act on a trump backed measure to end the partial government shutdown  but a bill promoted as a compromise to pair the presidents wall with legal protections for some immigrants would also severely restrict migrants ability to claim asylum  drawing fierce opposition from immigrant rights groups senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  is planning on tuesday to put the measure on the senates agenda  setting up a likely vote on thursday  absent any agreement from democrats to act on it sooner  but its prospects in the senate are dim  and with the shutdown now in its fifth week  800 000 federal workers are almost certain to miss their second paycheck on friday the 1 031 page bill  made public on monday evening by the senate appropriations committee  would fund shuttered federal agencies through the end of the fiscal year  it includes  5 7 billion for the border wall that mr  trump has proposed and large increases for detention of and removal of immigrants  as well as three year provisional protections for 700 000 of the young undocumented immigrants known as dreamers  and 300 000 immigrants mostly from latin american countries who have been living in the united states under temporary protected status but while republicans say the protections are drawn from the bridge act  a bipartisan measure  that bill would in fact protect hundreds of thousands more dreamers  who were brought to the united states illegally as children  the republican proposal would shield only those who applied for and received work permits under deferred action for childhood arrivals  or daca  created by president barack obama  which mr  trump rescinded in 2017  senate leaders have reached a deal that can end the government shutdown by the weekend  federal court decisions have kept daca in place  and on tuesday  the supreme court again declined the trump administrations request to review the legality of the program  almost certainly keeping it in place for the rest of the year  that decision by the court significantly devalued mr  trumps overture to democrats resisting wall funding the new senate measure also includes several provisions that are meant to make it more difficult for migrants to claim asylum in the united states  a legal process that allows people fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries to seek refuge  the changes have been top priorities of stephen miller  the conservative white house aide who crafted much of mr  trumps immigration agenda it would bar central american children from seeking asylum in the united states  instead requiring them to apply in their own countries  in what the legislation describes as a program that reduces the incentive for such persons to make the dangerous journey to the united states southern border to request asylum but democrats and immigrants rights advocates denounce the plan as cruel  while the obama administration created a similar program to expedite the claims of central american children seeking asylum  it never moved to block such minors from applying inside the united states these are children who are often desperately fleeing terrible violence back home  said representative diana degette  democrat of colorado  they are literally running for their lives and asking for our country to help  instead of offering them help  this proposal would require border officials to turn a deaf ear to their desperate pleas and send these kids back to the very places they just risked their lives to escape a separate provision would allow immigration authorities to quickly remove central american minors seeking asylum in the united states  a change to an anti child trafficking statute that some scholars said would violate international law in effect  we are looking at the rapid expulsion of these children  said greg chen of the american immigration lawyers association  the effect of the law will be to send people back into harms way  which would be a violation of international law the measure also adds a high bar for asylum claims across the board  mandating that they be deemed in the national interest  it would introduce a host of new grounds for deeming an asylum claim frivolous  including if the migrant seeking protection was also trying to obtain work authorization  had used a fraudulent document  knowingly or unknowingly  or did not file in a timely way republicans are arguing that the bill would do precisely what democrats have been demanding  reopen the federal government immediately  as an added sweetener to democrats  the measure also includes  12 7 billion for disaster relief  and would renew the violence against women act  which authorizes and funds services for victims of domestic violence  and expired at the end of last year but the senate math does not work in mr  mcconnells favor  he would need seven democrats to join with all 53 republicans for the measure to pass  but there are no more than a handful of democrats in republican leaning states  senators kyrsten sinema of arizona  doug jones of alabama and joe manchin iii of west virginia  who might vote in favor a spokesman for mr  manchin said the senator would remain undecided until he saw the text of the measure  ms  sinema and mr  jones have not announced their intentions house democrats are also planning this week to bring up a package of legislation to reopen the government and provide some funding for border related operations  including infrastructure improvements at ports of entry and immigration judges  they are still weighing whether to bring up their own border security proposal as part of a measure to fund the department of homeland security  but given that none of their plans include money for a wall  mr  mcconnell has said he will not bring them up in the senate .
washington  as the partial government shutdown took hold over the holidays  president trump seemed to express wonder at being alone in the white house with little but the cheeriness of heavily armed guards to keep him warm for the better part of a week i was waving to them  mr  trump said just after new years day  i never saw so many guys with machine guns in my life  secret service and military  these are great people mr  trumps home alone like christmas tale has hardened into a 20 day standoff as relations between his administration and congress over his  5 billion demand for a border wall grow ever frostier  the white house has stopped paying its water bill  desks of some furloughed employees  whose job can include such drudgeries as helping their bosses work the copy machine  sit empty in the west wing and the secret service agents mr  trump was so impressed with  down to the officers who check ids and wave black suvs in and out of the gates surrounding the complex  are all working unpaid  everyone in the secret service is  according to an official at the agency however  the agency said  those employees who are performing emergency work involving the safety of human life or the protection of property  the majority of the secret service work force  must continue to report to work with paychecks failing to fatten the bank accounts of some 800 000 federal workers  the pain of this partial shutdown bit into all corners of america  even the white house  where there is often very little sympathy for those whose job it is to keep washington running  only 156 of the executive mansions 359 full time employees are allowed to report for duty because their work is considered essential  according to a government contingency plan but multiple administration officials have stressed this week that despite the shutdown  it is still business as usual  the janitors are emptying the trash and vacuuming offices  the navy run white house mess is still serving food  this week  chicken and dumpling soup was on the menu  after leaner offerings including fruit  nuts and other snacks were presented last week on an abbreviated schedule because of the new year still  while trump administration officials emphasize the normality  others who have endured lengthy shutdowns warned of the broader effects on the white house staff  including an inevitable slowdown in accomplishing important policy decisions with fewer workers i dont think people appreciate how isolated you feel  jennifer palmieri  a former communications director for president barack obama and a former aide in the clinton white house  which owns the current record  21 days  for a shutdown  an unfortunate benchmark mr  trump is poised to pass if the impasse continues ms  palmieri said the two shutdowns she experienced were distinct in my mind as extraordinary moments because there are so few people around and because the stakes are so high during a shutdown during the obama administration in 2013  ms  palmieri recalls that she and other workers were forced to bring in their own food  feed the occasional hungry reporter with instant macaroni and cheese fished out of desk drawers  and cart out their own trash emptying her own trash was not her biggest concern you can get caught up in winning this fight to the detriment of a lot of other policy  ms  palmieri said  and also your own political capital for the long term bracing for a fight has not always appeared to be a particular concern for aides in this white house  which tends to function in a state of personnel flux and operates with a trench warfare mentality in the best of times at the center of the operation  after all  is a commander in chief who emphasizes the importance of never backing down  and mr  trump  who is said to be exploring ways to circumvent the need for congress to provide money by declaring a national emergency  has given every indication that he doesnt care how long this fight goes on but some of the presidents furloughed aides are among those who are not able to communicate with others using work phones or email  or seek outside income  rules that have spanned administrations  it all sounds familiar to cody keenan  a former speechwriter for mr  obama  mr  keenan recalled that he was able to continue commuting to his west wing office during the shutdown in 2013  but many other staff members  including fellow speechwriters  most of whom were stationed in the adjacent eisenhower executive office building  could not our teams were hit really hard  mr  keenan said in an email  my speechwriters were furloughed  and we were legally barred from contacting each other until the shutdown ended  not being paid was especially hard on younger staff who didnt have any savings yet  but theres nothing you can do federal employees are counting on getting back their lost pay at some point  but contracted workers could face a different outcome  a spokeswoman for the general services administration said that facility managers  considered federal employees  and many contracted janitors and maintenance workers in some offices are still working  but was not able to say whether the contractors would eventually receive their pay if they are contractors  said amanda osborn  a spokesman for the agency  their pay is determined by the status of their contract besides the issue of paying workers  other practical matters at the white house have been left unattended for now days after the shutdown took hold  representatives from the treasury department left notice with dc water  the washington water utility  that the federal governments  16 5 million quarterly water bill would not be fully paid  leading to a lively discussion among the dc water board about at what point a clients water could be cut off  according to a report from the news website wamu it turns out the board will let this one slide we are not turning off water to the white house  vincent morris  a dc water spokesman  said in an email  the outstanding tab   5 million lengthy shutdowns can be disastrous for the white house for other reasons the last time a shutdown went on for this long  president bill clinton put himself on the long road to impeachment when he approached a young intern named monica lewinsky in an empty corner of the west wing  nonessential employees had been sent home  unpaid interns were brought in to work  and the rest is bitter history the obama administration barred interns from coming to work during a shutdown  and the trump white houses new class of interns has not yet started  according to a senior official  its a smart move not to allow them in  leon e  panetta  mr  clintons former chief of staff during the shutdown  said in an interview  on thursday  as the most recent shutdown approached the 21 day mark  mr  trump was grudgingly coaxed from the white house  he took a handful of people still working in the white house with him aboard air force one to texas  where he met with border security officials and people whose lives had been affected by the scourge of illegal immigration  not a nagging shutdown at least seven senior aides were aboard the flight  including jared kushner  mr  trumps son in law and senior adviser  sarah huckabee sanders  his press secretary  bill shine  his deputy chief of staff for communications  mick mulvaney  his acting chief of staff  and stephen miller  a senior white house adviser and architect of the administrations zero tolerance immigration policies some may have seen it as a way for the president to break out of his self imposed shutdown isolation and learn about its effect on legions of federal workers  some of whom are back home  standing sentry on his front lawn  but mr  panetta warned that it might have had another effect the primary danger is that the president feels that somehow whatever hes doing hes winning  mr  panetta said  and tries to tell himself that its the other side thats going to break first .
mcallen  tex   it was dark in the stash house where they kept her  the windows covered so no one could see inside  at first  the smugglers had her cook for the other migrants who had recently crossed illegally into the united states  then they took her to a room upstairs  locked the door and began taking turns with her it was the summer of 2014  and melvin  a 36 year old mother of three  had just completed the journey from her native guatemala  crossing the rio grande on a raft before being led to the house in the texas border city of mcallen for weeks in that locked room  the men she had paid to get her safely to the united states drugged her with pills and cocaine  refusing to let her out even to bathe  i think that since they put me in that room  they killed me  she said  they raped us so many times they didnt see us as human beings anymore on americas southern border  migrant women and girls are the victims of sexual assaults that most often go unreported  uninvestigated and unprosecuted  even as women around the world are speaking out against sexual misconduct  migrant women on the border live in the shadows of the  metoo movement  read  in a border courtroom  a migrant woman confronts her biggest fear the stories are many  and yet all too similar  undocumented women making their way into american border towns have been beaten for disobeying smugglers  impregnated by strangers  coerced into prostitution  shackled to beds and trees and  in at least a handful of cases  bound with duct tape  rope or handcuffs the new york times found dozens of documented cases through interviews with law enforcement officials  prosecutors  federal judges and immigrant advocates around the country  and a review of police reports and court records in texas  new mexico  arizona and california  the review showed more than 100 documented reports of sexual assault of undocumented women along the border in the past two decades  a number that most likely only skims the surface  law enforcement officials and advocates say in addition  interviews with migrant women and those working with them along the border point to large numbers of cases that are either unreported or unexamined  suggesting that sexual violence has become an inescapable part of the collective migrant journey  read the newsletter  yes  there was duct tape  the harrowing journeys of migrants across the border  sign up for crossing the border here president trump has used the threat faced by migrant women to make his case for a border wall  one in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through mexico  he said in january  an estimate that appears to have originated from some limited surveys  one of them by doctors without borders  of women traveling through mexico but less understood is that the violence that befalls migrant women happens not just during the perilous journey through mexico  much of it happens after women reach the supposed safety of the united states in july  a 23 year old honduran woman told the authorities that she was sexually assaulted in a bedroom closet by a smuggler who had helped her and her sister cross into the south texas city of mission  the following month  a sheriffs deputy in san antonio was charged with sexually assaulting the 4 year old daughter of an undocumented guatemalan woman and threatening to have her deported if she reported the abuse  in 2017  a guide leading a group of migrants through the tohono oodham nations reservation in arizona raped a woman from el salvador twice during a seven day desert hike  threatening to leave her stranded if she resisted  i hope i leave you pregnant so you have one of my kids  he said  the woman told the authorities in 2016  a migrant woman fled a stash house in the south texas city of edinburg  where she said she had been raped by a smuggler who brandished a machete  in west texas that same year  two teenage girls reported that they had been sexually assaulted by a customs and border protection officer  who they said forced them to strip  fondled them  then tried to get them to stop crying by offering chocolates  potato chips and a blanket  in an unusual turn  the girls filed legal claims against the federal government  which settled the case in 2018 for  125 000 at least five of the women who were assaulted  in one case  bound with duct tape  raped and stabbed  were attacked not by migrant smugglers  who are often the perpetrators  but by on duty border patrol agents and customs officers experts say the actual number of sexual assaults is almost certainly much higher than those documented by prosecutors and the police  because most attacks are never reported  and such attacks dont end at the border  women have reported being assaulted in immigration detention facilities  and the federal government over a recent four year period has received more than 4 500 complaints about the sexual abuse of immigrant children at government funded detention facilities the times interviewed eight migrant women from central america who were sexually assaulted between 2013 and 2016  women still struggling with nightmares  depression and in some cases  thoughts of suicide  one reported that she was attacked in mexico  six said they were assaulted in south texas  one said she was attacked in both mexico and south texas  the oldest victims were in their early 40s when they were attacked  the two youngest were 14 most of their attackers were never prosecuted or identified  and the times was not able to independently verify the womens accounts  but all eight women either gave sworn testimony or submitted statements under penalty of perjury to the federal government in order to qualify for visas  and cooperated with the police in the investigation of their cases they described a netherworld of fear that coexists with the bustling life of american cities up and down the border  one woman told of being held prisoner in a house that had been turned into a makeshift brothel in mcallen  a city of 143 000 in the rio grande valley  nueva carne  new meat  the smugglers said as she and other migrant women were led into the house  said the woman  lucy  45  a migrant from honduras who  like others interviewed  did not want her last name used she said a series of men came into the house over the next several days and raped her  because i didnt want to let them  they tied my feet together and my hands behind my back  lucy said gladys  45  a mother of four from guatemala  said she was kidnapped by armed smugglers after crossing the border and jumped out of a car to escape  but was captured again  for days  she was held prisoner at a stash house in mcallen and forced to have sex with six men  i thought it would be better if i died when i fell from the car  she said law enforcement officials on the border said they had made arrests in many of the cases brought to them and would pursue more if they could  but the majority of women who have been assaulted do not report it  often because their attackers threaten to expose their immigration status  or worse  if they do  one woman  raped repeatedly at gunpoint in a stash house in phoenix in 2005  said her attacker threatened to sell her 3 year old daughter if she reported him  those who do go to the authorities may not know the names of their attackers  or even where the assault occurred  smugglers make sure their clients are unsure of their whereabouts  if they are detained by border patrol  they wont be able to pinpoint where they were held  read  open wounds  head injuries  fever  ailing migrants suffer at the border the women are powerless by almost any measure  most of the eight interviewed now live in the united states after receiving the victim related visas  they work in stores  restaurants and factories  most barely making a living  their english is limited  many of them have not even told their families what happened they dont have many defenses  said jesus r  romo vejar  an arizona lawyer who has represented many migrant women victimized by sexual assault  undocumented women and children are the most unprotected of human beings here are some of their stories lucy  45  was raped while being forced to work at makeshift brothels  first in mexico and then in mcallen  when we got to the house  there were many women  it was a big house  i couldnt see everybodys face  but there were different women in different rooms for prostitution  i wanted to flee but i was afraid they were going to kill me  they just told us  you guys dont have money  so you have to pay with your body when we crossed the river  there was a man waiting  a white guy with tattoos  he was in a truck  we got into the truck  he brought us into a house in mcallen  when we got there  the guy started talking and he said that i was new meat when they wanted to have sex with me they had to tie me up because i wasnt cooperative  they tied my feet together and my hands behind my back and then theyd have sex with me from behind before  i could not talk about this  i would have panic  really serious panic  i didnt want to leave the house  i didnt want to talk to anybody  i thought that everyone in the world saw me as a prostitute  i come from a poor family but a very decent family it has affected me  yes  but not anymore  im kind of enraged  those guys have mothers and daughters  what they did to us is what they did to women melvin  36  was raped and forced into prostitution in a locked room at a stash house in mcallen i lost count of how long i was there for  it wasnt me anymore  i think that since they put me in that room  they killed me  they have no mercy  they dont care that youre a mother  that you have family  they see someone who doesnt matter to them and i still remember while i was with them there  it was my birthday  and i didnt want to  not that day  and i remember that he grabbed me and at one point bit me  and when i arrived at the detention center  i still had the bite marks  i told them that it was my birthday  and according to them  the rape that day was for my birthday i tried to commit suicide three times  because you cant live with all of that  and every time i closed my eyes  the men would appear  youd shower  youd close your eyes  they were there  i didnt want to live with that in my head anymore  but here i am j e   19  and two other migrants were kidnapped in south texas by a border patrol agent  esteban manzanares  when j e  was 14  he raped her in his apartment in mission  tex   and later committed suicide he took me and tied me up to a tree  he said he would come back  i was thinking about my little brother  whos in honduras  and id never see him again  he was about 10  i think  it was hours he undid me from the tree and put me in the car  in the apartment  there were two beds on top of the other  childrens bunk beds  and ropes there  too  they were shoelaces  for my wrists and my feet my mind was blank  i was trying to understand everything  i didnt know what to do  my feet were tied up  i would look at him and he had a gun  and that frightened me  i asked him why  and he answered me that he was doing this to me because i was the prettiest one of the three there are people who sort of discard you when they know what happened to you  but the majority of my girlfriends do know so they can understand what i went through  and they support me v e m l   39  was raped in the south texas brush by a smuggling guide  she was apprehended  detained at the hutto detention center in taylor  tex   and later deported i knew that they were the ones who were going to take me across  so i knew that i had to stay with them  i never learned his name  i felt nervous about him  he was very strange  i wasnt sure if he was on drugs  he always stood up and sat down  and stood up and sat down the older one walked ahead  the younger one said  come with me i said  where are we going  and he said  were going to catch up with them ahead he bit my mouth so i could not cry out  i was scared that it might occur to him to kill me afterwards  he told me to hurry up or he would leave me there on the ground  the guys in the group start saying  immigration  immigration  i ran toward immigration  i wanted to get away  but then when they took me and put me in the car  i felt frustrated and alone  i just felt like i couldnt stop crying  they were all men agents  they kept asking me why i was crying and i couldnt explain when they brought me to laredo  i told a doctor what happened  he said  dont feel like youre the only one that this happened to  this has happened to many other women cindy  26  and her son samuel stayed at a stash house in mexico while waiting to cross the border  she and another woman were raped by a smuggler  and she learned after being apprehended by border patrol that she was pregnant  samuel is now 8  his little brother  to whom cindy gave the biblical name of adonai  is 2 when he entered the room  he had the gun  he took the children out  he had the gun and he pointed the gun at my head when he was attacking us  first he abused me and then he abused her  were in his power and we feel like were disposable  we cant do anything because its like they tell us  they can kill us and nobody will say anything it wasnt until that test that i knew i was pregnant  in that moment  it was like i had been marked  i had been marked because of what had happened to me  that violation i wanted to kill myself  going to the psychologist  thats what helped me heal  she told me that we had to talk about it  we had to think about it  and we had to learn to live with our lives moving forward  even with what happened my son  i realized he was an innocent bystander in this situation and that it wasnt his fault  my motivation to keep going in life are my two kids  i thank god because everything that i suffered  theyre the happiness that came out of that .
washington  along the 2 000 mile border with mexico  which sprawls across four states and nine house districts  a single seat is held by a republican  representative will hurd of texas and mr  hurd  a former undercover c i a  officer who barely won re election in texas 23rd district  the largest of the nine  has emerged as perhaps the most persistent critic in his party of president trumps wall drawing upon his years undercover and his work in the private sector  mr  hurd has a starkly different vision for the southwestern border  fiber optic cables  sensors  radar  drones  increased staffing  but not the concrete or steel barrier that mr  trump has demanded before he reopens the government he has joined democrats eight times this month to vote to reopen the government  without wall funding nobody likes being the cheese thats standing alone  mr  hurd said in an interview with the daily  the new york timess podcast  i have a unique perspective because i have so much border  because i have an entire career dealing with these issues  that is more important than any kind of political calculation my specific role has always been to articulate the problems to a level of specificity that people can understand and then give the on the ground perspective and experience on what the solutions can be  he added specificity  in this case  lies in the architecture of what mr  hurd describes as a smart wall  a wish list of technology and upgrades that would protect more than 800 miles of the southwestern border that demarcates the southern side of his district  he would dispense with the concrete wall or steel slats that mr  trump has advocated in raucous rallies  in favor of more advanced measures  including a fiber optic cable from sea to shining sea lets make sure were using the right tool in the right place  mr  hurd said  we should be thinking about all these different technologies and how they should be used  and when i describe this  nobody disagrees he added  a wall from sea to shining sea is the most expensive and least effective way to do border security he is not  as his staff readily acknowledges  inclined to broadcast his perspective or obsessively rope in votes for his cause  he has not sought opportunities to directly lobby the president to endorse the technological barriers he has envisioned   mr  hurd noted that the key players are all cognizant of his position  instead  he is content to remain on the periphery of the house republican conference  educating his colleagues  extending invitations to visit the border and voting the way he believes the majority of his constituents want him to  that is what resonates in a district that encompasses a large population of cybersecurity professionals  parts of san antonio and rural areas  and has flipped five times between the two parties since the early 1990s my boss is not the president  mr  hurd said  my boss is not the speaker  my boss is not the minority leader  my bosses are those 800 000 people that i represented and sent me up here aides say he often requests analysis of his personal outreach  including social media data and telephone town halls  that quantify who is following his work and their responses  metrics that inform his support of legislation on capitol hill  regardless of the party line or pressure from the presidential twitter feed you cant take a vocal minority as an indication of the epicenter of where people feel  mr  hurd said  the mix of republicans and democrats in his district  he said  believe that we should be able to secure our borders  and they think thats a mix of tools that is necessary to do that his ability to deftly navigate the electoral perils of his district and retain a place on capitol hill has surprised both his party allies and his opponents across the aisle  his margin of victory in november was so slim  a little over 1 100 votes  that mr  hurds democratic opponent attended new member orientation before conceding to mr  hurd i dont know what it is  but it is clearly working for him  said colin strother  a democratic strategist in texas  he added  im sure among republicans  there are people who arent happy that hes not on board conservatives acknowledge that mr  hurd is an asset to their conference  he has secured a temperamental electorate for now  and his intelligence  experience and status as the lone black republican in the house chamber make him invaluable he just approaches it differently than most members  said matt mackowiak  a veteran republican strategist in texas  hes also given the benefit of the doubt because of how difficult that district is regardless of ideological differences  most republicans express respect for mr  hurds knowledge  work ethic and dedication to the people he represents  in an announcement naming mr  hurd as a new member of the influential house appropriations committee  representative kevin mccarthy  republican of california and the minority leader  hailed him as one of the most innovative and entrepreneurial members in congress  democratic colleagues hear a border security solution that resonates with their own border constituents he knows what hes talking about  said representative juan c  vargas  a democrat whose district traverses the california mexico border  he hangs on because hes smart and knows security representative pete aguilar  democrat of california  first reached out to mr  hurd to collaborate on legislation last year that would have secured a path to citizenship for so called dreamers  young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children  while enhancing border security  the two men now text with each other so frequently that mr  aguilar jokes that his wife is a little jealous of their friendship even members of democratic leadership really respect how supportive he is in finding a solution on this issue  mr  aguilar said its not lost on anyone on our side of the aisle  he added  about how mr  hurd has crossed party lines to support bipartisan ideas on immigration and rebuff the presidents demands for a wall at the border .

washington used to know how to have a serious debate about border security republicans demanded more money for border patrol agents and necessary fences  democrats argued for better surveillance technology and more resources at the ports of entry  the two parties squabbled over how much to spend  how to pay for it and how it all fit into the broader struggle to overhaul the nations broken immigration system but president trump has demolished the decades old  bipartisan understanding about how to bargain over the border  in mr  trumps world  there are no alternatives that can form the basis of a legislative give and take  much as his allies and adversaries might hope for them  for the president  the only way to stop what he calls an onslaught of illegal immigrants is to erect a massive  concrete or steel barrier across the nearly 2 000 mile border with mexico drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun  but it is only a good old fashioned wall that works  he tweeted last month by conjuring images of a towering stone edifice around a medieval fortress  and branding those on the outside as invaders threatening to bring crime  drugs and disease to the united states  mr  trump has transformed what used to be a complicated  nuanced negotiation into a take it or leave it demand  laced with xenophobia  that has shuttered nearly a quarter of the government for weeks he turns a debate that is fundamentally about more or less  measured in dollars  and makes it a debate that is wall or not  said frank sharry  a pro immigration activist who has battled over border security for decades in the nations capital  its become cartoonish for decades  immigration has been an emotional and bitterly fought battle in washington and around the country  but even so  there has been a consensus among most republicans and democrats that securing the southern border requires a mix of costly strategies  that included a large number of border patrol agents posted at key points along the vast stretch of land from san diego to brownsville  tex   fences in urban areas and barriers to stop vehicles from crossing and high tech surveillance gear to alert the border agents to the presence of migrants and drugs until mr  trump was elected  the sticking points had largely been about other parts of the broader immigration debate  cracking down on people who stay longer than their visas allow  preventing companies from hiring illegal immigrants  expanding opportunities for legal immigration  and providing status to those already in the country illegally  including immigrants brought to the united states as children such a comprehensive deal is completely out of reach now  but mr  trumps behavior during the past several weeks suggests that even reaching a smaller  more targeted agreement on security arrangements at the border is more elusive than ever before the current government shutdown  which began just before christmas  is now the longest one ever in united states history  in the 22 days since the government shut down  there have been virtually no negotiations by congressional lawmakers or the white house  there have been no marathon  pizza fueled sessions in back rooms at the capitol  lawmakers have not traded detailed proposals with each other  mr  trump refused to give an inch in his oval office speech  and has spent more time in an extended photo op at the border than he has at the negotiating table it has all left veterans of past border debates exasperated and frustrated we know how to secure borders  said alex conant  a republican strategist who was a top aide to senator marco rubio in 2013 when the republican senator from florida helped lead the last major  bipartisan effort to overhaul immigration  the 2013 immigration plan had what everybody agreed was the most effective way possible to secure borders and other points of entry with the backing of president barack obama  a bipartisan group of eight senators that year succeeded in passing a comprehensive overhaul of the nations immigration system  but the legislation  which passed with 68 votes  prompted fierce opposition from conservative republicans  who condemned it as amnesty for 11 million undocumented immigrants  it was never brought up for a vote in the house still  the senate legislation was an indication of where the two parties could agree on border security  it doubled the number of border patrol agents  from 19 000 to almost 40 000  an increase that even the authors of the proposal agreed was overkill but was designed mostly as an enticement to win republican support senators from both parties also agreed on money for technological improvements along the border  the bill allocated  3 2 billion for drones  infrared ground sensors and long range thermal imaging cameras to give border patrol agents advance notice when migrants cross illegally  especially at night  it also included money for an electronic employment verification system for all employers and upgrades at airports to catch immigrants who overstay their visas and the consensus included some physical barriers  what mr  trump might call walls and others would call fencing  years earlier  the secure fence act of 2006 allocated money to build about 650 miles of barriers along the border  the 2013 bill  had it been signed into law  would have increased that total to almost 700 miles  mostly along the eastern half of the border with mexico almost all of the fencing that congress has approved has already been built  in populated areas  the fence is tall and steel or chain link and designed to keep people out  in other places  the barrier is nothing more than short  metal poles spaced out to keep vehicles from driving through  or low  wooden fences that run alongside pedestrian paths in 2011  a government accountability office report concluded that despite 649 miles of completed fencing  the the southwest border continues to be vulnerable to cross border illegal activity  including the smuggling of humans and illegal narcotics the report recognized that barriers have mostly not been built in the vast  empty stretches in texas  where rivers and mountains as natural borders have prevented cars from crossing into the united states and made the trek by foot difficult  if not impossible  but mr  trump seizes on conclusions like the g a o  reports about the continued influx of illegal immigrants at the southern border as proof that he is right in demanding a continuous wall in remarks to reporters after a meeting with democrats at the white house earlier this month  mr  trump insisted that the only way to prevent immigrants from crossing between the 25 official ports of entry is to erect fences everywhere else we cant let gaps  because if you have gaps  those people are going to turn their vehicles  or the gangs  theyre going to coming in through those gaps  the president said  and we cannot let that happen but there continue to be questions about the wisdom of building a wall from sea to shining sea  even from inside mr  trumps administration a different g a o  report  released last year  examined the preliminary cost estimates by customs and border protection of what it would cost to extend the wall along the entire border  the report criticized the border agency  saying that the cost estimates did not take into account that costs would vary depending on the kind of terrain where they were built in recent days  the rhetoric between the two sides has become more strident than ever  mr  trump and his republican allies have pointed out that democrats supported fencing in the past  though they purposefully ignore the context of those votes and the difference between the fencing that democrats supported and the all or nothing wall that the president has demanded speaker nancy pelosi of california has called the wall immoral  cementing her position against it at this

update  steve king was removed from his committee assignments over the comments made in this article  years before president trump forced a government shutdown over a border wall  triggering a momentous test of wills in washington  representative steve king of iowa took to the house floor to show off a model of a 12 foot border wall he had designed and long before mr  trump demonized immigrants  accusing mexico of exporting criminals and calling for an end to birthright citizenship  mr  king turned those views into talking points  with his use of misleading data about victims of undocumented immigrants and demeaning remarks about latinos immigration is mr  trumps go to issue  his surest connection to his most faithful supporters  and his prime time address on tuesday night underscored his willingness to use fear and misleading statements  to appeal to voters  just as he did with warnings about a migrant caravan before the midterm elections the republican party hadnt always intended to go this route  officials tried for years to come up with broad based immigration reform that would appeal to growing numbers of latino voters  but mr  trumps preoccupation with the wall and anti immigrant politics reflects how he has embraced the once fringe views of mr  king  who has used racist language in the past  promotes neo nazis on twitter and was recently denounced by one republican leader as a white supremacist with the federal government in a third week of paralysis over a border wall  mr  trumps positions are a reminder of how mr  kings ideology and his language maligning undocumented residents helped shape the republican message in 2016 and 2018 and define mr  trumps agenda and prospects for re election  mr  king may have been ostracized by some republicans over his racist remarks and extremist ties  but as much of the nation debates immigration  his views now carry substantial influence on the right early in mr  trumps term  the president invited mr  king  who was long snubbed by establishment republicans like the former house speaker john a  boehner  to the oval office  there  the president boasted of having raised more money for the congressmans campaigns than anyone else  including during a 2014 iowa visit  mr  king recalled in an interview with the times yes  mr  president  mr  king replied  but i market tested your immigration policy for 14 years  and that ought to be worth something mr  king  a 69 year old former bulldozer operator with a combative manner  who has been elected nine times  helped write the book on white identity politics that are ascendant in mr  trumps republican party  that provides both a template for mr  trump and a warning mr  kings full throated embrace of nativism has long found a supportive constituency in the rural midwest  the region that was a key to mr  trumps 2016 victory and represents his most likely path to re election but at the same time  mr  kings margin of victory in 2018 shrank to its narrowest in 16 years  he made national headlines for endorsing a toronto mayoral candidate with neo nazi ties and for meeting with a far right austrian party accused of trivializing the holocaust  on twitter  he follows an australian anti semitic activist  who proposed hanging a portrait of hitler in every classroom  and in october  the chairman of the republican house elections committee  representative steve stivers of ohio  condemned mr  king  saying  we must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms  mr  king lost corporate agriculture donors like purina  land olakes and smithfield  he dropped from an 18 point lead over his democratic opponent in his internal polls to barely squeaking out a three point win on election day  on wednesday  mr  king drew a formidable challenger for his fourth district seat in the 2020 republican primary  randy feenstra  an assistant majority leader in the state senate  who said mr  king had left iowa without a seat at the table because of sideshows and distractions mr  king  in the interview  said he was not a racist  he pointed to his twitter timeline showing him greeting iowans of all races and religions in his washington office   the same office once displayed a confederate flag on his desk  at the same time  he said  he supports immigrants who enter the country legally and fully assimilate because what matters more than race is the culture of america based on values brought to the united states by whites from europe white nationalist  white supremacist  western civilization  how did that language become offensive  mr  king said  why did i sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization after this article was published thursday  mr  king issued a public statement calling himself a nationalist and defending his support of western civilizations values  and said he was not an advocate for white nationalism and white supremacy  i want to make one thing abundantly clear  i reject those labels and the evil ideology they define  he wrote mr  kings influence over national politics derives from his representation of the reddest district in the first presidential nominating state  nearly all the 2016 republican presidential contenders sought his blessing at a forum he hosted in des moines in january 2015  mr  trump included donald trump came to iowa as a real nonideological candidate  mr  king recalled  mr  trumps first hire in iowa  chuck laudner  was a former chief of staff to mr  king  mr  trumps first iowa rally directly followed a visit to the mexican border the previous year  mr  trump had visited to endorse mr  kings re election  as the congressman warned of scenarios like islamic state terrorists or even africans with ebola illegally entering the country  mr  trump listened and nodded  when he stepped to the microphone  he echoed mr  king well  border security is a very big issue  he said  people are just flooding across tom tancredo  a former colorado congressman who once held the most conservative views in official washington on immigration  calling for a moratorium on even legal immigrants  said he handed the baton to steve king when he left the house in 2008 david johnson  a former republican state senator from mr  kings district  said he heard in the presidents rhetoric a direct echo of mr  king  they belong to the same subset of white nationalists who are afraid of how the country is changing  he said mr  king was born in storm lake  iowa  and attended high school in nearby denison  then a nearly all white rural farming region  where his father managed a state police radio station after founding an earth moving company  mr  king ran successfully for the state senate in 1996  his most notable legacy from six years in the legislature was a law making english the official state language  it was a time when packinghouses and other agricultural employers had dropped wages  and latino migrants increasingly were taking jobs that no longer attracted native born iowans elected to congress in 2002  mr  king attracted the attention of hate watch groups like the anti defamation league as he spoke increasingly about preserving western culture or western civilization  the groups consider those buzzwords that signal support to white nationalists  along with an obsession with birthrates and abortion rates among different ethnic groups he uses the concepts of either culture or civilization to obfuscate that hes talking about whiteness and race  said lawrence rosenthal  chairman of the berkeley center for right wing studies in 2011  mr  king objected to the affordable care acts mandate to cover contraception  thats not constructive to our culture and our civilization  he said in a speech in the house  if we let our birthrate get down below the replacement rate  were a dying civilization mr  king seems further emboldened during the trump presidency in an interview in august with a far right web publication in austria  mr  king displayed a deep familiarity with racist tracts and ideas embraced by white supremacists he spoke of the great replacement  a conspiracy theory on the far right that claims shadowy elites are working behind the scenes to reduce white populations to minorities in their own countries great replacement  yes  mr  king said in the interview  these people walking into europe by ethnic migration  80 percent are young men the accusation that a great replacement of whites is underway  which conspiracy theorists often link to prominent jews like george soros  animated the torch carrying white nationalists in charlottesville  va   in 2017  who chanted  you will not replace us and jews will not replace us mr  trumps refusal to condemn the marchers  and his insistence that there were very fine people on both sides  was cheered by neo nazi websites in mr  kings interview with the austrian website  he repeated his yearslong critique of multiculturalism what does this diversity bring that we dont already have  mexican food  chinese food  he said  those things  well  thats fine  but what does it bring that we dont have that is worth the price in recent years  mr  king has forged alliances with far right european leaders  including marine le pen of france and geert wilders of the netherlands  one of the most anti muslim politicians in europe  who calls for closing mosques ahead of dutch elections in march 2017  mr  king endorsed mr  wilders in a tweet  saying  we cant restore our civilization with somebody elses babies amid an ensuing controversy  he claimed the tweet wasnt about race  virulent white supremacists  however  heard otherwise steve king is basically an open white nationalist at this point  wrote andrew anglin  the founder of the neo nazi daily stormer mr  anglin and others celebrated that mr  trumps election had made once fringe beliefs about ethnonationalism acceptable to mainstream politicians as republicans have morphed from the party of george w  bush  who sought legal status for 12 million undocumented immigrants  to the party of mr  trump and mr  king  some party leaders fear for the future in a nation where hispanic voters are a rapidly growing electorate great damage has been done  said carlos curbelo  a moderate republican who lost a south florida congressional seat in the midterms  for anyone who cares about having a small government  free enterprise party in america that can aspire to win national elections  its a real concern mr  curbelo  who tried to forge compromise on immigration in the house last year  said mr  trump told him privately  including on air force one  that he wanted a deal with democrats but the president is paralyzed by the far right  mr  curbelo said  hes terrified of losing his base and the so called conservative media last week  as the new congress was sworn in  mr  king sat on his side of a chamber sharply delineated by demographics  the democratic majority included record numbers of african americans and women  including the first native american and the first muslim women  mr  kings side was mostly people who look like him you could look over there and think the democratic party is no country for white men  he said .
mcallen  tex   president trump was briefed near a county park on the rio grande on thursday on the perils of drugs and violence seeping across the mexican border  but the river he visited has seen its share of both treachery and normalcy just a few months earlier  a short walk from the spot where mr  trump stood  two retired border patrol agents had set off from the park in their boat  they were testing a new engine in anticipation of a fishing trip  they cracked open some bud lights  but the engine died while they were on the water  and on duty border patrol agents  old friends of the guys in the boat  sped out on the river to give them a tow there were no migrants apprehended  no heroin seizures  it was just one ordinary  leisurely moment on a border that hums with a continuing stream of migrants  and the easy rhythms of day to day life  amid a swirling national controversy over proposals to extend a massive wall along its banks the border depicted by the president and the one lived by most mcallen area residents are two very different places  the collision between the borders reality and how it is being portrayed for those thousands of miles away came sharply into focus on thursday during mr  trumps trip to mcallen  where he met with local  state and federal officials amid protests and counterprotests mr  trump carried his message of border security to a majority hispanic city of 142 000 that has been on the front lines of the surge in central american families coming into the united states preliminary plans are underway to expand some border fencing in parts of the rio grande valley  but mcallen has a well honed infrastructure to handle migrants  both legal and illegal  many here have been frustrated that the city has become the symbol of a faraway political debate so entrenched it has shut down parts of the federal government on the one hand  i dont like my city being portrayed as if theres a crisis and unrest  when the reality is were one of the safest cities in the u s   said monica stewart  a longtime resident and small business owner who has advised lawmakers on border security and international trade issues ms  stewart does not believe the border wall mr  trump wants to build is necessary  and said there were better ways to improve border security using technology mcallen  which was named for the family that settled in the area in the early 1900s  is a largely blue city  with scores of hispanic democrats who help run its municipal agencies  courts  schools and businesses  many of them were critical thursday of the presidents visit and said they believed he had manufactured a border crisis to sell his plan for a wall but mcallen and the larger rio grande valley region are also home to small but vocal numbers of hispanic conservatives  many are from middle class mexican american families who have lived in the area for generations and do not identify with the central american migrants fleeing poverty and violence like much else about life on the border  mcallen is never quite what people imagine it to be one of the most frequent places to run into border patrol agents in mcallen is not on the border itself but at wingstop or buffalo wings   rings  mcallen has synagogues and country clubs  its biggest employer is the local school district and community college  its tallest building is the 17 story chase tower  home to real estate developers and senator ted cruzs district office and its politics are far from predictable as the president traveled through town  all he had to do was look out the motorcades windows to see a mix of opposition and support for his visit  parts of the route were lined with protesters who waved signs  our home is not a crisis and no al muro  spanish for no to the wall   and with trump supporters who had their own signs at one moment on the protester side  police officers wrestled at least one person to the ground as tempers flared the mcallen police said two people were arrested following a confrontation between trump supporters and protesters joe cantu  a 75 year old trump backer who wore a red make america great again hat and matching t shirt  parked at a mall near the airport and was preparing to join a crowd of fellow supporters who gathered to cheer the presidents visit  some held flags and signs reading build the wall and latinos for trump hell yeah  we need a wall  said mr  cantu  a south texas native who is the former police chief of the nearby town of san juan mr  trump at one point walked over to dozens of supporters gathered at the airport oh  i like that  mr  trump said when a supporter handed him a military baseball cap with trump emblazoned on the front joaquin zamora  a city commissioner who was part of a contingent of officials and supporters who greeted mr  trump at the airport  said he was proud to have the president of the united states visit the city where he was born and raised  but he did not completely support mr  trumps plan to build a wall in a region that thrives on binational commerce and trade i think over all its not the neighborly thing to do with our neighbors to the south  said mr  zamora  47  who is also a hidalgo county prosecutor  you shouldnt be using immigration to shut down the government to get what you want  certainly i think theres other ways to go about it mr  zamora said he hoped the presidents visit would help dispel  not fuel  misconceptions about the city were a wholesome community  he said  were an american city thats on the border  what we dont want is the perception that were a dusty border town with burros and carts  ak 47s being fired every 30 minutes and molotov cocktails being thrown  because thats not whats happening in mcallen the county park adjacent to where mr  trump got his briefing  known as anzalduas park  lies directly along the rio grande  and on thursday  for the presidential visit  it was closed to the public city residents said the last time that happened for a presidential visit was in 2006  when president george w  bush held a news conference there  it is  they said  a place where families go on weekends for barbecues and gatherings  and one of its defining features is that just across the river  on the mexican side  families fill the banks for their own barbecues and gatherings they are so close  united by a river  that they could wave at one another  sometimes  they do just that .

its funny that were still talking about the physical features of what president trump wants or will settle for on our countrys southern border  about whether it will be concrete or steel  solid or slatted  a fancied up fence or  in nancy pelosis hilariously acerbic dig  a beaded curtain  because its not really a wall that trump is after  if indeed it ever was  its a victory for victorys sake  its a show of his might  its proof of his potency  of course he discussed it in a much different manner on tuesday night  when  for the first time during his presidency  he formally addressed americans from the oval office in prime time  he spoke of a crisis of the heart on the border  he spoke of a crisis of the soul  he mentioned drugs  crime  americans who have lost their lives because of undocumented immigrants and americans who have lost their jobs to them  it was an epic threat that he painted  and a grossly exaggerated one  whatever it takes to deliver on a promise that he should never have made whatever it takes to salvage his pride the longer his stalemate with democrats in congress grinds on  the clearer that becomes  seldom has a presidents ego been this tender  and seldom has it required so much shoring up  theres not enough concrete in creation for that job  network executives had little choice but to grant him access to the airwaves  he had never made such a request before  so its not like this particular grandstanding is habitual  go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with frank brunis candid reflections on politics  culture  higher education and more every week  sign up for his newsletter  and had the networks refused him  they would have handed him a cudgel in the culture wars that he would have used the same way that he governs  shamelessly  putting his ludicrous claims of martyrdom above any national interest  better for the networks to go along  with a plan in place to check his assertions rigorously and call out his lies immediately  even this deep into a presidency of such incompetence and amorality  he deserves a hearing  thats how the rest of us demonstrate the very respect for traditions and norms that he refuses to show  but he doesnt deserve an unfiltered one  thats the road to autocracy trump isnt selling something that the country really needs  and thats why he and his allies have to lard the pitch with lies  according to the washington post fact checker  there are more bogus claims and hallucinated menaces when he talks about immigration and the border than when he talks about anything else he insists that would be terrorists see a porous southern border as a welcome mat  but thats bunk  most try to get into the united states by plane and are apprehended at airports  he wildly inflates the amount of crime committed by undocumented immigrants and just as wildly overstates the effect a border wall might have on the countrys opioid crisis  he did this again on tuesday night  even though he wasnt speaking off the cuff  in a revved up style  at one of his rallies  he read prepared remarks  and still there was fiction aplenty in them nancy pelosi and chuck schumer  who were given time immediately following trump to present a rebuttal  clearly expected and were ready for that  in ticking off reasons that an expensive and expansive border wall wasnt needed  pelosi kept saying  the fact is  the fact is  it was a mantra meant to humiliate trump  which is a sport that she is developing an ever greater taste for when it comes to the border and the wall  trumps willful estrangement from reality is so profound that network executives and newspaper editors spent part of tuesday in strategy sessions about how to respond to his inevitable barrage of falsehoods  should there be a crawl of words on the bottom of the television screen to correct him in real time  could fact checkers work speedily enough to post rebuttals online within minutes of his misrepresentations  before they took root  this is where we find ourselves  other presidents have been untrustworthy  and others have had to be called out on it  but not like this  this is surreal its a function of  more than anything  his ego  his vanity  to which the television networks  furloughed federal workers  all americans  are hostage  hes not remarkable among presidents in having a high opinion of himself and in desperately wanting others to share it  a robust measure of arrogance and some degree of neediness are what make the grind of the campaign trail and the glare of the media bearable  and all presidents want to rack up triumphs that make them look and feel large  but none in my lifetime has spun so many falsehoods in the service of that  none has been so naked in his hunger for that heft to live with his resounding defeat by that nasty woman in the popular vote  trump had to invent the specter of millions of illegally cast ballots  he never did produce any evidence of that  to not feel eclipsed by president barack obama  he claimed there was a media conspiracy to undercount his inauguration crowd  but photographs dont lie  not the way a president does the day after his inauguration  in a visit to the c i a  headquarters  against a backdrop of stars that symbolized men and women who had been killed on the job for america  he used his remarks to tally his appearances on the cover of time magazine  i think we have the all time record  he said  but we as usual meant i  theres no occasion unsuitable for bragging  no mission more vital than the exaltation of trump  when  over the recent christmas holiday  he at last paid a visit to a combat zone and spoke to american troops in iraq  he seemed less intent on thanking them for their service than in having them thank him  he dwelled on a pay increase that they had received and claimed  erroneously  that they had gone without one for 10 years  until he came along we got you a big one  he said  i got you a big one  i got you a big one  i  big  thats the trump credo in two words  and that  at this point  is the point of the wall  i  big  its like a manhood thing for him  pelosi reportedly told house democrats in a closed meeting last month  as if manhood could ever be associated with him but bigness eluded trump on tuesday night  he came across as cramped  frustrated and forced to plead when hed much rather command  hes bunched up and boxed in  and the rest of us are yoked to this crazy  self affirming monument thats a barrier only to reason and responsible government .
president trump on friday said that he was considering the declaration of a national emergency along the border with mexico  which he apparently believes would allow him to divert funds from the military budget to pay for a wall  and to use military personnel to build it  while it is hard to know exactly what the president has in mind  or whether he has any conception about what it would entail  one thing is clear  not only would such an action be illegal  but if members of the armed forces obeyed his command  they would be committing a federal crime begin with the basics  from the founding onward  the american constitutional tradition has profoundly opposed the presidents use of the military to enforce domestic law  a key provision  rooted in an 1878 statute and added to the law in 1956  declares that whoever willfully uses any part of the army or the air force to execute a law domestically shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years  except when expressly authorized by the constitution or act of congress another provision  grounded in a statute from 1807 and added to the law in 1981  requires the secretary of defense to ensure that any activity  including the provision of any equipment or facility or the assignment or detail of any personnel  must not include or permit direct participation by a member of the army  navy  air force  or marine corps in a search  seizure  arrest  or other similar activity unless participation in such activity by such member is otherwise authorized by law  in response to the hurricane katrina disaster in new orleans  congress created an express exception to the rules  and authorized the military to play a backup role in major public emergencies  but in 2008 congress and president bush repealed this sweeping exception  is president trump aware of this express repudiation of the power which he is threatening to invoke the statute books do contain a series of carefully crafted exceptions to the general rule  most relevantly  congress has granted the coast guard broad powers to enforce the law within the domestic waters of the united states  but there is no similar provision granting the other military services a comparable power to search  seize and arrest along the mexican border  given congresss decision of 2008  this silence speaks louder than words  similarly  the current military appropriations bill fails to exempt military professionals from criminal punishment for violating the law in their use of available funds it is  i suppose  possible to imagine a situation in which the president might take advantage of the most recent exception  enacted in 2011  which authorized the military detention of suspected terrorists associated with al qaeda or the taliban  but despite president trumps unsupported claims about terrorists trying to cross the border  it is an unconscionable stretch to use this proviso to support using the military for operations against the desperate refugees from central america seeking asylum in our country it is even less plausible for the president to suspend these restrictions under the national emergencies act of 1976  from the great depression through the cold war  presidents systematically abused emergency powers granted them by congress in some 470 statutes  culminating in the watergate fiasco  in response  the first section of the 1976 act terminated all existing emergencies and created a framework of checks and balances on the presidents arbitrary will  if president trump declared an emergency  section five of the act gives the house of representatives the right to repudiate it immediately  then pass their resolution to the senate  which is explicitly required to conduct a floor vote within 15 days  since president trumps emergency declaration would be a direct response to his failure to convince congress that national security requires his wall  it is hard to believe that a majority of the senate  if forced to vote  would accept his show of contempt for their authority the supreme courts 1953 decision in youngstown v  sawyer would be critical in congressional consideration of such a decision  in a canonical opinion by justice robert jackson  the court invalidated president trumans attempt in 1952 to use his powers as commander in chief to nationalize steel mills in the face of labor strikes  the decision imposed fundamental constitutional limits on the presidents power to claim that a national emergency  in this case  the korean war  allowed him to override express provisions preventing him from using those powers domestically the law is clear  how it would play out is less so  but undoubtedly  we would see a period of passionate debate on capitol hill  with scores of representatives  from both parties  condemning the presidents move as an unconstitutional abuse of his powers as commander in chief  this would play out in public  with millions of service members watching closely  they would immediately be obliged to decide whether to obey president trump  and risk criminal punishment  for the president to put these men and women in such a position  simply out of petulance over congressional opposition  would be especially unconscionable  should the president proceed  he should ask the office of legal counsel to issue an opinion explaining to service members why they would not be willfully acting illegally if they heeded the presidents command  but we know this president well enough to know that will not happen  instead  he will likely take the most irresponsible path possible  issuing his national emergency through a tweet or a question begging written pronunciamento  recall how legally flawed his first stabs at the so called travel ban were  if anything  his willingness to seek legal advice  and the ability of those around him to provide it  has declined since then  what this all adds up to is a potential crisis much graver than whatever immigration emergencies the president has in mind  a legally ignorant president forcing our troops to choose between his commands and the rule of law in a petty political struggle over a domestic political question .
washington  a coalition of 16 states  including california and new york  on monday challenged president trump in court over his plan to use emergency powers to spend billions of dollars on his border wall the lawsuit is part of a constitutional confrontation that mr  trump set off on friday when he declared that he would spend billions of dollars more on border barriers than congress had granted him  the clash raises questions over congressional control of spending  the scope of emergency powers granted to the president  and how far the courts are willing to go to settle such a dispute the suit  filed in federal district court in san francisco  argues that the president does not have the power to divert funds for constructing a wall along the mexican border because it is congress that controls spending  read the full lawsuit here  xavier becerra  the attorney general of california  said in an interview that the president himself had undercut his argument that there was an emergency on the border probably the best evidence is the presidents own words  he said  referring to mr  trumps speech on feb  15 announcing his plan  i didnt need to do this  but id rather do it much faster the lawsuit  california et al  v  trump et al   says that the plaintiff states are going to court to protect their residents  natural resources and economic interests  contrary to the will of congress  the president has used the pretext of a manufactured crisis of unlawful immigration to declare a national emergency and redirect federal dollars appropriated for drug interdiction  military construction and law enforcement initiatives toward building a wall on the united states mexico border  the lawsuit says congress is on its own separate track to challenge the presidents declaration  the house of representatives  now controlled by democrats  may take a two prong approach when it returns from a recess  one would be to bring a lawsuit of its own lawmakers could also vote to override the declaration that an emergency exists  but it is doubtful that congress has the votes to override mr  trumps certain veto  leaving the courts a more likely venue joining california and new york are colorado  connecticut  delaware  hawaii  illinois  maine  maryland  michigan  minnesota  nevada  new jersey  new mexico  oregon and virginia  all have democratic governors but one  maryland  whose attorney general is a democrat  and most have legislatures controlled by democrats  read the first edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  the dispute stems from steps mr  trump said he would take after lawmakers granted him only  1 375 billion for new border barriers  legislation he signed last week to avoid another government shutdown mr  trump asserted the power to tap three additional pots of money on his own   600 million from a treasury department asset forfeiture fund for law enforcement priorities  about  2 5 billion from a military antidrug account  most of which would first be siphoned from other military programs the pentagon has yet to identify  and  3 6 billion in military construction funds he said he could redirect by invoking an emergency powers statute presidents have invoked emergency powers statutes nearly five dozen times since congress enacted the national emergencies act of 1976  but never before has one been used to make an end run around congress after it rejected funding for a particular policy but as the debate over mr  trumps action shifts to courtrooms  legal experts warned that its fate may turn less on such high constitutional principle and more on complex legal issues  from whether plaintiffs can establish that the case is properly before the courts  to how to interpret several statutes even though trumps political maneuver to get around an uncooperative congress looks like it stretches the constitution  the questions presented in court will raise ordinary and complicated issues of administrative law  said peter m  shane  an ohio state university law professor and co author of a separation of powers casebook two cases had already been filed after mr  trumps announcement on feb  15  one by the nonprofit watchdog group public citizen  representing several texas landowners and a texas environmental group  and the other a case jointly brought by the center for biological diversity  defenders of wildlife and the animal legal defense fund at least two other lawsuits are expected to be filed later this week  the american civil liberties union has announced its intention to file a case  but has not yet publicly identified its client  the other case will be brought by protect democracy  another watchdog group  and the niskanen center  a center right policy institute  on behalf of el paso county and the border network for human rights many critics have challenged whether an emergency truly exists on the southern border that a wall would solve  pointing to government data showing that the number of people crossing illegally has dropped significantly over the past generation and that most drugs are smuggled through ports of entry the president has argued  without proof  that the emergency declaration is warranted because the migrants invading the united states across the mexico border have caused epidemics of crime and drug use legal specialists expected the justice department to urge a court not to consider facts about the border or mr  trumps words  but rather to defer to the presidents decision  the courts have a long history of being reluctant to substitute their own judgment for the presidents about a security threat the trump administration will have a powerful argument to invoke  in the national emergencies act  congress defined no standard for what conditions have to be met before a president may determine that a qualifying crisis exists but before a judge could weigh whether mr  trump invoked the statute legitimately  he or she would have to decide whether the dispute is properly before the court in the first place plaintiffs will need to establish standing by showing that they are suffering some particular injury from what mr  trump is doing  several of the lawsuits involve people who own land or represent communities along the mexican border in texas  where mr  trump has put the focus of his emphasis on the need for more barriers but it is not clear whether any of the fencing will be built in california or new mexico  two of the states in the lawsuit  and it certainly will not be built in other states involved in the litigation  like new york  new jersey or hawaii mr  becerra  californias attorney general  suggested that plaintiffs in the states lawsuits have standing for reasons that are unrelated to whether any portions of mr  trumps wall will be built in their territory  arguing that the presidents unconstitutional action could cause harms in many parts of the country people in california and other plaintiff states could lose funding that they paid for with their tax dollars  money that was destined for drug interdiction or for the department of defense for military men and women and military installations  he said in the interview further complicating matters  the administration has said it intends to spend the funds in sequence  starting with the  1 375 billion congress appropriated  and reaching the emergency power military construction fund last  the justice department is likely to argue that if no disputed spending is imminent  the case is not ripe for litigation and should be dismissed ian bassin  the executive director of protect democracy  said that el paso county would probably argue that its economy was being harmed by mr  trumps emergency declaration because it wrongfully signaled to businesses and potential tourists that they should stay away the justice department declined to comment on the wave of lawsuits  mr  trump has said he expected to be sued and to lose in lower courts  but he predicted he would eventually prevail before the supreme court but plaintiffs can also challenge whether the administration is interpreting several statutes correctly the provision that gives the secretary of defense authority to transfer some pentagon money into the antidrug account mr  trump is then planning to tap  for example  says its authority may be used in no case where the item for which funds are requested has been denied by the congress  raising the question of whether extra funding for border barriers counts as such a forbidden item and the emergency powers statute mr  trump plans to use permits military construction spending in an emergency that requires the use of the armed forces for projects to support such use  that has been used before to build up foreign military bases in a war effort  but litigants challenge whether a permanent wall to help civilian agencies police the border qualifies under that wording judges will certainly be aware of the larger institutional context when they address those technical issues  but that awareness will not  by itself  determine how the legal questions get resolved  mr  shane said .
london  president trumps push for a border wall hints at a problem that populist leaders are facing across the western world after a year of setbacks  populist leaders and parties are trying to rejuvenate their fortunes by revitalizing the sense of crisis on which they thrive  but as with mr  trumps demand for a border wall  which has brought a two week government shutdown  this may say more about populisms weakness than its strength immigration and terrorism crises  which aided populisms world shaking rise in 2016  have waned  populists have faced disappointing election results in germany  the united states and even poland  shattering the image of the movements inevitability and its claims to represent true popular will the wests populist leaders and parties have grown defensive  retreating into ever starker messages of us versus them  the approach excites their most dedicated followers  but it can be risky  forcing voters to pick sides at a moment when the populist right holds declining appeal cas mudde  a dutch political scientist and leading scholar of populism  has predicted that the movements once meteoric rise will become modest and uneven in 2019  with more setbacks ahead populism is hardly dying  it holds power in the united states  italy and a few eastern european countries  as well as meaningful parliamentary minorities in much of western europe  where populist parties now reliably win about one in six votes still  without a crisis to justify populisms hard line policies  its message has been stripped down to its most core element  opposition to liberal ideals of pluralism  multiculturalism and international cooperation the result is a new phase in the populist era  one that will test populisms appeal  and that of its ideological rival  postwar establishment liberalism  as never before this story  playing out across western democracies  may be encapsulated best by the still unfolding drama of mr  trump  the government shutdown and the border wall two years after he won the presidency  threats supposedly posed by immigration and terrorism in the united states have not materialized illegal immigration continued its 10 year decline  a spate of terrorist attacks inspired by the islamic state occurred before mr  trump took office americans lost enthusiasm for strict policies like mr  trumps promised wall on the mexican border  which polls poorly  republicans suffered a devastating defeat in the midterm elections  mr  trumps divisive message  rather than pulling more voters in  had pushed some away but populists  who thrive on conflict against an existential threat  cannot bend with popular will as easily as mainstream parties  rather than giving up on his wall and compromising his vision  mr  trump has dug in populists in europe had a similarly rocky year in britain  support for brexit has slipped below 50 percent  polls suggest a majority of voters want a second referendum  brexit hard liners in the governing conservative party tried and failed to eject theresa may  the prime minister  over her support for a softer brexit in germany  the rise of alternative for germany  a far right party  has stalled  it performed worse than expected in elections in the border state of bavaria  where immigration is a major issue  and worse than it fared a year earlier when bavarias center right party tried to co opt the populist message and challenge chancellor angela merkel over immigration  it suffered election losses  ms  merkel survived  her approval rating spiked and she lined up a centrist successor many western populists are falling back to their message of besiegement and threat  as much out of the paranoid worldview that is central to populism as out of any conscious strategy brexit hard liners are pointing to the 470 people who illegally crossed the english channel by boat last year  a drop in the bucket compared with the hundreds of thousands of arrivals to europe in 2015 and 2016  mr  trump has claimed  with no hard evidence  mayhem at the mexican border but dividing the world into us versus them works only if voters want to belong to us and oppose them  typically establishment elites and cultural outsiders in europe  many more voters have had contact with migrants since 2016  which research suggests can lessen fear and resentment  in the united states  the buoyed economy has undercut fears of economic competition from immigrants one of the countries most often cited as a populist success last year may also underscore the movements challenges the sweden democrats  a populist party  won 17 5 percent of the vote  its highest share ever  in a national election in september  if populists could surge this high  this fast even in sweden  a bastion of liberalism  surely it represented a global shift but polls tell a different story support for the sweden democrats has not grown since the end of 2015  just as the refugee crisis began tapering off  and the partys share of the vote last year was only slightly more than that of dutch far right populists in 2017  which had been considered a disappointing setback for the movement swedens experience may suggest that western populists rose only with the refugee and terrorism crises and that  as those crises have faded  populism has stalled out well below the numbers needed for it to sustainably hold power a review of populisms global performance  conducted by jordan kyle and limor gultchin of the london based institute for global change  reached a similar finding populists today hold 20 governments worldwide  the same number they held in 2010  have held most years since and have never surpassed  what we perceive as a new wave may in fact be populism shifting out of poorer countries  often in latin america  where they have since suffered setbacks  to the west but there is another way to read cases like sweden  not as the populist wave cresting  but as the liberal consensus breaking  even if populists win power only occasionally  struggle in office and mostly consign themselves to an angry minority  that they play any role at all represents a seismic change their rise  even if it never progresses much further  could still reshape western politics in ways we are only beginning to understand stripped of claims to be responding to an immigration crisis  the populist message is taking on a certain clarity  and proving an enduring  if narrow  appeal though these parties surged in support only recently  their slow but steady rise dates to the 1960s  when postwar liberalism took hold ever since  they have used crises to hit on deeper fears of demographic and cultural change brought about by liberalism  and they have channeled opposition to an establishment consensus that called it taboo to question liberal ideals there has always been some discomfort with the aspect of liberalism that populists are most aggressively challenging  the notion that democracies must extend rights and protections to outsiders western populists have surfaced that discomfort and given it voice  by winning at least enough votes to force the world to listen  they have opened up space for western voters to reject liberal strictures explicitly parties like the sweden democrats and alternative for germany may no longer have much hope of leveraging crises to win power outright  but there appears to be enough latent opposition to liberalism to keep populists well involved in politics border crises  real or imagined  are ideal for this message  they highlight aspects of liberalism that people find most objectionable  promises to protect outsiders  demands that countries compromise sovereignty and the softening of fixed  racially defined national identities so perhaps when brexit hard liners or bavarian populists play up border crises that may seem exaggerated they are speaking to a deeper concern among their small but dedicated base that may be enough to keep them in national legislatures and conversations  even if populists in the west never advance beyond their heights in 2016  they will remain in a strong position to challenge liberalisms postwar hold over western democracies even in countries like germany or france  where centrist leaders hold power  the establishment party system has collapsed  seva gunitsky  a university of toronto political scientist  has argued that the distinction between democracy and authoritarianism is already blurring  with more elected leaders taking on the tools and tactics of strongmen postwar liberal democracy is simply too new of a system  scholars of democracy say  to know whether it can survive these challenges  we may look back at 2016 as a populist blip associated with one off crises  or as the beginning of a process of chipping away at liberal democracy from within for anyone who was hoping for a break in the hectic politics of the past years  mr  mudde wrote in his assessment of populisms prospects  2019 wont be it .
washington  president trump agreed on friday to reopen the federal government for three weeks while negotiations continued over how to secure the nations southwestern border  backing down after a monthlong standoff failed to force democrats to give him billions of dollars for his long promised wall the presidents concession paved the way for the house and the senate to both pass a stopgap spending bill by voice vote  mr  trump signed it on friday night  restoring normal operations at a series of federal agencies until feb  15 and opening the way to paying the 800 000 federal workers who have been furloughed or forced to work without pay for 35 days the plan includes none of the money for the wall that mr  trump had demanded and was essentially the same approach that he rejected at the end of december and that democrats have advocated since  meaning he won nothing concrete during the impasse mr  trump presented the agreement with congressional leaders as a victory anyway  and indicated in a speech in the rose garden that his cease fire may only be temporary  if republicans and democrats cannot reach agreement on wall money by the february deadline  he said that he was ready to renew the confrontation or declare a national emergency to bypass congress altogether we really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or steel barrier  mr  trump said  if we dont get a fair deal from congress  the government will either shut down on feb  15  or i will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and constitution of the united states to address this emergency  president trumps emergency powers  explained  but mr  trump has already adopted some of the language that his democratic adversaries have used during the longest shutdown in history  he conceded that we do not need 2 000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea  we never did and invoked the utility of smart walls that substitute some physical barriers for drones and other sensors  the semantic evolution provides both the president and democrats with a face saving way forward if they want it the surprise announcement was a remarkable surrender for a president who made the wall his nonnegotiable condition for reopening the government and a centerpiece of his political platform  some immigration hard liners that make up a key part of his political base were incensed by the capitulation good news for george herbert walker bush  as of today  he is no longer the biggest wimp ever to serve as president of the united states  the commentator ann coulter  who has aggressively pushed mr  trump to keep his campaign promise on the wall  wrote on twitter on capitol hill  though  jittery lawmakers from both parties greeted the news with relief  mr  trump relented as the effects of the shutdown were rippling with ever greater force across the economy  with fallout far beyond paychecks  on friday  air traffic controllers calling in sick slowed air traffic across the northeast  hundreds of workers at the internal revenue service also did not show up  and the f b i  director said he was as angry as he had ever been over his agents not being paid none of us are willing to go through this again  said senator lisa murkowski of alaska  referring to a half dozen republicans who voted on thursday for a democratic measure to reopen the government for two weeks  and its not just a few of us  there are a great many in our conference that feel pretty strongly  how the shutdown reordered american life  democrats  who declined to revel in their clear victory  said they would work in good faith to strike a deal on border security  they have raised their offer on border security funding considerably and toughened their rhetoric on stopping illegal immigration but speaker nancy pelosi stated plainly that any compromise would not include money for a new border wall  which democrats view as ineffective and overly costly even though many have supported border fencing in the past have i not been clear on a wall  ms  pelosi said at a news conference with senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  the two have repeatedly said they would support allocating additional money for technology and increased patrols along the border  like the ones mr  trump referenced on friday the cease fire should pave the way for mr  trump to deliver his state of the union address to congress after all  but ms  pelosi said it would not be held this tuesday  as originally scheduled  she had rescinded her invitation this week to come to the house chamber until the government was reopened  and on friday  she said she would work with mr  trump to find a new date the state of the union is not planned now  ms  pelosi said  when government is open we will discuss a mutually agreeable date as he announced the deal  mr  trump paid tribute to the federal workers who have endured five weeks without pay  expressing sympathy for them in a way he had not until now  you are fantastic people  he said he promised to ensure that workers would be compensated for the paychecks they have missed since the shutdown began in late december very quickly or as soon as possible  to that effect  the office of management and budget circulated a letter to affected agencies and departments on friday afternoon instructing management to prepare for an orderly reopening and to prioritize pay and benefits for workers but other costs will be more permanent  many federal contractors do not expect to be repaid for their work during the shutdown  its compounding effects will ultimately cost the federal government more money than if it was open  and though the long term economic damage caused by the shutdown remains to be seen  it appears that at the very least the short term pain was more costly than a down payment on the border wall according to an analysis from standard   poors  the ratings agency  the united states economy lost at least  6 billion in the five weeks the government was partly shuttered  more than the  5 7 billion that mr  trump had requested to build a steel or concrete barrier at the border mr  trump offered no explanation for his surrender  nor did he acknowledge that it was one  on twitter on friday night  he said  this was in no way a concession  it was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days  if no deal is done  its off to the races during the presidents speech earlier in the day  cabinet officials and white house aides lined the sides of the rose garden and applauded him  mr  trump began his remarks as if he had actually emerged victorious  saying that he was very proud to announce what he called a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government few lawmakers even in the presidents own party saw it that way i hail from a state that is very supportive of the president and border security with barriers  so that is a consideration for me  but there are a lot of other strategies we could employ that would work better than a shutdown  said senator shelley moore capito  republican of west virginia with polls showing the president enduring most of the blame by the public  republicans led by senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  pressured mr  trump to agree to the temporary truce  over the next three weeks  a house senate conference committee representing both parties will negotiate a border security plan  but if it fails to reach a consensus  government agencies could close again the presidents concession came a day after two competing measures to reopen the government failed on the senate floor  a democratic bill  which would have reopened the government with no strings attached  received more votes than the bill backed by mr  trump  which included temporary protections for some undocumented immigrants in exchange for  5 7 billion for his proposed border wall mr  mcconnell and mr  schumer huddled on thursday night after the failed votes to discuss a path forward  mr  schumer rejected the idea of offering a down payment for the wall to reopen the government and pitched mr  mcconnell on what ultimately became the agreement with mr  trump  according to a senior democratic aide mr  mcconnell  who viewed the shutdown as unnecessary from the start  found mr  trump eager to end the impasse  and in a series of calls  they ironed out the details  to the republican leader  it was a way to ease much of the pressure on federal workers and get the senate back to work as late as early friday morning  mr  trump appeared intent on declaring a national emergency at the border alongside the agreement to reopen the government  but mr  mcconnell and white house officials encouraged him to drop the idea  according to people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to discuss them republican leaders tried to rally their members during a closed policy luncheon before thursdays votes  but even as republicans prepared to support mr  trumps plan  the signs of mounting frustration after weeks of inaction were evident republican senators rose one by one to voice concerns about the effect on federal workers and the lack of forward momentum in an impasse that felt unbearable  they swore they would never stand by another government shutdown weve already lost  lamented senator johnny isakson  republican of georgia  according to people familiar with the remarks  its a matter of the extent we want to keep losing at another point  during an exchange first reported by the washington post  senator ron johnson  republican of wisconsin  vented at mr  mcconnell for putting republicans in the position of having to vote on two competing approaches to reopen the government  one republican and one democratic  without consulting them first you put us in this position  mr  johnson said  according to one of his aides mr  mcconnell  who had largely been absent from negotiations to reopen the government until late last week  responded  are you suggesting im enjoying this .

lenexa  kan   state senator dinah sykes  a democrat for three whole weeks  told the retirement home residents that she had felt ignored by republican leaders  she said that she remained a political moderate  she promised that her views on policy hadnt changed when she quit the republican party  only the letter beside her name but just like america  and just like kansas  the roomful of ms  sykess constituents was divided you flipped  im disenfranchised  said kent crippin  82  and ive been a republican all my life another man told her  i still feel betrayed  and i wont make the mistake of voting for you again ms  sykes choked back tears as she responded  if im not re elected  thats o k   but i did what i felt was right  she said  im sorry ive hurt you ms  sykes is one of four state lawmakers in kansas who switched allegiances last month  walking away from the republican party that has controlled this states capitol and dominated its politics for years  the defections wont affect control of the legislature  republicans have plenty of votes to spare in topeka  but they reveal a larger problem for the party as 2020 approaches  and one that reaches well beyond kansas the departures reflect a political shift in suburban areas of kansas  a state that surprised political experts by electing a democrat as governor in november  that shift is part of a larger realignment in traditionally republican suburbs across the country  where long marginalized democrats are now ascendant and where voters who are upset with president trump  especially women  have punished some moderate republican candidates all four of the lawmakers who announced in december that they were becoming democrats are women  and all four are from johnson county  just outside kansas city  mo  they each said that distaste for mr  trump and unease with kansas increasingly conservative republican party contributed to the decision to leave centrist republican lawmakers in johnson county have found themselves facing a painful choice  leave the states dominant party and alienate loyal voters  or remain republican despite clear shifts to the left in their districts ive got constituents saying  were cool with you  but how can you be associated with this  said state representative stephanie clayton  describing the pressure she faced before leaving the republican party in december  a month after she was re elected as a republican ms  clayton  who first registered with her former party as a teenager and once led a local young republicans chapter  said there had been a tremendous amount of energy being spent on my part saying  im not one of those republicans twenty percent of all kansans live in johnson county  it is quintessential suburbia  big houses  bigger parking lots  low crime  the county has always been more politically mixed than kansas bright red rural areas  but it has been friendly turf for republicans  especially those bringing messages of fiscal prudence and limited government  in 2012  mitt romney carried johnson county by 17 percentage points but even as mr  trump has expanded republicans reach into some areas  he has become a liability for the party in some well educated  affluent suburbs  in johnson county  where the majority of residents over 25 have a college degree and the median household income exceeds  80 000  mr  trump beat hillary clinton by just 3 percentage points some of the rhetoric nationally has been pretty ugly  especially around the  metoo movement and the way that our president speaks about women  said catherine barrett  28  a republican from lenexa  a suburb in johnson county  who supported mrs  clinton in 2016  ms  barrett said she voted for ms  sykes for state senate when she ran as a republican  and ill be happy to vote for her as a democrat the political shift in johnson county seems to be accelerating  democrats carried the county in four out of five statewide races in 2018  gov  laura kellys 17 percentage point margin in the county was crucial to her flipping the governorship to the democrats  and kevin yoder  a four term republican congressman from johnson county who had always coasted to re election  was decisively beaten by representative sharice davids  a democrat who became the first openly gay kansan in congress and one of the first two native american women in the house i think there was a lot of pushback that kind of jumped on the national bandwagon of anti trump  said kelly arnold  the chairman of the kansas republican party  which retained large majorities in both chambers of the state legislature  i think the democrats did a pretty good job convincing swing voters we need something new across the country  democrats made inroads in 2018 in suburban areas where they had long struggled  near minneapolis and st  paul  two republican congressmen lost their seats  outside chicago  democrats took two congressional districts from republicans and helped vote out illinoiss republican governor  and in suburban orange county  calif   one of the most famous republican bastions of the 20th century  democrats flipped four congressional seats in kansas  mr  trump is by no means the only force stirring political turmoil  sam brownback  the republican governor who resigned last year to become a united states ambassador  was deeply unpopular in the state after pushing a philosophy of fiscal austerity over several years  his approach to school funding and a tax cutting plan that led to revenue shortfalls and service cuts angered many residents last years republican nominee for governor  kris w  kobach  who got his political start in johnson county by serving on the overland park city council  put off some suburban voters with his strident language about illegal immigration and his public embrace of mr  trump   mr  kobach also raised eyebrows by showing up at a parade in shawnee  in johnson county  with a replica machine gun mounted on his jeep  all the while  a longstanding split between conservative and moderate republicans in kansas has grown increasingly contentious conservatives  or the further right faction of the republican party  have continued and continued and continued to try to force those of us of the moderate mind out of the party  said state senator barbara bollier  a retired anesthesiologist from mission hills who was the first of the four johnson county legislators to announce that she was becoming a democrat along with ms  sykes  ms  clayton and ms  bollier  the other kansas lawmaker who changed parties was state representative joy koesten  who lost the republican nomination to a conservative challenger in last years primary  ms  koesten announced that she was becoming a democrat a few weeks before her term ended some conservatives sounded untroubled by the exodus of moderate lawmakers  who had frequently voted with democrats in the legislature even before changing parties  some conservatives even saw the switches as an opportunity  freeing the republican party to run more conservative candidates in those districts bob cook  who has lived in johnson county for decades  said he had seen his once reliably republican area make a 180 degree swing as younger residents moved in parents of school age children in particular have become a significant political force on issues surrounding education in the countys shawnee mission and blue valley school districts  which are consistently among the states best i dont think that the entire suburbs are all of a sudden blue  said liz benditt  a leader of education first shawnee mission  a group of mothers formed after the 2016 election that endorsed a mixed list of democrats and moderate republicans in legislative races last year  i just think theres more openness to talking about things we disagree about and finding common ground for decades  democrats were so toothless in kansas that many left leaning residents registered as republicans so they could vote for moderates over conservatives in the partys primaries  where most of the real decisions were made  as of last fall  the republican party had a 75 000 person advantage in registration in johnson county  but some of those registered republicans said the trump and brownback eras were pushing them away the national politics around the party are such that i could not support it any more  publicly  said erin thompson  41  a lawyer and roeland park city council member who did not run for another term as her precincts republican committeewoman the four lawmakers who changed parties gave similar accounts they said they felt unwanted by kansas republicans and out of step with mr  trumps priorities  several grew frustrated when voters expected them to weigh in on whatever the president was saying on twitter  or when questions about mr  trump dominated their interactions with voters while canvassing in the end  said ms  sykes  who faced the testy reception at the retirement home  i had to do what i could do to look at myself in the mirror .
washington  speaker nancy pelosi of california said on wednesday that she would be willing to endorse any bipartisan border security agreement that emerges from house senate negotiations  leaving the success of those talks largely hinging on president trumps endorsement with administration officials on capitol hill for the state of the union address on tuesday  ms  pelosi said she told vice president mike pence that she hoped the white house would adhere to the same hands off policy and let the bipartisan group of house and senate lawmakers come to their conclusion ahead of the feb  15 deadline to keep the government fully funded mr  trump has repeatedly scorned the talks as a waste of time if a final agreement produced by the group  known as a conference committee  does not satisfy his  5 7 billion demand for a wall at the southwestern border  but ms  pelosi offered her unqualified support if left to their own devices  if they have a bipartisan agreement  i will support it  ms  pelosi told reporters on wednesday  adding that she had offered the same assurance to senator richard c  shelby  republican of alabama and a member of the committee left to their own devices  i think they could have an agreement by friday  she added that might be optimistic  leaving a classified briefing with committee members and customs and border protection agents  representative kay granger of texas  the ranking republican on the house appropriations committee  offered a slightly more pessimistic prediction no  ms  granger said when asked if there was a chance to reach an agreement by friday  but a deal by next week  she said  was absolutely possible mr  shelby told reporters after the meeting that he hoped a final piece of legislation could be produced by monday and voted on later next week  staff members  he said  were again expected to work through the weekend times fleeting  and times ticking  said mr  shelby  the chairman of the senate appropriations committee the classified briefing with career officials  organized by mr  shelby  was supposed to detail the immediate needs of law enforcement at the southwestern border  but lawmakers emerged without a consensus on physical barriers  only with renewed insistence that a final deal needs to include money for some kinds of physical structures as well as technology and manpower ms  granger  who took a brief trip to a handful of cities along the border this week with her house republican colleagues on the conference committee  conceded to reporters on tuesday that the structure described by the officials she met would be best categorized as fencing  but she did not retreat from her insistence that physical structures needed to be a part of the final deal those on the trip came back and said  if were going to do it right  it has to be some kind of physical barrier  she said  singling out the examples of bollard fencing she saw the group visited mcallen  tex   along with representative henry cuellar  a democrat and fellow committee member whose district includes the city  they also toured the border in el paso and san diego the priority is a physical barrier  a change in the system and enough people that our professional security can do their jobs  ms  granger said some of the conclusions that ms  granger described seemed to align with those of some of her colleagues  who emerged from the closed meeting describing a solution that encompasses both physical barriers and enhanced technology at the southwestern border they dont rule out barriers  they dont rule out fences  but technology was their first priority  said senator richard j  durbin  democrat of illinois  but a tangible combination of all of those  he said  was still unclear even if an agreement is reached  mr  trump could follow through on his threat to declare a national emergency and try to build the wall by shifting money from other projects  if lawmakers miss the deadline  another lapse in funding could shutter parts of the government just weeks after the end of the countrys longest shutdown obviously  it would be great if the president decided to sign the bill  senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  said on tuesday  i think we dont know yet what his view is on this a short term spending bill could extend the deadline for negotiators  but multiple lawmakers have said they dread the prospect of again punting on a final spending bill mr  trumps decision to refrain from threatening a national emergency or a shutdown in his state of the union address offered a glimmer of hope he never used the word shutdown  which i think is very significant  mr  cuellar said in an interview after the presidents speech  i think that sends out a signal to the republicans to say  work something out i think that there is a path forward  but people need to understand we are not going to do the  5 7 billion  he added on wednesday  i think we all agree that it has to be a comprehensive thing .
washington  one thousand new customs officers at ports of entry  imaging technology to scan every vehicle coming into the country  increased spending on the coast guard  secret service and other agencies  and new technology at mail processing facilities to find fentanyl and other opioids  but nothing for a wall at the southwestern border house democrats laid out the general terms of their offer for toughening border security on wednesday as house and senate negotiators met for the first time to find a deal before feb  15 that can prevent another government shutdown  but the democrats opening bid showed how far the parties have to go in the next two weeks  and no one seems sure of what president trump will or will not sign border security is more than physical barriers  and homeland security is more than border security  said representative lucille roybal allard  democrat of california and the chairwoman of the appropriations subcommittee that deals with homeland security  she later told reporters after the meeting that while democrats have supported funding fencing in the past  they wanted to examine technological innovations that could be used in place of fences mr  trump  weighing in on the negotiations hours before they were scheduled to begin  warned on twitter that if the group was not discussing or contemplating a wall or physical barrier  they are wasting their time while not yet finalized  the house democratic proposal served as an opening bid  the emphasis was on technology and improving existing operations  such as expanding the border patrols air and marine operations  increasing risk based targeting of passengers and cargo at ports of entry  bolstering the federal emergency management agencys preparedness programs  improving the transportation security administrations threat detection capabilities at security checkpoints and even funding a new coast guard polar icebreaker nothing can be considered in a vacuum  ms  roybal allard said  more funding for one priority means less for others there are serious homeland security vulnerabilities for which we will have no funding if the president gets his way  she added democrats also insisted on their own priorities beyond homeland security  they proposed new funding to improve customs and border protections care for migrants in the agencys custody  expanding an alternatives to detention program at immigration and customs enforcement to keep families together while reducing the number of ice detention beds and requiring more frequent detention facility inspections representative nita m  lowey of new york  the chairwoman of the appropriations committee  declined to say whether democrats would block any money for barriers or fencing  telling reporters after the meeting that everything is on the table and that she did not want to get ahead of the negotiations  a day earlier  representative hakeem jeffries of new york  the no  5 democrat in the house  told reporters that the party would be willing to support fencing where it makes sense if derived from an evidence based fashion during the meeting  however  there was little mention of a wall  republicans spoke of physical barriers placed  as senator shelley moore capito  republican of west virginia  put it  where it makes sense representative tom graves  republican of georgia  said  i suspect we might have some discussions about terminology and the words we use whether its deterrents  whether its obstructions  whether its walls  whether its barriers  i think were all here for a very narrow scope  he added lawmakers from both parties signaled that they would be open to a broad package that combined the smart technology promoted by democrats and the physical barriers that could pacify mr  trump i think its going to take a comprehensive approach  senator richard c  shelby  an alabama republican who is the chairman of the senate appropriations committee  told reporters  and i think that would be part of it some members on the committee raised the prospect of visiting the border  representative henry cuellar  democrat of texas and the only member of the committee from a border district  displayed photos of the mountains and rivers stretching through the texas border as he argued that a wall would not work but after a bruising and record breaking shutdown  the 17 negotiators said they wanted to prove that bipartisan success was possible doing our job means by definition nobody gets everything they want  said senator roy blunt  republican of missouri  this is our first real test across the capitol  senators from both parties agreed that any kind of deal would be preferable to another shutdown im for narrow or broader  senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the majority leader  said on tuesday when asked what he felt was an appropriate scope for a final deal  im for whatever works that prevents the level of dysfunction weve seen on full display here the last month but lawmakers disagreed on the mechanism to prevent another funding lapse senator richard j  durbin  democrat of illinois and a member of the negotiating panel  known as a conference committee  told his colleagues that if their final deal included language that put an end to government shutdowns once and for all  count me in multiple lawmakers have also introduced legislation that would prevent funding lapses if spending bills were not completed in time  among them  a bill that senator rob portman  republican of ohio  has introduced every session since 2012 that would automatically continue funding for a short time without a formal spending bill  and the stop stupidity act proposed by senator mark warner  democrat of virginia  which would automatically maintain funding for all aspects of the government except the executive and legislative branches but prominent democrats in the house  including representative steny h  hoyer of maryland  the majority leader  and ms  lowey rejected such automatic stopgap spending measures as a dereliction of congresss constitutional power of the purse congress ought to do its job  mr  hoyer told reporters on tuesday  i personally am reticent about automatic bills that in effect take congress out of having to make decisions even a ceremonial resolution declaring that shutdowns are detrimental to the nation and should not occur  proposed by representative jennifer wexton  democrat of virginia  failed to win the two thirds majority required to pass it wednesday under expedited house rules only 21 republicans voted for the resolution  and 163 opposed it  several republicans had lobbied for the removal of certain language singling out mr  trump for his role in forcing the government shutdown  ms  wexton said  and members of the hard line freedom caucus took to the floor to protest the resolution but even with the offending language removed  an overwhelming majority of the republicans voted against the ceremonial measure and subsequently in favor of keeping the shutdown tool alive as a bargaining chip  representative kevin mccarthy of california  the republican leader  condemned the resolution on the house floor as a glorified press release .
in the early months of the trump administration  with the president no longer running his family business  his eldest sons embarked on a plan to roll out two new hotel lines in dozens of american cities  it reflected the ambitions of the next generation of the company  president trumps son eric said at the time now  in a striking reversal  the trump organization is no longer pursuing the signature initiative  according to company officials plans for the two hotel chains  scion and american idea  are to be shelved indefinitely  most likely for the remainder of the presidency  as a practical matter  that means calling off just one agreement  in mississippi  though two years ago the trump organization said it had as many as 30 potential deals in the pipeline the retrenchment comes as the company faces growing scrutiny from federal prosecutors and congressional investigators  and as a former employee  michael d  cohen  heads to prison for multiple crimes  with democrats now in control of the house of representatives  any new hotel deals could have provided investigative fodder for critics of the president we live in a climate where everything will be used against us  whether by the fake news or by democrats who are only interested in presidential harassment and wasting everyones time  barraging us with nonsense letters  eric trump said in a statement  we already have the greatest properties in the world and if we have to slow down our growth for the time being  we are happy to do it the decision to walk away from the hotel plans is the latest and clearest sign of the perils of running a family business whose owner occupies the white house  as eric trump and his brother donald jr  downsize the trump organizations hotel ambitions  the president has lamented the toll that elected office has taken on the company  i lost massive amounts of money doing this job  he told the new york times in a recent interview  this is one of the great losers of all time some of those losses stem from an ethics code that mr  trump was encouraged to adopt  it has prevented the company from doing new business abroad during his presidency  halting the global growth that for years brought in millions of dollars in fees  but other wounds have been more directly self inflicted  in the united states  where the company intended to open the scion and american idea hotels  mr  trumps divisive rhetoric and polarizing politics have turned his brand into a target for opponents the trump organization  which the president continues to own  faced local opposition to potential scion deals in cities like dallas and st  louis  some potential development partners were also scared away by the prospect of intense media coverage and legal and financial vetting from the companys outside ethics adviser  people briefed on the matter said the people said that as of thursday the trump organization was walking away from more than a dozen potential deals in washington  d c   and at least five states the only new hotel deal the trumps had announced was in the mississippi delta  a remote region unlike anywhere the company had done business  the trumps planned to collaborate with local hoteliers  the brothers dinesh and suresh chawla  on one scion and as many as three american idea hotels in a statement about parting ways with the chawlas  the trump organization left open the possibility of reviving the scion and american idea brands  donald jr  and eric trump praised the chawlas and the would be scion property  predicting it would still be an absolutely spectacular project dinesh chawla  whose company plans to move forward on the hotels without the trumps  declined to comment beyond the statement  the terms of the deal were not disclosed  and it is unclear whether the trumps were required to compensate the chawlas in some way for pulling out  in the joint statement  the chawlas said  we understand their position completely the failure to launch was hardly foreseen in june 2017  when the chawlas appeared at trump tower in new york to announce the partnership  donald jr  told the story of how the families originally met  the chawlas immigrant father had sought business advice decades earlier from donald j  trump  who surprisingly returned the call then  at the end of the event  eric trump spoke optimistically about the companys new direction  you just wait to see what we do  he teased a crowd of hotel executives  channeling his fathers flair for salesmanship while the retreat from scion and american idea is a setback for the company  it also signals that the trump presidency takes priority over the trump bottom line long before eric trumps statements on thursday  some senior executives at the trump organization expressed concern that expanding the hotel operation could backfire and reflect poorly on the president  according to the people briefed on the matter  who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it  the executives worried that any potential new deals could lead to accusations that the company  and its owner  were profiting from the presidency in late 2017  eric trump foreshadowed a shift in strategy  indicating in an interview that the company would concentrate on its existing golf  real estate and hotel properties if we have to take a break for an eight year period of time or a four year period  then it is what it is  he said  referring to new business opportunities at the outset of the presidency  mr  trumps sons inherited a company that was coming off a decade of growth  having opened a slate of golf courses and luxury hotels from chicago to las vegas  marketing deals put the trump name on properties around the world  as well as on suits  mattresses and a host of other products the presidency proved to be a game changer the trump name became so toxic in some places that the company was paid to remove it from hotels in toronto and new york  the majority owner of the trump hotel in panama took a more drastic step  ordering the t r u m p letters pried off the property with a crowbar in the last two years  the company has also been under scrutiny from federal investigators and democrats in congress  particularly after mr  cohen pleaded guilty to arranging hush money payments during the presidential campaign to two women who said they had had affairs with mr  trump  the trump organization reimbursed mr  cohen for one of those payments  and is itself a focus of the ongoing investigation the company has also faced a torrent of negative media coverage  most recently over revelations  first reported in the times  about its employment of undocumented workers  the reports  which prompted a review of its properties staffs and the firing of more than two dozen workers  came at a time when mr  trump was denouncing illegal immigration as a threat to national security still  the presidency has not put a damper on all aspects of mr  trumps business  some international deals that were in the works before the election have moved forward  including a trump branded hotel in vancouver and a golf course in dubai that opened in early 2017  and other plans that are still underway in india  uruguay and the philippines the trump international hotel in washington  which opened in 2016  has surpassed expectations  with its lobby regularly packed with republican officials and operatives  it has also caused headaches for the company  having prompted lawsuits claiming that mr  trump is illegally profiting from the presidency  two cases now working their way through the courts focus on whether patrons of his hotels hail from overseas or state governments  a potential violation of the emoluments clauses of the constitution mr  trump brushed off those concerns in the recent interview with the times  suggesting that any new business dealings were more than offset by lost opportunities  during the presidential campaign  about six months before his surprising victory  mr  trump told the times that he had about 120 deals in the pipeline  his executives had been working on hotel projects across the globe  including in israel  saudi arabia and china after the election  the self imposed prohibition on new development in foreign countries caused the trump organization to cancel some proposed deals and its pipeline to rapidly shrink  the company has said  just before taking office  mr  trump said his company had turned down a potentially lucrative deal in dubai closer to home  where fewer restrictions applied  the company focused on the prospect of new hotel lines in cities such as cincinnati  nashville and valley forge  pa the hotels were intended to target an audience different from the patrons of the existing five star trump properties  the scion  a four star line  would be a hipper boutique option  american idea  a chain of budget friendly hotels  would feature hints of americana  scion was announced before mr  trumps election  and the concept for american idea materialized after the trumps spotted an opportunity during the campaign to expand into farther flung markets with fewer hotel options potential partners  though  were put under a microscope the company aborted a scion deal that was under discussion in dallas  after the times reported that the prospective partner had ties to russia and kazakhstan and the trumps outside ethics adviser raised questions about the potential deal  the times also reported that the chawlas  the partners in mississippi  had turned to the state government for millions of dollars in support through a tax rebate program new business activity slowed even further last year  and the company announced no new hotel deals  the trump organization briefly managed a livingston  n j   hotel owned by the family of jared kushner  mr  trumps son in law  and were in talks to open a scion on the jersey shore that the kushners would have owned  both of those endeavors fell through the mississippi hotels seemed to be the exception  though they were far behind schedule  the hotels showed signs of progress last year  including laying the foundation for some of the buildings trump hotel executives visited mississippi and spent considerable time working with the chawlas to revise the plans for the hotels the chawlas  in the statement  left open the possibility of doing business with the trumps in the future  we hope that when the time is right  they said  we can work with trump hotels again .
president trump has addressed the nation in prime time from the oval office  delivered remarks from the rose garden  met with democrats in the situation room and traveled to the border with mexico to make his case that the government would not reopen unless he got funding for a border wall thirty five days into the shutdown  the president announced on friday from the rose garden that the government would reopen until at least feb  15  giving congress time to work out a deal on border security he did not get any funding for a wall  and on friday  he did not advance any new arguments for building one  in fact  many of the claims he made were recycled heavily from previous comments and contained many of the same misstatements and exaggerations  also notable was something mr  trump did not say  namely that mexico would pay for the wall  one of the most often repeated  and unsupported  claims he has made on the border funding dispute the essence of mr  trumps pitch for a border wall  that a porous border had led to a crime and drug epidemic  remained unchanged last year  he said  immigrations and customs enforcement removed 10 000 known or suspected gang members like ms 13 and members as bad as them   this is exaggerated  the agency reported it had removed 5 872 known or suspected gang members in the 2018 fiscal year  in addition  mr  trump repeated the statistic that in the past two years  ice arrested a total of 266 000 criminal aliens inside of the united states  including those charged or convicted of nearly 100 000 assaults  30 000 sex crimes and 4 000 homicides or  as you would call them  violent  vicious killings  the figures include both charges and convictions  and each arrest may represent multiple offenses  the most common charges were traffic violations and drug and immigration offenses drugs kill much more than 70 000 americans a year and cost our society in excess of  700 billion  the president said  the figures are accurate for overdose deaths and the economic costs of addiction  but a border wall would do little to prevent the 35 percent of overdose deaths involving prescription opioids or the  627 5 billion in costs incurred because of tobacco  alcohol and prescription drug addiction still  the president pressed the case i believe that crime in this country can go down by a massive percentage if we have great security on our southern border  mr  trump said  i believe drugs  large percentages of which come through the southern border  will be cut by a number that nobody will believe the claim that a wall would lead to a huge decrease in crime is not supported by statistics  construction of a wall would not suddenly remove millions of undocumented immigrants already in the united states  and there is no evidence of a causal link between immigration and crime  as for drugs  90 percent of heroin coming into the united states enters through the southern border  but it is mostly smuggled through legal ports of entry and not wall less areas  most fentanyl arrives in the united states from china through the mail though border crossings have been declining for nearly two decades  mr  trump continued to stress the need for a border wall with exaggerated data and overstated claims last month was the third straight month in a row with 60 000 apprehensions on our southern border  he said  think of that  we apprehended 60 000 people that monthly figure for october and november  data for december was not yet publicly posted  includes the 51 000 people caught illegally crossing the border  as well as the 9 000 to 10 000 people who attempted to enter through legal ports of entry but were deemed inadmissible each month  in the 2018 fiscal year  apprehensions at the border averaged 33 000 per month and he recounted with graphic detail what happens to victims of smugglers  women are tied up  theyre bound  duct tape put around their faces  around their mouths  in many cases  they cant even breathe  theyre put in the backs of cars or vans or trucks  they dont go through your port of entry  they make a right turn going very quickly it is possible that mr  trump learned of a duct taping case from law enforcement officers  but more than a dozen experts in human trafficking told the washington post and the toronto star that they had not witnessed or heard of such an episode for emphasis  he added  its at the worst level  human trafficking  in the history of the world  millions of africans were forcibly enslaved and trafficked during the 15th and 18th centuries mr  trump thanked federal workers for their sacrifice and support  not only did you not complain  but in many cases  you encouraged me to keep going because you care so much about our country and about its border security  whatever mr  trump may have personally heard  polls have shown the opposite  most civil servants have overwhelmingly opposed the shutdown beyond federal workers  he said  republicans and democrats  and  by extension  the american people  are for complete border security  and they have finally and fully acknowledged that having barriers  fencing or walls  or whatever you want to call it  will be an important part of the solution a washington post poll this week noted that surveys have consistently showed that a majority of americans do not support the wall  the post abc news poll found that 54 percent of americans oppose the project  while 42 percent support it  unchanged from a survey two weeks ago on friday  the president said  we do not need 2 000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea  we never did  he added that he had never proposed such a thing  dozens of times during the 2016 campaign  mr  trump promised to build a wall along the southwestern border  usually saying it would be 1 000 miles long at varying heights and costs  at times  the building materials changed  he mentioned concrete  steel and  at one point  even a wall that would have solar panels  but a wall and the unsupported pledge that mexico would pay for it were foundational elements of his campaign  and mr  trump has continued to make similar assertions throughout his presidency .
president trump leaned hard on the strength of the american economy during his second state of the union address on tuesday  but with a blend of precise statistics and gauzy superlatives that are much more difficult to measure he also returned to a theme that dominated the second year of his presidency  a quest for a border wall with mexico to cope with what he said is a crisis of crime and drugs in the united states caused by illegal immigration the two issues dominated his address  which in tone was more measured than his biting twitter feed  but in substance contained numerous claims that were false or misleading here is what mr  trump said and how it stacked up against the facts   sign up for crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  the u s  economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office  and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world the american economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 5 percent in the third quarter of 2018  growth in latvia and poland was almost twice as fast  same for china and india  even the troubled greek economy posted stronger growth  and a wide range of economic analysts estimate that the growth of the american economy slowed in the fourth quarter  and slowed even further in the first month of 2019  we recently imposed tariffs on  250 billion of chinese goods  and now our treasury is receiving billions and billions of dollars since mr  trump imposed tariffs on certain imports from china  and imported steel and aluminum from around the world  federal tariff revenues have increased  revenues from customs duties  which include tariffs  rose by  13 billion in the third quarter of 2018 compared with a year earlier  the commerce department reported  technically  that money is paid by americans who bring the goods across the border  and it is often passed on to american consumers in the form of higher prices my administration has cut more regulations in a short period of time than any other administration during its entire tenure the trump administration has slowed the pace of adopting new rules  and it has moved to roll back some existing or proposed federal regulations  particularly in the area of environmental protection  the white house claimed that as of october  a total of  33 billion worth of future regulator costs had been eliminated  but experts say the scale of the rollbacks in the trump era still does not exceed extensive cuts in federal rules during the carter and reagan administrations  when rules governing airline  truck and rail transportation were wiped off the books  among other changes  we have created 5 3 million new jobs and importantly added 600 000 new manufacturing jobs  something which almost everyone said was impossible to do  but the fact is  we are just getting started  the bureau of labor statistics reports that since january 2017  when mr  trump took office  the economy has added 4 9 million jobs  including 454 000 jobs manufacturing jobs  far from being impossible  that is closely comparable to the pace of job creation during some two year periods during the obama administration  and significantly slower than the pace of job creation in manufacturing in the 1990s wages were growing for blue collar workers  who i promised to fight for  they are growing faster than anyone thought possible wages are rising faster for construction and manufacturing workers than workers in service occupations  according to the labor department more people are working now than at any time in our history while the total number of people working in the united states is higher than ever  it is not because of the presidents policies  it is because more people than ever live in the united states  the border city of el paso  tex   used to have extremely high rates of violent crime  one of the highest in the entire country  and considered one of our nations most dangerous cities  now  immediately upon its building  with a powerful barrier in place  el paso is one of the safest cities in our country  el paso was never one of the most dangerous cities in the united states  and crime has been declining in cities across the country  not just el paso  for reasons that have nothing to do with border fencing  in 2008  before border barriers had been completed in el paso  the city had the second lowest violent crime rate among more than 20 similarly sized cities  in 2010  after the fencing went up  it held that place san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country  in response  a strong security wall was put in place  this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings  border apprehensions decreased by 91 percent in the san diego sector between the 1994 fiscal year  right after the original border fencing was completed  to the 2018 fiscal year  but  according to the congressional research service  that fence alone did not have a discernible impact on the number of immigrants crossing the border into the united states illegally  as we speak  large  organized caravans are on the march to the united states at the end of january  a new caravan of thousands of migrants from central america was headed north  and some of the travelers said they intended to try to cross into the united states  but many in the caravan have said they plan to remain in mexico  thanks in part to policies put in place by the new mexican government  president andrs manuel lpez obrador has made it easier for central americans to get visas and work in mexico  president trumps warnings of an imminent invasion from new caravans is overstated i hope you can pass the u s m c a  into law  so we can bring back our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers  expanding american agriculture  protecting intellectual property  and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words  made in the u s a the revised trade deal with canada and mexico  known as the united states mexico canada agreement  does include provisions that are intended to bring manufacturing jobs back to the united states  like minimum wage provisions for some auto manufacturing  but some economists have said those provisions could ultimately push more manufacturing  and jobs  outside north america  the deal does allow american farmers to sell more dairy products to canada  but the trade pact has yet to be approved by congress  and both democrats and republicans say that is unlikely to happen without significant changes  when i took office  isis controlled more than 20 000 square miles in iraq and syria  just two years ago  today  we have liberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters  the defense department reports that the islamic state now controls only around 20 square miles of territory in syria  down from 34 000 in 2014  but many of the gains against the sunni extremist caliphate began under president barack obama  with the trump administration continuing obama administration policy  and the top american military commander in the middle east told a senate hearing on tuesday that the islamic state could return if the united states and its allies abandoned the fight  in december  mr  trump announced he was withdrawing american troops from syria we condemn the brutality of the maduro regime  whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in south america into a state of abject poverty and despair this has become a popular talking point among american conservatives  it is true that the rule of president nicols maduro of venezuela has brought that country to economic ruin  inflation is at astronomical rates  and ordinary people are struggling to get basic food and health supplies  three million citizens have fled  some of the collapse can be traced to mr  maduros economic policies  which do fall under the broad label of socialism  but analysts say that corruption  the lack of rule of law and the absence of democracy  all the hallmarks of a dictatorship  have played just as big or larger roles  if i had not been elected president of the united states  we would right now  in my opinion  be in a major war with north korea  in 2016  at the end of the obama administration  there was no sign that the united states and north korea were about to go to war  though pyongyang had been conducting nuclear tests and mr  obama had continued economic sanctions  in mr  trumps first year in office  he increased tensions with north korea by attacking its leader  kim jong un  in a series of twitter posts  which prompted hostile statements from pyongyang  mr  trump wrote that north koreas actions would be met with fire and fury and called mr  kim little rocket man  analysts said at the time that the chances of war between the two nations had grown because of these exchanges lawmakers in new york cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mothers womb moments from birth on jan  22  the 46th anniversary of the supreme courts landmark decision roe v  wade  gov  andrew m  cuomo  democrat of new york  signed the reproductive health act  the new law ensures a womans right to an abortion in new york if roe v  wade were to be overturned  it does not broadly allow abortions until shortly before birth  as mr  trump suggested  instead  it will allow for an abortion after 24 weeks to protect the mothers health or if the fetus is not viable  under the prior law  abortions were allowed after 24 weeks only if the womans life was in jeopardy we had the case of the governor of virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth in an interview last month  gov  ralph northam said that he supported a late term abortion bill that would loosen restrictions on the procedure  and allow women to consult with a doctor on an abortion up to  but not including  the time of birth the governor  a pediatric neurologist  also talked about some of the dangerous medical emergencies that pregnant women could face  such as carrying a nonviable fetus  he said that in such a case  the mother would deliver the infant and then  the infant would be resuscitated if thats what the mother and the family desired  and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother  while mr  northam was talking about an end of life care discussion in the case of a child that would not live  republicans seized on his remarks as

san diego  migrants who are allowed to remain in the united states to pursue asylum are usually given a choice when they are released from detention in san diego  go to the greyhound bus station and fend for themselves  or try to find a cot and a shower at a local shelter one way or another  once the migrants have been dropped off by discreet white immigration and customs enforcement vans in border towns across the southwest  they are no longer the federal governments problem president trump has tried and failed to end a practice he derisively calls catch and release  and thousands of undocumented migrants apprehended at the border every month are still being granted routine entry to the united states while their cases are processed by immigration courts but as the number of migrant families in recent months has overwhelmed the governments detention facilities  the trump administration has drastically reduced its efforts to ensure the migrants safety after they are released  people working along the border say an ever larger number of families are being released with nowhere to stay  no money  no food and no means of getting to friends and relatives who may be hundreds or thousands of miles away federal officials say they are unable to do more to help the migrants  and local governments have often been hesitant to get involved because of cost and potential liability stepping into the void has been a growing network of charities  expanding along the border from california to texas  dating back well into the obama administration  when the surge in migrant families began  these churches and other nongovernmental organizations have strung together millions of dollars worth of assistance to help keep migrants off the streets and speed their reunion with family members in the united states the government isnt doing anything  its been a total make it up as we go thing  said kevin malone  one of the founders of the san diego rapid response network  a consortium of faith based nonprofits in the area  people are working 24 hours a day trying to make this happen  everyone is strapped while there has never been a good solution to the issue of what to do with migrants after they are released by immigration agents  recent steps by the trump administration have exacerbated the situation undocumented migrants are held initially at border patrol and ice facilities as their claims for asylum are registered  previously  government agents would help coordinate plans for their release  contacting family members in american cities and helping secure transportation  even sometimes paying for bus tickets  when charity operated shelters were full  government agencies sometimes held them a little longer  until they could be transferred those practices  known collectively as safe release  ended in october  according to a statement from ice  because the agency has become overwhelmed by the number of migrants it has to process part of the problem  government officials say  is that the courts have established a limit of 20 days for holding migrant children in detention  and the government has a very limited number of detention facilities that can handle both adults and children  an earlier attempt to detain them separately was struck down by the courts and rescinded  waiting to coordinate releases with charity shelters can result in migrant families being held in detention for too long  officials say after decades of inaction by congress  the government remains severely constrained in its ability to detain and promptly remove families with no legal basis to remain in the u s   the agency said  to mitigate the risk of holding family units past the time frame allotted to the government  ice has curtailed reviews of post release plans from families apprehended along the southwest border yet those now trying to help the migrants say the government has abandoned its moral responsibility to make sure they are released safely under president obama  the government also had no infrastructure to provide services to newly released migrants  instead it relied on a cooperative relationship with private shelter operators  now  the shelter operators say  that cooperation has become fraught some charity networks have had to quickly become experts in refugee aid in american border towns  they provide showers  nutrition and clean clothes  many guests  as the volunteers call the migrants  arrive hungry  sick or traumatized  they need fresh diapers for their infants and clean clothes for their older children the sole shelter in san diego  run by jewish family service of san diego  has processed nearly 5 000 asylum applicants since it began operating two months ago  it was built on a wing and a prayer  according to mr  malone  and has had to move five times to find adequate space  newly arrived migrants are provided with austere blue cots  portable showers and donated bread and fruit  they are also screened for illnesses kate clark  the director of immigration services at jewish family service  said the organization stepped in nine weeks ago when it learned migrants were being dumped at the border  but despite californias political leaders talking about being receptive to migrants  every single night  our ability to ensure that none of the migrants are sleeping on the street is questionable  because of the capacity of our shelters  ms  clark said their operating costs run between  350 000 and  400 000 a month  largely raised by faith organizations and a gofundme account  still  on days when 100 or more refugees are dropped off  they have little option  because of capacity constraints  other than to turn away families and leave them homeless its been a difficult couple of years  but theres never been anything like this  said etleva bejko  the director of refugee services at the organization the charities have also had to learn how to cope with the illnesses that migrants can develop during the difficult journey from central america  which many make on buses and on foot marcela wash  a registered nurse who has helped treat migrants in san diego  said that many arrive dehydrated and in various states of medical distress  rashes  scabies  and respiratory infections have been extremely common  she said  she estimated that 80 percent of the women she saw had lice their journeys were hard  of course  but many of these things they caught either at a shelter in tijuana or in detention  she said once migrants are healthy enough to travel  the shelter pays to transport them to join relatives wherever they are in the country  while their cases proceed in court some border towns have a more established base of nonprofit assistance for migrants  but they too have seen demands grow in recent months in el paso  the annunciation house has coordinated migrant releases with ice for years  the migrants typically stay for a few days at the charitys main building or at one of nearly two dozen churches  hotels and other sites that are part of its shelter network  in recent months  the charity has been assisting about 2 200 migrants a week in el paso on a recent afternoon  the shelters headquarters  a red brick building about a mile from the border  bustled with activity  part migrant dormitory  part cafeteria and part triage center  upstairs  a worker holding bundles of laundry walked past family dorm rooms with bunk beds  as the aroma of a dinner being prepared filled the halls  downstairs  migrant families waiting for a ride to the bus station kept busy by helping to unload a ups truck parked outside  a new batch of donations had arrived  to add to the towers of amazon boxes full of clothing and other goods that people around the country had donated the cost of these operations can be crushing  in just two texas border regions  the el paso and mcallen areas  several catholic groups  charities and local governments have spent roughly  2 million in recent years on migrant relief efforts on friday  ruben garcia  the director of annunciation house  was preparing to pay for several rooms at a hotel for the next seven days to handle an overflow of migrants from their shelter  the tab came to about  14 000  depending on the number of migrants ice releases  the shelters hotel expenses can climb as high as  150 000 a month bureaucracy and politics can tie up more significant investments at the local level  mr  malone  the executive director of the san diego organizing project  said san diego municipal and county officials have suggested to him they have been waiting for the state to officially declare a crisis to lend a hand  he presumed that had to do with the bottom line it became just a bunch of people pointing fingers  said mr  malone  and at the end of the day  the other question was  who is going to pay the check  thats the real reason that no one talked about the california department of social services gave the

washington  president trumps repeated threat to declare a national emergency so he can build his border wall without congressional approval has been denounced by democrats as extreme and an overreach  but it could be the only politically realistic way out of the shutdown crisis in the nations capital i think we might work a deal  and if we dont  i may go that route  i have the absolute right to do national emergency if i want  mr  trump told reporters on wednesday  my threshold will be if i cant make a deal with people that are unreasonable if the president does invoke emergency powers to circumvent congress  it would be an extraordinary violation of constitutional norms  and establish a precedent for presidents who fail to win approval for funding a policy goal but mr  trumps threatened move offers both sides a face saving solution in the budget standoff between the president and congressional democrats that has prompted a partial government shutdown  which  if it lasts to saturday  will be at 22 days the longest in american history both sides have taken absolutist positions that leave no room for the kind of split the difference compromise that usually ends budget impasses  mr  trump refuses to accept anything less than his demand for about  5 billion in wall spending  and house speaker nancy pelosi has said his wall along the southern border would be immoral but mr  trumps claim that he can and may attempt to build his wall another way opens the door for him to sign a spending bill with no wall funding  reopening the government without capitulation by either side while any such move by mr  trump is certain to prompt outrage from his critics and wild approval from his supporters  there is good reason to believe that it is unlikely to result in much immediate change  his push for a wall would be channeled into a lengthy court fight  keeping lawyers far busier than construction workers  at least initially  as his term ticks away were going to be in 2020 before this gets resolved  said walter e  dellinger iii  a former solicitor general in the clinton administration  adding  if they are just planning where to build slats  judges are unlikely to decide that requires expedition in the supreme court  i think they would recognize the wisdom of going slow if  in the end  the supreme court were to rule that emergency power laws give mr  trump authority to proceed  he would probably face still more litigation with property owners over whether the government may use eminent domain to force them to sell their border lands  there may be little time left in his term after all that to add more than a few miles  if any  of barriers to the 1 954 mile border  which already has 654 miles of fencing and if the court instead eventually ruled against him  mr  trump could honestly tell his supporters that he tried  and then vow to renew the push if he is re elected  indeed  he has suggested that he would relish still having the issue of wall to once again rev up supporters in the campaign  he wrote on twitter late last month that democrats may have enough votes to stop his wall  but we have the issue  border security  2020 in the meantime  the shutdown that is threatening to last for months could end  hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors could once again receive their wages and pay household bills  national parks could reopen and be cleaned  needy families could keep receiving food assistance  across the economy  farmers and businesses that depend on government actions could proceed with work they need to be handled its a way to get past an ugly fight in a way that allows the dust to settle and passions to cool while moving on  said bruce buchanan  an emeritus professor of political science at the university of texas at austin if mr  trump does invoke emergency powers  fierce criticism would follow  of the 58 times presidents have declared emergencies since congress reformed emergency powers laws in 1976  none involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval  chris edelson  an american university government professor and author of a 2013 book  emergency presidential power  from the drafting of the constitution to the war on terror  said he could recall no such instance in the first two centuries of american history  either the precedent mr  trump would establish raises the risk of longer term damage to the american constitutional system  undermining peoples confidence in the countrys democracy  said elizabeth goitein  who oversaw a recent study of presidential emergency powers for the brennan center for justice at new york university school of law it is a crisis when the president of the united states flouts the role of congress and abuses his powers in order to get around the will of congress and to undermine the democratic process for lawmaking set forth in the constitution  she said ms  goitein and other experts who have studied emergency powers laws have said there are serious  if not dispositive  arguments that mr  trumps legal team can make that at least two such statutes could be used to erect border barriers by redirecting military construction funds that can be freed up  in a presidentially declared emergency  to build something congress has not approved but she and others maintain that it would be an abuse of power for mr  trump to proclaim that there is a national emergency along the southern border that justifies a wall  the number of people illegally crossing the border is far lower than it was a generation ago  the recent phenomenon of caravans of central american migrants largely consists of people who present themselves to border officials and request asylum and despite repeated false claims by trump officials that terrorists are infiltrating the country across the border  including by the thousands  no one in the modern era who committed a terrorist attack on domestic soil has turned out to have sneaked in via mexico many legal experts nevertheless expect that in the inevitable litigation  the justice department would pressure judges not to even consider the facts  arguing that courts must defer to the presidents judgment about whether an emergency exists rather than substituting their own thinking but even though courts have traditionally given substantial deference to the presidents determinations in security matters  mr  dellinger said that should not be true within the executive branch  he said it was the obligation of senior justice department officials who review the legality of proposed government actions  the head of the office of legal counsel  steven a  engel  and the acting attorney general  matthew g  whitaker  to independently assess whether there really is a justifiable basis to declare an emergency  and if there is not  to tell mr  trump no  or resign if there is not  in fact  a persuasive basis for this being the kind of national emergency that was contemplated by congress  and it is nevertheless approved by the department of justice  what is the rule of law cost  what kind of slope does that start us down  mr  dellinger said  one question is whether there is some other way out of this current mess that doesnt involve such a cost to the rule of law .
the federal government received more than 4 500 complaints in four years about the sexual abuse of immigrant children who were being held at government funded detention facilities  including an increase in complaints while the trump administrations policy of separating migrant families at the border was in place  the justice department revealed this week the records  which involve children who had entered the country alone or had been separated from their parents  detailed allegations that adult staff members had harassed and assaulted children  including fondling and kissing minors  watching them as they showered  and raping them  they also included cases of suspected abuse of children by other minors from october 2014 to july 2018  the office of refugee resettlement  a part of the health and human services department that cares for so called unaccompanied minors  received a total of 4 556 allegations of sexual abuse or sexual harassment  1 303 of which were referred to the justice department  of those 1 303 cases deemed the most serious  178 were accusations that adult staff members had sexually assaulted immigrant children  while the rest were allegations of minors assaulting other minors  the report said the safety of minors is our top concern when administering the uac program  jonathan h  hayes  the acting director of the office of refugee resettlement  said in a statement  using an abbreviation for unaccompanied children  none of the allegations involved o r r  federal staff  these allegations were all fully investigated and remedial action was taken where appropriate  read the latest edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  the records do not detail the outcome of every complaint  but they indicate that some accusations were determined to be unfounded or lacking enough evidence to prosecute  in one case  a staff member at a chicago detention facility was accused in april 2015 of fondling and kissing a child and was later charged with a crime  the report did not state whether that person had been found guilty the documents  first reported by axios  were made public by representative ted deutch  democrat of florida  the night before a house judiciary committee hearing on tuesday about the trump administrations policy of family separations at the southern border  that policy  which was put in place last spring  resulted in more than 2 700 children being separated from their parents under president trumps zero tolerance policy of prosecuting anyone caught crossing the border illegally  including those with families seeking asylum on humanitarian grounds for most of the four years covered by the report  the number of allegations made to the office of refugee resettlement stayed about the same from month to month  but the number of complaints rose after the trump administration enacted its separation policy  from march 2018 to july 2018  the agency received 859 complaints  the largest number of reports during any five month span in the previous four years  of those  342 allegations were referred to the justice department  the report showed during the hearing on tuesday  a discussion of the records sparked a heated exchange between mr  deutch and cmdr  jonathan white of the united states public health service commissioned corps  who last year repeatedly warned a top official in health and human services that the family separation policy could permanently traumatize young children as mr  deutch read some of the report  commander white interjected  that is false he later apologized  claiming that a vast majority of allegations proved to be unfounded  he said he was unaware of any accusations against staff members that were found to have merit .
id like to apologize to all the banana republics ive offended over the decades with snarky references to their dysfunction  this is karma  i now live in a nation where a petulant president has shut down much of the most powerful government in the world  so the white house isnt even paying its water bills the government has shut down before  under presidents of both parties  but this shutdown is particularly childish and unnecessary  to revise churchill  rarely have so many suffered so much at the hands of so few its difficult to pick the craziest of the arguments that president trump is making about the shutdown  theres a vast buffet of imbecility to choose from  but heres my good faith effort 1  this is a crisis  terrorists are crossing the border  rapists this is more like a lull than a crisis  the number of people apprehended at the border remains near a 45 year low  from 1972 on  there were more apprehensions every single year than there were in 2017 as for terrorists  experts say that there isnt a single known case of a terrorist sneaking into the united states along unfenced areas of the southern border  ever 2  only a wall can do the job  a big beautiful wall that stops people and drugs house speaker nancy pelosi was wrong to describe a wall as an immorality  for we need border security  and a wall in some places can be effective  but a great majority of the undocumented immigrants in the country didnt arrive by sneaking across the border  but rather came legally  often at airports  and overstayed their visas  the most beautiful of walls wouldnt stop them likewise  drug smuggling is a real problem  but narcotics have mostly been smuggled in on trucks  cars and airplanes at official ports of entry  or through tunnels under the border  or through the postal system  not by individuals crossing remote parts of the border the daily show dug up a 2004 college graduation speech in which trump counseled perseverance of just the kind that makes walls  by themselves  not terribly effective  never  ever give up   if theres a concrete wall in front of you  go through it  go over it  go around it  but get to the other side of the wall  3  but this is a humanitarian issue yes  it is  the most egregious humanitarian concern has been trumps brutal policy of separating children from parents at the border kids are still being separated  lee gelernt of the a c l u  told me  mostly the government does this when it says that a parent has a criminal history  but the offenses sometimes were minor or unsubstantiated meanwhile  the government shutdown causes other tragedies  for example  even in normal times 3 000 people a year die in the united states from food borne illness  yet the food and drug administration has now had to stop most routine food inspections  with inspectors sent home on furlough  the result may well be more people getting sick or dying from food poisoning 4  the president doesn t need congress  after all  he s the president plenty of people would be a bit relieved if trump took the dubious route of declaring a national emergency and trying to steal  er  divert money intended for disaster victims to pay for his wall  it might be a way out of our national stalemate  allowing the government to reopen but look  folks  when we welcome our president doing something possibly illegal  as he unjustly takes money from disaster victims  that just confirms that we have a crisis  not at the border but in washington trumps wall isnt about governing but about creating a political symbol and rallying his base  the problem is that its an expensive symbol by my calculations  the  5 7 billion could send 100 000 at risk american kids to a high quality preschool for a year and provide pell grants for 100 000 students to attend college for a full four years  with enough left over to also provide a years comprehensive treatment to 115 000 americans struggling with opioid addiction 5  anyway  mexico will pay for the wall trump repeatedly declared that mexico would pay for the wall  and he still insists that mexico will pay for it indirectly many  many times over  so i have a solution to the whole mess since mexico will pay for the wall eventually  the problem now is one of cash flow  fortunately  we have financial instruments to deal with precisely this issue i propose that trump pay the  5 7 billion himself  and then the u s  will repay him  with a nice interest rate  as the mexican payments for the wall pour in  the federal reserve can verify the mexican income stream and forward the sums to trump since hes so confident that the wall will pay for itself  he should be delighted with this option  right  mr  president .

washington  president trump doubled down on one of the biggest gambles of his presidency on tuesday night with a televised appeal to pressure congress into paying for his long promised border wall  even at the cost of leaving the government partly closed until lawmakers give in embarking on a strategy that he himself privately disparaged as unlikely to work  mr  trump devoted the first prime time oval office address of his presidency to his proposed barrier in hopes of enlisting public support in an ideological and political conflict that has shut the doors of many federal agencies for 18 days in a nine minute speech that made no new arguments but included multiple misleading assertions  the president sought to recast the situation at the mexican border as a humanitarian crisis and opted against declaring a national emergency to bypass congress  which he had threatened to do  at least for now  but he excoriated democrats for blocking the wall  accusing them of hypocrisy and exposing the country to criminal immigrants  read our fact checks of mr  trumps speech  how much more american blood must we shed before congress does its job  mr  trump asked  citing a litany of grisly crimes said to be committed by illegal immigrants  asking americans to call their lawmakers  he added  this is a choice between right and wrong  justice and injustice  this is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the american citizens we serve democrats dismissed his talk of crisis as overstated cynicism and  with polls showing mr  trump bearing more of the blame since the partial shutdown began last month  betrayed no signs of giving in  the white house earlier in the day dispatched vice president mike pence and others to capitol hill to try to shore up senate republicans  who are growing increasingly anxious as the standoff drags on in their own televised response on tuesday night  speaker nancy pelosi of california and senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  accused the president of stoking fear and mocked him for asking taxpayers to foot the bill for a wall he had long said mexico would pay for president trump must stop holding the american people hostage  must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government  ms  pelosi said in taking his argument to a national television audience and on a trip to the texas border he plans to take on thursday  mr  trump hoped to reframe the debate  after spending much of the first two weeks of the shutdown cloistered in the white house  he has now opted to use the powers of the presidency to focus public attention on his ominous warnings about the border  full transcripts  trumps speech and the democratic response  yet privately  mr  trump dismissed his own new strategy as pointless  in an off the record lunch with television anchors hours before the address  he made clear in blunt terms that he was not inclined to give the speech or go to texas  but was talked into it by advisers  according to two people briefed on the discussion who asked not to be identified sharing details its not going to change a damn thing  but im still doing it  mr  trump said of the border visit  according to one of the people  who was in the room  the trip was merely a photo opportunity  he said  but  he added  gesturing at his communications aides bill shine  sarah huckabee sanders and kellyanne conway  these people behind you say its worth it mr  trump plans to head to the capitol on wednesday to attend a senate republican lunch and later will host congressional leaders from both parties to resume negotiations that so far have made little progress  mr  trump has insisted on  5 7 billion for the wall  while ms  pelosi said she would not give him a dollar for a wall she has called immoral in a nod to democrats  mr  trump spent the first half of his talk on the humanitarian situation at the border before even mentioning the wall  expressing sympathy for those victimized by human smugglers  this is a humanitarian crisis  a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul  he said even so  he directly took on ms  pelosi and mr  schumer  the only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized  he said mr  trump has made the wall the singular focus of his presidency as he enters his third year in office  his promise to erect a big  beautiful wall along the border became perhaps the most memorable promise on the campaign trail this fall  eliciting chants from supporters of build the wall  and he has been frustrated by his inability to deliver on it but his alarming description of a crisis at the border has raised credibility questions  while experts agree there are serious problems to address  migrant border crossings have actually been declining for nearly two decades  the majority of heroin enters the united states through legal ports of entry  not through open areas of the border  and the state department said in a recent report that there was no credible evidence that terrorist groups had sent operatives to enter the united states through mexico at one point in his speech  he even suggested that democrats had signaled that they would accept his wall if redesigned  at the request of democrats  it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall  he said  even though democratic leaders have made clear they oppose the barrier regardless of the material even so  democrats  many of whom like mr  schumer voted in 2006 for 700 miles of fencing along the border  did not want to conduct the debate on mr  trumps terms  instead  they focused attention on the damaging effects of the shutdown  already the second longest in american history  about 800 000 government employees are either furloughed or working without pay  in addition to hundreds of thousands of contractors house democrats planned to approve individual spending bills this week that were intended to reopen closed departments one at a time in hopes of putting republicans on the defensive  but senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  has said he would not put any bill on the floor without mr  trumps explicit support senate democrats took to the floor on tuesday to pressure mr  mcconnell and vowed to block consideration of other legislation until the government is reopened mr  mcconnell fired back  noting the 2006 legislation  maybe the democratic party was for secure borders before they were against them  he said  or maybe theyre just making it up as they go along  or maybe they are that dead set on opposing this particular president on any issue  for any reason  just for the sake of opposing him but two more republicans  senators lisa murkowski of alaska and shelley moore capito of west virginia  spoke out on tuesday in favor of reopening the government while negotiations over border security continue  i think we can walk and chew gum  ms  murkowski told reporters ms  capito expressed frustration with the shutdown and how useless it is  indicating that she might support reopening the government while wall talks continue  i mean  i think i could live with that  but lets see what he says tonight  she said before the speech that makes five republican senators who have expressed such a position  which if combined with a unanimous democratic caucus would make a majority to reopen the government if mr  mcconnell were to allow a vote allies of the president warned fellow republicans to stand with mr  trump  if we undercut the president  thats the end of his presidency and the end of our party  senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina  said on fox news after the speech the political nature of the fight was hard to miss  just hours before he went on air  mr  trumps re election campaign sent out a fund raising email asking supporters to raise  500 000 by the time his speech began  on the other side  senator bernie sanders of vermont  a possible candidate for the democratic presidential nomination next year  offered his own response after ms  pelosi and mr  schumer for all of the pyrotechnics of competing national speeches  it seemed like a political kabuki dance that by the end of the evening had changed no minds in washington representative hakeem jeffries of new york  the no  5 house democrat  who perhaps most succinctly summed up his partys response  we are not paying a  5 billion ransom note for your medieval border wall  he wrote on twitter  with a castle emoji  and nothing you just said will change that cold  hard reality if democrats do not approve money for the wall  mr  trump has threatened to declare a national emergency and proceed with construction without congress  a move that could provoke a constitutional clash with the legislative branch over the power of the federal purse  while some legal experts said the president has a plausible case given current law  it would almost surely generate a court challenge even some republicans warned against it  senator susan collins of maine said that although the law provides the president with emergency powers  the administration should not act on a claim of dubious constitutional authority  she added  it should get authorization from congress before repurposing such a significant sum of money for a border wall the wall is popular with mr  trumps base  but the public at large holds the president responsible for the shutdown  according to polls  in a reuters ipsos poll  51 percent of respondents said that mr  trump deserves most of the blame  up four percentage points from earlier in the crisis  while 32 percent pointed the finger at congressional democrats moreover  the public seems to have grown weary of the impasse  seventy percent of registered voters in the latest the hill harrisx poll favored a compromise  while just 30 percent said sticking to principles was more important than reopening the government the presidents use of the oval office for the speech stirred some debate  with critics asserting that a setting more typically used for occasions of war or other national security crises was being turned into a partisan platform  the subsequent joint statement by ms  pelosi and mr  schumer was the first time opposition leaders were given national airtime to respond to a president in the oval office not counting speeches to congress  mr  trump had made only five formal addresses to the nation before tuesday night  three of them in prime time and none from the oval office  according to mark knoller  a longtime cbs news journalist who tracks recent presidential history  mr  trumps previous prime time speeches were to introduce his two supreme court nominations and to announce his decision to send more troops to afghanistan by contrast  president bill clinton gave 16 addresses to the nation over eight years  14 of them from the oval office  president george w  bush gave 23 such addresses  six from the oval office  and president barack obama gave 12  with three from his office .
washington  america will get its first taste of divided government under president trump this week when a democratic house tries to wrest control of the political agenda from mr  trump  who appears determined to keep the focus on border security  immigration and his big  beautiful wall after the midterm elections ushered in the most diverse freshman class in history  house democrats intend to put a spotlight on the issues that worked well for them during the campaign  diminishing the influence of the wealthy and connected  expanding voting rights  lowering prescription drug costs and passing a bipartisan infrastructure bill mr  trump  on the defensive and presiding over a federal government that remains partially closed  is trying to stomp on that message  on tuesday  as the government shutdown was in its 11th day  mr  trump invited congressional leaders of both parties to a briefing on border security wednesday afternoon  sarah huckabee sanders  the white house press secretary  said on tuesday night that mr  trump would attend it would be the first visit by democratic leaders to the white house since dec  11  when the president told representative nancy pelosi and senator chuck schumer he would be proud to shut down the government for border security mr  trump appeared to make a gesture of peace ahead of wednesdays meeting border security and the wall thing and shutdown is not where nancy pelosi wanted to start her tenure as speaker  he said tuesday on twitter  lets make a deal just what deal mr  trump had in mind was not clear  while ms  pelosi has repeatedly signaled she would like to find a compromise that would allow the government to reopen  she has also made it clear that a wall cannot be part of any such deal  whether or not that leads to a messy start to her speakership after she is elected speaker on thursday  she hopes to introduce a transparency in governing measure to portray democrats as a responsible governing party and draw a contrast between them and mr  trumps scandal ridden administration  the measure would require disclosure of shadowy political donors  end gerrymandering of congressional districts and expand voting rights but their first order of business will be reopening the government  as ms  pelosi said tuesday on twitter in response to mr  trump the president has given democrats a great opportunity to show how we will govern responsibly   quickly pass our plan to end the irresponsible  trumpshutdown  she said  just the first sign of things to come democrats also intend to use their first months in the majority to push for a bipartisan infrastructure bill and legislation to lower prescription drug costs  issues that they believe will have bipartisan appeal the democrats plan to pass two bills on thursday  the first includes six bipartisan spending measures that would fully fund agencies like the interior department and the internal revenue service through the end of the fiscal year in september  the second would fund the department of homeland security through feb  8  with  1 3 billion for fencing but no money for a wall on the mexican border with the plan facing a shaky future in the senate and an intransigent president  some rank and file lawmakers in both parties are suggesting that a deal to revamp the nations immigration laws  pairing border security and protections for some undocumented immigrants  may be the way out of the stalemate how about comprehensive immigration reform  representative debbie dingell  democrat of michigan  said on cnn on tuesday  when asked how democrats intend to compromise with mr  trump one of mr  trumps closest allies  senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina  has revived his long stalled immigration proposal to marry  5 billion for the wall with immigration law changes that might appeal to democrats  including three year renewable work permits for young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children  known as dreamers mr  trump has raised the prospects of broader talks on twitter  we will be forced to close the southern border entirely if the obstructionist democrats do not give us the money to finish the wall   also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with  he said last week  hard to believe there was a congress   president who would approve mr  trump has also claimed  somewhat misleadingly  that democrats had already voted for a wall im in the oval office  he tweeted on monday  democrats  come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for border security  including the wall  you voted yes in 2006 and 2013 he was referring to the secure fence act of 2006  which authorized building a fence along 700 miles of the southern border  and to a 2013 comprehensive immigration bill  that bill passed the senate with 68 votes but did not make it out of the house  it combined the republican priority of enhanced border security with the democratic goal of offering legalization and a pathway to citizenship for the nations 11 million undocumented immigrants democratic leaders are wary of any immigration negotiations with mr  trump  whom they view as an unreliable partner  representative hakeem jeffries of new york  the new chairman of the house democratic caucus  said in an interview on tuesday that democrats would not again broach immigration before the government is reopened we do have a broken immigration system that needs to be fixed in a sustainable and bipartisan way  mr  jeffries said  however  its impossible to have a mature conversation about comprehensive immigration reform in the midst of a reckless trump shutdown sparked by his desire to build a medieval border wall democrats have not forgotten that a year ago  when they talked to mr  trump about daca  he promised to work with them on a bill of love  only to back away  prompting mr  schumer to declare that negotiating with mr  trump was like negotiating with jell o senator chris van hollen  democrat of maryland  said the challenge lies with the republican majority in the senate if you want to get a bipartisan immigration bill in the coming months  youre going to have to have republican senators willing to work across the aisle to get things done  mr  van hollen said  i dont think they can give president trump the pen to write every word of legislation at the same time  democratic leaders will face pressures of their own  from a freshman class packed with first  and second generation immigrants  latinos and immigrant advocates  house democratic leaders and their staffs have indicated to immigration advocates that they plan to act on legislation to protect immigrants who face an imminent threat of deportation after the shutdown is over  that proposal would grant permanent residence to daca recipients and to others who came under temporary protected status  which mr  trump has also moved to rescind what we want in 2019 is early action on a bill that combines a permanent solution for dreamers and for t p s  holders  said frank sharry  the executive director of americas voice  an immigrant advocacy group democrats have already begun strategizing privately around such a bill  which would most likely pass the house with little to no republican support  but senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the republican leader  has shown little appetite for politically tricky measures that divide republicans or put them at odds with mr  trump  particularly on immigration the issue could expose fissures among democrats as well  liberals are agitating for measures such as abolishing immigration and customs enforcement  the agency that carries out deportations  or killing funding for immigration detention beds and enforcement agents but democratic congressional leaders and many rank and file members  including freshmen elected in districts carried in 2016 by mr  trump  say they are all for border security and enforcement  as long as it is effective and reasonable broader immigration legislation would be nice  if we had a reliable person at the other side of the table to negotiate with  said representative gerald e  connolly  democrat of virginia  i wouldnt be so bold as to predict a magic bullet .
ever since donald trumps upset victory over hillary clinton in 2016  much of the media attention has been on how democrats need to reconsider their strategy for winning voters in future elections  particularly obama to trump voters  but the results of the 2018 midterm elections suggest that republicans have some soul searching to do as well they lost the popular vote in six of the last seven presidential elections and suffered battering losses in the house in 2018  republican strategists must grapple with how to keep their party viable nationally  and our data suggests that trumpism may continue to hurt them in the future it has flown under the radar a bit  masked perhaps by the switch of millions of barack obamas voters into mr  trumps column  but in 2016 mr  trump did not receive support from a large segment of voters who pulled the lever for mitt romney in 2012  in fact  our data shows that 5 percent of romney 2012 voters stayed home in 2016  while another 5 percent voted for mrs  clinton  these voters tended to be female  nonwhite  younger and more highly educated  the very voters republicans feared would be alienated by a trump victory when he was seeking the partys nomination most strikingly  one third of 2012 romney voters who were under 40 in 2016 did not vote for mr  trump  but rather stayed home  voted for mrs  clinton or voted for a third party candidate  among the under 40 romney voters who supported mr  trump in 2016  16 percent appear to have defected from the party to vote for a democratic house candidate in 2018  of course  we dont know how they will vote in 2020  but what this means is that in the past two elections republicans may have lost more than 40 percent of romney voters born after 1976 republican house candidates performed worse among 18  to 39 year olds than they have in decades  the voters mr  trump and his party lost in 2016 and 2018 represent the future of american politics  if the republican party becomes the party of the past  that is  of aging white men with less education  it could make winning elections increasingly difficult to explore the characteristics and attitudes of these voters  we used data from the cooperative congressional election study  a large survey with a sample of more than 64 000 adults  we focus on three groups in this essay  romney to trump voters  romney to clinton voters and romney to nonvoters   we used validated voter turnout data rather than self reported turnout  which tends to overstate actual voter participation   four primary characteristics distinguished deserters from the 2012 romney coalition  gender  race  level of education and age defectors were disproportionately women  63 percent of romney to clinton voters were female compared with 46 percent of romney to trump voters  romney to nonvoters were 54 percent female perhaps unsurprisingly  given mr  trumps rhetoric  mr  trump shed a large share of 2012 romney voters of color  precisely the type of voters that republicans have been struggling to attract for some time  among romney to trump voters  91 percent were white  the breakdown for romney to nonvoters was very similar  with 89 percent white   however  among romney to clinton voters  the nonwhite share was twice as large  20 percent mr  trump also lost support from romney supporting college educated voters  while only one in four romney to trump voters had a college degree  39 percent of romney to clinton voters did  and 31 percent of romney to nonvoters were college educated crucially  the trump campaign alienated a lot of younger to middle aged voters who had turned out for mr  romney in 2012  four percent of romney to trump voters were under 30 years old in 2016  in contrast  18 percent of romney to clinton voters were under 30  as were 21 percent of romney to nonvoters  each of these patterns should raise red flags for republicans  even more so after 18  to 29 year olds went from supporting mrs  clinton by a 25 point margin in 2016 to supporting house democrats by a 44 point margin in 2018  according to the voter file firm catalist  but it is the graying of the republican coalition that is arguably the biggest threat to the partys prospects  it is true that on average  older people are more reliable voters than younger people  but the partisan identities and voting behaviors that people adopt early in the life cycle tend to stick  becoming routines that people carry on for the remainder of their lives  in addition  according to data for progress research  30 percent of millennial republicans prefer the republican party over mr  trump somewhat or strongly  while 65 percent prefer mr  trump somewhat or strongly  compared with 80 percent of boomer republicans and 81 percent of so called silent republicans  can republicans solve their demographic problem  a look at issue preferences indicates wooing back defectors will be difficult  on crucial issues facing the country  romney to clinton voters  romney to nonvoters and americans over all hold positions that are relatively far from romney to trump voters take two issues that have become central to mr  trumps presidency  immigration and trade  seventy four percent of romney to trump voters support deporting undocumented immigrants  but only 35 percent of romney to clinton voters  and 62 percent of romney to nonvoters  do  the average citizen is in between romney to clinton voters and romney to nonvoters  with 44 percent supporting deportation similarly  while 27 percent of romney to trump voters supported the trans pacific partnership  63 percent of romney to clinton voters  and 53 percent of romney to nonvoters  did  in short  the 2012 romney voters who did not vote for mr  trump have views that are pretty distant from the emerging republican consensus that drove mr  trumps victory and has been a central component of his presidency mr  trump may have won the white house with a thin margin built on winning over just enough obama voters in the right places  but this victory may ultimately have come at the expense of the republican partys long term electoral prospects  to win some of the romney coalition back  republicans would need to moderate their stances on some key issues  like immigration and trade  and  of course  exactly the opposite is happening  republican strategists will continue to work to expand on mr  trumps success  but their task will get harder and harder if mr  trump continues to move the party away from public opinion  .
washington  the supreme court agreed on friday to decide whether the trump administration may add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census questionnaire that will be sent to every household in the nation the courts move added a highly charged and consequential blockbuster to what had been a fairly sleepy term  the justices have mostly avoided controversy while they adjusted to the new conservative majority created by the arrival in the fall of justice brett m  kavanaugh the federal government has long gathered information about citizenship  but since 1950  it has not included a question on it in the forms sent once a decade to each household  last month  a federal trial judge blocked the commerce department from adding the question  saying that the process that led to the decision was deeply flawed the supreme court stepped in before any appeals court had ruled on the matter  and it put the case on an unusually fast track  the supreme courts speed was almost certainly a result of a looming deadline  the census forms are set to be printed in june without immediate action from the court  the solicitor general  noel j  francisco  told the justices  the government will be disabled for a decade from obtaining citizenship data through an enumeration of the entire population the supreme court scheduled arguments for late april  and it is expected to rule before the end of june the case  united states department of commerce v  new york  no  18 966  is the latest test of the scope of executive power in the trump era  last year  the justices upheld president trumps authority to restrict travel from several predominantly muslim countries  more recently  the court rejected the administrations request to reinstate a ban on asylum claims by immigrants who cross the southern border illegally on friday  mr  trump said he expected his declaration of a national emergency to build a border wall to be challenged in court  he predicted that the administration would lose in the lower courts but prevail in the supreme court the census case has its roots in the text of the constitution  which requires an actual enumeration every 10 years  with the house of representatives to be apportioned based on the whole number of persons in each state by its terms  therefore  the constitution mandates that every 10 years the federal government endeavor to count every single person residing in the united states  whether citizen or noncitizen  whether living here with legal status or without  judge jesse m  furman of the federal district court in manhattan wrote last month in his decision  setting out the consensus view critics say that adding the question on citizenship would undermine the accuracy of the census because both legal and unauthorized immigrants might refuse to fill out the forms  by one government estimate  about 6 5 million people might decide not to participate that could reduce democratic representation when congressional districts are drawn in 2021 and affect the distribution of hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending  judge furman found that were the question added  arizona  california  florida  illinois  new york and texas would risk losing seats in the house and that several states could lose federal money dale ho  a lawyer with the american civil liberties union  which challenged the addition of the citizenship question  said that it would cause incalculable damage to our democracy the evidence presented at trial exposed this was the trump administrations plan from the get go  mr  ho said wilbur ross  the commerce secretary  has said that he ordered the question to be added in response to a december 2017 request from the justice department  which said that data about citizenship would help it enforce the voting rights act of 1965 in a detailed decision after an eight day trial  judge furman concluded that mr  ross had dissembled  saying that the evidence is clear that secretary rosss rationale was pretextual while the court is unable to determine  based on the existing record  at least  what secretary rosss real reasons for adding the citizenship question were  it does find  by a preponderance of the evidence  that promoting enforcement of the voting rights act  or v r a   was not his real reason for the decision  judge furman wrote  instead  the court finds that the v r a  was a post hoc rationale for a decision that the secretary had already made for other reasons judge furman had called for mr  ross to be questioned under oath  but the supreme court blocked that order in october  justice neil m  gorsuch  joined by justice clarence thomas  said the court should have gone further  shutting down all pretrial fact gathering in the census case  justice gorsuch added that there was no indication of bad faith in mr  rosss conduct theres nothing unusual about a new cabinet secretary coming to office inclined to favor a different policy direction  soliciting support from other agencies to bolster his views  disagreeing with staff or cutting through red tape  justice gorsuch wrote at the time  of course  some people may disagree with the policy and process  but until now  at least  this much has never been thought enough to justify a claim of bad faith and launch an inquisition into a cabinet secretarys motives in november  the supreme court rejected a request from the trump administration to halt the trial  over the dissents of justices thomas  gorsuch and samuel a  alito jr in his ruling last month  judge furman relied on evidence in the so called administrative record  meaning the materials the government said mr  ross had considered before making his decision evidence presented at the trial showed that mr  ross had wanted to add the question long before the request from the justice department  the letter from the justice department  judge furman wrote  was an attempt to launder their request through another agency  that is  to obtain cover for a decision that they had already made documents disclosed in the case showed that mr  ross had discussed the citizenship issue early in his tenure with stephen k  bannon  the former white house chief strategist and an architect of the trump administrations tough policies against immigrants  and that mr  ross had met at mr  bannons direction with kris kobach  the former kansas secretary of state and a vehement opponent of unlawful immigration in a startling number of ways  judge furman wrote  secretary rosss explanations for his decision were unsupported by  or even counter to  the evidence before the agency judge furman ruled that the administration had violated federal statutes  but he rejected a constitutional challenge based on equal protection principles  saying that there was not enough evidence in the record to conclude that mr  ross had intended to discriminate against minorities and unauthorized immigrants the lawsuit challenging the addition of the question was filed by new york  other states  localities and advocacy groups  they said that asking the question was a calculated effort by the administration to discriminate against immigrants adding a question about citizenship to the census would incite widespread fear in immigrant communities and greatly impair the accuracy of population counts  letitia james  new yorks attorney general  said on friday after the supreme court agreed to hear the case in urging the supreme court to review judge furmans decision  mr  francisco  representing the trump administration  wrote that mr  ross had wide discretion over the census that could not be second guessed by courts  he added that questions about citizenship have often been asked of at least a sample of the population in many earlier censuses and are commonplace in ones conducted by other developed democracies .
washington  president trump will declare a national emergency as early as friday to bypass congress and build his long promised wall along the nations southwestern border even as he agreed to sign a spending package that does not finance it  white house officials said thursday the announcement came just minutes before voting began on the spending measure  which then cleared both houses  ending a two month war of attrition that closed much of the federal government for 35 days and threatened a second shutdown on friday  the senate passed it 83 to 16  and the house followed later in the evening  300 to 128 but if he declares a national emergency to access billions of dollars for his wall  mr  trump could instigate a constitutional clash over who controls the federal purse and test the bounds of presidential authority in a time of divided government  democrats and some republicans instantly condemned the move  with some vowing to challenge it through legislation and lawsuits  trump will declare a national emergency  what happens next  the presidents plan would combine money included in the spending package for fencing along the border with funds that he can divert from other programs using traditional presidential discretion on top of still other money he would tap by declaring an emergency altogether  an administration official said  mr  trump would be able to dedicate about  8 billion for barriers  more than the  5 7 billion that congress refused to give him president trump will sign the government funding bill  and as he has stated before  he will also take other executive action  including a national emergency  to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border  said sarah huckabee sanders  the white house press secretary  the president is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall  protect the border and secure our great country mr  trumps announcement capped hours of last minute drama as he came under pressure on thursday morning to not sign the spending legislation from conservative figures like laura ingraham  who denounced it on twitter as a monstrosity and a total scam a balky president was concerned that signing the measure could impose restraints on his ability to tap other funds and was urged by his chief of staff  mick mulvaney  to tell republican leaders to instead pass a short term bill to keep the government open while reopening negotiations  according to a republican briefed on the situation such a move would have unraveled the delicate bipartisan balance favored by senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  who wanted to move beyond the wall fight  in a telephone conversation on thursday  mr  trump asked mr  mcconnell whether the spending measure included any hidden provisions or land mines  and the senator reassured him it did not  according to a person familiar with the call similarly  kirstjen nielsen  the homeland security secretary  and white house lawyers told him that he could still move money around  and ms  nielsen said that the spending package was actually better than a short term measure  mr  mcconnell argued that it was a win over speaker nancy pelosi ultimately  mr  trump was persuaded to sign the bipartisan spending measure after all  and at least some close to the president doubted that he was ever really wavering and instead was just enjoying the suspense but mr  mcconnell chose not to take a chance  rushing to the floor and interrupting a colleagues speech to announce mr  trumps decision  in effect locking it in before he could change his mind in agreeing to end the spending fight for now  however  mr  trump essentially started a new one with his vow to declare a national emergency  one that crosses party and ideological lines as liberals and conservatives alike objected to what they called presidential overreach seven senate democrats  including four announced or possible presidential candidates  immediately introduced legislation intended to block mr  trump from diverting money from disaster relief for the wall  some house democrats  including representative jerrold nadler of new york  the chairman of the judiciary committee  began endorsing a joint resolution to essentially nullify a national emergency declaration a parade of liberal advocacy organizations sent out pre written statements promising to challenge any such declaration in court as an outrageous abuse of power by an unstable and increasingly autocratic president  as one of the groups  public citizen  put it the president is doing an end run around congress  ms  pelosi told reporters  she suggested that mr  trump was setting a precedent for future democratic presidents to act on issues like gun control  precisely the scenario that scares republicans you want to talk about a national emergency  lets talk about today  ms  pelosi said  reminding mr  trump that it was the anniversary of the shooting massacre last february at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland  fla  seventeen students and staff members were killed  thats a national emergency  why dont you declare that emergency  mr  president  i wish you would senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  echoed her criticism and said congress would defend its prerogatives  the public was more opposed to the emergency declaration than they were to the wall  he said in a brief interview  and they were opposed to the wall about a half dozen senate republicans quickly spoke out against the move  as well  i dont think this is a matter that should be declared a national emergency  said senator lisa murkowski of alaska  we as legislators are trying to address the presidents priority  what were voting on now is perhaps an imperfect solution  but its one we could get consensus on senator susan collins of maine said such a declaration was of dubious constitutionality  while senator marco rubio of florida called it a bad idea  senator rand paul of kentucky said  we have a government that has a constitution that has a division of power  and revenue raising and spending power was given to congress still  other republicans backed mr  trump  including an ally  senator lindsey graham of south carolina  as well as senator shelley moore capito of west virginia  who faces re election next year  he feels that declaring a national emergency gives him that flexibility that he wants and needs  so im supportive of that  ms  capito said of the president for goodness sake  we tried for 35 days in december and january  right  to get the democrats to do what everyone knows needs to happen except democrats  said representative jim jordan  republican of ohio  i support the national emergency declaration 100 percent among the republicans who privately warned mr  trump against an emergency declaration was mr  mcconnell  who expects that house democrats will pass a resolution terminating it in a form that the republican leader cannot block from a floor vote  at least five or six republican senators are likely to vote against the president  making a majority along with the democrats  and potentially forcing mr  trump to veto it  read the first edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up for it here  a person familiar with the discussions said that mr  mcconnell said that he has warned mr  trump that he has less than two weeks to try to persuade wavering republicans to support his national emergency effort  otherwise he will face the prospect of a bipartisan rebuke by congress the spending legislation that passed on thursday drew strong bipartisan votes in a congress that has been deeply divided along party lines  in the house  213 democrats and 87 republicans voted yes  meaning that democrats were unable to pass it by themselves because they lost 19 of their own  most republicans  109 in all  voted no ms  pelosi  using nearly a dozen pens to sign the final bill  applauded the bipartisan majority  calling it quite a remarkable show in the senate  most of the 16 no votes were by republicans  along with four democratic presidential candidates  cory booker of new jersey  kirsten gillibrand of new york  kamala harris of california and elizabeth warren of massachusetts the package includes the seven remaining bills to keep the remainder of the government open through the rest of the fiscal year at the end of september  house and senate negotiators unveiled the 1 159 page bill on wednesday just before midnight  leaving little time for lawmakers to actually digest its contents the border security compromise tucked into the bill is perhaps the most stinging legislative defeat of mr  trumps presidency  it provides money for 55 miles of steel post fencing  essentially the same deal that mr  trump rejected in december the measure prohibits construction in certain areas along the rio grande valley and includes a provision  pushed by representative henry cuellar  democrat of texas  granting communities on the border time to weigh in on the location and design of the fencing the bill also prohibits funds from being used to keep lawmakers from visiting and inspecting department of homeland security detention centers  following a number of highly publicized instances where democratic lawmakers tried to visit detention centers and were turned away lawmakers were drawn by the other six parts of the spending package that finance a number of agencies  including the internal revenue service  which is in the middle of tax filing season  and the commerce department  allocations include  77 million to address the opioid epidemic  as well as money for natural disasters  including nearly  4 billion to wild land fire programs and  12 6 billion for the federal emergency management agencys disaster relief fund the package also negates an executive order that mr  trump signed to freeze pay for federal civilian workers  and instead extends a 1 9 percent pay increase  vice president mike pence  cabinet officials and other high level political appointees will receive raises of about  10 000 a year that had been frozen during the shutdown negotiators failed to resolve other matters  including back pay for federal contractors caught in the middle of the shutdown and an extension of the violence against women act  which expires friday  although grants under the act are funded in the spending bill mr  trumps aides have told him he can add to the  1 375 billion by reallocating money from other related programs using his traditional discretion but a national emergency would allow him to access even more money  exactly how that would work was still being debated  there were multiple drafts of the emergency order circulating within the government this week a defense department official said one likely scenario would be to divert up to  2 5 billion in counternarcotics funds to the army corps of engineers  the administration would then transfer existing federal land along the border to the defense department and acquire or condemn private land the army corps could then go ahead and build a wall or other barrier to secure the defense departments property using the newly diverted funds  dozens of miles of barrier could be built this way  according to the official  who asked not to be identified discussing alternatives before the white house was ready to disclose a specific plan legal experts have said mr  trump can muster serious arguments that he can declare a national emergency under current law  but it would almost surely prompt a court challenge from critics arguing that he is usurping two centuries of congressional control over spending under article i of the constitution  congress has the power to appropriate funds  no money shall be drawn from the treasury  but in consequence of appropriations made by law  it says but congress has passed laws in the past providing presidents with authority in national emergencies  laws that remain on the books  indeed  31 national emergencies declared by mr  trump and his predecessors remain active legal challenges could ultimately lead to a confrontation at the supreme court  the court is led by a five member conservative majority  but it has shown skepticism of presidential excesses in recent years  reining in both president george w  bush and president barack obama when the justices concluded they had overstepped their authority .
washington  president trump declared a national emergency on the border with mexico on friday in order to access billions of dollars that congress refused to give him to build a wall there  transforming a highly charged policy dispute into a confrontation over the separation of powers outlined in the constitution trying to regain momentum after losing a grinding two month battle with lawmakers over funding the wall  mr  trump asserted that the flow of drugs  criminals and illegal immigrants from mexico constituted a profound threat to national security that justified unilateral action were going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border  and were going to do it one way or the other  he said in a televised statement in the rose garden barely 13 hours after congress passed a spending measure without the money he had sought  its an invasion  he added  we have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country but with illegal border crossings already down and critics accusing him of manufacturing a crisis  he may have undercut his own argument that the border situation was so urgent that it required emergency action  i didnt need to do this  but id rather do it much faster  he said  i just want to get it done faster  thats all the presidents decision incited instant condemnation from democrats  who called it an unconstitutional abuse of his authority and vowed to try to overturn it with the support of republicans who also objected to the move this is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president  who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process  speaker nancy pelosi of california and senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader  said in a joint statement mr  trumps announcement came during a freewheeling  50 minute appearance in which he ping ponged from topic to topic  touching on the economy  china trade talks and his coming summit meeting with north koreas leader  kim jong un  the president again suggested that he should win the nobel peace prize  and he reviewed which conservative commentators had been supportive of him  while dismissing ann coulter  who has not sounding alternately defensive and aggrieved  mr  trump explained his failure to secure wall funding during his first two years in office when republicans controlled both houses of congress by saying  i was a little new to the job  he blamed certain people  a particular one  for not having pushed this faster  a clear reference to former speaker paul d  ryan of wisconsin  a republican mr  trumps assertions were replete with misinformation and  when challenged by reporters  he refused to accept statistics produced by his own government that conflicted with his narrative the numbers that you gave are wrong  he told one reporter  its a fake question on point after point  the president insisted that he would be proved correct  people said  trump is crazy  he said at one point  discussing his outreach to mr  kim  and you know what it ended up being  a very good relationship  president trump declared a national emergency  what happens now  mr  trump acknowledged that his declaration of a national emergency would be litigated in the courts and even predicted a rough road for his side  look  i expect to be sued  he said  launching into a mocking riff about how he anticipated lower court rulings against him  and well win in the supreme court  he predicted indeed  public citizen  an advocacy group  filed suit by the end of the day on behalf of three texas landowners whose property might be taken for a barrier  california and new york likewise announced that they will sue over what gov  gavin newsom of california called the presidents vanity project  and a roster of other groups lined up to do the same  fortunately  donald trump is not the last word  said mr  newsom  a democrat  the courts will be the last word among those predicting a flurry of judicial decisions against mr  trump was george t  conway iii  a conservative lawyer and the husband of kellyanne conway  the presidents counselor  if he knows he is going to lose  mr  conway  a vocal critic of mr  trump  wrote on twitter  then he knows he is violating the constitution and laws he has sworn to uphold the house judiciary committee announced friday that it would investigate the presidents emergency claim  while house democrats plan to introduce legislation to block it  that measure could pass both houses of congress if it wins the votes of the half dozen republican senators who have criticized the declaration  forcing mr  trump to issue the first veto of his presidency the emergency declaration  according to white house officials  enables the president to divert  3 6 billion from military construction projects to the wall  mr  trump will also use more traditional presidential discretion to tap  2 5 billion from counternarcotics programs and  600 million from a treasury department asset forfeiture fund combined with  1 375 billion authorized for fencing in the spending package passed on thursday night  mr  trump would have about  8 billion in all for barriers  significantly more than the  5 7 billion he unsuccessfully demanded from congress the president opted not to tap hurricane relief money from texas or puerto rico  an idea that had generated angry complaints from republicans  but he expressed no concern that diverting military construction money would delay projects benefiting the troops like base housing  schools and gyms  it didnt sound too important to me  he said neither the white house nor the pentagon had yet identified which projects may be shelved as a result  but pentagon lawyers and other officials planned to work over the weekend to identify which construction funds would be diverted the declaration also provided that land may be transferred to the defense department from other federal agencies or from privately purchased or condemned land  the next step would be to secure those lands  where the pentagon would erect barriers  the declaration gives patrick shanahan  the acting defense secretary  broad latitude to carry out this process most americans oppose mr  trumps emergency declaration  according to polls  one released this week by fox news found 56 percent against it  including 20 percent of republicans mr  trumps desire for approval by fox and other conservative news outlets was on display when he identified various pundits as supporters  naming sean hannity  laura ingraham  tucker carlson and rush limbaugh  although he insisted that they dont decide policy but ms  coulter  who has viscerally attacked mr  trump for caving on the wall  has clearly gotten under his skin  i dont know her  he said before quickly correcting himself  i hardly know her  i havent spoken to her in way over a year  he noted  though  that she was an early predictor of his election victory  so i like her  but shes off the reservation  he said  but anybody that knows her understands that ms  coulter fired back shortly afterward  the only national emergency is that our president is an idiot  she said on kabc radio in los angeles white house officials rejected criticism from across the ideological spectrum that mr  trump was creating a precedent that future presidents could use to ignore the will of congress  republicans have expressed concern that a democratic commander in chief could cite mr  trumps move to declare a national emergency over gun violence or climate change without legislation from congress it actually creates zero precedent  mick mulvaney  the acting white house chief of staff  told reporters  this is authority given to the president in law already  its not as if he just didnt get what he wanted so hes waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money presidents have declared national emergencies under a 1970s era law about five dozen times  and 31 of those prior emergencies remain active  but most of them dealt with foreign crises and involved freezing property  blocking trade or exports or taking other actions against national adversaries  not redirecting money without explicit congressional authorization white house officials cited only two times that such emergency declarations were used by presidents to spend money without legislative approval  once by president george bush in 1990 during the run up to the persian gulf war  and again by his son  president george w  bush  in 2001 after the terrorist attacks in new york  washington and pennsylvania in both of those cases  the presidents were responding to new events  the iraqi invasion of kuwait and al qaedas assault on the united states  and were moving military funds around for a military purposes  neither was taking action specifically rejected by congress in mr  trumps case  he is defining a longstanding problem at the border as an emergency even though border apprehensions have actually fallen in recent years  to 400 000 in the last fiscal year from a peak of 1 6 million in the 2000 fiscal year  and unlike either of the bushes  he is taking action after failing to persuade lawmakers to go along with his plans through the regular appropriations process  read the first edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up for it here  the spending package passed thursday by congress included none of the  5 7 billion that mr  trump demanded for 234 miles of steel wall  instead  it provided  1 375 billion for about 55 miles of fencing  mr  trump signed the package into law on friday anyway to avoid a second government shutdown after the impasse over border wall funding closed the doors of many federal agencies for 35 days and left 800 000 workers without pay for weeks  republicans led by senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky urged mr  trump not to declare a national emergency  but the president opted to go ahead anyway to find a way out of the political corner he had put himself in with the failed effort to force congress to finance the wall mr  mcconnell privately told the president that he would support the move despite his own reservations  but warned mr  trump that he had about two weeks to win over critical republicans to avoid having congress vote to reject the declaration mr  trump was among those republicans who criticized president barack obama for using his executive authority to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation after failing to persuade congress to do so  repubs must not allow pres obama to subvert the constitution of the us for his own benefit   because he is unable to negotiate w  congress  mr  trump tweeted in 2014 but mr  trump sought to drive home the personal toll of illegal immigration  inviting to the rose garden several relatives of americans killed by people in the country without authorization  some of the relatives  known as angel moms  stood up holding pictures of loved ones who had died matthews death was preventable and should have been prevented  one of the women  maureen maloney  said in an interview after the event  her son matthew denice  23  was killed in 2011 in a motorcycle accident in massachusetts after colliding with an automobile driven by an undocumented immigrant  he should have never been here in the first place  she said  if he wasnt here  it wouldnt have happened .
 what you need to know to start the day  get new york today in your inbox  homer  n y   the fears weigh on mike mcmahon  if one of his undocumented workers gets a traffic ticket  it could prompt an immigration audit of his entire farm  if another gets detained by immigration agents at a roadside checkpoint or in a supermarket parking lot  the rest may flee  and if his undocumented work force disappears overnight  there is no one to replace them it keeps me up at night  said mr  mcmahon  who owns a dairy farm south of syracuse  there are people out there who just say  send them all back and build a wall  but they would be facing empty shelves in the grocery store if that were to happen it has long been an open secret in upstate new york that the dairy industry has been able to survive only by relying on undocumented immigrants for its work force  now  this region has become a national focal point in the debate over president trumps crackdown on undocumented immigrants and their role in agriculture the tensions have escalated to such a degree over the last year that gov  andrew m  cuomo described federal agents as reckless  accusing immigration and customs enforcement of violating the rights of farmers in pursuing undocumented immigrants mr  cuomo was responding to a high profile raid on a dairy farm  during which a farmer was briefly handcuffed after protesting that ice agents were mistreating one of his workers  the farmer claimed ice did not have a warrant to enter his farm mr  cuomo is a democrat  but republicans who represent upstate new york in congress have also come to the defense of the farmers the pressures here reflect broader challenges facing farmers across the country who rely on undocumented workers  the farmers are struggling with a shrinking labor pool as fewer migrants cross illegally into the country and migrants who are long term residents become too old for field work this year the labor shortage has been compounded by mr  trumps trade war and extreme weather  forcing some small farmers to switch to higher value crops  to reduce their acreage and to consider selling their farms if anything  the situation in upstate new york is more difficult smaller dairy farmers here have been some of the hardest hit by tougher immigration enforcement because their workers are subject to scrutiny from both ice and the border patrol  which is allowed to operate within 100 miles of the border  in this case  with canada agriculture contributes an estimated  37 billion to new yorks economy and is responsible for nearly 200 000 jobs we are seeing that the immigration enforcement is having a tremendous enforcement impact on farm workers  on farms  said mary jo dudley  director of the cornell farmworker program  for many farmers  theres no alternative labor force to search private property like a farm  ice needs a warrant that shows reason to believe a particular undocumented immigrant is living or working there  but if undocumented workers leave the farm to go to a grocery store  they can be approached by ice agents in a parking lot or a roadside checkpoint  detained and deported  read the latest edition of crossing the border  a limited run newsletter about life where the united states and mexico meet  sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  advocates for undocumented immigrants said ice agents target immigrants indiscriminately in these public spaces  but ice disputes those claims ice continues to focus its limited resources first and foremost on those who pose the greatest threat to public safety  said an ice spokesman  khaalid walls  ice only conducts targeted immigration enforcement  the agency does not conduct raids or sweeps that target aliens indiscriminately supporters of stricter immigration policies said they were sympathetic to the plight of small farms  but they pointed out that the farms reliance on inexpensive  undocumented labor would handicap american agriculture in the long term they argue that while immigration crackdowns could force farms to consolidate and mechanize and may be hard for individual farmers  it would make the industry more competitive globally the more productive policy response would be subsidized loans to invest in machinery for small scale farmers  rather than revising how we import foreign workers and perpetuating the labor intensive old fashioned way of doing business  said mark krikorian  executive director for the center for immigration studies  a think tank that favors restricting immigration dairy farmers face particular challenges because without american workers  they have no alternative to migrant labor  the government program that brings in legal temporary workers does so only for seasonal workers and dairy farming is a year round activity in washington  lawmakers representing dairy heavy districts have tried to reform the legal foreign workers program to include year round dairy workers but so far  efforts have fallen short  these lawmakers are caught between staunch conservatives who consider any reprieve a form of amnesty and democrats who want more comprehensive immigration reform  which would also address the deferred action for childhood arrivals program  known as daca  and immigrants with temporary protected status well have detractors on both sides  said representative chris collins  a republican in western new york still  mr  collins said  a solution is urgently required to keep dairy farms afloat while the political impasse over a comprehensive immigration package drags on  theres not a single person representing dairy that doesnt understand its a crisis  a true crisis  he said he plans to introduce legislation in the coming weeks that would offer temporary employment authorization to year round farmworkers on dairies as a stopgap measure deportations have been a concern for new yorks farmers and farm workers since the early 2000s  when the sudden enforcement of immigration laws led to a rash of immigration enforcement activities on farms across the state  after the obama administration narrowed the pool of immigrants ice prioritized for deportation  some sense of security returned to upstate farming communities  which was shattered when mr  trump took office we had heard things were starting to get bad  some wineries in the area and quite a few in the finger lakes started losing workers  it was almost immediately after trump took office that ice started snagging people  said kelly raby  a vineyard owner in lewiston last fall  victor pacheco  the foreman on ms  rabys family farm for 23 years  was detained by ice agents and deported to mexico ms  raby has struggled to find a foreman skilled enough to manage her vineyard  where the grapevines are now dusted in a light coat of snow and in need of winter pruning  this has left her uncertain about the future of their family farm and the president she helped vote into office i still agree with trump in a lot of ways  but im more on the fence about him now  ms  raby said  i dont want to lose the immigrants who are working here and growing our food over the last 50 years  american farms have relied on two labor forces  migrants who settled in the united states during the migration wave of the 1960s and 1970s  and those who stayed temporarily  illegally crossing the border for each harvest season  but today  permanent migrants who settled are reaching their 60s  fewer and fewer seasonal migrants are coming to the united states  and enforcement operations are driving the few migrants left out of the state today you go to work and you dont know if youll come back home and be with your family again  said eladio beltran  an immigrant from mexico who works in an apple orchard in albion  he is currently awaiting deportation proceedings after being pulled over by state troopers and taken into ice custody being undocumented and living in new york state is not worth it anymore  he said for dairy farmers like mr  mcmahon  if even one of his migrant workers leaves  the absence has a drastic effect on his 2 300 acre farm operation  he depends on having enough workers for round the clock shifts  seven days a week  they keep this schedule year round  he said  to ensure his roughly 800 cows are milked three times a day  their calves are fed  and all cows are medically cared for what we really want is some kind of method of getting foreign workers legally  mr  mcmahon said from his farm in homer  about 30 miles south of syracuse owners of apple orchards and vineyards  who can afford to  have also started turning to the h 2a program  the legal foreign worker program that brings agricultural labor to the united states for temporary work critics of the program argue that workers are often exploited by employers and risk deportation if they complain about mistreatment  farmers complain that it is costly  complicated and laden with bureaucracy we didnt really have a choice but to use to h 2a  said mark nicholson of red jacket orchards  which switched to using the program last year  when the system works  it answers one of our biggest challenges to staying in business  and thats having a reliable source of skilled farm labor  but when it doesnt work  it dooms us to the same risk as before if the issue of undocumented farm workers is left unaddressed  there will be an impact across the supply chain  there will be long term consequences that not only our farms will deal with  but consumers will have to deal with as well  said steve ammerman  the senior associate director of public policy at the new york farm bureau without a legal alternative to informal migrant labor  the competition between dairy farms to retain migrant workers is so fierce that farm owners  once notorious for underpaying and mistreating workers  are now improving working conditions and wages to entice employees to stay on their farms  workers said victor cortez is an immigrant who has worked on a dairy farm in western new york for 18 years  a few years ago  farm owners wouldnt let us leave the farm  he said  adding  they wouldnt pay us as much as they promised they would but the good thing about it now  he said  is that we get paid more and this farmer is good to me .
this week  students took on some challenging topics via our writing prompts  including the debate over the border wall  sexual abuse allegations against r  kelly  and the relationship between the news media and the president as always  we were impressed with their thoughtfulness  humility and sharp analyses  but what really impressed us was how many students took the time to read and reply to each others comments with both disagreement and approval  most readers offered substantial and civil rebuttals  responses we know are not always easy to give to issues as complicated and emotional as these below  weve rounded up the best of the comments on two of these topics  along with some more lighthearted teenage musings about dream travel destinations were so happy to welcome new classes from downers grove  ill   sarah e  goode stem academy in chicago  and tallahassee  fla  this week  and we want also to give a special shout out to the students at the julia r  masterman school in philadelphia  who wrote excellent comments across all our prompts this week please note  all student comments have been lightly edited for length  but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted           the government shutdown and debate over a border wall have dominated headlines for the past few weeks  following president trumps prime time address to the nation on jan  8  we asked students what they thought about the standoff between mr  trump and congress and how they hoped it would be resolved the majority of students took issue with the impasse  but a few defended mr  trumps steadfastness  others suggested ways the deadlock could be resolved and how the  5 7 billion mr  trump wants for the border wall could be better spent  we highlight some of the best argued and most interesting ideas in our roundup below weighing the costs and benefits of a government shutdownin the midst of the government shutdown  there is a looming humanitarian crisis  however  it is not a scourge of illegal immigrants entering the us and committing unspeakable atrocities  but the roughly 800 000 federal employees who are not reviving paychecks as a consequence of government shutdown  each day it stretches on  their situation grows more perilous as they are forced to draw from financial savings that should be utilized for retirement or sending their children to college  it is absolutely abhorrent that almost one million people are having their livelihoods put on hold because the president does not want to negotiate the wall is perhaps the most ridiculous and controversial border control proposition created in the last fifteen years  in its full form  it would cost american taxpayers upwards of 50 billion dollars  and it has no guarantees of effectiveness  there is no denying that the us mexico border has an issue with illegal immigrants  but this is no way of solving the issue  a multifaceted  extremely complex problem that has continually defied resolution  a simple wall will not remedy the conundrum faced by both us and mexican authorities  in summary  the cost for the border wall  in both monetary and humanitarian terms  is far too high to justify its creation  instead  it would be exponentially more useful to explore alternate  less belligerent methods of border control that can be more universally agreed upon and implemented  jake hession  hoggard high school  wilmington  n c robert frost once wrote  good fences makes good neighbors  so do good walls  the united states government does not need the added work of taking care of all of these illegal immigrants  who sneaked here to flea danger in their country  not only is it fair to the u s  government  but it is also unfair to the many people trying to enter the country legally  who have been waiting for years only to have to wait longer because of these illegal immigrants  many people are making the argument that government workers are not being paid for their work  however  these workers do get backpay as compensation for the money they lost during that time  this one bit of information makes that argument almost completely irrelevant  jonah a   masterman schoolin all honesty  i am a supporter of the border wall  however  the recent actions and behavior mr  trump has displayed in order to fund the wall is absolutely not justified  a leader is supposed to unify the hoi polloi  not divide us even further  but mr  trump has failed to do this  instead of offering himself to the united states  mr  trump has decided to offer the united states for his own desires  this is wrong  and its not okay  800 000 americans are struggling to survive without a paycheck because of one mans selfishness  some of these citizens also have families to feed  many with young children  g jap  masterman school  philadelphia  penn i agree with the president in this matter  i understand that a lot of people are not being paid for their work  but sometimes that just has to happen for the greater good  the border will decrease a lot of illegal immigration  which should be our priority  the government shutdown provided a lot of the fund to build reinforce the border already  and im not saying its a good thing  but all of the funds are essential to a safe border  the democrats have a false sense of security  thinking that we are already protected well enough from illegal immigration  but that is false  hundreds or even thousands of people cross the border every passing day  and they are not doing anything to stop it  the border needs its funds in order to keep doing its job david w  the great  the great land of earthgovernment spending and the walldonald trumps prime time address did not sway my opinion at all  i still believe the wall is unnecessary money to take from america that could be used to help the people in flint  michigan or a years worth of housing for every homeless person in the us  there are much more urgent and important matters that the president has sidelined to focus on his wall  angela xhori  julia r  masterman  philadelphiai believe that yes our border needs protection just not keeping everyone out with a huge wall  what i feel would be more warranted would be background and weapon checks on those coming into the usa to ensure the safety of the country  reza chity guevara  masterman  philadelphia  penn i believe that the wall is a terrible idea  with the money the government would be spending on the wall  1 4 million people could get health care  double funding for mental health  and double funding for environmental causes  this wall wont fix anything  it will just prove america avoids their problems and builds barriers  new problems would arise with the wall  for example  people could destroy parts of the wall or dig under it  this is basically throwing money out of the window  molly flaxman  masterman school  philadelphiawhy isnt 5 billion dollars being spent in the cities that suffer from a drug epidemic  why not 5 billion dollars to the homeless  orphanages  hospitals  schools  medicine  and more  spend the money on what you really need to help this country  what does the wall benefit  not schools  not research centers  not even care centers  that money can be used to make places for those immigrants who have crucial reasons to be leaving their own home  spend money on the violence of our cities  young teens killing each other  spend money on educating the young people who will become our caretakers in the future  if you really want to make america better thats how you make america great again  not with a wall  jenesis moreno  masterman  philadelphia  penn democrats and republicans need to work togetheri think putting a wall on the border is not going to solve all the problems  i also think as a country  we should put our differences aside and work together  america has a greater destiny and purpose and should be an example for future generations  if we act as we do now  the future leaders will act worse seeing our behavior and political thinking  even though political views have split the country tremendously over the past 3 years  our main goal is to keep this country the best and running  now the republicans and democrats are wasting every precious second and because of this  many families are suffering and the national parks are slowly getting destroyed  eleena john  masterman  philly  penn trump is not willing to negotiate  but neither is nancy pelosi or chuck schumer  they are saying that they do not want the wall under any circumstance  all three of them are resisting each other and the u s  citizens are paying for it  or not getting payed  whatever floats your boat   i hope this will end by the republicans giving in  and the loads of money will be spent on different issues like global warming  while still not letting all the illegal immigrants in  arjun ahya  masterman school  philadelphia  penn           last week  the times travel section published its annual 52 places to go piece and announced the travel writer who would travel to and write about all 52 spots  in this student opinion question  we asked students which of these destinations theyd most like to visit and whether they would want the job of the 52 places traveler of the 52 places to go in 2019  students were most excited about visiting the setouchi islands in japan  other top spots included  puerto rico  the islands of tahiti  the ontario ice caves  and panama  they also recommended several places not on the list  including ghent  belgium  the galpagos islands  pittsburgh  and the great wall of china  below  they tell us why where students want to visit and whyevery single place in the list provided looked absolutely breathtaking and incredible  and while there were so many choices  i found myself stopping to take a closer look at aberdeen  in scotland  while it may not have been as beautiful or exotic as some of the other destinations on the list  i have always found myself to be fascinated with all things scottish  i love how the scottish accent flows  and i have always been amazed by the landscapes and lochs in scotland  what made this location appear even more impressive to me was the old fashion trains  which combine two things i love  old fashioned vehicles and overnight train rides  lily chancey  philadelphia  mastermanif i could travel to one of the places on the list  i would prefer to go to the setouchi islands in japan  before i even went through the list  i already had a passion to go to japan for a trip  i wanted to see japans beautiful nature and try some of their traditional foods  setouchi triennale 2019  a major art fair interests me considering it will be held at teshima and honjima which are less frequented to create a balance between the nature and the art  there are so many different places to go  some focusing on the natural beauty of japan like cycling on trails with citrus trees and olive groves  i would love to ride a sea plane with setouchi sea planes to take scenic flights to small and larger islands  the food that i could try on the trip also inticesme considering i could try authentic japanese food  japan seems like an ideal place for me to travel and relax to have a fun time in a calm place  janey l   julia r  masterman  philadephiain my lifetime  i have visited five of the seven continents  travelling has always lead me blindly into the most thrilling and unique experiences  i will take any chance i get to pack my bag and experience a new lifestyle  and i am constantly searching for ways to broaden my cultural horizon  there was one destination included in the article that sounded very rare and intriguing  isla palenque  panama  when reading the description  the part that caught my attention was the resort grows some of its own food  has furniture made from fallen trees and maintains a no plastics policy  including subbing papaya shoots for straws  it would be a totally new experience for me to live off the land  and get away from all of the sounds overpopulation  haven habrat  hoggard high school  wilmington  n c my biggest dream is to travel  having never left the country  i rely on the internet and experiences from friends to tell me about the world outside of the us  last year i got to know two foreign exchange students that had come to the us for a year and it only fueled my passion for travel  it amazes me how different cultures are and i want to learn about them all the tatra mountains in slovakia caught my attention  i live in a port city  right by a beach community so its always fairly warm  it would be interesting to go to a place that has snow and its sweltering hot for 75  of the year  also there are many outdoor activities that i have never tried before  due to lack of snow  like snowboarding  skiing  snow tubing  etc  paige phillips  hoggard high school  wilmington  n c i am your average student  stressed from the amount of homework and the constant pressure im always under  i will live in my little bubble for most of the year forgetting that there is an entire world out there to explore  after reading the fifty two recommended places i found the islands of tahiti to be one of the places i want to explore  i have always wanted to live on the water and be able to experience something that i could not find anywhere  what made it stand out was tahitis clear  warm waters offer views of more than 1 000 species of marine life  this would be something you would only receive once in a lifetime and living on the water while seeing more than a thousand species of marine life is something extraordinary  talia porzio  hoggard high school  wilmington  n c traveling is one of the best ways to learn  you are exposed to different cultures  as well as encounter the history embedded to the place  one of the proven best ways to learn is to experience what is being taught  personally  i would love to visit the setouchi islands in japan  thailand  or danang in vietnam  my mom was born in vietnam but was raised in america  a result of being forced to flee during the war  it would be so nice to go and revisit some of the few memories she has as well as enrich my knowledge in the culture  hope a  masterman  phillyon being the 52 places travelerhaving a job as the 52 place traveler sounds phenomenal because you would get to take a break and visit places that your heart desires  in addition  all you have to do is write about your experiences  everything is taken care of  and it would just be a extremely long vacation  although this job sounds great  there are also downfalls  you may have to be away from your family and friends  and that can always make you feel lonely  though there are downfalls  this job still sounds great  sometimes you have to sacrifice things in life  so that you can get another  sophia  mastermanit might be fun to go 52 different places  but if you even spend 3 days there  plus a day for flying there  thats four days  multiplied by 52 is 208 days   almost 2 3 of the year  i dont think i would want to spend that much time away from home because there are a lot of aspects of my home that i really enjoy  in conclusion  i probably wouldnt want to travel somewhere for more than 1 5 months  and only up to 1 5 months if its really fun  samuel  mastermani would absolutely love to have a job that travels 52 places  that is like a dream job  you have the opportunity to experience the world and do things others dream to do  the only challenging thing about this job might be leaving your family for long periods of time  however what you gain from traveling the world is absolutely worth it  elodie poussard  massachusettsi would be absolutely ecstatic about being the 52 places traveler  that opportunity to connect with people different from you  and learn something new is once in a lifetime  it would be so fun to meet people  visit historic places  eat new foods  and really learn about a new culture  i think the challenging part would be a language barrier  but that would never stop me from enjoying myself  im sure i can communicate well enough with hand jesters and google translate  bailey dyer  florida high school  tallahassee  fla           in our most popular picture prompt of the week  tight rope  we asked students to study the image above and interpret it in light of current events they came up with a variety of nuanced explanations  but all seemed immediately to grasp the theme of the frank bruni column that inspired our prompt  the relationship between president trump and the news media  of the many wonderful comments we got  we chose those that were grounded in the illustrations visual evidence and drew clear connections to specific events or issues  especially because  having just judged our own student editorial cartoon contest  we know it is this kind of thinking that results in sophisticated winning work like this here is what students came up with walking a fine linei believe that this picture is commenting on the difficult job of our press  in america  the press has to try so hard to stay neutral  not supporting one side over the other i know that newspapers and magazines have to walk a fine line  or tightrope  when it comes to publishing  it is either exposing the truth or risking large scale retaliation from the readers and people in power  sam doyle  philly phillyi think that this image is trying to represent how on edge the news feels today  president trump has repeatedly said that todays new is the enemy of the people  and whenever he doesnt like something on the news he calls it fake news  it shows how careful the reporters have to be  in the image they have to be careful to stay on balance and not fall  but in real life they have to make sure they say the right things so they dont get president trump mad  it must feel like walking on eggshells around him  reporters today have to balance on a tightrope to get to talk to trump without him calling them fake news or the enemy of the people  and thats not how things are supposed to be in a democratic country  ami s  masterman  philadelphiai assume the guy with the tanned face and blonde hair is president trump so i feel like the picture is showing the dangers of news outlets reporting on president trump  its almost like a tight rope that you are crossing when it comes to him and the controversy your news outlet can start  i feel like the people on the other side of the tightrope are news reporters that are passed all the controversy with trump and some of them may even support him  this may be the reason why he is depicted talking to them  when in other situations he is ignoring the reporters that confront him  this picture shows the other news reporters on the rope who may be in the controversy and their news outlet may be undergoing some type of drama with trump and have to record him from a distance  abdoul diallo  julia r  masterman  philadelphiai believe that this picture prompt represents how difficult it is for reporters and journalist just to talk to president trump  a reporters job is to get information from a person  but when the person is not cooperative then this cold be a rather hard job  we all know that trump is not easy to interview because he cuts people off and sometimes turns questions around  i can recall he even kicked a journalist out of a news conference for asking a question about a topic trump was very strict on  immigration   so when a reporter is trying to ask the president something its like they are walking on a tightrope because you never know how he could possibly lash out  jack dunphy  philadelphiaseeking the truthi think that this image is saying how maybe donald trump is keeping the truth away from us  he is making reporters and other people who are trying to figure out what s going on work very hard to get it  i feel this picture saying that he is hiding what he is doing and only a few people who are determined will continue to try to get to it  my opinion on what i think is this messages is why not tell them what is happening you are the president but it is still our lives  your people should know what is going on  sierra mckinley  philadelphia  penn in this illustration  donald trump is on one side while reporter are trying to get to him on a tightrope  i think the tightrope represents how hard reporters try to figure out what is happening in the trump presidency  there are so many secrets and things that we dont know especially in the trump presidency because of all of the things that have happened during his term and all of the lies he has told  we need to know the truth  and its these reporters jobs to tell us whats going on  maia keenan  masterman  philadelphiawe think this image depicts reporters trying to ask questions and will risk everything to know the truth and reality  the reporter holding the microphone is asking risky questions  especially because all of the other reporters could fall if he asks something that donald trump finds offensive  finally  everyone in the image can only move forward because if they go back everyone falls but trump is isolated  hall ms el masters  corte madera  calif the media circuswhen i look at this picture it reminds me of the media image in america  and how it is so focused on donald trump  since the presidential election all that has been in the news is donald trump  has been the on the headline of the news so many times that i cant even keep track anymore  we have been so focused on what he is doing that we are missing out on all the other stuff that is happening in america like all the mass shooting that are constantly happing in america or the mass population homeless people that we have on our streets  they say that he is digging this country into a deeper hole but what they dont say is that the media is there with him helping him dig this ever growing hole  niara hughes  masterman  philadelphia  penn  the image shows how donald trump is trying to get attention  even if people are risking their lives at the same time  for example  the government shutdown   he thinks his wall is more important than the people of america  maya kowal  masterman school  philadelphia  penn .
washington  president trump delivered a message of bipartisan unity on tuesday night in his first address to congress in the new era of divided government  but signaled that he would continue to wage war for the hard line immigration policies that have polarized the capital and the nation in a nationally televised speech that toggled between conciliation and confrontation  mr  trump presented himself as a leader who could work across party lines even as he pressed lawmakers to build a wall along the nations southwestern border that leaders of the newly empowered congressional democrats have adamantly rejected we must reject the politics of revenge  resistance and retribution  and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation  compromise and the common good  the president said  together  we can break decades of political stalemate  we can bridge old divisions  heal old wounds  build new coalitions  forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of americas future any hopes for a newfound spirit of cooperation  however  seemed elusive as the president and democrats spent the hours before  during and after the address exchanging partisan political fire  making clear that ritualistic calls for across the aisle collaboration were unlikely to transform an environment that has turned increasingly toxic republicans jumped to their feet at the presidents calls to curb immigration  limit late term abortions and ensure that the united states does not turn to socialism  even chanting u s a  u s a a couple of times as if at a trump campaign rally  that sounds so good  he exulted speaker nancy pelosi  sitting behind mr  trump for the first time  and other democrats largely remained in their seats without applauding and expressed only tepid enthusiasm even for his mention of goals intended to appeal to them  like infrastructure and paid parental leave  ms  pelosi maintained a polite  even amused smile on her face for much of the speech but the evening was filled with political theater as the president introduced world war ii veterans  holocaust survivors  the apollo 11 astronaut buzz aldrin  a 10 year old cancer survivor  a police officer shot seven times at last falls synagogue massacre in pittsburgh and the teary eyed relatives of a couple killed by an illegal immigrant  all sitting with the first lady  melania trump the change in the power structure in a capitol long dominated by men was on display as ms  pelosi and scores of house democratic women wore white  the color of the suffrage movement  reflecting the fact that 131 women were sworn into the new congress  the most in american history when mr  trump noted this breakthrough  the women leapt to their feet  cheering  dancing and high fiving each other  thats really great  he said  congratulations he made no direct mention of the issues that may yet come to dominate the year  such as the russia investigation by the special counsel  robert s  mueller iii  or the parallel inquiries that house democrats intend to conduct into his campaigns ties with russia and efforts to impede investigations instead  he alluded to them only in passing  but pointedly  an economic miracle is taking place in the united states  he said  and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars  politics or ridiculous partisan investigations but mr  trump indicated no retreat from his almost singular pursuit of a border wall  directly taking on ms  pelosi  who has called it immoral  he devoted 15 minutes of the hour and 22 minute speech to immigration with no concession to democratic priorities like a path to citizenship for immigrants brought into the country illegally as children this is a moral issue  mr  trump said as ms  pelosi sat unmoved behind him  no issue better illustrates the divide between americas working class and americas political class than illegal immigration  he added  wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards in the official democratic response  stacey abrams  who lost a close race for governor of georgia in november  scorned the idea of unity from a president who has practiced the politics of division  we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan  she said  but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart ms  abrams  who is african american  challenged mr  trumps history of racial provocation  saying  we must hold everyone from the highest offices to our families accountable for racist words and deeds and call racism what it is  wrong the presidents speech  built on a theme of choosing greatness  came at a pivotal moment halfway through the presidents term as he seeks to regain momentum after the midterm election defeat that handed control of the house to democrats and after his failed effort to use a partial government shutdown to extract money for the wall stung by his retreat on the government shutdown  mr  trump has hardly been in the mood for collaboration with the other party  as he and his team drafted his address in recent days  he has groused about the text  complaining that it was too gentle on democrats  according to people briefed on the matter the president insisted on sharpening some of the lines in the speech and rebuffed aides  who urged him to congratulate ms  pelosi on her ascension to the speakership during an off the record lunch for television anchors on tuesday before the speech  mr  trump offered scathing assessments of a number of leading democrats  including some lining up to run against him next year he dismissed former vice president joseph r  biden jr  as dumb  called senator chuck schumer of new york a nasty son of a bitch and mocked gov  ralph northam of virginia  who he said choked like a dog at a news conference where mr  northam tried to explain a racist yearbook photograph  according to multiple people in the room democrats did not wait for the address to pan it  it seems every year the president wakes up and discovers the desire for unity on the morning of the state of the union  then the president spends the other 364 days of the year dividing us  and sowing a state of disunion  mr  schumer said on the senate floor  he added  the blatant hypocrisy of this president calling for unity is that he is one of the chief reasons americans feel so divided now mr  trump fired back at mr  schumer via twitter  i see schumer is already criticizing my state of the union speech  even though he hasnt seen it yet  the president wrote  hes just upset that he didnt win the senate  after spending a fortune  like he thought he would  too bad we werent given more credit for the senate win by the media mr  trump arrived at this point in his presidency with the approval of just 37 percent of the public  according to gallup  in the past four decades  the only times a president headed into a state of the union address with as little or less support were in 1983 when ronald reagan was struggling with a painful recession and in 2007 and 2008 when george w  bush was trying to turn around the iraq war mr  trump is the only president in the history of gallup polling to have never drawn the support of a majority of the public at any point in his first two years in office  but while he is the fourth president in a row to lose at least one house of congress during a midterm election  bill clinton and barack obama both bounced back to win re election  and mr  trump has privately expressed confidence that he will  too after presidents suffer setbacks in midterms  they often reach out to the victorious opposition with words of conciliation  however artificial or short lived they may be  in mr  trumps case  he opened this period of partisan power sharing with a relentless confrontation over his proposed border wall  resulting in a record breaking 35 day partial government shutdown that impasse nearly cost mr  trump his opportunity to deliver his state of the union address  as ms  pelosi refused to let him come to the house chamber as long as federal agencies were closed and workers unpaid  mr  trump backed down and accepted a measure reopening the government for three weeks  but negotiations in the interim have made no more progress toward winning money for his wall  and the government could close again on feb  15 given that  mr  trumps calls for unity were almost surely destined to fall on deaf ears  even republicans have publicly rebuked him lately for his plans to withdraw troops from syria and afghanistan  and party leaders have pressed him not to declare a national emergency bypassing congress to build the wall among those invited by the president to join the first lady during the speech was joshua trump  a sixth grade student from wilmington  del   who has been bullied in school due to his last name  according to the white house democrats were making points with their guests  as well  among those they invited were air traffic controllers who went unpaid during the government shutdown  illegal immigrants who worked at mr  trumps properties and transgender soldiers who will be banned under the presidents new policy in addition to ms  abrams  other democrats sought to get in on the action  senator kamala harris of california  who is running for president  delivered her own response shortly before the speech  while senator bernie sanders of vermont  who may also run  delivered his afterward in his address  mr  trump assailed democrats like mr  northam for comments in support of easing restrictions on late term abortions and called for federal legislation cracking down on such procedures  a nod to mr  trumps conservative base  he made no mention of the racist medical school yearbook picture that has threatened mr  northams political career  after aides cautioned him about raising that issue mr  trump also sought to frame the opposition democrats as too extreme  suggesting that the country was in danger of a socialist takeover  here in the united states  we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country  he said  as republican lawmakers booed  we are born free and we will stay free  tonight we renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country the president highlighted what he sees as the accomplishments of his first two years in office  including a growing economy  rising energy production  increased military spending  deregulation and tax cuts  he pressed congress to approve his new trade pact with canada and mexico updating the north american free trade agreement mr  trump did not outline the traditional laundry list of new initiatives  the way other presidents have  but he did plan to make a national commitment to end transmission of the virus that causes aids  with a goal of stopping its spread in the united states by 2030  he repeated past calls for bipartisan measures to rebuild americas crumbling infrastructure  curb the cost of prescription drugs and approve paid parental leave the president also talked about his goal of bringing an end to the endless wars in places like syria and afghanistan  the threat he sees from iran and his bid to force president nicols maduro of venezuela to step down  he announced that he would meet for the second time with north koreas leader  kim jong un  in vietnam on feb  27 28 to seek his nuclear disarmament mr  trump ended his address with an uncharacteristic effort at poetry  an ode to america and its common purpose  i am asking you to choose greatness  he said  no matter the trials we face  no matter the challenges to come  we must go forward together .

bret stephens  gail  the word is that robert mueller may soon send his report to attorney general william barr  do you expect a bombshell  a dud  or just a lot more confusion  depending on what barr makes public and what congress chooses to do with its conclusions gail collins  well  weve already got indicted minions  as to trump himself  i feel very safe voting for a lot more confusion  just on general principles  the trump presidential campaign was knee deep in conflicts of interest  many of them involving russia  but given the mans general disorganization  i find it hard to imagine the report picking him out as the sinister  canny leader who was orchestrating everything behind the scenes still feeling that the real disaster for trump is going to come with the investigations into his business practices in new york  how about you bret  thats my guess  too  trumps  100 million inauguration committee looks like a giant pay to play scheme  i still think his alleged campaign finance violations in connection to the stormy daniels and karen mcdougal payoffs are criminal and impeachable  and who knows what else muellers investigation have dredged up about trump family values gail  the family that stays together preys together bret  and vice versa  that said  if mueller finds no clear and credible evidence of collusion or cooperation between the trump campaign and russia  it will be a major political victory for the president and a liability for his detractors  fairly or not  it will call all the other investigations into question  however credible or serious they may be thats one of the reasons ive been leery of investing too much political capital in wondering what trump might have done behind peoples backs  its what he does every day in plain sight that is much more concerning gail  even if the mueller investigation fails to produce  well still have a bunch of congressional committees digging up dirt  but i know thats not as satisfying for a conservative trump hater  youre right that theres plenty to investigate in his normal day to day life  which horrible things the president has done lately seem most appalling to you bret  well  that list is long  but let me start by praising trump on a couple of fronts  i think hes shown moral leadership on venezuela  by getting much of the world to recognize juan guaid as the legitimate president and drawing attention to the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding under the maduro regime  and im also glad hes partially reversed course and will keep at least some troops in syria  i hope he winds up withdrawing none of them so long as they can help protect our kurdish friends and deter our syrian  iranian  russian and turkish foes o k  now to the rest  his declaration of a national emergency over border wall funding is a threat to constitutional government and the separation of powers and sets a precedent that both sides will abuse if the supreme court doesnt stop it gail  no disagreement on the national emergency  the fact that you havent seen a major uprising of republicans over that is proof that theres no real republican party anymore  only trumpism and im looking forward to the next democratic president declaring that climate change is a national emergency bret  his unloading on the new york times as a true enemy of the people is an assault on the first amendment and the safety of journalists  including us  his hankering for a deal  any deal  with north koreas kim jong un so that he can win a nobel peace prize is a danger to peace and stability in asia gail  our publisher really called trump out on the danger he is creating for journalists  its perilous enough reporting from trouble spots around the globe without having the president of the united states cheerleading for the enemies of a free press bret  his desire to start another trade war with europe  this time over cars  is a threat to global growth and another nail in the coffin of trans atlantic unity  his nonstop lies and exaggerations and demagoguery about the purported evils of illegal immigration are an insult to our intelligence and devastating to the g o p s chances of ever again being a majority party gail  i love it when you get on a roll like this  keep going bret  and his overall comportment continues to be a foul stain on the office of the presidency  a moral embarrassment to a majority of americans  and a blot on the record of liberal democracy  how about you gail  well  youve kind of run the table  but id add his attempts to undermine womens reproductive rights  the assault on planned parenthood isnt just about abortion  its about the far rights hatred of anything that gives women the power to decide if and when they want to get pregnant  cant tell you what a deep irony it is to have this guy leading that crusade bret  id call it hypocrisy  not irony  but im being pedantic gail  and everything about guns and domestic violence  many people have taken note of the fact that the president tweeted out about the smollett scandal and the suit against the washington post by the kentucky high school student who was involved in that incident with a native american in washington  but not a twittery word about the white supremacist coast guard officer who has been accused of stockpiling weapons to murder newscasters and liberal politicians  when reporters asked him about it  all trump could come up with was  i think its a shame  thats the kind of thing you say when a politician gets caught cheating on his wife  not when youre talking about a self declared white supremacist intent on a politically inspired mass slaughter bret  the smollett and covington high stories are fascinating in a cultural sense  mostly for what they tell us about our current culture of victimhood and the assumptions too many people  including too many in our profession  make about who is the victim based on current stereotypes  but the case of the coast guard officer is genuinely terrifying given that it comes on the heels of the florida mail bomber  the pittsburgh mass killer and the california man charged last year with phoning in death threats to journalists  thats a terrifying reality of the culture war from which most of the right prefers to look away gail  not long before he announced that he was running for president  trump went to an n r a  convention and got a wild  massive reception  right then i knew he was going to be a huge gun rights supporter  no matter what he had believed before when he was running against hillary clinton i thought he was terrible  but not nearly as terrible as he turned out to be  kind of amazing  did you foresee all of this bret  partly  i wrote more than a dozen columns for the wall street journal during the last presidential campaign  denouncing his bigotry  lawlessness  ignorance and demagoguery  he vindicates my first impression with his every foul tweet  i think hes debasing our political culture in ways we will be living with  and suffering from  for at least a generation  and hes becoming a role model of sorts for other populist demagogues around the world  from brazil to italy gail  well  i wrote a lot about what a jerk hed been in new york for the last 30 odd years  i guess i didnt take him seriously enough because hed always behaved like such a fool bret  on the other hand  the world didnt end with his presidency  the economy is robust  we havent stumbled into a catastrophic war  yet   and democracy is still alive and well considering all the democrats planning to run against him  that isnt to say things might not still go horribly wrong  only that the habit of comparing trump to despots of yore is off the mark and undermines the case against him gail  right  hes our own special unique despot wannabe bret  but can i switch the subject  last week the times ran an eye opening story on senator amy klobuchar of minnesota  basically to the effect that she is a truly horrible boss  with some of the highest staff turnover in the senate  from a policy standpoint shes my favorite democrat in the race  but this is a serious issue for her candidacy  how do you think voters should factor that into their considerations gail  im playing the wait and see card  were undoubtedly going to find out unpleasant things about a lot of the candidates as we go along  but that story about her using her comb to eat a salad on an airplane and then giving it to her aide to wash is going to  resonate your position is that youll vote for whoever the democrats nominate  even if its a modern day attila the hun  right bret  definitely not  of course i cant vote for trump under any circumstance  but i would never vote for bernie sanders  who seems to think bread lines are a good thing because theyre egalitarian  i couldnt vote for elizabeth warren  either  shes too far to my left and her prevarications about her ancestry are morally insulting and intellectually embarrassing  i have personal reservations about cory booker  stemming from his deceits as mayor of newark  and kamala harris  stemming from her behavior as a prosecutor  if any of them is the nominee  i will probably write in bill weld or john kasich or larry hogan  middle of the road republicans or former republicans who know how to win over democrats and could govern from the center gail  ah  i remember many republicans who had those sentiments  trump was appalling and impossible to support  but hillary clinton was too far a bridge to cross  and so they voted for people like gary johnson  the libertarian  which meant they helped put trump in office bret  i voted for hillary clinton  even though i had plenty of reservations  but theres no way im going to follow democrats jumping off the cliff on the left because im angry at republicans for jumping off the cliff on the right gail  really  i have to warn you  if i hear any trump hater talking about writing in his mothers name or the green party name or howard schultz i immediately decide this is a person who would rather have four more years of donald trump than compromise his principles by voting for a deeply imperfect democrat bret  im already compromising many of my usual political principles by voting for centrist democrats  never mind the real lefties  i could vote for joe biden  though i doubt hell get the nomination  or senator michael bennet from colorado  our bosss brother   or any other middle of the road democrat  that category included klobuchar  but i have a problem with people who are horrible bosses and dont have the good sense to use their fingers to eat the way i do but lets talk about something our readers really care about  the oscars  did you watch  did your favorites win gail  i believe this is the first year ever that ive seen all the movies nominated for best picture  and best actress and best actor  and pretty much everything  this is all about avoiding donald trump  since hes been president ive instinctively organized my life around trying to forget about current events for at least a few hours a day  its the same reason ive been watching football for the first time in my life but about the winners  i like watching people be genuinely surprised  so i really enjoyed seeing olivia colman win for playing the dotty queen in the favourite  how about you bret  i saw only a few of the films  but i was thrilled with the win for free solo  the documentary about climber alex honnold that i wrote a column about last year  and i was deeply moved by roma  i grew up in mexico city  and the movie perfectly captured a world i know very  very well  nice to see that in this accelerated age of ours theres still appreciation for a film that takes it slow and goes deep gail  and while were talking about awards that made me happy  congratulations on winning the ellis island medal of honor  bret  im so glad your fight for immigrant rights is being recognized  you deserve it  and as a bonus  i cant think of anything that would irritate donald trump more bret  thanks  gail  of course ill be bringing my mom to the ceremony  this year will be her 69th as an immigrant in this country .
in case you havent noticed  long established political parties across the democratic world are blowing up  with britains labour party just the latest to fracture  could americas parties be next could we have our first four party election in 2020  with candidates from the donald trump far right  the old g o p  center right  the joe biden center left and the alexandria ocasio cortez far left all squaring off  as the deepening divides within our two big parties simply cant be papered over any longer  its not impossible indeed  two phrases recently in the news that touch on core principles of the democratic and republican parties are like fuses that could ignite much larger explosions in the coming year  those phrases are  unwilling to work and national emergency on feb  7  ocasio cortezs congressional office sent out an f a q  explainer of the green new deal that shes proposing  the initiative aims to mobilize every aspect of american society  to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions and create economic prosperity for all i admire that goal and the huge energy shes brought to it among young people  but one version of her offices f a q  stated that the green new deal would guarantee  among other benefits  economic security to all who are unable or unwilling to work economic security for people unwilling to work  whos going to sign up for new taxes to support people unwilling to work or be retrained when some commentators called this out  ocasio cortezs team said the f a q  was an unfinished draft that never should have been released  i dont buy it  it was also too late  that phrase  economic security even for people unwilling to work  was not just noted by conservatives  it rattled some center left democrats as well  because it hinted that the partys base had moved much farther to the left in recent years than theyd realized  and it highlighted the most important fault line in todays democratic party  the line between what id call redivide the pie democrats and grow the pie democrats grow the pie democrats  think mike bloomberg  celebrate business  capitalism and start ups that generate the tax base to create the resources for more infrastructure  schools  green spaces and safety nets  so more people have more opportunity and tools to capture a bigger slice of the pie grow the pie democrats know that good jobs dont come from government or grow on trees  they come from risk takers who start companies  they come from free markets regulated by and cushioned by smart government the wisest grow the pie democrats have also learned something from the past few years  the benefits of nafta  open trade with china and the rise of the digital economy  while vital for creating economic growth  dont just automatically trickle down  any more than g o p  tax cuts did  they require trade insurance and surge protectors  free community college  portable health care coverage and pensions  and a very intentional strategy to more equitably spread the benefits of growth among bosses  workers and shareholders redivide the pie democrats  think bernie sanders  argue that after four decades of stagnant middle class wages  and bailouts for bankers and billionaires but not workers in 2008  you cant grow the pie without redividing it first  inequality is too great now  there are too many people too far behind the decision by amazon to scuttle its big expansion in new york city marks the first big clash this election season between grow the pie democrats  who insisted that tax breaks for amazon would pay for themselves  and redivide the pie democrats  who saw amazon as pitting their community in a race to the bottom with other communities over which could lavish more subsides on a tech behemoth that didnt need them in truth  the episode was a huge failure of imagination by both sides  virginia got it right  explained amy liu  urban affairs expert at the brookings institution  in an essay last week in the times  yes  it gave amazon some  500 million in subsidies  but the state offered twice that amount in new investments in local transportation and schools to create a strong pipeline of technically skilled workers  something that will benefit the entire community for years as for the g o p   its divided between a limited government grow the pie right  but one that wants to just let capitalism rip  and a hoard the pie  pull up the drawbridge trump led far right the limited government grow the pie faction is itself split between the never trumpers  whove refused to prostitute themselves to trumps serial lying  cozying up to russia and other madness  and those whove hitched a ride on trumps wagon to get their tax cuts  conservative judges and deregulation but trumps decision to declare a national emergency on the mexico border has violated the partys most core principle of limited government  in doing so its opened a fissure between the old limited government grow the pie republicans and the anti immigrant hoard the pie  pull up the drawbridge trumpers the early signs are that the limited government types  led by mitch mcconnell  are so morally bankrupt  after having sold their souls to trump for two years  theyll even abandon this last core principle and go along with trumps usurpation of congresss power of appropriation stay tuned  over the years our two parties have usually managed to handle deep fractures  this time may be different the level of outrage in both bases is sky high  their ability to express that outrage through weaponized social networks  talk radio and cable television is powerful and pervasive  and the three accelerations  in globalization  technology and climate change  were going through are stressing everyone and demanding very different political choices so heres my hunch  the 2020 u s  election will be unlike any in my lifetime think about it  ever since world war ii until the early 21st century  the major political parties in the west were all built on a set of stable binary choices  capital versus labor  big government high regulation versus small government low regulation  open to trade and immigration versus more closed to trade and immigration  embracing of new social norms  like gay rights or abortion  and opposed to them  and green versus growth across the industrial world parties mostly formed along one set of those binary choices or the other  but that is no longer possible what if i am a steelworker in pittsburgh and in the union  but on weekends i drive for uber and rent out my kids spare bedroom on airbnb  and shop at walmart for the cheapest chinese imports  and what i cant find there i buy on amazon through a chatbot that replaced a human  monday to friday im with labor  saturday and sunday im with capital my point  many of the old binary choices simply do not line up with the challenges to workers  communities and companies in this age of accelerating globalization  technology and climate change  but national governments are so paralyzed by partisanship that they cant adapt  and most families are too weak to manage these forces and pass along the american dream to their kids fortunately  though  all is not lost  creative adaptation is happening in many of americas counties  cities and towns  where trust is much higher  the most successful are forging what i call complex adaptive coalitions  where business  labor  philanthropists  social entrepreneurs  educators and local government all network together to create jobs  attract businesses  grow housing  fix potholes and improve schools these coalitions are not focused on splitting the differences between the old right left binary choices  theyve actually moved to a totally different grid  one that asks every day on every issue  what works  find it and share it  so we can get the best out of these accelerations in technology  globalization and climate change and cushion the worst for the most people in our community  oxford economist eric beinhocker recently pointed out to me research that says there are only two ways to cure political tribalism  a common threat or a common project  we need a common project  and its obvious  build a new foundation for the middle class  ultimately that requires the local and the national levels to work together  but for now we should be glad that its at least happening at the local level don baer  who served as president clintons communications director  has a bumper sticker for anyone who wants to run for president in 2020 on the grid of rebuilding our country through complex adaptive coalitions  but it will take your whole bumper make america work again  for those who are willing to work and for those who are willing to work together

action on southwest key  a nonprofit that houses almost a third of detained migrant youth  would be a balancing act for officials as they tried to avoid tipping an overstressed system into chaos  without adequate shelter space  minors remain stuck at border stations ill equipped to care for them  after the recent deaths of two children in border patrol custody  the stakes have never been clearer about 12 400 migrant children are now housed across roughly 100 permanent sites and two temporary ones  thats down from the record level of almost 15 000 last month  largely because the trump administration relaxed its rule requiring fingerprints for every member of a household sponsoring a child by any measure  southwest key is the industry juggernaut  the austin based charity operates 24 permanent facilities in texas  arizona and california  one of those is the nations largest permanent shelter  a converted walmart supercenter in brownsville  tex   that can house more than 1 400 minors southwest key  which has pulled in  1 7 billion over the past decade  is being investigated by the justice department after a new york times article documented possible financial improprieties and poor management  the charity stockpiled tens of millions in taxpayer dollars with little government oversight  possibly engaged in self dealing with top executives and paid them significantly higher than the federal salary cap for migrant shelter grants but if the federal government revoked its grants  there would not be enough room in the crowded system to absorb the children under its care  officials would need to find another provider to take over southwest keys shelters  or find new facilities altogether maria cancian  a former deputy assistant secretary for policy in the administration for children and families  said if a large provider had lost its contracts under her watch  she would try to maintain as many of the providers staff and facilities as possible the logical thing to do to maximize safety and minimize waste of public funds would not be to immediately shut down an enormous number of shelters  ms  cancian said  the best course of action would be to figure out a plan for transitioning those facilities and transitioning those personnel the office of refugee resettlement  the agency that oversees migrant shelters as part of the administration for children and families  declined to speculate on southwest keys grants  in response to a question asking if the agency had a plan if the charity were to lose its grants  a spokeswoman said the agency was always planning for unforeseen events a southwest key spokesman  jeff eller  said the charity had had no discussions about losing its grants with the office of refugee resettlement or about its shelter licenses with officials from texas  arizona or california  he said the charity was focused on providing the best care possible for children last year  the government cut off the contracts of another major shelter provider  international educational services  over suspected financial improprieties  juan sanchez  who founded southwest key and still runs it  also helped establish i e s   although he has not had a role there for decades the closing of i e s  facilities was carried out haphazardly  straining the system for months  as many as 620 children needed to be rehoused  most landed in southwest key facilities comprehensive health services  a for profit company based in florida that ran one of the temporary shelters  leased three former i e s  shelters  all in the rio grande valley in texas  and then received a new government contract  many original staff members were rehired two southwest key facilities closed last year  including the shelter where staff members were caught on video abusing children  as part of a settlement with arizona after the charity failed to provide proof that its workers had received required background checks  those shelters could house more than 500 children  southwest keys six remaining shelters in arizona also can no longer accept new children until the state says otherwise if the government ends up seeking a provider to take over southwest keys remaining shelters  comprehensive health services  a workplace medical contractor that has provided support during emergencies  is a likely alternative  but the company has also been accused of improperly handling government money in february 2017  comprehensive health services paid a settlement of almost  4 million over improperly charging the government for medical screenings  the company said the overbilling was a mistake the countrys second largest provider  a san antonio based nonprofit called bcfs  seems unlikely to take over all southwest keys shelters  its primary focus has long been disaster relief and international aid  and the nonprofit has faced daily protests for running a sprawling tent city in tornillo  tex the government may also try to delay deciding on southwest key contracts until it reduces the number of children in federal custody  or  at the least  reduces the number of children placed with southwest key a major reason for the shelters overcrowding was the administrations decision in june to require fingerprints for every member of a household that wanted to care for migrant children  as fingerprinting slowed placement  the average length of time children spent in shelters stretched from about a month to nearly two in december  the trump administration relaxed the fingerprinting requirements  the tent city  scheduled to close by jan  15  has already been reduced from 2 850 children to 1 500  in november  southwest key housed as many as 5 000  but as of friday  there were only 3 900 still  the temporary shelter run by comprehensive health services is expanding  from a capacity of 1 350 to 2 350 children .
 what you need to know to start the day  get new york today in your inbox  the newly emboldened democratic led new york state legislature waded into the battle over immigrants rights on wednesday  approving a bill that for the first time offers undocumented students access to state financial aid and scholarships for higher education gov  andrew m  cuomo has confirmed he will sign the measure into law the dream act is the latest in a wave of state level protections for immigrants as blue state legislatures increasingly seek to act as a counterbalance to president trumps federal immigration policies  these issues are also expected to play a prominent role in the democratic partys 2020 presidential primary  with candidates who are courting liberal activists supporting the state measures after new york democrats won control of the state senate in november for the first time in a decade  protections for immigrants became a legislative priority  they included permitting undocumented residents to obtain state drivers licenses and reducing maximum jail sentences for certain misdemeanors that could otherwise lead to deportation it took us almost a decade to get the dream act  and its going to take another five  10  20 years to undo the damage that washington is causing our families  said assemblywoman catalina cruz of queens  who was born in colombia and came to new york as an undocumented child even as the bill gained passage  the new york immigration coalition and other advocates were pushing for lawmakers to dream bigger and address issues like expanded funding for immigrant legal services and health care for immigrants all these measures  lawmakers say  could act as a bulwark against republican efforts in washington and the ongoing standoff over the nations southern border the election of trump and the fact that he made immigration a central theme of his presidency has made immigration a more prominent issue at the state level  said muzaffar chishti  the director of the migration policy institute at the new york university school of law  in some ways  blue states are now competing with each other to provide a higher level of protection to immigrants the new york bill will affect an estimated 146 000 young people who were educated in new york public schools but have been ineligible to receive financial aid under federal and state law  according to analysis by the new york state youth leadership council and n y u  law schools immigrant rights clinic these young undocumented immigrants will work  they will pay taxes  they will buy products  and the greater earning capacity they have the more taxes they will pay  said democratic state sen  luis seplveda  this is one piece of legislation where we must get beyond the anti immigration fervor created by president trump and see the benefits educating these young people has for our state but many republicans say that the measure diverts funds away from legal residents and comes at the expense of taxpayers how am i supposed to tell families in my senate district that adequate state aid to help afford college isnt available for them  but it is available for others who are in this country illegally  said republican state sen  james seward the move on financial aid for undocumented immigrants comes during a week in which the legislature and governor cuomo continued to make headway on a list of liberal measures that had long been blocked while republicans controlled the state senate for most of the last decade on tuesday  mr  cuomo signed the reproductive health act  to expand rights to abortion  new yorks abortion laws had not been updated since 1970  three years before roe v  wade  the measure moves abortion regulations from the state penal code to the health code  recognizing abortion as a public health issue rather than a crime from which the state had carved out exclusions in passing the state dream act  new york joined california  texas  new mexico  washington  oregon and minnesota  which have already passed similar legislation offering undocumented students access to state funded financial aid  a dozen states have ensured undocumented immigrant residents can obtain drivers licenses  and a handful have provided pathways for immigrants to secure professional and occupational licenses only three states have enacted provisions that proactively prohibit undocumented students from accessing in state tuition rates  and two  alabama and south carolina  prohibit those students from even enrolling at a public postsecondary institution the dream acts passage reflected the democratic partys turn to the left on immigration  an issue party leaders once handled gingerly out of fear of angering some white voters but mr  trumps incendiary language on race  the increasingly diverse nature of the democratic voter base and the partys success in multiethnic cities and suburbs have convinced many party leaders that they are both morally right and on safe political ground when they side with undocumented immigrants the partys 2020 presidential hopefuls  including some who once held more hawkish views on immigration  like senator kirsten gillibrand of new york  are already moving to reassure liberal activists on the issue in an effort to protect themselves in the 2020 campaign it is a strikingly different scenario than during the 2008 democratic primary  when white house hopefuls wrestled with whether undocumented immigrants should be allowed to obtain drivers licenses  several candidates  including then senator hillary clinton of new york  were torn between pleasing their core voters and scaring off swing voters in a general election the center of gravity has now shifted so that few democratic presidential candidates would hesitate to embrace such measures as providing the undocumented drivers licenses or in state tuition benefits  the only question now is how best to counter mr  trumps hard line immigration policies  and the debate has moved toward whether agencies like the immigration and customs enforcement should exist at all democrats in the new york legislature first introduced the dream act in 2013  but the legislation was narrowly defeated in the senate  since that time  democrats have included it in new york state budget proposals  only to have it repeatedly negotiated out of the budget there is a backlog of progressive legislation that the new democratic majority can finally prioritize  said democratic state senator jessica ramos  we might not have jurisdiction over immigration laws themselves  but there is still a lot we can do as a state to protect our diversity though the state already allows all students who graduate from high school in new york to pay in state tuition at the city university of new york and the state university of new york  the dream act extends state financial aid to all students who meet the tuition assistance program requirements  opens 529 tuition savings accounts to all new york youth and establishes a commission to raise private funds for college scholarships to be offered to the children of immigrants still  the republican minority that opposed the dream act argues that it creates a greater tax burden on already stressed middle class taxpayers and puts the needs of undocumented immigrants above those of american citizen students middle class families across new york continue to struggle with high tuition costs and oppressive taxes  said republican assemblywoman mary beth walsh  as state representatives  it is our duty to ensure that our state government operates in the best interests of new yorks families and not undocumented immigrants  she said until now  many young undocumented students could not afford to attend universities  despite aspiring to higher education degrees  the immigration policy center estimates that because of financial constrains  only 5 to 10 percent of the 4 500 undocumented students who graduate from new york high schools each year go on to pursue college degrees when i came here i found out how hard it would be to go to college as someone who is undocumented  said richard salinas  an 18 year old high school student in queens who came to the united states four years ago  i wouldnt be able to get any help  and my mom cant afford it and my dad cant afford it this changes everything for me  mr  salinas said .
one night a year  during the state of the union address  president trump sets aside his affinity for combat to offer up 90 minutes of stand up comity to a national audience the agenda i will lay out this evening is not a republican agenda or a democrat agenda  mr  trump said  opening his speech on a conventionally presidential note on tuesday  it is the agenda of the american people  a couple of hours earlier  during a private lunch with network anchors that did not stay private long  mr  trump called senator chuck schumer  the democratic leader  nasty  described former vice president joseph r  biden jr  as dumb  ripped into senator john mccain  and derided senator elizabeth warren as pocahontas the speech itself  embedded with patriotic language and delivered in a reassuring tone  veered between two moods  combative and conciliatory  reflecting a president at a crossroads ahead of an uncertain 2019 here are four takeaways for more than a month  mr  trump has threatened to invoke a state of emergency along the southern border with mexico  in an attempt to circumvent congress  which has refused to give him  5 7 billion for a border wall but it was not until this week that senate republicans  many of whom vehemently oppose the idea on the grounds that it tramples legislative prerogative  made it clear that diverting funding from other projects for a wall  in the name of a national emergency  was a nonstarter for the moment  mr  trump heeded their wishes  the emergency declaration was not among his demands for increased border security it was  to a significant degree  an act of political self protection at the weekly republican senate lunch held in the capitol a few hours before mr  trumps speech  senator john thune of south dakota  the majority whip  was asked about the likelihood of the president invoking emergency powers  mr  thune replied by saying he believed that the president would avoid a confrontation with his own party because too many republicans opposed it  and it would take only four republican defections to pass a measure opposing the move mr  trump would do the right thing  he predicted  because all you have to do is count to four  mr  thune quipped  according to a person in attendance mr  trump began the night by optimistically playing up a new opportunity in american politics  if only we have the courage to seize it and he expressed support for a variety of popular initiatives that enjoy widespread popularity among democrats  including new funding to eradicate aids  a campaign to reduce childhood cancers and yet another commitment to try to fix the countrys crumbling infrastructure then  about 15 minutes into the address  mr  trump hit on an issue foremost in his consciousness  the looming threat of congressional investigations into his conduct first  he offered what amounted to a plea for the new democratic majority in the house to avoid ridiculous partisan investigations and cautioned his enemies not to seek revenge against him then came the bluntest of threats to the woman sitting behind him  speaker nancy pelosi  if there is going to be peace and legislation  there cannot be war and investigation  it just doesnt work that way  he said we must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad  he said already facing a divided congress  mr  trump has been rebuked by members of his own party in recent days over his decision to pull troops from syria and his demands for a border wall in response  he invoked two issues that have been used to rally divided conservatives for decades  the fights against abortion and socialism there could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days  he said  referring to efforts by democrats in new york and virginia to loosen restrictions on abortion rights in recent days  republicans on capitol hill have been circulating talking points urging them to highlight plans by democrats  including the freshman representative alexandria ocasio cortez of new york  to increase taxes on the wealthy here  in the united states  we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country  mr  trump said  america was founded on liberty and independence  and not government coercion  domination and control mr  trump dedicated several minutes to listing his economic accomplishments on behalf of women as he faced row upon row of seats occupied by democratic women wearing white  in a visual demonstration of their unprecedented power in a house run by one of their own no one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women  who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year  said mr  trump  who seemed genuinely surprised by the thunderous applause it evoked from women on both sides of the aisle you werent supposed to do that  said the president  who went on to praise the record breaking election of 117 women to congress in 2018 that  too  garnered a hearty ovation  he has a long way to go  however recent polls show that large majorities of women disapprove of his performance with 10 days left for congress to pass a border security package and avert another government shutdown  mr  trump devoted a significant portion of his speech to making the case for his signature campaign proposal  a wall at the southern border this is a smart  strategic  see through steel barrier  not just a simple concrete wall  he said  adding  simply put  walls work and walls save lives but as mr  trump raised the time frame to keep the government fully funded  the democrats tensed and republicans continued to applaud  representative ilhan omar  democrat of minnesota  buried her head in her hands  as he detailed a litany of familiar talking points about caravans marching toward the united states  there was a disgruntled round of groans  punctuated by a couple boos as they looked around at each other  shaking their heads  trump wants a border wall  heres whats in place already  representative veronica escobar  democrat of texas  whose district includes most of el paso  was visibly angry after mr  trump referenced her district and the decrease in crime  she appeared to mouth that it was safe before the wall and after the wall  oh my god  oh my god  she mouthed to her colleagues  her arms crossed as other representatives looked over in her direction there were also some unhappy murmurs when he described the increase in troops at the southern border and scoffs at his description of the savage ms 13 gang the audience for mr  trumps state of the union address looked like a striking sea of white  with democratic women  many dressed in white in a nod to the womens suffragist movement  sitting together  midway through the presidents speech  they did something completely unexpected  they stood up and cheered no one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women  who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year  mr  trump said  prompting the women to roar their approval  after all  many of them had new jobs  in the house  which they took from men you werent supposed to do that  the president said  smiling all americans can be proud that we have more women in the work force than ever before  mr  trump went on  adding  dont sit yet  youre going to like this and then he delivered his biggest applause line  exactly one century after congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote  we also have more women serving in congress than at any time before it was a striking moment for a president who has been routinely accused of misogyny  who paid hush money to a pornographic film actress and a playboy model and who spoke in vulgar terms as he admitted on videotape that he had sexually assaulted women stacey abrams  the former minority leader of the georgia legislature  narrowly lost her bid to be the first african american female governor in the south  but it was the way she lost  amid charges of voter suppression and vote rigging  that really rankled in choosing ms  abrams to give the democratic response  her partys leaders were tapping a crusader for voting rights  and that is what she delivered while i acknowledged the results of the 2018 election here in georgia  i did not and we cannot accept efforts to undermine our right to vote  ms  abrams said  this is the next battle for our democracy  one where all eligible citizens can have their say about the vision we want for our country  we must reject the cynicism that says allowing every eligible vote to be cast and counted is a power grab  americans understand that these are the values our brave men and women in uniform and our veterans risk their lives to defend she also tackled race  even as a democratic governor  ralph northam of virginia  fights for his political survival after photos of a man in black face and another in a ku klux klan robe emerged in his medical school yearbook we fought jim crow with the civil rights act and the voting rights act  yet we continue to confront racism from our past and in our present  she said  which is why we must hold everyone from the very highest offices to our own families accountable for racist words and deeds  and call racism what it is  wrong mr  trump plans to sit down with north koreas leader  kim jong un  this month in vietnam  a country chosen as a neutral location for their second nuclear summit meeting  but one that also has plenty of symbolic significance mr  trump hopes the meeting will jump start a diplomatic effort that has stalled since their first encounter  last june in singapore  while north korea since then has refrained from overtly provocative actions like testing nuclear warheads or ballistic missiles  it has yet to agree to actually give up any piece of its atomic arsenal much work remains to be done  but my relationship with kim jong un is a good one  mr  trump said  chairman kim and i will meet again on february 27th and 28th in vietnam after spending the first portion of his speech patting himself on the back for what he views as his administrations accomplishments  including low unemployment  mr  trump issued a stern warning to the democrats now in charge of the house an economic miracle is taking place in the united states  and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars  politics or ridiculous partisan investigations  he said  if there is going to be peace and legislation  there cannot be war and investigation  it just doesnt work that way speaker nancy pelosi smirked behind him  representative adam schiff of california  chairman of the house intelligence committee  smiled  he has already begin examining whether money laundering could have motivated mr  trumps coziness with russian oligarchs this years state of the union address was the second longest in recorded history  according to the american presidency project at the university of california  santa barbara  the projects data dates to 1964  tonights address surpassed mr  trumps first state of the union speech by about two minutes  but falls short of former president bill clintons 2000 address by about six minutes president trump delivered a message of bipartisan unity on tuesday night in his first address to congress in the new era of divided government  but any hope of enduring harmony was dispelled long before he arrived at the capitol mr  trump  who has warred with democrats for weeks over his plan to build a wall along the nations southwestern border  hoped to use the nationally televised speech to present himself as a leader who can work across party lines even as he continued to press lawmakers to give him money for the barrier together  we can break decades of political stalemate  mr  trump told lawmakers from the rostrum of the house of representatives  we can bridge old divisions  heal old wounds  build new coalitions  forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of americas future  the decision is ours to make mr  trump signaled that he would not back off his hard line immigration policies that have polarized the country  no issue better illustrates the divide between americas working class and americas political class than illegal immigration  he was to add  according to excerpts released by the white house  wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards read more from peter baker speaker nancy pelosi was spared any discomfort that might have come with the ritual introduction of the president of the united states  the president jumped the gun before she could utter the traditional  ladies and gentlemen  i give to you the president of the united states  mr  trump had already started speaking while mr  trump forgot to have ms  pelosi introduce him  another republican president  george w  bush  made a big deal of ms  pelosis introduction of him in 2007  the year she first became speaker tonight  i have a high privilege and distinct honor of my own  as the first president to begin the state of the union message with these words  madam speaker  mr  bush said then  fact check  what president trump got right and wrong in his speech .
walls protect  walls divide  both these statements are true  yet perhaps no issue represents the deep political chasm separating this country as a wall  a big  beautiful wall in the words of president

asserts that a good deal of the power of walls and fences come from their psychological power  what does he mean  to what extent do you agree 2  he argues that walls are not built for security  but instead for a sense of security  why does he make this distinction  do you agree 3  do you think walls have a different psychological effect from fences  or are they really just the same thing with a different name station 5  a political symbolhours before a partial government shutdown kicked in at midnight on dec  22  president trump released a video reiterating his demand for additional funding for a wall or a slat fence or whatever you want to call it  he said  we need a great barrier  in the video  he claimed  its very dangerous out there  drugs are pouring in  human trafficking  so many

trumps wall is now an entirely symbolic affair  he continues  the symbolism is more important than the reality  indeed  the president has offered to compromise  saying that we dont have to call it a wall and it doesnt even have to really look like one  but that doesnt matter either  because for democrats  any structure that the president could claim victory over would be a defeat answer these questions 1  do you agree that the border wall has become a political symbol for both the presidents supporters and opponents  why 2  as of jan  3  parts of the united states government were closed because the president and congress could not agree on the presidents demand for  5 billion in funding to begin construction of a border wall  do you think the two branches of government will be able to get past this impasse  should either side compromise  and if yes  what should a compromise look like  3  in its editorial  the times editorial board suggests the need for sensible border security investments and immigration reform  in his essay  mr  goldberg writes that the symbolism of the wall fight has made immigration policy itself something of an afterthought  first  do you agree with either or both of these positions  second  do you think the president and congress will be able to move past the shutdown standoff to address larger issues related to immigration  why or why not 4  walls also can have great symbolic power  the department of homeland security unveiled eight wall prototypes in october 2017  which president trump visited six months later  none of these prototypes have been selected  and no wall has been built  but these eight prototypes have symbolic power choose one of these eight prototypes and explain what you think it symbolizes from two points of view  first  for the president and his supporters  and second  for the presidents political opponents now  look at some proposals that werent selected  including a 2 000 mile pink wall  a shopping mall and
