0,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — President Donald Trump's drug czar on Monday touted the president's plan for a U.S.-Mexico border wall as a way to save American lives by helping stem the flow of illegal drugs into the country.While visiting Kentucky, drug czar Jim Carroll said Trump's long-promised border wall would help stop drug smugglers looking for places to penetrate the United States away from ports of entry.""So that wall will undoubtedly stop the flow of drugs in those locations, force people to the ports of entry, where there's more law enforcement located,"" Carroll said when asked about the wall and its potential impact on the illegal drug trade.But U.S. statistics, analysts and testimony at the New York City trial of drug kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman show most hard drugs entering the U.S. from Mexico come through land border crossings staffed by agents, not open sections of the border.David Shirk, a University of San Diego political science and international relations professor, said by phone Monday that a wall would only lead to ""more creative solutions to moving drugs into the country.""Carroll visited an addiction recovery center in Louisville with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has stuck with the president during Trump's fight with Congress over his national emergency declaration along the Mexican border.Trump issued the first veto of his presidency in rejecting an effort by Congress to block the emergency declaration he'd used to circumvent lawmakers as he tried to shake loose funds for the wall. It is unlikely that Congress will have the votes required to override Trump's veto, shifting the confrontation to the courts.Carroll said it's wrong to assume that beefing up enforcement at ports of entry alone will stop the influx of illegal drugs.""If you're a drug trafficker coming up from Mexico, you're not going to stop trafficking drugs just because (of) the ports of entry,"" he said. ""They will then move between the ports and that's why we need a wall there. But obviously they're coming through in massive numbers as it is now. But this is clearly needed to save American lives.""The southwestern U.S. border ""remains the primary entry point for heroin into the United States,"" said the Drug Enforcement Administration's 2018 Drug Threat Assessment. It said most of its heroin seizures on the border are at official crossings called ports of entry, in California, and increasingly in Arizona. It arrives in passenger vehicles, hidden inside their frames and in other places in the cars, followed by tractor-trailers, where the drugs are hidden in legal imported goods.A much smaller amount of heroin is seized from people who sneak across the border, usually on foot.Border security has been beefed up for decades without making a dent in drug flows, said Shirk, who specializes in U.S.-Mexico relations and border politics.""Barriers make it easier for border authorities to gain operational control at the border, but they also lead to innovation by drug traffickers to find new, more sophisticated ways to penetrate the border,"" he said.McConnell and Carroll emphasized a combination of law enforcement and treatment and recovery programs to combat substance abuse. Carroll also urged employers to consider hiring people who have overcome addictions. A restaurant owner recently told him the eateries staffed by people in recovery are his best-performing locations, Carroll said.""These people who are in recovery and starting their lives over again are some of the hardest-working people that they've found,"" Carroll said.McConnell, who is up for re-election next year, said about $30 million in federal funding has been sent to Kentucky in recent years for addiction treatment and recovery efforts.""I think our people on the ground ... are making great use of all this additional funding that we are providing to try to get on top of this epidemic,"" McConnell said.McConnell and Carroll visited a Volunteers of America addiction recovery center in Kentucky's largest city. For participants, the center's treatment programs can last three to nine months because the focus goes beyond recovery from addiction, said Jennifer Hancock, president and CEO of Volunteers of America Mid-States.""We know ... that long-term recovery must be contingent upon not just being clean and sober, but having stable housing, also having a living-wage job,"" she said."
1,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Defense is proposing to pay for President Donald Trump's much-debated border wall by shifting funds away from projects that include $1.2 billion for schools, childcare centers and other facilities for military children, according to a list it has provided to lawmakers.The Pentagon gave Congress a list on Monday that included $12.8 billion of construction projects for which it said funds could be redirected. Around 10 percent of the list relates to educational establishments and includes school buildings for the children of service members in places like Germany, Japan, Kentucky and Puerto Rico.The move comes as a surprise given the Trump administration's oft-touted support for the sacrifices made by military families and suggests the White House's desire to build a wall on the border with Mexico outstrips nearly all other issues.However, of the $1.2 billion in projects related to education, approximately $800 million worth are far in the future, and those funds could readily be used for wall construction and replaced later.The Pentagon told Congress that just because a project was listed, it ""does not mean that the project will, in fact, be used"" as a funding source to build sections of the border wall. Trump earlier in March asked for $8.6 billion in his 2020 budget request to help pay for his promised wall on the U.S-Mexico border to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking. It drew swift criticism from Democrats.Trump declared a national emergency in a bid to fund the wall without congressional approval, allowing his administration to use money from the military construction budget, if needed.In a tense Congressional hearing last week, Democratic senators demanded that they be provided a list of military funds that could be utilized to fund wall construction.Military officials have vowed that they would not use any funds from military housing. A recent Reuters investigation https://reut.rs/2t1Y2UA found thousands of U.S. military families were subjected to serious health and safety hazards in on-base housing, prompting moves from lawmakers to improve landlord controls.But elementary and middle schools on bases around the world serving military families are at risk of suffering from the funding diversion, as well as a new engineering building and parking garage at West Point, the Army's military academy in New York state.Joint Base Andrews, where the president's Air Force jet is based, was slated to receive $13 million for a ""Child Development Center,"" but funding for that project is on the list. The base currently has three child development centers serving the 12,000 to 14,000 active and reserve military stationed there.The children of pilots for the F-35A jet, being made by Lockheed Martin at a cost of $89 million each, could be impacted. Alaska's Eielson Air Force Base is slated to get $22.5 million to build a school to enroll 240 additional children ""in a remote arctic climate"" when the jet begins operations there.The current school serves 108 and has an ""extensive waiting list,"" according to Air Force budget documents which say that if a school is not built ""children will be turned away,"" ""directly impacting support of the F-35 mission, morale, and welfare.""

2,"WASHINGTON — President Trump doubled down on one of the biggest gambles of his presidency on Tuesday night with a televised appeal to pressure Congress into paying for his long-promised border wall, even at the cost of leaving the government partly closed until lawmakers give in.Embarking on a strategy that he himself privately disparaged as unlikely to work, Mr. Trump devoted the first prime-time Oval Office address of his presidency to his proposed barrier in hopes of enlisting public support in an ideological and political conflict that has shut the doors of many federal agencies for 18 days.In a nine-minute speech that made no new arguments but included multiple misleading assertions, the president sought to recast the situation at the Mexican border as a “humanitarian crisis” and opted against declaring a national emergency to bypass Congress, which he had threatened to do, at least for now. But he excoriated Democrats for blocking the wall, accusing them of hypocrisy and exposing the country to criminal immigrants.[Read our fact checks of Mr. Trump’s speech.]“How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?” Mr. Trump asked, citing a litany of grisly crimes said to be committed by illegal immigrants. Asking Americans to call their lawmakers, he added: “This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.”Democrats dismissed his talk of crisis as overstated cynicism and, with polls showing Mr. Trump bearing more of the blame since the partial shutdown began last month, betrayed no signs of giving in. The White House earlier in the day dispatched Vice President Mike Pence and others to Capitol Hill to try to shore up Senate Republicans, who are growing increasingly anxious as the standoff drags on.In their own televised response on Tuesday night, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, accused the president of stoking fear and mocked him for asking taxpayers to foot the bill for a wall he had long said Mexico would pay for.“President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government,” Ms. Pelosi said.In taking his argument to a national television audience and on a trip to the Texas border he plans to take on Thursday, Mr. Trump hoped to reframe the debate. After spending much of the first two weeks of the shutdown cloistered in the White House, he has now opted to use the powers of the presidency to focus public attention on his ominous warnings about the border.[Full transcripts: Trump’s speech and the Democratic response.]Yet privately, Mr. Trump dismissed his own new strategy as pointless. In an off-the-record lunch with television anchors hours before the address, he made clear in blunt terms that he was not inclined to give the speech or go to Texas, but was talked into it by advisers, according to two people briefed on the discussion who asked not to be identified sharing details.“It’s not going to change a damn thing, but I’m still doing it,” Mr. Trump said of the border visit, according to one of the people, who was in the room. The trip was merely a photo opportunity, he said. “But,” he added, gesturing at his communications aides Bill Shine, Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Kellyanne Conway, “these people behind you say it’s worth it.”Mr. Trump plans to head to the Capitol on Wednesday to attend a Senate Republican lunch and later will host congressional leaders from both parties to resume negotiations that so far have made little progress. Mr. Trump has insisted on $5.7 billion for the wall, while Ms. Pelosi said she would not give him a dollar for a wall she has called “immoral.”In a nod to Democrats, Mr. Trump spent the first half of his talk on the humanitarian situation at the border before even mentioning the wall, expressing sympathy for those victimized by human smugglers. “This is a humanitarian crisis — a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul,” he said.Even so, he directly took on Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer. “The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized,” he said.Mr. Trump has made the wall the singular focus of his presidency as he enters his third year in office. His promise to erect a “big, beautiful wall” along the border became perhaps the most memorable promise on the campaign trail this fall, eliciting chants from supporters of “build the wall,” and he has been frustrated by his inability to deliver on it.But his alarming description of a “crisis” at the border has raised credibility questions. While experts agree there are serious problems to address, migrant border crossings have actually been declining for nearly two decades. The majority of heroin enters the United States through legal ports of entry, not through open areas of the border. And the State Department said in a recent report that there was “no credible evidence” that terrorist groups had sent operatives to enter the United States through Mexico.At one point in his speech, he even suggested that Democrats had signaled that they would accept his wall if redesigned. “At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall,” he said, even though Democratic leaders have made clear they oppose the barrier regardless of the material.Even so, Democrats, many of whom like Mr. Schumer voted in 2006 for 700 miles of fencing along the border, did not want to conduct the debate on Mr. Trump’s terms. Instead, they focused attention on the damaging effects of the shutdown, already the second longest in American history. About 800,000 government employees are either furloughed or working without pay, in addition to hundreds of thousands of contractors.House Democrats planned to approve individual spending bills this week that were intended to reopen closed departments one at a time in hopes of putting Republicans on the defensive, but Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has said he would not put any bill on the floor without Mr. Trump’s explicit support.Senate Democrats took to the floor on Tuesday to pressure Mr. McConnell and vowed to block consideration of other legislation until the government is reopened.Mr. McConnell fired back, noting the 2006 legislation. “Maybe the Democratic Party was for secure borders before they were against them,” he said. “Or maybe they’re just making it up as they go along. Or maybe they are that dead-set on opposing this particular president on any issue, for any reason, just for the sake of opposing him.”But two more Republicans, Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, spoke out on Tuesday in favor of reopening the government while negotiations over border security continue. “I think we can walk and chew gum,” Ms. Murkowski told reporters.Ms. Capito expressed frustration with the shutdown and “how useless it is,” indicating that she might support reopening the government while wall talks continue. “I mean, I think I could live with that, but let’s see what he says tonight,” she said before the speech.That makes five Republican senators who have expressed such a position, which if combined with a unanimous Democratic caucus would make a majority to reopen the government if Mr. McConnell were to allow a vote.Allies of the president warned fellow Republicans to stand with Mr. Trump. “If we undercut the president, that’s the end of his presidency and the end of our party,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said on Fox News after the speech.The political nature of the fight was hard to miss. Just hours before he went on air, Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign sent out a fund-raising email asking supporters to raise $500,000 by the time his speech began. On the other side, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a possible candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination next year, offered his own response after Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer.For all of the pyrotechnics of competing national speeches, it seemed like a political Kabuki dance that by the end of the evening had changed no minds in Washington.Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the No. 5 House Democrat, who perhaps most succinctly summed up his party’s response: “We are not paying a $5 billion ransom note for your medieval border wall,” he wrote on Twitter, with a castle emoji. “And nothing you just said will change that cold, hard reality.”If Democrats do not approve money for the wall, Mr. Trump has threatened to declare a national emergency and proceed with construction without Congress, a move that could provoke a constitutional clash with the legislative branch over the power of the federal purse. While some legal experts said the president has a plausible case given current law, it would almost surely generate a court challenge.Even some Republicans warned against it. Senator Susan Collins of Maine said that although the law provides the president with emergency powers, “the administration should not act on a claim of dubious constitutional authority.” She added, “It should get authorization from Congress before repurposing such a significant sum of money for a border wall.”The wall is popular with Mr. Trump’s base, but the public at large holds the president responsible for the shutdown, according to polls. In a Reuters-Ipsos poll, 51 percent of respondents said that Mr. Trump “deserves most of the blame,” up four percentage points from earlier in the crisis, while 32 percent pointed the finger at congressional Democrats.Moreover, the public seems to have grown weary of the impasse. Seventy percent of registered voters in the latest The Hill-HarrisX poll favored a compromise, while just 30 percent said sticking to principles was more important than reopening the government.The president’s use of the Oval Office for the speech stirred some debate, with critics asserting that a setting more typically used for occasions of war or other national security crises was being turned into a partisan platform. The subsequent joint statement by Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer was the first time opposition leaders were given national airtime to respond to a president in the Oval Office.Not counting speeches to Congress, Mr. Trump had made only five formal addresses to the nation before Tuesday night, three of them in prime time and none from the Oval Office, according to Mark Knoller, a longtime CBS News journalist who tracks recent presidential history. Mr. Trump’s previous prime-time speeches were to introduce his two Supreme Court nominations and to announce his decision to send more troops to Afghanistan.By contrast, President Bill Clinton gave 16 addresses to the nation over eight years, 14 of them from the Oval Office. President George W. Bush gave 23 such addresses, six from the Oval Office, and President Barack Obama gave 12, with three from his office."
3,"EL PASO — President Trump came to this bustling border city on Monday to rally support for his wall with Mexico. But he was met by El Paso’s favorite son, Beto O’Rourke, who denounced Mr. Trump’s claim that walls reduce violent crime and led the city’s residents in his own boisterous show of opposition.The dueling rallies, just across the Rio Grande from Mexico, offered a vivid snapshot of the national debate over immigration, as well as a tantalizing early glimpse of the rivalry between Mr. Trump and Mr. O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman who is now considering a challenge to the president in 2020.As he mulls a run for the Democratic presidential nomination, Mr. O’Rourke has seized on immigration as a defining issue. With a flair for political theater that even Mr. Trump took note of, Mr. O’Rourke addressed a crowd less than a mile from the El Paso County Coliseum, where the president spoke to thousands of cheering supporters.“We are not safe because of walls but in spite of walls,” Mr. O’Rourke said, speaking to supporters within earshot of Mr. Trump’s rally. “We have so much to give, so much to show the rest of the country.”Inside the arena, Mr. Trump was flanked by banners that said, “Finish the Wall,” and he faced a sea of red and blue signs urging him to “Build the Wall.”“We need the wall, and it has to be built,” Mr. Trump said, adding, “Today we started building the big beautiful wall right on the Rio Grande.”Mr. Trump’s rally, his first since an acrimonious debate over funding of the wall shut down the government, came as negotiators in Washington appeared to reach a deal, potentially averting another shutdown. The president said he was told about the agreement just before taking the stage.“We probably have some good news,” Mr. Trump said, almost grudgingly, before adding, “I don’t even want to hear about it.”In an interview with Laura Ingraham of Fox News that aired at the end of the rally, Mr. Trump seemed more concerned with talking about the number of supporters in the crowd on Monday night than about an update on negotiations with Congress.The president said he had had the option of receiving a briefing on the negotiations or going on camera.“It was between the deal and you, and I had to choose you,” Mr. Trump said. “They’re talking, and we’ll see what happens.”The president’s choice of El Paso to make his argument was curious on several grounds. Violent crime actually declined for years in this vibrant immigrant city across the river from Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, before the Army Corps of Engineers began building a fence in 2008. It rose during the two years before and after the barrier was constructed.[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]A Democratic stronghold in a mostly Republican state, El Paso has long been one of the safer cities of its size in the United States — a trend that local law enforcement officials attribute to the residents and community policing, not to the border fence.Still, if Mr. Trump wanted to force the debate with Democrats, he could hardly have chosen a better place. The presence of Mr. O’Rourke, who represented the city in Congress before he gave up his House seat to run unsuccessfully for the Senate, guaranteed the president the kind of confrontation he relishes, even if the two men did not come face to face.Mr. Trump lost little time in ridiculing Mr. O’Rourke, describing him as “a young man who’s got very little going for himself, except he’s got a good first name.”“He’s supposed to win in order to run,” the president added. “Beto was defeated.”Mr. Trump’s discursive style delighted his crowd, though protesters heckled him more frequently than at other rallies since he became president. After one protester was escorted out of the arena to a chorus of boos from the crowd, the president asked, “Is there any place that’s more fun to be than a Trump rally?”Mr. Trump has insisted that El Paso was an example of why a wall is necessary.“Walls work,” he said, repeating his assertion that the crime rate went down in El Paso after the border wall was built. “Thanks to a border wall with Mexico,” he said, El Paso is “one of America’s safest cities.”Mr. O’Rourke debunked that claim on Friday in a lengthy post on the website Medium, in which he also tried to set out an alternative blueprint for overhauling the nation’s immigration laws. El Paso’s success, he said, repudiated Mr. Trump’s call for a border wall.“He will promise a wall and will repeat his lies about the dangers that immigrants pose,” Mr. O’Rourke said of the president.Mr. O’Rourke has spotlighted his heavily Latino hometown on Facebook and on other social media sites as an example of what works in immigration policy.A short walk from the coliseum, protesters gathered to march in a show of dissent against the president. Many held signs criticizing Mr. Trump; buttons, signs and stickers proclaiming “Beto 2020” could be seen throughout the crowd.“Trump is an insult to my proud military family,” said Isabel Harris, 60, an immigrant from Mexico who held a sign honoring her son Martin Ferrufino, 32, a disabled veteran of the Iraq war.Ms. Harris said Mr. Trump’s efforts to curb immigration was an affront to her son, who crossed the border illegally as a child. Later, he attended high school in El Paso and joined the Army.“My son sacrificed for this country, and this is how he’s treated? How we are treated?” Ms. Harris said in Spanish.Nearby, two El Paso-born brothers, Adam and Andrew Peña, also joined the protest against Mr. Trump.“Trump thinks he can rule us by fear,” said Adam Peña, 31, a lawyer who lives in San Diego and traveled to El Paso to voice his opposition. “I’m here to prove him wrong.”Mr. Trump got the idea to focus on El Paso from an exchange with the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, who told him the wall drastically reduced the city’s crime rate and therefore served as a persuasive argument for building one along more of the southwestern border.“After that fence went up and separated Juárez, which still has an extremely high crime rate, the crime rates in El Paso are now some of the lowest in the country,” Mr. Paxton said. “So we know it works.”While it is true that Juárez has a much higher crime rate than El Paso — and while the fence did cut down on illegal crossings — the rest of his statement is, at best, highly misleading.The El Paso Times, which analyzed three decades of statistics from the F.B.I. and the local police, found that crime peaked in 1993, with more than 6,500 violent crimes recorded. It then dropped by 34 percent over the next 13 years.The crime rate then increased by 17 percent from 2006 to 2011. Construction of the wall began in 2008, under President George W. Bush, and was completed in mid-2009, during the Obama administration. Crime has ebbed and flowed within a fairly narrow band since then.Local officials, including Mayor Dee Margo, a Republican, have spoken out against Mr. Trump’s claims. Representative Veronica Escobar, a Democrat who recently won Mr. O’Rourke’s former seat, has demanded that the president apologize and meet with migrant families seeking asylum in the United States. Among lawmakers who represent border districts, there is remarkably little support for a wall.Yet Mr. Trump has been undeterred. He repeated grisly stories of violent crimes committed by illegal immigrants — never mind that the crime rate among immigrants is no higher than among native-born residents. He said a wall would stem the flow of deadly opioids and other illicit drugs into the United States — another dubious assertion, given that most drugs arrive at legal ports of entry.Mr. Trump’s aides are trying to build momentum after last week’s State of the Union address, which they believe was well received by his political base. Unlike some of his predecessors, the president did not immediately leave on a road trip to sell the messages in the address. But he has been eager to return to rallies, which energize him and filled up his calendar before the midterm elections.Mr. Trump dismissed those who disputed his facts about the wall, saying the mayor of El Paso was “full of crap,” even if he was a Republican.“People of El Paso,” he asked, “am I right?”"
4,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump issued the first veto of his presidency on Friday to block a measure passed by Democrats and Republicans in Congress that would terminate his emergency declaration for a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.The veto, made necessary after a strong and unusual rebuke from members of Trump's Republican party, capped a week that left Trump politically wounded, at least temporarily, as immigration and his signature promise of a wall become a flashpoint again in the 2020 presidential campaign.Congress is unlikely to muster the votes to override Trump's veto, a fact that left White House officials confident despite disappointment that it passed the Republican-controlled Senate at all. The bipartisan vote on Thursday was a slap at Trump for his decision to circumvent Congress and take money already designated for other programs to pay for a barrier on the southern border.Twelve Republicans joined Democrats in the Senate to pass the measure, concerned that the president had overstepped his authority.Trump repeated his view that a crisis existed at the border, called the resolution reckless and said he was proud to veto it.""As president the protection of the nation is my highest duty. Yesterday, Congress passed a dangerous resolution that if signed into law would put countless Americans in danger, very grave danger,"" he said, sitting behind his desk in the Oval Office. ""Congress has the freedom to pass this resolution, and I have the duty to veto it.""The White House had lobbied heavily for Republicans to back Trump, despite concerns among some about executive overreach and precedent-setting action that a future Democratic president could copy on policies that Republicans oppose. The president, without acknowledging that lobbying, said he had sympathy for those who defied him, adding they did what they had to do.U.S. Attorney General William Barr said the president's emergency declaration was legal. It is being challenged in court as an unconstitutional usurpation of Congress' power of the purse.Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi said her chamber would vote on March 26 to override the veto.“The House and Senate resoundingly rejected the president’s lawless power grab, yet the president has chosen to continue to defy the Constitution, the Congress and the will of the American people,"" she said in a statement.The Senate would have to vote to override the veto as well, requiring more Republicans than the original 12 to sign on, which is unlikely to happen.Trump was flanked by border officials and people whose relatives were killed by someone who was in the United States illegally. They praised the president for standing firm on the issue, which resonates strongly with his political base.Researchers have said that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes, despite Trump repeatedly linking immigration and crime. The president has said he wants a wall to prevent immigrants from crossing into the United States illegally. Democrats deny there is an emergency at the border, saying border crossings are at a four-decade low. Trump thanked Republican senators who voted for his declaration in a Twitter post earlier on Friday. ""Watch, when you get back to your State, they will LOVE you more than ever before!"" he said.Trump made a border wall a central promise of his 2016 campaign for the White House. He initially insisted that Mexico would pay for the wall but it has declined to do so. Last year, Trump forced a government shutdown over an impasse with Congress over funding for the barrier. When a deal to prevent another shutdown did not give him the funding he requested, Trump declared a national emergency, redirecting funds that were allocated for other projects to build the barrier instead.

7,"WASHINGTON — Democratic U.S. senators berated top Defense Department officials on Thursday over the Trump administration's plan to sidestep Congress by using money intended for ongoing wars to finance the president's long-desired border wall with Mexico.In the budget plan sent to Capitol Hill on Monday, President Donald Trump proposed adding some $100 billion dollars to a ""slush fund"" set aside for what the Pentagon calls ""Overseas Contingency Operations"" (OCO).The Pentagon intends to use the OCO fund to boost the amount of money it has available to avoid budget caps passed by Congress that prevent increasing military spending without also boosting non-defense spending.The plan annoyed Democrats as well as some Republicans who are already pushing back against Trump with votes against his declaration of a ""national emergency"" along the border with Mexico as well as his support for Saudi Arabia in the war in Yemen.""What we're really talking about here is the establishment of a slush fund to hide what's happening with defense spending,"" said Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, during an unusually combative Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. Trump requested $750 billion for defense, including about $718 billion for the Pentagon.The Pentagon's budget request included $165 billion in OCO funding. The White House directed defense officials to submit a request that separated $98 billion from the OCO ""for base requirements"" in addition to $67 billion to fund wars.Last year's OCO request was only $69 billion with no separate funding broken out.Senator Jack Reed, the top committee Democrat, called the move ""a particularly egregious misuse of the OCO account"" that ""exceeds any precedent and cannot be justified.""On top of the extra OCO request, another $9 billion would be put in an ""emergency"" account that could be used to fund a U.S.-Mexico border wall or repair bases damaged by hurricanes.Pentagon officials defended the plan.""There is no slush fund,"" acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said. It was his first appearance at a congressional public hearing since taking over from Jim Mattis on Jan. 1.Republican Senator Tom Cotton said he was not optimistic that Republicans and Democrats could reach a budget deal, and might have to pass a temporary spending bill. ""I do believe we may be heading in the direction of a full-year continuing resolution."" he said. Lawmakers also criticized the Pentagon for failing to detail what military projects could be cut back to pay for the wall.

8,"WASHINGTON — President Trump unleashed an offensive on Monday to persuade Americans that a “humanitarian and security crisis” on the southern border must be addressed before a government shutdown can end, announcing a prime-time address for Tuesday and a trip to the border later in the week.Vice President Mike Pence briefed reporters on the status of negotiations in a hastily arranged session, part of an orchestrated effort to sway balking Democrats who say the government should reopen while they wrangle over Mr. Trump’s demand for $5.7 billion to begin his border wall.The shutdown, heading into Day 18, has become a critical test for Mr. Trump, who campaigned as a master negotiator and deal maker but so far has achieved virtually no agreements with Democrats. Already, it is the second-longest breakdown in government funding in the nation’s history, affecting about 800,000 federal workers, many of whom will miss their first paycheck this week. The president has offered little to his Democratic adversaries to lure them to the table.Now, he will try to use a broad-based public appeal to raise the pressure.Senate Democrats, for their part, were moving to halt legislation to pressure Republicans to reopen the government, starting Tuesday. And late Monday, the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate released a joint statement demanding equal television time.“Democrats must immediately be given equal airtime,” said the leaders, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. They said that “if his past statements are any indication,” Mr. Trump’s address “will be full of malice and misinformation.”The vice president, while conceding that no progress was made in weekend negotiations with senior Democratic staff members, said Democrats “did not dispute our facts” about what he called a “humanitarian and security crisis.” Democrats and immigration advocates have argued that the administration has vastly overstated the scope of the border situation.Democrats said Mr. Pence appeared to be misrepresenting their position. While they agreed there was a crisis at the border, one senior Senate Democratic official said, they see it as a humanitarian rather than national security issue. As such, Democrats view Mr. Trump’s proposed wall as an expensive and pointless response that does nothing to address the needs on the ground.Several aides briefed on the weekend negotiations said the White House appeared eager to promote agreement on almost anything in lieu of any real progress between the two sides.That has led Mr. Trump to consider using a president’s “emergency powers” to order that the wall be built.But Mr. Pence said the White House was bargaining in good faith. The administration has now provided Democrats details they were seeking about how any border security money would be spent, and officials have incorporated at least one Democratic idea, to allow migrant children seeking asylum to apply in their home countries rather than make a treacherous journey to the United States border.“The question I have is: When are the Democrats going to start negotiating?” Mr. Pence said.The administration’s credibility continues to suffer, as Democrats call out Mr. Trump for falsehoods about the crisis, such as his assertion that former presidents had told him privately that they should have built the wall. On Monday, former President Jimmy Carter joined the list of presidents who said they had never discussed a border wall with Mr. Trump.With talks to end the shutdown at a standstill, Mr. Pence said the president had directed the Office of Management and Budget to take steps to “mitigate” its effects, including an order to the Internal Revenue Service to issue tax refunds. Under previous shutdown plans — and interpretations of federal law — the I.R.S. was prohibited from dispensing tax refunds when Congress had not approved money to fund the Treasury Department, as is the case now.On Capitol Hill, Democrats tried to use leverage of their own to force Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to come to the table and pressure Mr. Trump. On Monday, Democrats said they would vote against advancing a package of bipartisan Middle East policy bills slated for consideration this week unless Republicans allowed a vote on bills to reopen shuttered federal departments already passed by the House — a decision that could scuttle its prospects if Democrats stick together.Senate Democrats did not indicate whether they are ready to block other bills, but their position raised the prospect that a significant portion of the chamber’s work could halt until the Senate gets to vote to reopen the parts of the government now closed.The House, under Ms. Pelosi, passed a package of bills on Thursday, the day Democrats took control of the chamber, to reopen the one-quarter of the government without funding Mr. Trump’s wall. But Mr. McConnell has refused to consider them, insisting that he will not bring up any legislation that does not have Mr. Trump’s explicit support.“Unfortunately, President Trump keeps rejecting the bipartisan House-passed bills, which have already received strong bipartisan support in the Senate, to reopen the government,” Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer wrote. “Instead, he is still demanding that American taxpayers pay at least $5.7 billion for his wall, which can’t pass either chamber of Congress and of course Mexico is not paying for.”It is unclear what effect the Democratic screw tightening will have on Mr. McConnell, a political tactician who sees little benefit in entering the shutdown fray.Republicans in the chamber turned the blame around on Democrats.“If it’s all about defeating President Trump and embarrassing him politically, which seems to be the focus of Ms. Pelosi and Senator Schumer, then obviously we’re not going to get a deal anytime soon,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas.Democrats in the House were preparing their own steps, intended to pull more moderate Republicans to their position. The Rules Committee will start the process of passing individual appropriations bills to reopen the government on Tuesday, beginning with legislation that would fund the Treasury Department, including the I.R.S.Mr. Trump’s request that the major networks broadcast his speech live set off a day of tense deliberations at ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox. By Monday evening, they had all agreed to broadcast the president’s address live at 9 p.m. Eastern. Cable news channels, including CNN and Fox News, will also carry the speech.Some journalists worry that handing Mr. Trump a chunk of network prime time could allow the president to assert falsehoods to tens of millions of viewers. But several network producers said privately on Monday that they were uncomfortable turning down the president amid a national event affecting millions like the government shutdown. Declining Mr. Trump’s request could also open the networks to accusations of partisan bias.Ted Koppel, the veteran ABC anchor, said in an interview that given that Mr. Trump had not previously requested time for an Oval Office speech, the networks ought to give him “the benefit of the doubt.”“When the president of the United States asks for airtime, you’ve got to do it,” Mr. Koppel said. “If what he has to say is clearly just in his self-interest and does not address the greater national interest, then the next time the White House comes around, I might not be inclined to offer it.”In the recent past, White House requests to interrupt prime-time programming on the nation’s broadcast networks were rare and usually reserved for moments of national import, like the death of Osama bin Laden, and networks usually granted the requests. There have been instances, however, where such requests were rejected by producers as insufficiently newsworthy. In 2014, the networks declined a request from the Obama administration to air his speech about using executive action to change immigration policy.The acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, has for days told other White House officials that a presidential address would be a way for Mr. Trump to try to recast the narrative around the shutdown fight.On Monday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, announced Mr. Trump’s plans to travel Thursday to the border, which would be the 20th day of the partial government shutdown if an agreement between Congress and the White House is not reached."
9,"LONDON — In an apparent effort to bolster his case for a wall along the Mexican border, President Trump pointed on Wednesday to examples of walls going up around the world, especially barriers built in Europe, as proof that they work.Here’s an assessment of those claims.While governments around the world have built or planned to build 77 walls, about seven such barriers are not expected to materialize anytime soon, said Elisabeth Vallet, a researcher at the University of Quebec in Montreal who keeps a tally of such construction. Seventy walls is closer to the truth, she said. Europe has built about 1,000 kilometers, or just over 620 miles, of walls since 2015, Ms. Vallet said. The White House did not respond to questions about the source of the numbers the president cited in his tweet. Some observers on social media speculated that he had been watching a report on Fox Business that examined the issue the night before.What Mr. Trump may think of as a “big, beautiful wall,” whether made of concrete or steel slats, would not fit the definition in Europe. Most of the walls he referred to on the Continent are, in fact, different styles of fences with masonry foundations. And not all of them were designed with migration in mind. Countries like Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary and Slovenia have built walls since 2015 to quell the flow of migrants arriving mainly from the Middle East via the Balkan Route. But Ukraine and the Baltic States that share borders with Russia have started raising barriers to mark their territories in response to perceived threats of invasion from their larger neighbor. “Almost a third of the walls in the world are designed to keep the neighbor out,” Ms. Vallet said. Much like the desert terrain along the United States border with Mexico, the perilous seas, not walls, have been the main obstacle for people trying to get to Europe. The Continent has gone beyond building walls to impede the arrival of undocumented migrants. Frontex, the European Union’s border agency, and national governments raised a security apparatus that is often referred to as Fortress Europe.It includes naval patrols and surveillance on the Mediterranean, where most migrants try to cross into Europe. European governments work with countries like Libya, Morocco and Turkey to try to deter migrants from attempting deadly sea crossings. Last year, an estimated 150,000 illegal crossings were detected on the external borders of the European Union, according to Frontex. (The same person may attempt the crossing and be counted in different locations.) This was 25 percent less than in 2017, and the lowest level in five years.Still, far-right politicians like Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary have promoted the specter of an impending migration crisis, accompanied by xenophobic rhetoric, to justify funds for border protection. [Read more about whether Europe is still facing a migration crisis.]“The boosting and militarization of border security has led to a higher death toll for forcibly displaced persons,” according to a report released in May by the Transnational Institute, a research and advocacy institute.In another report on border walls, researchers at the institute looked at maritime barriers in the Mediterranean and considered them as significant or more significant than land barriers on the European continent. Walls have worked for politicians who used them as a means to mobilize supporters, but not to deal with the problem of migration, Nick Buxton, a researcher with the institute, said by phone. “You can build more and more walls until you’re a completely walled society, but all you’re doing is making it more and more dangerous,” he said. “People will find ways to cross walls.” The fence around the entrance of the tunnel providing the only land access to Britain from Continental Europe has failed to deter illegal crossings. Last year, about 500 migrants, 10 times as many as in 2017, attempted to cross the perilous waters of the English Channel from France. More than half completed the journey.Reports of smugglers operating around most of these points of access suggest to researchers that walls alone cannot solve the problem. “Every time you have a border fence and no public policy that is dealing with the root problem, it is as if you were inviting organized crime to the table,” Ms. Vallet said. Ms. Vallet said she could not think of historical examples of walls that work. She noted that both the Great Wall of China and the Maginot Line in France — each built at great expense — ultimately failed to stop invaders. "
10,"The crowdfunding platform GoFundMe said that more than $20 million in donations were slated to be refunded after a campaign to raise $1 billion for the Trump administration to build a wall on the border with Mexico had fallen well short of its goal.The fund-raising campaign, which began last month, had gone viral as President Trump’s attempt to get Congress to pay for the wall fueled a heated political dispute and resulted in a partial shutdown of the federal government.More than 325,000 donors had pledged in the GoFundMe campaign that the organizer, a veteran from Florida named Brian Kolfage, said would have been used for President Trump’s border wall.But in a note posted on the campaign’s website on Friday, Mr. Kolfage said the federal government would not be able to accept the donations “anytime soon.”Mr. Kolfage said in an interview that donating to the government would have required approval from Congress and that he knew that a Democrat-controlled House would not give its approval.Instead, Mr. Kolfage said, he has formed a Florida-based nonprofit organization called We Build the Wall that will use donations to finance a private effort to build parts of the wall where private landowners allow construction.GoFundMe donors would have to proactively choose to redirect their money to the nonprofit; otherwise, they would be refunded.Mr. Kolfage said he did not know exactly how many donors would want to redirect their money nor how many landowners would want parts of the wall constructed on their properties.“When Americans see us completing real miles of beautiful wall, we know that we will raise the many billions we need to finally secure the entire border,” Mr. Kolfage said on the updated GoFundMe campaign page.The Department of Homeland Security and the Trump administration did not respond to requests for comment on Friday evening on the possibility of a privately funded effort to build the wall.Typically, GoFundMe campaigns can still collect money even if they do not meet their goal.But Bobby Whithorne, a spokesman for GoFundMe, said in a statement on Friday that Mr. Kolfage’s original campaign page had said “If we don’t reach our goal or come significantly close we will refund every single penny” and that “100% of your donations will go to the Trump Wall. If for ANY reason we don’t reach our goal we will refund your donation.”Mr. Whithorne said that since the campaign was not going to reach the $1 billion goal, and that both GoFundMe and Mr. Kolfage had determined the money raised could not be given to the federal government, GoFundMe had contacted all donors to the original campaign about the refund.Donors can ask for a refund immediately, Mr. Whithorne said, but if they do not choose to redirect their money to the nonprofit, they will automatically receive a refund in 90 days.Immigration advocacy groups had condemned the GoFundMe campaign as a xenophobic result of fearmongering about immigrants. Some had started competing fund-raising campaigns to raise money for Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, a Texas nonprofit known as Raices.Jonathan Ryan, president and chief executive of Raices, said that despite the change in Mr. Kolfage’s campaign, the original critiques of it still stand.“It’s a difference without a change,” Mr. Ryan said. “The wall remains the wrong direction for us as a country, something that will not help advance any of our national interests and that would only serve to further harm vulnerable refugees and immigrants seeking protection in our country.”This week, Mr. Trump appeared on television in an attempt to pressure Congress into paying for the border wall, characterizing the situation at the Mexican border as a “humanitarian crisis” that was exposing the country to crime, drugs and terrorism.Experts, however, point out that migrant border crossings have been declining over about two decades. The State Department said in a recent report that there was “no credible evidence” that terrorist groups had sent operatives to enter the country through Mexico."
11,"President Trump has addressed the nation in prime time from the Oval Office, delivered remarks from the Rose Garden, met with Democrats in the Situation Room and traveled to the border with Mexico to make his case that the government would not reopen unless he got funding for a border wall.Thirty-five days into the shutdown, the president announced on Friday from the Rose Garden that the government would reopen until at least Feb. 15, giving Congress time to work out a deal on border security.He did not get any funding for a wall. And on Friday, he did not advance any new arguments for building one. In fact, many of the claims he made were recycled heavily from previous comments and contained many of the same misstatements and exaggerations. Also notable was something Mr. Trump did not say, namely that Mexico would pay for the wall, one of the most often repeated, and unsupported, claims he has made on the border funding dispute.The essence of Mr. Trump’s pitch for a border wall — that a porous border had led to a crime and drug epidemic — remained unchanged.Last year, he said, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement “removed 10,000 known or suspected gang members like MS-13 and members as bad as them.” (This is exaggerated; the agency reported it had removed 5,872 “known or suspected” gang members in the 2018 fiscal year.)In addition, Mr. Trump repeated the statistic that in the past two years, ICE “arrested a total of 266,000 criminal aliens inside of the United States, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes and 4,000 homicides or, as you would call them, violent, vicious killings.” The figures include both charges and convictions, and each arrest may represent multiple offenses. The most common charges were traffic violations and drug and immigration offenses.“Drugs kill much more than 70,000 Americans a year and cost our society in excess of $700 billion,” the president said. The figures are accurate for overdose deaths and the economic costs of addiction. But a border wall would do little to prevent the 35 percent of overdose deaths involving prescription opioids or the $627.5 billion in costs incurred because of tobacco, alcohol and prescription drug addiction.Still, the president pressed the case.“I believe that crime in this country can go down by a massive percentage if we have great security on our southern border,” Mr. Trump said. “I believe drugs, large percentages of which come through the southern border, will be cut by a number that nobody will believe.”The claim that a wall would lead to a huge decrease in crime is not supported by statistics. Construction of a wall would not suddenly remove millions of undocumented immigrants already in the United States, and there is no evidence of a causal link between immigration and crime. As for drugs, 90 percent of heroin coming into the United States enters through the southern border. But it is mostly smuggled through legal ports of entry and not wall-less areas. Most Fentanyl arrives in the United States from China through the mail.Though border crossings have been declining for nearly two decades, Mr. Trump continued to stress the need for a border wall with exaggerated data and overstated claims.“Last month was the third straight month in a row with 60,000 apprehensions on our southern border,” he said. “Think of that. We apprehended 60,000 people.”That monthly figure for October and November — data for December was not yet publicly posted — includes the 51,000 people caught illegally crossing the border, as well as the 9,000 to 10,000 people who attempted to enter through legal ports of entry but were deemed “inadmissible” each month. In the 2018 fiscal year, apprehensions at the border averaged 33,000 per month.And he recounted with graphic detail what happens to victims of smugglers: “Women are tied up. They’re bound. Duct tape put around their faces, around their mouths. In many cases, they can’t even breathe. They’re put in the backs of cars or vans or trucks. They don’t go through your port of entry. They make a right turn going very quickly.”It is possible that Mr. Trump learned of a duct-taping case from law enforcement officers, but more than a dozen experts in human trafficking told The Washington Post and The Toronto Star that they had not witnessed or heard of such an episode.For emphasis, he added, “It’s at the worst level — human trafficking — in the history of the world.” Millions of Africans were forcibly enslaved and trafficked during the 15th and 18th centuries.Mr. Trump thanked federal workers for their sacrifice and support: “Not only did you not complain, but in many cases, you encouraged me to keep going because you care so much about our country and about its border security.” Whatever Mr. Trump may have personally heard, polls have shown the opposite — most civil servants have overwhelmingly opposed the shutdown.Beyond federal workers, he said, Republicans and Democrats — and, by extension, the American people — are “for complete border security, and they have finally and fully acknowledged that having barriers, fencing or walls — or whatever you want to call it — will be an important part of the solution.”A Washington Post poll this week noted that surveys have “consistently showed that a majority of Americans do not support the wall.” The Post-ABC News poll found that 54 percent of Americans oppose the project, while 42 percent support it, unchanged from a survey two weeks ago.On Friday, the president said, “We do not need 2,000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea — we never did.” He added that he had never proposed such a thing. Dozens of times during the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump promised to build a wall along the southwestern border, usually saying it would be 1,000 miles long at varying heights and costs. At times, the building materials changed. He mentioned concrete, steel and, at one point, even a wall that would have solar panels. But a wall and the unsupported pledge that Mexico would pay for it were foundational elements of his campaign, and Mr. Trump has continued to make similar assertions throughout his presidency."
12,"WASHINGTON — Before it became the chief sticking point in a government shutdown drama that threatens to consume his presidency at a critical moment, President Trump’s promise to build a wall on the southwestern border was a memory trick for an undisciplined candidate.As Mr. Trump began exploring a presidential run in 2014, his political advisers landed on the idea of a border wall as a mnemonic device of sorts, a way to make sure their candidate — who hated reading from a script but loved boasting about himself and his talents as a builder — would remember to talk about getting tough on immigration, which was to be a signature issue in his nascent campaign.“How do we get him to continue to talk about immigration?” Sam Nunberg, one of Mr. Trump’s early political advisers, recalled telling Roger J. Stone Jr., another adviser. “We’re going to get him to talk about he’s going to build a wall.”Talk Mr. Trump did, and the line drew rapturous cheers from conservative audiences, thrilling the candidate and soon becoming a staple of campaign speeches. Chants of “Build the wall!” echoed through arenas throughout the country.Now, Mr. Trump’s fixation with a border wall — the material embodiment of his keep-them-out immigration agenda — has run headlong into the new realities of divided government, pitting him against Democrats who reject the idea out of hand. The impasse is particularly remarkable given that even some immigration hard-liners do not regard the wall as their highest priority and fear that Mr. Trump’s preoccupation with it will prompt him to cut a deal that trades a relatively ineffectual measure for major concessions on immigration.“I’ve always thought it created a danger that he would trade almost anything in order to get the wall — I think that’s still a potential danger,” said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that argues for less immigration. “I’m still worried about that now.”That fear has been realized at times when Mr. Trump has explored a deal with Democrats on granting permanent legal status for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, known as Dreamers. The president has always walked away at the last moment from committing to preserving the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, but on Friday, FAIR, an anti-immigration group, warned him again that it would be a mistake.To many conservative activists who have pressed for decades for sharp reductions in both illegal and legal immigration — and some of the Republican lawmakers who are allied with them — a physical barrier on the border with Mexico is barely relevant, little more than a footnote to a long list of policy changes they believe are needed to fix a broken system.The disconnect is at the heart of the dilemma facing Mr. Trump as he labors to find a way out of an impasse that has shuttered large parts of the government and cost 800,000 federal employees their pay. Having spent more than four years — first as a candidate and then as president — whipping his core supporters into a frenzy over the idea of building a border wall, Mr. Trump finds himself in a political box of his own making.In transforming the wall into a powerful emblem of his anti-immigration message, Mr. Trump has made the proposal politically untouchable for Democrats, who have steadfastly refused to fund it, complicating the chances of any compromise.“As a messaging strategy, it was pretty successful,” Mr. Krikorian said. “The problem is, you got elected; now what do you do? Having made it his signature issue, Trump handed the Democrats a weapon against him.”The dynamic has been on vivid display this past week as Mr. Trump has argued that there can be no deal to reopen the government unless his wall is paid for, while Democrats, now in control of the House, have refused in ever sharper terms.“A wall is an immorality — it’s not who we are as a nation,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday. “This is not a wall between Mexico and the United States that the president is creating here; it’s a wall between reality and his constituents, his supporters.”Last month, in private comments to Democratic lawmakers after an Oval Office confrontation with Mr. Trump, Ms. Pelosi said the wall was “like a manhood thing for him.”Yet it has also become an outsize symbol in the other direction for Democrats, many of whom supported at least some sort of barrier along the border in the past but now cast Mr. Trump’s wall as a travesty. Sixty-four Democrats in the House and 26 in the Senate voted in 2006 for the Secure Fence Act, which provided for hundreds of miles of fencing along the border. Among them were Senators Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Chuck Schumer.“The only things that have changed is the situation at the border is worse and Donald Trump got elected,” said Kellyanne Conway, the president’s counselor.Ms. Conway said Mr. Trump had become so committed to a wall because it would not only prevent the entry of many illegal immigrants and stem the flow of drugs, but also discourage migrants from coming in the first place.“The reason he’s focused on the wall is he thinks you need a very robust physical barrier at the border that you can’t climb over, slide under, drive through or walk around,” she said. “He believes it’s got to be something that’s a deterrent that stops people from taking these perilous journeys.”Beyond the symbolism, Democrats now argue that a wall is an expensive and ineffective means of curbing illegal immigration. The majority of undocumented immigrants are people who overstay visas, not people who sneak across the border. A report released in March by Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security Committee found that Border Patrol agents on the front lines said they needed more technology and additional personnel to curb illegal immigration and drug traffic, with less than one half of one percent mentioning a wall.Mr. Schumer, now the Senate Democratic leader, has insisted for two years that any spending agreements contain language barring federal money for Mr. Trump’s wall. Republican leaders went along each time, even as the president became increasingly irate, once coming close to vetoing a spending package on the day of the White House signing ceremony.While most Republicans refuse to say so publicly for fear of angering Mr. Trump, many share the view that the wall is only a piece — and nowhere near the most important one — of a broader set of actions needed to overhaul the immigration system, including cuts to legal immigration, tighter standards for granting asylum and better enforcement.Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump’s acting chief of staff, gave voice to that position in 2015, when he was a congressman from South Carolina, telling a local radio station that Mr. Trump, at the time a presidential candidate, had an overly simplistic view of tackling immigration.“The fence is an easy thing to sell politically,” Mr. Mulvaney said then. “It’s an easy thing for someone who doesn’t follow the issue very closely to say, ‘Oh, well, that will just solve everything, build the fence.’ The fence doesn’t solve the problem.”“Just to say ‘build the darn fence’ and have that be the end of an immigration discussion is absurd and almost childish,” Mr. Mulvaney said.John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump’s former chief of staff, enraged Mr. Trump last year when he privately told a group of Democratic lawmakers that the president had not been “fully informed” when he proposed a border wall during his campaign, and had since “evolved” under Mr. Kelly’s tutelage. “The Wall is the Wall,” the president responded in an angry tweet contradicting his top aide.“To be honest, it’s not a wall,” Mr. Kelly said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times last month as he prepared to leave the White House, adding that the administration had abandoned the idea of a “solid concrete wall early on.” His comments prompted another irate tweet from Mr. Trump. “An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED,” he wrote.Mr. Trump himself has at other times said he is not necessarily wedded to a concrete wall but open to different forms of barriers at different points along the border, including steel slats. “I never said, ‘I’m going to build a concrete” wall, he said on Friday, rewriting history. “I said I’m going to build a wall.”NumbersUSA, another conservative group that presses for stricter immigration policies, circulated an article last month suggesting that Mr. Trump drop his wall demand in favor of a plan to mandate that all employers use E-Verify, an electronic system that checks immigration status for prospective employees.The wall “has sucked political capital from the pursuit of other, and arguably better, means to deter illegal immigrants,” wrote Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute.Yet Mr. Trump has tethered himself to the wall and shows no sign of letting go.Ann Coulter, who along with Rush Limbaugh, Matt Drudge and other conservative commentators has pressed Mr. Trump to live up to his campaign promise, said the focus on the wall was not to be to the exclusion of other policies aimed at stemming illegal immigration.“We want that stuff too — but we also want a wall,” she said in an email on Friday. “The chant at every campaign rally wasn’t, ‘Enforce E-Verify!’ ‘Tax remittances!’” she added, referring to a proposal to tax cash payments sent by immigrants to their families in Mexico and Central America.Advisers said the president became absorbed by the idea of a wall because it was the most memorable and tangible promise he made while stumping for the White House in 2016.“He wants to call it a wall because that’s what he campaigned on,” said Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax and a friend of Mr. Trump’s. “He’s very obsessed about carrying out his campaign promises — I think to a degree that’s unhealthy — but that’s important to him, and that’s not a bad thing.”Mr. Ruddy and some other advisers argue that Mr. Trump has more room to maneuver than he thinks, because his base would accept his word that some form of additional security along the border was the equivalent of a wall in terms of effectiveness.“Listening to Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter on this is a mistake,” Mr. Ruddy said. “I don’t think the president’s base moves even one inch from him even if he doesn’t get a wall. They know where his heart is, they know where his mind is.”Michael D’Antonio, a biographer of Mr. Trump, said the wall appealed to the builder and brander in him. “I think he hears the beep, beep, beep of a cement truck backing up and the product being poured and the wall rising,” Mr. D’Antonio said. “He can grasp that stuff. He loves it.”It would be a presidential legacy that future generations could see and touch, an accomplishment that would last for ages. “I think he’d like it being called the Great Wall of Trump,” Mr. D’Antonio said, with a plaque to the president who built it “every mile or so.”The simplicity of the concept made it a powerful sales pitch on the campaign trail. “It’s a four-letter thing,” Mr. D’Antonio said. “It’s an idea that can be expressed in a single word, and I think that has great appeal to him as a marketer. It’s sort of ‘crooked Hillary’ or ‘lock her up,’ but it’s even better.”"

14,"JACKSONVILLE, N.C. — The main road that connects a strip of tattoo parlors, pawn shops and restaurants to Camp Lejeune is still lined with broken trees bent by Hurricane Florence’s winds. Inside the gates, a new threat has arisen for the sprawling Marine Corps base as it contends with billions of dollars in hurricane damage and lingering effects of contaminated water: President Trump’s border wall.On Tuesday, the House will try to override the first veto of Mr. Trump’s presidency and rescue Congress’s bipartisan bid to block the president’s national emergency declaration, which Mr. Trump wants to use to siphon military funds from projects like Camp Lejeune’s reconstruction to build a wall on the Mexican border.Last month, Democrats appealed to Republicans — with only limited success — to vote down the president’s emergency on the lofty grounds of constitutional prerogative and Congress’s control of federal spending. This time, on the veto override, their appeal is more parochial: Look where the wall money will come from.“A bipartisan majority of Congress went on record in voting to rebuke this ill-conceived idea,” said Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. “Now that members of Congress can see the potential impact this proposal could have on projects in their home states, I hope they will take that into consideration before the vote to override the president’s veto.”The expansive list of Defense Department projects targeted for possible cuts — $12.9 billion in all — spans nearly all 50 states and more than two dozen countries where troops are stationed. Fire station repairs, new schools and training complexes are all slated for potential funding delays to fulfill Mr. Trump’s intent to take up to $3.6 billion in military construction funds for the wall. So are plans for Camp Lejeune’s new water treatment facility.“What may seem small is large to others,” said Monique Gibbs, 39, a Jacksonville, N.C., native who works with survivors of trauma and abuse.On Monday, Patrick M. Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, authorized the first transfer of Defense Department money to fencing construction at the southwestern border: up to $1 billion from military personnel funding toward the construction of 57 miles of border wall, improving roads and adding lighting in Yuma, Ariz., and El Paso, according to a letter sent to the Department of Homeland Security.That transfer was made without having to use the emergency declaration, but the Defense Department is rushing to sign contracts on several projects, hoping that will protect them before officials turn to military construction funds to fulfill the president’s request. But some projects would be hit if the emergency decree survives its congressional rebuke and court challenges, and delays could be consequential for service members and their families.National Guard officials are scrambling to award money to build a $9 million fire rescue station in Peoria, Ill., before it is lost to the border and locals are left with an outdated fire station — built in 1992 and incapable of providing 24-hour support.At Fort Campbell, Ky., home of the historic 101st Airborne Division, base housing and maintenance facilities are throwbacks to the 1950s. The structures have slowly degraded under the rapid deployment tempo of the wars since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, according to congressional aides who recently toured the facility. And without congressional intervention, construction on a $63 million middle school will be delayed and base officials will likely repurpose an aging high school in the interim.In Jacksonville, there is discomfort among residents that money for Camp Lejeune’s projects could be delayed for a wall more than a thousand miles away.John Henley, a defense contractor here, doubted the “financial feasibility” of Mr. Trump’s signature campaign promise, but he also was resigned to a local hit.“I hate to make it so nonchalant; a building or two may fall down before they get repaired,” Mr. Henley, 34, said as he polished off a black cherry and grape snow cone a couple miles from Camp Lejeune. But, he added, “we’re a resilient type.”Efforts to turn the list into political ammunition against Republicans are particularly pointed in North Carolina, where Senator Thom Tillis, a first-term Republican, is running for re-election next year. Mr. Tillis publicly outlined his intent to vote against Mr. Trump’s national emergency declaration last month in a Washington Post opinion piece last month that dwelt on his constitutional responsibilities.Then, just before the vote last week, he changed his mind and voted with the president.Already, the state Democratic Party has blasted out emails detailing which North Carolina projects were on the list — including the Camp Lejeune water treatment facility — and condemning Mr. Tillis for putting “his political career ahead of the well-being” of local military families. That fund-raising email sparked more than double the average amount in donations, according to a person familiar with the results.“This definitely damaged Senator Tillis’s re-election concern in a way that’s unique, more so than the government shutdown or some of the past votes he took,” said Robert Howard, a spokesman for the North Carolina Democratic Party, citing the potential effect on Camp Lejeune, Fort Bragg and other military bases. “We very much understood what the emergency declaration could mean to our state.”Mr. Tillis said on Monday that he was concerned about the potential threat to the projects, but added, “I feel like the critical needs — we’ll be able to secure funding.”“I’m not worried about that,” Mr. Tillis said when asked about Democrats weaponizing his vote and the threat to North Carolina projects. “They’ll always be looking for ammunition.”Republican strategists and several conservative voters said his flip-flop suited them fine.“I’m glad he changed his mind,” said Ann Sulliview, 68, speaking ahead of a Republican convention in Wayne County, where officials emphasized the need to keep both the Senate and the presidency in Republican control. But, she conceded, “he was going to catch flak for that either way he went.”Patrick Gallagher, a Wayne County chiropractor, agreed. “We put him in office because he’s going to help the Republican Party,” he said. “The fact that he had a change of heart shows that he reflected back on why he’s there. He’s not there to thwart what we’re trying to accomplish.”Potentially losing money for military projects, he acknowledged, “is not the best” for the state. But he said it was something he and other conservative voters could accept for Mr. Trump and his wall.“I think we would give that up to do the greater good,” Dr. Gallagher said. “It’s not the best, but we’re forced to do that.”Republican lawmakers who voted against the national emergency declaration found that sentiment prevalent when they returned to their districts. Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, was disinvited from a Republican dinner after his vote against the emergency declaration, the Kansas City Star reported.And at a town hall-style meeting in Spokane, Wash., on Monday, Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers told about 20 constituents that her vote for the resolution of disapproval — “a difficult vote for me,” she repeated — was a vote against a president trying to secure taxpayer funds without congressional approval, not against a border wall. Some applauded her resolve, but others were unconvinced of her support for Mr. Trump’s border security vision.“I appreciate your vote, but I disagree,” said Kerry Schmidt, 62. “There’s a lot of people fighting against it. Where are the people fighting for it?”"
15,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has decided to roll out the big cannon.In the Rose Garden on Friday, he said he was declaring a national emergency to build a wall on the border with Mexico, using money from other federal accounts, after Congress declined to authorize sufficient funds to satisfy him in legislation that averts another government shutdown.Mr. Trump is wielding extraordinary power to get his way. Democrats strenuously dispute that there is a national security crisis on the border that warrants using the kind of presidential authority that in the past has been used for grave matters like the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.Here are six takeaways from Mr. Trump’s action.Republicans in Congress, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, were fine with the spending deal that they reached with Democrats to keep the government open.But more hard-line elements within the party scalded Mr. Trump with criticism, including the Fox host Laura Ingraham and the conservative commentator Ann Coulter. But as The New York Times reported early Friday, the president felt cornered into accepting the deal and agreed to it only with Mr. McConnell’s promise to support an emergency declaration.Still, the White House assuaged some other skeptics of the funding deal, namely Sean Hannity on Fox and the radio host Rush Limbaugh, both of whom in effect announced the president’s decision in advance and encouraged their followers to fall in line.Mr. Trump is willing to risk the blowback, even from members of his party, and a possible court defeat, if it means he can tell his core supporters that he did all he could to build the wall.Democrats cannot stop the president from issuing the declaration, but they can make it very uncomfortable for Republicans.They can vote to terminate the president’s declaration on the grounds that there is no emergency — there is strong sentiment among Democrats to do that — which would force Republicans in the Senate to make a tough vote over Mr. Trump’s extraordinary exercise of power.Already, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, has been sharply critical of the president using his authority this way, and fellow Republican Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky also have been highly skeptical. Mr. Paul called it “extraconstitutional.”So the president’s action will force Republicans to decide whether to back him — and then set a precedent for a future Democratic president to use power this way — or embarrass Mr. Trump with a vote that could undo his declaration. The president could veto the resolution, and the declaration would likely remain in place because there would not be sufficient votes to override it, but his standing would be undermined.Mr. Trump has to find money from other federal programs to make up a $4 billion shortfall from his initial demand for border wall funding. He can do this by taking money from funding for projects.The declaration enables Mr. Trump to divert $3.6 billion budgeted for military construction projects, and he will also tap into $2.5 billion from counternarcotics programs and $600 million from a Treasury Department asset forfeiture fund. All told, that leaves him with about $8 billion for the wall, including the $1.375 billion authorized by Congress in the spending package that averts a government shutdown.Each of those pots of money comes with a specific constituency that authorized it in the first place, and those constituencies may not be pleased to see it used for another purpose.With this declaration, a court challenge is a near certainty. A party opposing the president will probably seek an injunction — a halt in the action — while the matter is litigated. Yet every day that the wall is not built could undermine Mr. Trump’s fundamental premise that there is an emergency at the border.The challenges are likely to be many, in jurisdictions from coast to coast, increasing the chances that new construction would not start any time soon.Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has been among the few Democrats who seem to be able to stare down the president.In this case, she has offered a not-so-subtle warning about what she sees as an abuse of the emergency authority. She pointed to the mass shootings in the United States, and noted that perhaps the president should issue a national emergency about guns.That could be a mere preview of how she and the Democrats will frame the case against the president, starting with the idea that he has abused his constitutional authority.After his speech on Friday, Ms. Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, vowed to try to overturn the decision.“This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process,” they said in a joint statement.Expect to hear a lot from Ms. Pelosi about a basic tenet of American government, that Congress is a coequal branch of government that is not cowed by presidential whim.The president’s penchant for improvisation may not have served him well. In making his case for a national emergency, Mr. Trump said that he could have waited, but he did not want to, so he declared an emergency.“I could do the wall over a longer period of time,” the president said. “I didn’t need to do this but I’d rather do it much faster.”Then he noted that he had so much money from the legislation that averted a shutdown that money was not really an issue.”We have so much money, we don’t know what to do with it,” Mr. Trump said. “I don’t know what to do with all the money they’re giving us. It’s crazy. “Those two admissions could be the foundation of a legal challenge to his national emergency declaration."
16,"After prompting the longest government shutdown in history, President Trump’s divisive proposal for a border wall has taken a back seat in recent days for negotiators in Congress who are seeking to avoid another crippling closure. The latest talks have focused on another immigration issue that has exploded in recent months: Record numbers of migrants being held in cramped detention centers.Under orders to end the process that the president calls “catch and release,” the authorities have arrested and jailed tens of thousands of migrants since Mr. Trump took office, and Republicans would like it to stay that way.Democrats argue that ordinary immigrants around the country are being unnecessarily plucked from their families and jailed, and newly arrived migrants are being forced to wait unreasonable lengths of time in harsh detention centers.At issue is how much money the budget should provide for detention. Without more money, the authorities will have to scale back on arrests.“We’ll be releasing gang members. We’ll be releasing individuals convicted of domestic violence and drug crimes,” said Matthew Albence, deputy director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “We will not be able to respond to as many calls as we do today. And in fact, in many of these calls, we’re going to tell them, ‘Just release them,’ because we have no choice.”Democrats point out that more than a quarter of current ICE detainees are not subject to mandatory detention under the law.Both Republicans and Democrats are citing competing data to claim that the new budget proposal advances their goals. Here’s what the plan really says:Months of brinkmanship between Congress and the White House over the border wall have distracted from the issue of detention, which has now reached a breaking point, with the authorities being urged by the White House to arrest more immigrants than they can currently afford to detain.With little support for a robust border wall on either side of the aisle within Congress, Republicans and Democrats have moved on to detention, which is also expensive, and has implications for recent border crossers as well as immigrants with firmly established roots in the United States.Mr. Trump’s strict enforcement agenda has pushed the population of detained immigrants to the highest levels in history, with the authorities sweeping into immigrant-heavy locales to arrest vast numbers of the undocumented, as well as immigrants who have violated the terms of their visas (usually through criminal convictions), making them deportable.Under sweeping policy changes introduced by Mr. Trump, ICE has gone after immigrants who were once not targeted, repopularizing workplace raids, arresting community leaders, and using previously frowned upon tactics to ferret out anyone who can be expelled from the country. As a result, the average daily population in immigration detention for the 2019 fiscal year has reached 45,890. ICE currently has funding to house only 40,520 people.Republicans are saying that they secured money for 5,000 additional immigration detention beds, while Democrats are saying that they managed to bring down detention numbers by 17.4 percent. Technically, both are true. Here’s why:Both parties agreed in the proposal to fund an average daily population for 2019 of 45,724 ICE detainees, or about 5,000 more than the 2018 budget provided — allowing Republicans to claim their success.But in order to reach that average by Sept. 30, the last day of the fiscal year, ICE will gradually have to decrease its detained population to 40,520, which represents about a 17 percent decrease from the 49,057 who are currently detained.Republican aides suggested in internal communications that the number of detained immigrants could reach 58,500 under the proposal through a process called reprogramming, which allows agencies to adjust their budgets to address unforeseen emergencies.Under reprogramming, federal agencies can take money that has been appropriated by Congress for specific matters, and use it to fund other things. And though it is meant to be used sparingly, the Department of Homeland Security has often used reprogramming to fund extra detention beds.Though it is a common tactic, Democrats argue that the amount of money that would need to be reprogrammed in order to reach 58,500 detention beds, $750 million, would be unprecedented.And they argue that the congressional committees that are now controlled by Democrats would never approve such a large amount.The Department of Homeland Security has historically deferred to such committees for approval before reprogramming funds, though it is not technically required.The deal provides funds for $1.375 billion in physical barriers along the border, far less than the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump requested for his border wall. The money could be put toward 55 miles of new fencing, using only “currently deployed designs.”The proposal also provides funding to revamp holding facilities that are used by Customs and Border Protection, which came under renewed scrutiny after the deaths of two young migrant children around Christmas.And it would refund Obama-era programs that were eliminated under Mr. Trump, which had provided alternatives to detention for certain immigrants. Those who had been enrolled in the programs were allowed to roam freely, using GPS ankle bracelets and other incentives devised to make sure they showed up for court."
17,"LAS CRUCES, N.M. — In a vast congressional district of fluted mountain ranges, chile crops and oil and gas wells on the country’s southern border, New Mexico Democrats in November broke the Republican hold on a House seat that had endured for 37 years, except for a two-year break.Xochitl Torres Small, a 34-year-old water rights lawyer, won by carefully calibrating her message as a problem-solver, like several other moderate Democrats who flipped House seats nationwide last year. Though the region is 55 percent Hispanic, she did not harp on President Trump’s border wall or his incitement of fears of immigrants bringing crime and drugs.She did not need to.“In New Mexico, we experience the positions of this president a little more intimately than a lot of people,” said Jeff Steinborn, a Democratic state lawmaker from Las Cruces. “The race baiting, divisive border politics has a very human face in our community.”As Mr. Trump agreed on Friday to end the longest government shutdown on record, in the face of  some of his lowest approval ratings ever, he backed down at least temporarily from his campaign promise of a border wall. Doing so could come at a political price with his supporters.But at the same time, there already has been a toll to his party for his insistence on hundreds of miles of new border barriers.Nowhere is that clearer than in the Southwest, where growing diversity and Mr. Trump’s demeaning rhetoric about Latino migrants are pulling parts of the region from the once-firm grip of Republicans.In addition to Ms. Torres Small’s district, Democrats flipped a House seat in the midterms on the southern border in Arizona and four seats in rapidly diversifying Orange County in Southern California.In Arizona, Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat, captured a Republican-held Senate seat, while in Texas the Democratic Senate nominee, Beto O’Rourke, came closer to winning a major statewide race than any other Democrat in 20 years. Ms. Sinema won 69 percent of Latino voters and Mr. O’Rourke 64 percent, according to exit polls.Each of the nine House members whose districts touch the border from California to Texas opposes a wall as the wrong solution for border security.“The irony of the wall is it works best the further you are from the border,” said Senator Martin Heinrich, Democrat of New Mexico, the state with the highest share of Hispanics.While Mr. Heinrich glided to re-election in November, some Democrats from nearly all-white states farther north went down to defeat. “It was a huge issue in North Dakota and Montana in the Senate races,” Mr. Heinrich said.“This constant picture painted by the president of this dangerous borderlands region is so incongruous with daily life,” he added.Republican analysts play down the role of immigration and the border in the recent Democratic advances in the Southwest. Stan Barnes, a former Arizona state lawmaker and current Republican lobbyist in Phoenix, said the positions of Ms. Sinema on the border were nearly identical to those of her Trump-hugging opponent, Martha McSally.“Kyrsten Sinema, you couldn’t tell the difference between her and Martha McSally on matters of the border,” he said. “She did not run as a Democrat, she ran as an independent or an Arizonan, and did not concede one bit of being tough on illegal immigration to Martha McSally.”Demographers have long predicted the growing share of Latinos in Texas and Arizona would turn those Republican-leaning states a shade of purple or blue. Democrats’ expectations of awakening “the sleeping giant” of Latino voters have been repeatedly thwarted.But 2018 may have moved them a step closer to the future. More than one in four Latino voters said they cast a ballot in a midterm election for the first time, versus 12 percent for whites, according to the Pew Research Center. In congressional races across the country, about 69 percent voted for the Democrat.“Immigration is the big deal breaker in not voting Republican,” said Joseph Garcia, director of the Latino Public Policy Center at Arizona State University.Because Latinos are much younger on average than whites, and many are just forming a partisan preference, Mr. Garcia predicted that Mr. Trump’s policies and language about immigrants would sour them on Republicans in federal elections for years to come.“It wasn’t just the wall, it was the rhetoric over three years demonizing Latinos in general,” he said. “That has a longer-lasting effect than just this administration.”“The die has been cast in that Arizona’s future is largely Latino,” he added, “and they’re all U.S. citizens because they were born here.” The median age of Latinos in Arizona is 26, and for non-Hispanic whites, 43.To James Kolbe, a Republican who in the 1990s and 2000s represented the Arizona congressional seat that flipped in the midterms, south and east of Tucson, the president’s rhetoric about illegal immigrants was reminiscent of the white-hot anger he heard at town hall events in the mid-2000s. But that talk is out of date, he said, because the reality on the southern border is far different.With illegal immigration near a 50-year low, more Mexicans are leaving the United States than entering. Meanwhile, there is a spike in families and children from Central America turning themselves in to border agents.Critics of the Trump administration say the actual border crisis is one of its own making because it has failed to allocate resources to process asylum seekers and humanely house children and families.In the race for Mr. Kolbe’s old district, which has swung between the parties, the losing Republican supported Mr. Trump’s wall, while the Democratic victor, Ann Kirkpatrick, opposed new border barriers and called for a path to citizenship for “Dreamers,” the immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children.While the district’s overall population since 2000 has grown by 14.5 percent, its Latino population soared 53 percent, according to a New York Times analysis of census data.Back in New Mexico, Ms. Torres Small won a narrow victory in the Second District thanks to a voter surge in Democratic-leaning Las Cruces, the state’s second-largest city.Turnout in the city and surrounding Doña Ana County was up 4 percent over 2010, while in Lea County — a Republican stronghold — turnout fell more than 7 percent, starkly showing the contrast between Democratic and Republican enthusiasm, which many observers trace to Mr. Trump.On Saturday, chants of “No wall! No wall!” broke out as Ms. Torres Small spoke at the local women’s march about the need to compromise with the president on the shutdown.“We have to make sure that people who live on the border have a voice for what we want our border to look like,” Ms. Torres Small said, according to The Las Cruces Sun News.Meanwhile, at a street market downtown where farmers sold honey and chile wreaths, shoppers said they had no sense of a crisis on the border, which is 40 miles south and buffered by scrubland of juniper and yucca.Last year the Border Patrol replaced 20 miles of low fencing meant to stop vehicles with a column-style barrier, 18 to 30 feet tall, which one shopper called a “Jurassic Park wall.”“I really don’t think about it very much at all,” said Patricia Mihok, who was selling children’s books she had written about wildlife of the Chihuahuan Desert, which straddles the international border. She worried that a border wall would threaten migrating species.Rory Richardson, 70, a retired airline pilot, called a wall a waste of money. He blamed the president for falsely accusing immigrants of crimes unsupported by statistics.“He brings out the very worst in this society,” Mr. Richardson said. “He’s talking to the people who supported him from Day 1, that don’t care about the truth. They’ve made up their minds and don’t confuse me with the facts.”But Henry Diaz, 85, a retired sheriff of Doña Ana County, who was strolling with his wife after a breakfast of huevos rancheros at Rosie’s Cafe, said a border wall was needed.“Everybody has a fence around their house,” he said. “Why do you have that? You need the privacy.”New Mexico, which last voted for a Republican for president in 2004, was once more of a political battleground than it is today. Democrats made sweeping gains in the midterms, winning not just the Second District but also the governor’s race and enlarging their majorities in the Legislature.Last week, Democratic lawmakers in Santa Fe introduced bills to make New Mexico a “sanctuary state,” which would bar state agencies from helping federal immigration authorities who seek to deport undocumented immigrants.“I think it’s important that New Mexico not help Donald Trump enact basically racist immigration policies,” Mr. Steinborn, the Las Cruces lawmaker, said."

Here’s the sign-up.)A coalition of states, including California and New York, challenged President Trump in court on Monday over his plan to use emergency powers to pay for a wall on the border with Mexico.The suit, filed in San Francisco, argues that the president doesn’t have the power to divert funds because it is Congress that controls spending. Read the full lawsuit here.Catch up: The lawsuit is part of a constitutional battle that Mr. Trump set off last week when he declared a national emergency in order to use money that lawmakers declined to give him.Go deeper: Presidents have declared national emergencies nearly five dozen times since 1976.

It would have been pretty amazing to be at its premiere, which was given this week in 1904, right?Undoubtedly — because it was one of the great fiascos in opera history.The premiere, at the storied Teatro alla Scala in Milan, was often drowned out by what one critic described as “groans, roars, moos, laughs, bellows, sneers.” The Times reported that the opera had been “received rather coldly.”Puccini compared the experience to a “lynching.” Some believed rivals had organized claques to embarrass him. Others cited the opera’s subject matter: An unsympathetic American naval lieutenant impregnates and abandons a Japanese teenager, later driving her to suicide.After several revisions — including a new remorseful aria to soften the lieutenant — “Butterfly” became a hit.

19,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. President Trump declared a national emergency to try and build a border wall that Congress refused to give him.“We’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and we’re going to do it one way or the other,” he said in a televised announcement at the White House, above. “It’s an invasion,” he added. “We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country.”Nearly all of Mr. Trump’s claims about the southern border were misleading, exaggerated or false.House Democrats plan to introduce legislation to block the president’s move. If approved by Congress, it would put the president in the position of issuing the first veto of his presidency. Here’s what might happen next.A last-minute tantrum by Mr. Trump nearly derailed a deal to avert another government shutdown and forced the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to accept an emergency declaration. We have a behind-the-scenes look at how it all came to a head._____2. The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether the Trump administration can add a question about citizenship to the next census questionnaire. A decision is expected before census forms are printed in June.Critics say that adding the question would undermine the accuracy of the census because both legal and unauthorized immigrants might refuse to fill out the form. About 6.5 million people might decide not to participate, according to one government estimate.That could reduce Democratic representation when congressional districts are drawn in 2021 and affect the distribution of hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending._____3. Amazon was long accustomed to highly deferential treatment from localities across the country. But according to dozens of interviews this week, it badly misjudged how it would be received in New York.Thursday’s abrupt announcement that the tech company was canceling a deal to build a new campus in Long Island City, Queens, capped several days of intense behind-the-scenes maneuvering among government officials and Amazon executives. We took a look at how the deal collapsed.New York was one of two cities chosen for new Amazon campuses. Northern Virginia is keeping Amazon’s 25,000 jobs, and it wants you to know it._____4. As the possibility grows of Britain leaving the E.U. with no deal, one country is seeing it as a beacon of hope: Many in Ireland believe a no-deal Brexit could lead to the country’s reunification with Northern Ireland.“The sense of a slow momentum toward Irish reunification has become a fast momentum now,” said an English economist based in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, where a defaced “Welcome to Northern Ireland” sign can be seen, above.But lurking in the background of the debate is the possibility that the imposition of a hard border between Britain and Ireland could reignite the violence that largely ended in 1998. And even still, the majority of voters in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic would need to back reunification in a public referendum — and the British government has discretion over when to call a vote.Separately, check out our British-Irish dialect quiz to see what it says about where you’re from.

As a parade of quarterbacks found work, he filed a grievance asserting that the league’s owners had conspired to keep him out because of his protests.The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. The league also settled a similar claim lodged by another player, Eric Reid, above right, who knelt alongside Kaepernick and went unsigned for a period._____7. Terminally ill federal prisoners have long had the option of applying for what is called compassionate release — at least in theory. But in practice, that reprieve has come too late for many.An analysis of federal data by The New York Times and The Marshall Project found that 266 inmates who had applied from 2013 to 2017 had died, either after being denied or while still waiting for a decision. During the same period, the bureau approved only 6 percent of applications.One of the provisions of the new criminal justice law signed by President Trump in December gives inmates the ability to appeal directly to the courts. Steve Cheatham, 59, seen above with his wife, did just that, filing a petition last month so that he could go home to die. He was among the first to be granted release under the new law — but he died before he could make it home._____8.

A constitutional clash between President Trump and Congress appears imminent.He plans to sign the spending package Congress is rapidly approving, to keep the government open past Friday.But then, according to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, he plans to declare a national emergency to sidestep Congress for funds to build his long-promised border wall. Above, the border fence between New Mexico and Mexico.Here’s what the declaration would mean._____2. The former F.B.I. deputy director Andrew McCabe said the Justice Department discussed encouraging cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove President Trump from office.In an interview with “60 Minutes” ahead of the publication of his memoir, Mr. McCabe said that topic was broached in 2017 by officials deeply alarmed by Mr. Trump’s decision to fire the bureau’s director, James Comey. Above, Mr. McCabe testifying on Capitol Hill in 2017.The news came hours before the Justice Department came under new leadership.

Amazon canceled its plans to build a corporate campus in New York City after stiff opposition from some local lawmakers and unions. The finger-pointing has begun.A point of contention was the $3 billion package of incentives and subsidies the city and state agreed to — their largest ever, dedicated to one of the world’s richest companies.Amazon said the deal would have created 25,000 jobs, but the debate it stirred touched on the city’s very identity. Before Amazon’s announcement, we looked at how the resistance was empowered by the rise of Democratic political strength. Above, anti-Amazon protesters before a New York City Council hearing last month.Our business columnist notes that Amazon was forced to confront a challenge to one of its bedrock beliefs: “that being loved by customers is all that matters.”_____4. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., observed a day of mourning for the 17 lives lost a year ago today in the nation’s deadliest school shooting.Some gathered for a moment of silence at 10:17 a.m. in a memorial garden. Others took solace in smaller groups, seen above. There was an early dismissal.On today’s episode of “The Daily,” four students who survived the massacre told us how it changed them. “It’s hard to differentiate what’s from the shooting and what’s from regular teenage anxiety,” one said.And in an Op-Ed essay, a third-year medical student details what it’s like in the emergency room when young gunshot victims arrive._____5. In parts of the Alps, the warming climate is making glaciers disappear. The Swiss have a plan to make use of the valleys left behind.Our climate reporter and multimedia reporter traveled to the Alps to see how glacial melting is affecting hydropower. Swiss researchers are studying the newly exposed valleys, like that from the Trift glacier, above, and say some may be ideal sites to collect the diminishing meltwater — and still make power.We also looked at what would happen if the U.S. adopted seven of the most ambitious climate policies already in place around the world. In short, the country would be much of the way toward the deep decarbonization called for to avert the worst effects of climate change._____6.

21,"Nearly 75 years ago, an American president was eyeing a grand project along our southern border, not to divide the United States and Mexico but to bring the two nations together. On June 12, 1944, a week after D-Day, President Franklin Roosevelt signed legislation establishing Big Bend National Park, almost a million acres along the Rio Grande in West Texas. He followed up with a grand challenge to President Manuel Ávila Camacho of Mexico: “I do not believe that this undertaking in the Big Bend will be complete until the entire park area in this region on both sides of the Rio Grande forms one great international park.” Mr. Camacho agreed.Still, the building of a great international park along our southern border, rather than a grim medieval wall, remains an elusive goal. But if there ever was a moment for it, this is it, and particularly in a place where time and the flowing river have already carved truly great walls along thousand-foot-deep canyons. There was a compelling precedent for President Roosevelt’s idea. In 1932, the United States and Canada joined Glacier National Park and Waterton Lakes National Park to form the world’s first international peace park, an important example globally of cross-border collaboration. Following this lead, in 1936 the United States and Mexico established a commission to begin work on Big Bend International Park. With the ending of the war, President Harry Truman took up his predecessor’s cause, writing President Camacho to reiterate American interest in the binational park. But Mr. Camacho’s tenure ended in 1946, President Truman had bigger challenges, and the idea sputtered for decades.In 1977, I was a member of the first reported expedition to navigate the entire 1,800-mile-plus Rio Grande. The highlight of the journey, sponsored by the National Geographic Society and Dartmouth’s Ledyard Canoe Club, was Big Bend, where an international border neatly drawn on a map dissolves into the muddy waters of the Rio Grande. Etched in my memory are sweeping cactus-filled deserts, soaring pine-dotted peaks and a lone Mexican cowboy riding across the river to round up a stray.Big Bend continued to draw presidential attention, including from President Ronald Reagan and President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado. They signed an agreement in 1983 “for protection, improvement and conservation” of the border area. In 1994 Mexico established the Maderas del Carmen protected area, and in 2000 a Mexican corporation, Cemex, conserved additional borderlands that helped re-establish bighorn sheep and black bears.[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]About a decade later, President Barack Obama and President Felipe Calderón signaled their interest in joint protection of Big Bend, and American and Mexican officials developed a plan for “protection and preservation” of the transboundary region. Nothing came of it in Congress. Nevertheless, after decades of work, more than three million contiguous acres — substantially larger than Yellowstone National Park — are now protected on both sides of the Rio Grande, along with more than 250 miles of river frontage.With the 2016 election, the chant to “build that wall” seemed to drown everything else. But interest in the Roosevelt idea is still alive on both sides of the river, even as President Trump seeks billions more for his wall. So what’s the case for an international park?The pitched battle over Mr. Trump’s wall has focused on border security and immigration policy. These are critical issues, with lives at stake. But in the midst of this heated dispute, what if we could actually strengthen day-to-day relationships among people living on both sides of the border, without seizing any private land, and also enhance security in the process? An international park would send a strong message of cooperation and hope at a moment when the loudest words are about division and despair.A jointly managed park would recognize the region as a single ecosystem and encourage collaboration by focusing the two nations on shared environmental and climate challenges along the border, like droughts, floods and wildfires, and invasive plants and endangered species. Joint efforts at habitat restoration and water conservation would increase river flows, discourage illegal crossings and support agriculture. And the park would increase tourism, helping struggling people on both sides of the river.The park would be managed like its United States-Canadian counterpart, with the United States and Mexico retaining separate authority over their respective lands and park visitors carrying required documents as they cross from one side to the other. At the same time, park managers, with high-level support from both Washington and Mexico City, could collaborate on everything from search and rescue and wildlife protection to scientific research and native plant restoration.Republicans have a strong tradition, extending back to Teddy Roosevelt, of supporting parks and international conservation. Republicans and Democrats recently came together in overwhelming numbers in Congress to approve a sweeping land conservation bill. Protecting natural areas is not an alien concept for Republicans, even these days.On the Democratic side, Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico is a strong supporter of the idea. His father, Stewart, was instrumental in enacting the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act as head of the Interior Department in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. That law protects 196 miles of the Rio Grande in Texas and 68 miles in New Mexico.Across the river, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador sees Mr. Trump’s wall as “an attempt to strong-arm and humiliate Mexico.” But he also understands that “Mexico and the U.S. are bound not only because of the common border, but by a shared culture and history.”A great international park that connects rather than divides our two nations would honor that relationship and stimulate important collaboration at a perilous time. Franklin Roosevelt would be pleased."
22,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has repeatedly warned that terrorists are pouring into the United States from Mexico, in one of his central justifications for building a border wall.But his own government’s assessments conclude that Mr. Trump has seriously overstated the threat. And counterterrorism officials and experts said there had never been a case of a known terrorist sneaking into the country through open areas of the southwest border.Despite the administration’s focus on security threats at the border, a White House strategy document sent to Congress last month outlining steps needed to monitor and intercept terrorists included no reference to the need for construction of barriers, fences or walls. Separately, an intelligence analysis concluded that cyberattacks are the top threat to the United States — not terrorists at the border.“There is no wave of terrorist operatives waiting to cross overland into the United States,” Nicholas J. Rasmussen, the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said on Tuesday. “It simply isn’t true.”In a rare prime-time address to the nation, broadcast at 9 p.m. on Tuesday, Mr. Trump was expected to describe a national security crisis brewing at the Mexican border. It was his opportunity to directly defend his demands for $5.7 billion for a border wall — funding that congressional Democrats have refused to provide, fueling the 18-day government shutdown.Many Latin American countries have border law enforcement gaps — limited law enforcement capabilities and established smuggling routes — that extremists could exploit to harm the United States, according to the State Department’s latest Country Reports on Terrorism.But, the report concluded, that has not happened.“These vulnerabilities offer opportunities to foreign terrorist groups, but there have been no cases of terrorist groups exploiting these gaps to move operations through the region,” the report said.The latest ranking of urgent national security vulnerabilities, compiled annually by American intelligence agencies, puts the terrorist threat from the southwest border low on the list and then mentions it in a discussion of how “worldwide production of cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine is at record levels.”Over the last several days, White House and Department of Homeland Security officials have relentlessly pushed the case that the situation at the border is both a national security crisis and a humanitarian one.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Sunday that “nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally,” and added that the “most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border.”A day later, Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, called those comments “an unfortunate misstatement.”At the same time, in a memo sent to journalists late Monday, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, cited “more than 3,000 ‘special-interest aliens’ — individuals with suspicious travel patterns” who posed a potential national security risk.“The threat is real,” she wrote in a series of tweets on Monday afternoon. “The number of terror-watchlisted encountered at our Southern Border has increased over the last two years. The exact number is sensitive and details about these cases are extremely sensitive.”Former national security officials and analysts have pushed back — especially on the notion that terrorism suspects or their sympathizers use the southwest border as a door to the United States.“That 4,000 number was bull,” said W. Ralph Basham, who served as commissioner of United States Customs and Border Protection from 2006 to 2009, during the Bush administration.“The idea that you have that many terrorists flooding across the border when you have all of these dedicated agents focused on stopping that kind of activity is ridiculous,” Mr. Basham said.A senior American counterterrorism official said on Tuesday night that an annual average of three known or suspected terrorists — all of whom were on watch lists — had tried to enter the United States at a legal border crossing or entry point over the last several years, and had been denied.A 22-page National Strategy to Combat Terrorism Travel, overseen by the staff of the National Security Council and under Mr. Trump’s signature, cited a broad commitment to making it “more difficult for terrorists to cross U.S. borders.”Sent to Congress on Dec. 21, the day before the government shutdown began, the document urged data sharing and improved coordination with foreign partners to identify terrorists before they travel. It did not urge the construction of a border wall.The only explicit reference to “border security” in the document, which was obtained on Tuesday by The New York Times, is a listing of executive orders that Mr. Trump has already signed. It also included strategies to “interdict” potential terrorists with plans to “maintain the equipment and technology” necessary to stop bad actors and share real-time information between law enforcement agencies.The 2018 assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ranked cyberattacks against utilities, communications systems and markets as the top threat to the United States. Published annually by American intelligence agencies, the ranking has not changed much over the past five years.But the government shutdown has furloughed nearly half of the work force of the Department of Homeland Security’s new Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is advertised as the first line of defense against network attacks. Mr. Trump has also dismantled the office of the White House cybersecurity coordinator, the job that was supposed to sew together offense and defense against the daily barrage of cyberattacks.After cyberattacks, the top threats to the United States include the rise of smaller, more deadly nuclear and biological weapons; terrorist attacks by the Islamic State and Al Qaeda; and Russian-style influence campaigns and threats to the United States’ space assets.Counterterrorism officials have long discounted the threat of Islamic State or Qaeda terrorists entering through the southwest border. In some cases, the opposite has happened, said Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of George Washington University’s program on extremism, citing homegrown American extremists who crossed into Mexico to avoid being detected on no-fly lists.Officials included the case of Jason Ludke of Milwaukee, who pleaded guilty in October to conspiring to provide material support to the Islamic State. He and a co-conspirator were headed to the border in Texas, with plans to join the Islamic State in Syria or Iraq, when they were arrested.According to the plea agreement, Mr. Ludke had planned to work under the Islamic State’s direction and control and recorded a video of himself pledging his allegiance to the terrorist group’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Mr. Ludke told an undercover F.B.I. agent that he had training in jujitsu and computers, which he believed would benefit the Islamic State.Even as Mr. Trump has lobbied for the wall, he has also pressed the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security to immediately tighten security on the border.On Dec. 27, homeland security officials asked for assistance that the Pentagon later estimated would require 3,000 additional military personnel to be sent to the border, according to memos exchanged by the two departments over the last two weeks. The force could include a combination of National Guard troops, active-duty military personnel and volunteers, but that was not made clear in the documents, officials said. It remains an issue of hot debate inside the Pentagon.The Homeland Security Department also requested 146 mobile surveillance vehicles to be sent to four border states, along with enough personnel and material to install 150 additional miles of barbed concertina wire. The homeland security memo also again asked Defense Department officials to provide additional aviation support to monitor and control the flow of immigrants.The Pentagon has not yet approved the request. It included guidelines for Ms. Nielsen and other homeland security officials to “take the lead” on strategic communications intended to highlight the Pentagon’s role. It also made clear the troops would carry no weapons."
23,"WASHINGTON — President Trump delivered a message of bipartisan unity on Tuesday night in his first address to Congress in the new era of divided government, but signaled that he would continue to wage war for the hard-line immigration policies that have polarized the capital and the nation.In a nationally televised speech that toggled between conciliation and confrontation, Mr. Trump presented himself as a leader who could work across party lines even as he pressed lawmakers to build a wall along the nation’s southwestern border that leaders of the newly empowered congressional Democrats have adamantly rejected.“We must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution, and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise and the common good,” the president said. “Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future.”Any hopes for a newfound spirit of cooperation, however, seemed elusive as the president and Democrats spent the hours before, during and after the address exchanging partisan political fire, making clear that ritualistic calls for across-the-aisle collaboration were unlikely to transform an environment that has turned increasingly toxic.Republicans jumped to their feet at the president’s calls to curb immigration, limit late-term abortions and ensure that the United States does not turn to socialism, even chanting “U-S-A, U-S-A” a couple of times as if at a Trump campaign rally. “That sounds so good,” he exulted.Speaker Nancy Pelosi, sitting behind Mr. Trump for the first time, and other Democrats largely remained in their seats without applauding and expressed only tepid enthusiasm even for his mention of goals intended to appeal to them, like infrastructure and paid parental leave. Ms. Pelosi maintained a polite, even amused smile on her face for much of the speech.But the evening was filled with political theater as the president introduced World War II veterans, Holocaust survivors, the Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, a 10-year-old cancer survivor, a police officer shot seven times at last fall’s synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh and the teary-eyed relatives of a couple killed by an illegal immigrant, all sitting with the first lady, Melania Trump.The change in the power structure in a Capitol long dominated by men was on display as Ms. Pelosi and scores of House Democratic women wore white, the color of the suffrage movement, reflecting the fact that 131 women were sworn into the new Congress, the most in American history.When Mr. Trump noted this breakthrough, the women leapt to their feet, cheering, dancing and high-fiving each other. “That’s really great,” he said. “Congratulations.”He made no direct mention of the issues that may yet come to dominate the year, such as the Russia investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, or the parallel inquiries that House Democrats intend to conduct into his campaign’s ties with Russia and efforts to impede investigations.Instead, he alluded to them only in passing, but pointedly. “An economic miracle is taking place in the United States,” he said, “and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations.”But Mr. Trump indicated no retreat from his almost singular pursuit of a border wall, directly taking on Ms. Pelosi, who has called it “immoral.” He devoted 15 minutes of the hour-and-22-minute speech to immigration with no concession to Democratic priorities like a path to citizenship for immigrants brought into the country illegally as children.“This is a moral issue,” Mr. Trump said as Ms. Pelosi sat unmoved behind him. “No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration,” he added. “Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.”In the official Democratic response, Stacey Abrams, who lost a close race for governor of Georgia in November, scorned the idea of unity from a president who has practiced the politics of division. “We know bipartisanship could craft a 21st-century immigration plan,” she said, “but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart.”Ms. Abrams, who is African-American, challenged Mr. Trump’s history of racial provocation, saying, “We must hold everyone from the highest offices to our families accountable for racist words and deeds and call racism what it is — wrong.”The president’s speech, built on a theme of “choosing greatness,” came at a pivotal moment halfway through the president’s term as he seeks to regain momentum after the midterm election defeat that handed control of the House to Democrats and after his failed effort to use a partial government shutdown to extract money for the wall.Stung by his retreat on the government shutdown, Mr. Trump has hardly been in the mood for collaboration with the other party. As he and his team drafted his address in recent days, he has groused about the text, complaining that it was too gentle on Democrats, according to people briefed on the matter.The president insisted on sharpening some of the lines in the speech and rebuffed aides, who urged him to congratulate Ms. Pelosi on her ascension to the speakership.During an off-the-record lunch for television anchors on Tuesday before the speech, Mr. Trump offered scathing assessments of a number of leading Democrats, including some lining up to run against him next year.He dismissed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as “dumb,” called Senator Chuck Schumer of New York a “nasty son of a bitch” and mocked Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia, who he said “choked like a dog” at a news conference where Mr. Northam tried to explain a racist yearbook photograph, according to multiple people in the room.Democrats did not wait for the address to pan it. “It seems every year the president wakes up and discovers the desire for unity on the morning of the State of the Union, then the president spends the other 364 days of the year dividing us, and sowing a state of disunion,” Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor. He added, “The blatant hypocrisy of this president calling for unity is that he is one of the chief reasons Americans feel so divided now.”Mr. Trump fired back at Mr. Schumer via Twitter. “I see Schumer is already criticizing my State of the Union speech, even though he hasn’t seen it yet,” the president wrote. “He’s just upset that he didn’t win the Senate, after spending a fortune, like he thought he would. Too bad we weren’t given more credit for the Senate win by the media!”Mr. Trump arrived at this point in his presidency with the approval of just 37 percent of the public, according to Gallup. In the past four decades, the only times a president headed into a State of the Union address with as little or less support were in 1983 when Ronald Reagan was struggling with a painful recession and in 2007 and 2008 when George W. Bush was trying to turn around the Iraq war.Mr. Trump is the only president in the history of Gallup polling to have never drawn the support of a majority of the public at any point in his first two years in office. But while he is the fourth president in a row to lose at least one house of Congress during a midterm election, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both bounced back to win re-election, and Mr. Trump has privately expressed confidence that he will, too.After presidents suffer setbacks in midterms, they often reach out to the victorious opposition with words of conciliation, however artificial or short-lived they may be. In Mr. Trump’s case, he opened this period of partisan power sharing with a relentless confrontation over his proposed border wall, resulting in a record-breaking 35-day partial government shutdown.That impasse nearly cost Mr. Trump his opportunity to deliver his State of the Union address, as Ms. Pelosi refused to let him come to the House chamber as long as federal agencies were closed and workers unpaid. Mr. Trump backed down and accepted a measure reopening the government for three weeks, but negotiations in the interim have made no more progress toward winning money for his wall — and the government could close again on Feb. 15.Given that, Mr. Trump’s calls for unity were almost surely destined to fall on deaf ears. Even Republicans have publicly rebuked him lately for his plans to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan, and party leaders have pressed him not to declare a national emergency bypassing Congress to build the wall.Among those invited by the president to join the first lady during the speech was Joshua Trump, a sixth-grade student from Wilmington, Del., who “has been bullied in school due to his last name,” according to the White House.Democrats were making points with their guests, as well. Among those they invited were air traffic controllers who went unpaid during the government shutdown, illegal immigrants who worked at Mr. Trump’s properties and transgender soldiers who will be banned under the president’s new policy.In addition to Ms. Abrams, other Democrats sought to get in on the action. Senator Kamala Harris of California, who is running for president, delivered her own response shortly before the speech, while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who may also run, delivered his afterward.In his address, Mr. Trump assailed Democrats like Mr. Northam for comments in support of easing restrictions on late-term abortions and called for federal legislation cracking down on such procedures, a nod to Mr. Trump’s conservative base. He made no mention of the racist medical school yearbook picture that has threatened Mr. Northam’s political career, after aides cautioned him about raising that issue.Mr. Trump also sought to frame the opposition Democrats as too extreme, suggesting that the country was in danger of a socialist takeover. “Here in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” he said, as Republican lawmakers booed. “We are born free and we will stay free. Tonight we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.”The president highlighted what he sees as the accomplishments of his first two years in office, including a growing economy, rising energy production, increased military spending, deregulation and tax cuts. He pressed Congress to approve his new trade pact with Canada and Mexico updating the North American Free Trade Agreement.Mr. Trump did not outline the traditional laundry list of new initiatives, the way other presidents have, but he did plan to make a national commitment to end transmission of the virus that causes AIDS, with a goal of stopping its spread in the United States by 2030. He repeated past calls for bipartisan measures to rebuild “America’s crumbling infrastructure,” curb the cost of prescription drugs and approve paid parental leave.The president also talked about his goal of bringing an end to the “endless wars” in places like Syria and Afghanistan, the threat he sees from Iran and his bid to force President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela to step down. He announced that he would meet for the second time with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, in Vietnam on Feb. 27-28 to seek his nuclear disarmament.Mr. Trump ended his address with an uncharacteristic effort at poetry, an ode to America and its common purpose. “I am asking you to choose greatness,” he said. “No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.”"
24,"Updated February 14, 2019: Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, announced that President Trump planned to declare a national emergency so he can bypass Congress and build his long-promised wall along the southwestern border. Read the latest here.WASHINGTON — As the budget standoff between President Trump and congressional Democrats grinds into the third week of a partial government shutdown, the White House has floated the idea that Mr. Trump might invoke emergency powers to build his proposed wall on the Mexican border without lawmakers’ approval.That route could resolve the immediate crisis by giving Mr. Trump a face-saving way to sign spending bills that do not include funding for his wall. But it would be an extraordinarily aggressive move — at a minimum, a violation of constitutional norms — that would most likely thrust the wall’s fate into the courts. Here is a primer on whether Mr. Trump can use emergency powers to proceed with the project without explicit congressional permission.The president has the authority to declare a national emergency, which activates enhancements to his executive powers by essentially creating exceptions to rules that normally constrain him. The idea is to enable the government to respond quickly to a crisis.Although presidents have sometimes claimed that the Constitution gives them inherent powers to act beyond ordinary legal limits in an exigency, those claims tend to fare poorly when challenged in court.But presidents are on firmer legal ground when they invoke statutes in which Congress delegated authorities to the executive branch that can be generated in emergencies. In a recent study, the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law identified 123 provisions of law granting presidents a range of such powers.The National Emergencies Act, enacted during the post-Watergate reform era, regulates how presidents may invoke such powers. It requires them to formally declare a national emergency and tell Congress which statutes are being activated.[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]Maybe. The Trump administration could point to two laws and say they allow officials to proceed with building a border wall without first obtaining explicit authorization and appropriations from Congress, according to Elizabeth Goitein, who oversaw the Brennan Center’s study and is a co-director of its Liberty and National Security Program.One of the laws permits the secretary of the Army to halt Army civil works projects during a presidentially declared emergency and instead direct troops and other resources to help construct “authorized civil works, military construction and civil defense projects that are essential to the national defense.”Another law permits the secretary of defense, in an emergency, to begin military construction projects “not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces,” using funds that Congress had appropriated for military construction purposes that have not yet been earmarked for specific projects.In light of those statutes and similar ones that give presidents flexibility to redirect funds in a crisis, the Trump administration could point to serious arguments to back up Mr. Trump if he invokes emergency powers to build a wall, said William C. Banks, a Syracuse University law professor who helped write a 1994 book about tensions between the executive and legislative branches over security and spending, “National Security Law and the Power of the Purse.”“The fundamental principle is that no president or official may spend funds that were not appropriated for that purpose,” he said. “But I think that it’s possible that the president could declare a national emergency and then rely on authority Congress has historically granted for exigencies to free up some funds to support constructing a barrier along the border.”No. If he invokes emergency powers to build a border wall, Mr. Trump is almost certain to invite a court battle. While Ms. Goitein agreed that “there is a nonfrivolous legal case to be made” that emergency-powers laws might empower Mr. Trump to spend military funds on a wall, she also pointed to counterarguments any lawsuit would have to contend with.For example, she noted, under one of the laws Mr. Trump might try to invoke, the military may redirect funds to build only projects that Congress has separately authorized. Lawmakers have not approved a military wall spanning the border.Still, the administration might argue that Congress has effectively preapproved a wall-like barrier under other laws, including one that authorizes the military to construct border “fences” blocking drug-smuggling corridors, and another, the Secure Fence Act of 2006, that empowers the Department of Homeland Security to build “physical infrastructure enhancements” along the border.The government could skip the requirement to identify pre-existing authorization for a wall if it invoked a different emergency-powers law for the funds, but that route would raise other problems, Ms. Goitein said. Among them, the government would need to show that a wall meets the legal definition of military construction even though it is not clearly tied to a military facility or installation and that the southern border situation represents the kind of emergency that requires the use of the armed forces.Probably not.If Mr. Trump declares that the situation along the southern border suddenly constitutes an emergency that justifies building a wall without explicit congressional sanction, he will run up against a reality: that the facts on the ground have not drastically shifted. The number of people crossing the border unlawfully is far down from its peak of nearly two decades ago. The recent caravans from Central America primarily consist of migrants who are not trying to sneak across the border but instead are presenting themselves to border officials and requesting asylum.And while Mr. Trump and his aides keep claiming that terrorists are sneaking in across the border, including assertions that they are doing so by the thousands, as a matter of empirical reality, there has been no such instance in the modern era.Still, as a matter of legal procedure, facts may be irrelevant. Before a court could decide that Mr. Trump had cynically declared an emergency under false pretenses, the court would first have to decide that the law permits judges to substitute their own thinking for the president’s in such a matter. The Justice Department would surely argue that courts should instead defer to the president’s determination.“If any court would actually let itself review whether this is a national emergency, he would be in big trouble,” Ms. Goitein said. “I think it would be an abuse of power to declare an emergency where none exists. The problem is that Congress has enabled that abuse of power by putting virtually no limits on the president’s ability to declare an emergency.”In part by accident. When passing many emergency-powers laws, Congress attached a procedure that would let lawmakers override any particular invocation of that authority. The National Emergencies Act, for example, permitted Congress to rescind an emergency if both the House and the Senate voted for a resolution rejecting the president’s determination that one existed.But in 1983, the Supreme Court struck down such legislative vetoes. The justices ruled that for a congressional act to have legal effect, it must be presented to the president for signature or veto. Because it takes two-thirds of both chambers to override a veto, the ruling significantly eroded the check and balance against abuse that lawmakers had intended to be part of their delegation of standby emergency powers to presidents."
25,"WASHINGTON — For the last month, President Trump’s public schedule has mostly been a sparse document. The one issued for Tuesday, for instance, listed only his daily intelligence briefing and lunch with the vice president. No new policy announcements. No new cabinet appointments.As the partial government shutdown enters its 33rd day, Democrats accuse Mr. Trump of hostage-taking tactics, but among the hostages has been his own presidency. Other than his single-minded pursuit of a border wall, Mr. Trump has all but put on hold advancing the rest of his agenda. It has become, as one administration official put it, a one-issue White House.“There are important things that aren’t being addressed,” said William A. Galston, who served as a domestic policy aide to President Bill Clinton. But the wall has become the singular issue for Mr. Trump because he has become convinced that his presidency is on the line. “It’s easy to come up with a list of things on the domestic front that he should be worrying about,” Mr. Galston said, “but it’s just as easy to understand why he’s not.”Senate leaders briefly raised hopes of a possible cease-fire in the shutdown on Tuesday by agreeing to hold votes on a pair of measures this week, but it appeared unlikely that either would draw the 60 votes necessary. Mr. Trump is eager to deliver his State of the Union address in the House chamber next week as originally scheduled, the most prominent platform a president has to set the terms for the coming year. But Speaker Nancy Pelosi has suggested it might be postponed or canceled if government agencies remain closed.White House officials said they were operating on the assumption that the president would still give the speech at the Capitol next Tuesday unless expressly disinvited, but if that were to happen, they had alternative options, like a televised speech delivered in the East Room of the White House. The address is being written to unveil a variety of policies, not just discuss the border dispute, which is one reason it is so important to Mr. Trump.The standoff has already forced Mr. Trump to cancel a trip to Europe to meet with global business leaders in Davos, Switzerland, at a time when the world economy faces a possible slowdown. The president has made no evident progress in filling a series of senior vacancies nor has he produced the tax-cutting plan he promised last year. He has done nothing in weeks to publicly promote priorities like fighting opioid abuse or bolstering the economy.“There is this frustration that the shutdown is interfering with the ability of Republicans — I assume Democrats feel the same way — to advance the agenda,” said Lanhee J. Chen, who was chief policy adviser to Mitt Romney’s Republican presidential campaign in 2012 and is now at Stanford University.And yet, given the new era of divided government, he added, “I’m not sure how quickly any agenda would be moving even if the government were open. That’s a sad testament about where we are as a country.”Many of Mr. Trump’s agency leaders and senior advisers, of course, are still at work. His trade negotiators are focused on brokering an agreement to ease the tariff war with China, and Mr. Trump himself met with a visiting official from North Korea to pave the way for a second summit meeting with its leader, Kim Jong-un, as early as next month.But at a time when a president is typically finishing a collection of policies in connection with the State of the Union and previewing them to build public support, some of Mr. Trump’s aides acknowledge that the president and his senior team have been almost entirely focused on the border dispute.Indeed, administration officials said the situation had the unintended benefit of making it easier for Mick Mulvaney, the newly installed acting White House chief of staff, to settle into his job because he did not have as many issues to juggle.The president, who made no public appearances on Tuesday, has kept his primary attention on the fight for the border wall for weeks, making only two unrelated out-of-town trips since the shutdown began, an unannounced stop in Iraq to visit troops at Christmas time and a quick flight to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware last weekend to pay respects to the returning remains of four Americans killed in Syria. Even a day trip to New Orleans to address farmers turned into another public pitch for the wall.Still in his inbox are a slew of important vacancies to fill, including defense secretary, interior secretary and chief of staff. His attorney general, United Nations ambassador and Environmental Protection Agency chief are all serving in an acting capacity while waiting for Senate confirmation votes of his nominees. The White House on Tuesday sent 51 judicial nominations to the Senate, returning names that had gone unacted on last year.Mr. Trump expressed no urgency when asked by reporters recently about all the acting officials in the upper echelon of his administration. “I like acting,” he said. “It gives me more flexibility.”Left uncertain is how Mr. Trump may pursue other goals. He vowed before the midterm election to pass a middle-class tax cut in the new Congress but has said little about it since then. He also vowed to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement to pressure Congress to pass his newly negotiated replacement but has yet to do so.He has similarly talked about collaborating with Ms. Pelosi’s Democrats, who just took over the House, on possible bipartisan initiatives like rebuilding the nation’s roads, bridges and other infrastructure or bringing down the cost of prescription drugs. Neither of those ideas has come up lately and it is hard to see the current impasse establishing the sort of trust that might lead to across-the-aisle cooperation.Moreover, any bitterness or ill will that lingers once the current shutdown is resolved, assuming it is, may complicate future financial negotiations when the debt ceiling needs to be raised to keep the country from defaulting on its obligations and when the current fiscal year is over at the end of September.That may depend on how the border fight turns out. Some optimists see the potential for an eventual deal between Mr. Trump and Democrats that includes money for his wall in exchange for permanent revisions to immigration laws protecting many of those who have lived in the country illegally for many years.“Hopefully, in the end, we can turn an awful situation into a legislative accomplishment for both sides,” said Representative Josh Gottheimer, Democrat of New Jersey and a leader of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, who met recently with the president.Others are not so sure. Mr. Trump has been willing to subordinate the rest of his agenda to the border wall, analysts said, because it is so central to his political identity and his campaign for re-election next year.“The president believes that the wall represents his contract with America, certainly his contract with his supporters,” said Mr. Galston, who is now at the Brookings Institution. “He regards it, and I think probably accurately, as the issue that did more than any other to propel him to the White House.“That being the case,” he added, “this government shutdown is not over a peripheral issue that overshadows other issues. It is the most important issue, at least from the perspective of the president.”"
26,"WASHINGTON — As he makes his case for building a border wall, President Trump says that his predecessors have secretly confided in him that they should have done it themselves. The only problem: All of the living presidents say that’s not true.Former President Jimmy Carter said on Monday that he never had such a conversation with Mr. Trump, making him the last of the veterans of the Oval Office to dispute the assertion. “I have not discussed the border wall with President Trump and do not support him on the issue,” Mr. Carter said in a statement.Aides to the other living presidents — Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama — have all likewise denied Mr. Trump’s claim. Former President George Bush, who died in November, was in failing health throughout Mr. Trump’s administration and did not have any discussion with the current president about substantive issues, according to people close to him.This would not be the first time Mr. Trump has bragged about conversations that never happened. In 2017, he publicly claimed that the head of the Boy Scouts called him to praise a speech as the best ever given to the organization. He also asserted that the president of Mexico had called him to say that Mr. Trump’s enforcement efforts at the border were deterring Central Americans from crossing into Mexico because they knew they could no longer get into the United States.After both the Boy Scouts leader and President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico denied making such calls, the White House acknowledged that they never happened. But the president’s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, insisted that Boy Scouts leaders and Mr. Peña Nieto had said things like that in person, just not on the telephone.The White House did not respond to requests on Friday or Monday to explain the president’s latest statement. A senior administration official, who insisted on anonymity to address the matter, said Mr. Trump might have been referring to public comments made by previous presidents on behalf of border security, though not the wall specifically or directly to Mr. Trump.In an interview with “Today” on NBC aired Tuesday morning, Vice President Mike Pence defended the president’s comments while suggesting that they were not based on actual conversations with his predecessors.“I know the president has said that that was his impression from previous administrations, previous presidents,” Mr. Pence said. “I know I’ve seen clips of previous presidents talking about the importance of border security, the importance of addressing the issue of illegal immigration.”The issue came up on Friday when Mr. Trump held an expansive news conference in the Rose Garden about his standoff with Congress over funding for a wall. “This should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me,” he said. “And they all know it. Some of them have told me that we should have done it.”While in office, the younger Mr. Bush signed legislation authorizing 700 miles of fencing. But he has said that stronger border enforcement should be paired with an overhaul of rules making it possible for some of the millions of immigrants in the country illegally to stay. A spokesman said Mr. Bush had not discussed the issue with Mr. Trump. Mr. Clinton, Mr. Obama and Mr. Carter are on record opposing Mr. Trump’s wall.Mr. Trump has not interacted with any of his predecessors in any meaningful way since his inauguration. None of the five former presidents alive when Mr. Trump was elected in 2016 voted for him, even the Republicans. The elder Mr. Bush voted for Hillary Clinton, and the younger Mr. Bush told the author Mark K. Updegrove that he voted for “none of the above.”Mr. Trump has not met with any of his predecessors in two years in office. He called the younger Mr. Bush to offer condolences when his father died, and the first time he saw any of the former presidents since taking office was at the funeral a few days later. He shook Mr. Obama’s hand and Mr. Bush came over to shake his, but none of the former presidents had any extended words with the incumbent."
27,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. The House passed a resolution to block President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency on the Mexican border, with a handful of Republicans joining Democrats.The resolution will be taken up by mid-March in the Senate. Three Republican senators have already declared their support, just one short of the number needed to send the legislation to the president’s desk. Above, wall construction at the border in El Paso last week.While it is unlikely that there would be enough votes to overturn a promised presidential veto, the resolution does assert Congress’s constitutional authority over spending, and its passage could bolster numerous lawsuits that maintain that Mr. Trump’s declaration is an illegitimate end run around Congress’s power of the purse._____2. President Trump may be willing to ease U.S. demands on North Korea, at least for now.Mr. Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, exchanged fiery threats in 2017, but in the second round of talks, the president wants a deal — and appears to be willing to shift his administration’s goals to reach one, from immediate dismantlement of the North’s arsenal to limits on its size and reach. Above, Mr. Trump arriving in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Tuesday.The two leaders will have dinner together on Wednesday night (which is early Wednesday Eastern Time), and then a formal one-on-one meeting. Here’s what’s at stake.In an Op-Ed essay, Susan Rice, the national security adviser under President Barack Obama, sees hope for progress if Mr. Trump empowers the administration’s new envoy for North Korea, Stephen Biegun._____3. Capitol Hill was busy. Michael Cohen, pictured above, testified for the first of several days. President Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer was behind closed doors today, and he’ll have a public session before a House committee Wednesday beginning at 10 a.m. Eastern (we’ll have it live) and another private session on Thursday.A Florida congressman, Matt Gaetz, apparently unnerved by reports that Mr. Cohen would describe the president’s possible criminal conduct and go into “granular detail” about the plan to pay hush money to Stormy Daniels, tweeted a threat at him:“Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she’ll remain faithful when you’re in prison. She’s about to learn a lot…”Separately, big pharma faced a day of reckoning. Seven pharmaceutical executives defended high drug prices at a Senate hearing, insisting they were not profiteering. Their solution: Keep list prices high, but add caps on out-of-pocket costs paid by patients and let insurers pick up the difference._____4. Mark Harris, the North Carolina Republican whose congressional campaign paid for an absentee ballot effort rife with misconduct, said he would not run in a new election.Mr. Harris, pictured above at a hearing last week, attributed his decision to his health and said the Ninth District deserved “to have someone at full strength during the new campaign.”The state board has not yet set a timetable for the new election, and Democrats are expected to mount an aggressive campaign behind Dan McCready, their candidate in last fall’s race._____5. Chicago voters headed to the polls today to choose a new mayor in one of the most wide-open elections the city has seen. The blur of 14 candidates has no clear favorite.Our National desk sees a high likelihood of a runoff. Here’s the latest. Polls close at 7 p.m. local time (8 p.m. Eastern).Many African-Americans cast their votes another way: by leaving. They have moved away by the thousands every year, sick of entrenched gang violence, miserable job prospects and shuttered schools, even as new white residents flow in._____6. As General Motors and Ford move toward drastic cuts, Fiat Chrysler is heading in the other direction.Despite forecasts for slowing U.S. auto sales, the Italian-American automaker plans to create 6,500 jobs by spending $4.5 billion on several Detroit plants, like the one above. The plants will produce three large Jeep models, reflecting consumers’ growing preference for bigger vehicles.But the company is trimming operations at an Illinois plant, cutting almost 1,400 jobs._____7. What does Hollywood keep getting wrong about race?On today’s episode of “The Daily,” Wesley Morris, our critic at large, talks about Hollywood’s obsession with fantasies of racial reconciliation and why it’s not surprising that there are echoes of “Driving Miss Daisy,” a best picture winner 30 years ago, in this year’s winner, “Green Book,” above.Mr. Morris explored the topic of interracial friendships in film in this essay last month._____8. Shot-putters might be the only athletes in the world who refer to themselves seriously as “human cannons.”Take Ryan Crouser and Joe Kovacs, for example, the reigning Olympic gold and silver medalists in the shot-put. They can heave a 16-pound ball farther than just about anyone, and their competition and friendship have become track and field’s version of a buddy flick. Mr. Crouser, above left, and Mr. Kovacs, above center, competed in New York this month.We talked to them about what it’s like to travel the world together, and bond over things like strength training and eating absurd amounts of food._____9. Are some celebrity mediums fooling their audience members by researching them on social media? A group of online vigilantes is out to prove it.The Times Magazine goes inside the secret sting operations to expose celebrity psychics. One group hopes to catch them at their own game by using fake Facebook profiles as bait: The social media platform has become a clearinghouse for the kind of personal detail that psychics used to have to sweat for.If anything, “the psychics have just gotten lazier,” a member of the group told our writer._____10. Finally, an ode to a different kind of culture.Homemade yogurt is central to South Asian cuisines, a cooling respite to spicy dishes or a sweet tang for desserts. But it is the starter culture that gives each yogurt its unique, familiar flavor, and generations of families around the world have their own.Our writer explores the importance of passing down yogurt’s most important ingredient and the lengths families will go to keep that narrative (and culture) going. Above, a mother and daughter in Glasgow making their family’s recipe.“There was never store-bought yogurt in our house, because none compared to my father’s velvety, tart homemade tufts,” our writer says. “They looked like icebergs in your bowl, and made your cheeks pucker pleasantly.

28,"WASHINGTON — A coalition of 16 states, including California and New York, on Monday challenged President Trump in court over his plan to use emergency powers to spend billions of dollars on his border wall.The lawsuit is part of a constitutional confrontation that Mr. Trump set off on Friday when he declared that he would spend billions of dollars more on border barriers than Congress had granted him. The clash raises questions over congressional control of spending, the scope of emergency powers granted to the president, and how far the courts are willing to go to settle such a dispute.The suit, filed in Federal District Court in San Francisco, argues that the president does not have the power to divert funds for constructing a wall along the Mexican border because it is Congress that controls spending.[Read the full lawsuit here.]Xavier Becerra, the attorney general of California, said in an interview that the president himself had undercut his argument that there was an emergency on the border.“Probably the best evidence is the president’s own words,” he said, referring to Mr. Trump’s speech on Feb. 15 announcing his plan: “I didn’t need to do this, but I’d rather do it much faster.”The lawsuit, California et al. v. Trump et al., says that the plaintiff states are going to court to protect their residents, natural resources and economic interests. “Contrary to the will of Congress, the president has used the pretext of a manufactured ‘crisis’ of unlawful immigration to declare a national emergency and redirect federal dollars appropriated for drug interdiction, military construction and law enforcement initiatives toward building a wall on the United States-Mexico border,” the lawsuit says.Congress is on its own separate track to challenge the president’s declaration. The House of Representatives, now controlled by Democrats, may take a two-prong approach when it returns from a recess. One would be to bring a lawsuit of its own.Lawmakers could also vote to override the declaration that an emergency exists, but it is doubtful that Congress has the votes to override Mr. Trump’s certain veto, leaving the courts a more likely venue.Joining California and New York are Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon and Virginia. All have Democratic governors but one — Maryland, whose attorney general is a Democrat — and most have legislatures controlled by Democrats.[Read the first edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]The dispute stems from steps Mr. Trump said he would take after lawmakers granted him only $1.375 billion for new border barriers, legislation he signed last week to avoid another government shutdown.Mr. Trump asserted the power to tap three additional pots of money on his own: $600 million from a Treasury Department asset forfeiture fund for law enforcement priorities; about $2.5 billion from a military antidrug account, most of which would first be siphoned from other military programs the Pentagon has yet to identify; and $3.6 billion in military construction funds he said he could redirect by invoking an emergency-powers statute.Presidents have invoked emergency-powers statutes nearly five dozen times since Congress enacted the National Emergencies Act of 1976, but never before has one been used to make an end-run around Congress after it rejected funding for a particular policy.But as the debate over Mr. Trump’s action shifts to courtrooms, legal experts warned that its fate may turn less on such high constitutional principle and more on complex legal issues — from whether plaintiffs can establish that the case is properly before the courts, to how to interpret several statutes.“Even though Trump’s political maneuver to get around an uncooperative Congress looks like it stretches the Constitution, the questions presented in court will raise ordinary and complicated issues of administrative law,” said Peter M. Shane, an Ohio State University law professor and co-author of a separation-of-powers casebook.Two cases had already been filed after Mr. Trump’s announcement on Feb. 15 — one by the nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen, representing several Texas landowners and a Texas environmental group, and the other a case jointly brought by the Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife and the Animal Legal Defense Fund.At least two other lawsuits are expected to be filed later this week. The American Civil Liberties Union has announced its intention to file a case, but has not yet publicly identified its client. The other case will be brought by Protect Democracy, another watchdog group, and the Niskanen Center, a center-right policy institute, on behalf of El Paso County and the Border Network for Human Rights.Many critics have challenged whether an emergency truly exists on the Southern border that a wall would solve, pointing to government data showing that the number of people crossing illegally has dropped significantly over the past generation and that most drugs are smuggled through ports of entry.The president has argued, without proof, that the emergency declaration is warranted because the migrants “invading” the United States across the Mexico border have caused epidemics of crime and drug use.Legal specialists expected the Justice Department to urge a court not to consider facts about the border or Mr. Trump’s words, but rather to defer to the president’s decision. The courts have a long history of being reluctant to substitute their own judgment for the president’s about a security threat.The Trump administration will have a powerful argument to invoke: In the National Emergencies Act, Congress defined no standard for what conditions have to be met before a president may determine that a qualifying crisis exists.But before a judge could weigh whether Mr. Trump invoked the statute legitimately, he or she would have to decide whether the dispute is properly before the court in the first place.Plaintiffs will need to establish standing by showing that they are suffering some particular injury from what Mr. Trump is doing. Several of the lawsuits involve people who own land or represent communities along the Mexican border in Texas, where Mr. Trump has put the focus of his emphasis on the need for more barriers.But it is not clear whether any of the fencing will be built in California or New Mexico, two of the states in the lawsuit, and it certainly will not be built in other states involved in the litigation, like New York, New Jersey or Hawaii.Mr. Becerra, California’s attorney general, suggested that plaintiffs in the states’ lawsuits have standing for reasons that are unrelated to whether any portions of Mr. Trump’s wall will be built in their territory, arguing that “the president’s unconstitutional action could cause harms in many parts of the country.”People in California and other plaintiff states could “lose funding that they paid for with their tax dollars, money that was destined for drug interdiction or for the Department of Defense for military men and women and military installations,” he said in the interview.Further complicating matters, the administration has said it intends to spend the funds in sequence, starting with the $1.375 billion Congress appropriated, and reaching the emergency-power military-construction fund last. The Justice Department is likely to argue that if no disputed spending is imminent, the case is not ripe for litigation and should be dismissed.Ian Bassin, the executive director of Protect Democracy, said that El Paso County would probably argue that its economy was being harmed by Mr. Trump’s emergency declaration because it wrongfully signaled to businesses and potential tourists that they should stay away.The Justice Department declined to comment on the wave of lawsuits. Mr. Trump has said he expected to be sued and to lose in lower courts, but he predicted he would eventually prevail before the Supreme Court.But plaintiffs can also challenge whether the administration is interpreting several statutes correctly.The provision that gives the secretary of defense authority to transfer some Pentagon money into the antidrug account Mr. Trump is then planning to tap, for example, says its authority may be used “in no case where the item for which funds are requested has been denied by the Congress” — raising the question of whether extra funding for border barriers counts as such a forbidden item.And the emergency-powers statute Mr. Trump plans to use permits military construction spending in an emergency that requires the use of the armed forces for projects “to support such use.” That has been used before to build up foreign military bases in a war effort, but litigants challenge whether a permanent wall to help civilian agencies police the border qualifies under that wording.“Judges will certainly be aware of the larger institutional context when they address those technical issues, but that awareness will not, by itself, determine how the legal questions get resolved,” Mr. Shane said."
29,"WASHINGTON — Hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to work on Monday with a presidential promise of a paycheck “very quickly” but no guarantee that they will be working in three weeks, when a temporary stopgap of funding expires.President Trump and congressional Democrats arrived at a short-term agreement late on Friday, reopening the government after 35 days and the longest government shutdown in history. Lawmakers have until Feb. 15 to reach a compromise on the Republican request for billions of dollars to be allocated for a border wall — a wall Democrats have refused to fund.Referring to the odds that a deal could be struck over that time, Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal on Sunday, “I personally think it’s less than 50-50.” Mr. Trump said he would use emergency powers to fund the wall if an agreement could not be reached.In a stark reminder that federal employees were returning to work with the knowledge that they might be forced to go without a paycheck once again next month, one federal agency, the Department of Agriculture, updated its employee information website and said, “We will also leave some of the shutdown-related material up for a period time, should you need to refer back to it.”Richard Nagle, a lawyer with the Environmental Protection Agency in Chicago, said returning to work after a mandatory furlough required some digging out.“It’s triage,” he said, eyeing his email inbox. “I’m going to go through the ones that are screaming for attention. I haven’t been on voice mail yet, but I’m sure that’s capped out at 32 messages.”In the first hour of his day, one question seemed to be echoing through the halls: What did you do?Colleagues were sharing stories of how they passed the time while they were furloughed. Pretty much everyone confessed to sleeping a little later than usual. Basements were cleaned out, digital photos were organized, hardwood floors were scrubbed until they were gleaming.Some employees took road trips, visiting extended family in Michigan or driving down to Memphis, eight hours away. Anything to stave off the boredom and anxiety of being home, unpaid, during a Chicago winter.As employees streamed into the office, managers stood in the lobby, handing out informational papers on things to know: how to apply for back pay, what to do if you forgot your passwords. Some supervisors brought in sweet treats. There were nudges about projects that had been put on hold — and, in some cases, forgotten — and hurried meetings to figure out what could be accomplished before the next potential shutdown.At a Federal Emergency Management Agency office in Fort Worth, some employees felt like they were racing against the clock.“They’re trying to get as much work as they can get done before flood season, tornado season and hurricane season,” said Steve Reaves, a safety officer for FEMA who also leads the union for FEMA employees. “With us, it’s do as much we can before they try to do this again.”Senior officials on Monday both welcomed their workforces and tried to reassure them about the weeks to come.“I encourage you all to take time to talk to each other about the past few weeks and be transparent with your supervisors about any hardships,” Brock Long, the FEMA administrator, wrote in an email on Monday morning. “I also want to be clear that there is no higher priority than to guarantee, for those who missed paychecks, that you get paid as quickly as possible.”But Mr. Long acknowledged that reopening the government was not as simple as turning a light switch.“While there is important work to be done, I want to make sure that you are set up for success before jumping into your normal assignments,” he wrote. “Please allow time for updates and reboots to computers, addressing expired passwords, syncing mobile devices, managing benefits and organizing your work space. Supervisors have been provided checklists that should be helpful. Again, please also take the time to listen and support each other.”Ryan Baugh, a Department of Homeland Security statistician and a steward for the American Federation of Government Employees, said the possibility that there could be another shutdown had a damaging effect, raising questions about what could realistically be scheduled — meetings, trainings, projects — given the uncertainty.“We’ll work hard for three weeks, and then we’ll see what happens,” he said. “You could still use the word ‘hostage.’ We’re still the bargaining chip here.”The morning commute on Monday in the Washington area was once again bustling after an eerily quiet month of little road traffic during peak travel hours and open seats on trains and buses.At a Metro station near the Environmental Protection Agency’s headquarters in Washington, a small group of environmental activists with the nonprofit group Mom’s Clean Air Force welcomed E.P.A. employees back to work with cinnamon rolls.“Welcome back! Cinnamon roll?” Elizabeth Brandt, a field organizer for the group, chirped as employees rode up the Metro escalator. Ms. Brandt, holding her daughters, Valencia, 5, and Natalia, 3, said that having grown up next to a toxic cleanup site in Tacoma, Wash., it was important to her to make sure the agency’s workers knew their work was valued.“I don’t often get a chance to thank people who do that work the way I thank our pediatrician and the people who give my kids shots,” she said.E.P.A. employees for their part said they were relieved to be back to work yet anxious that the reprieve from the partial government shutdown could be short-lived.“Most of us cannot afford to be without pay for a month,” said Denise Walker, an agency lawyer. “It’s very stressful for people.”The National Park Service reopened on Sunday, but prospective visitors were encouraged to check with individual parks to make sure they were indeed receiving visitors. Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo were set to reopen on Tuesday.Federal workers who had turned to food banks to feed their families continued to struggle to make ends meet as they returned to work on Monday. Some federal employees have been working without pay for weeks. And many federal contractors are not expected to be paid at all for the days the government was closed.Jamie Rodny, an investigator at the Housing and Urban Development office in Los Angeles, said she was both excited to return to work and scared she would be facing the same situation in three weeks. She was told she would not see a paycheck on Monday, and said her branch chief told her that he had heard they might get paid on Thursday.Ms. Rodny, who works for the Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity division, which oversees the enforcement of federal housing laws, said she arrived at her office to find frantic emails and voice mail messages from people whose cases she was forced to drop when the government closed. Now, as she returns these messages, she expects to hear that some of those complainants were evicted over the past 35 days or are facing debts because of the forced lull in their cases.“Where do I start,” she asked.Ms. Rodny spoke at the Women’s March in Washington earlier this month, after she was approached by her labor union, the National Federation of Federal Employees, about the financial and emotional pain of workers affected by the shutdown. Her family lives paycheck to paycheck, she said, and during the break in pay, they used their credit cards for as many purchases as possible, which resulted in her credit score dropping. She said they were able to make their mortgage payment because of donations they received through a GoFundMe campaign. She recently started an activist group called “Stop Government Shutdowns Forever.”The president promised the 800,000 employees who had been furloughed or forced to work that they would be paid “very quickly or as soon as possible,” without providing a specific date. The White House Office of Management and Budget directed agencies to prioritize pay and benefits after reopening.Some federal agencies worked through the weekend in an effort to get paychecks to their workers as soon as possible. The Department of Agriculture instructed its employees to file their time sheets by noon on Monday and pledged to resume direct deposits into bank accounts by Thursday. On Sunday, the commissioner of the Customs and Border Protection agency, Kevin K. McAleenan, addressed employees on Twitter to say that the agency had already approved a majority of the timecards and pledged to work to make sure everyone is paid soon.Aware of the looming Feb. 15 deadline, some lawmakers are trying to pass a law that would outlaw future government shutdowns.“Shutting down the government should be as off limits in budget negotiations as chemical warfare is in real warfare,” Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said on Friday."
30,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump, undaunted by perhaps the most bruising legislative defeat of his tenure, plans to kick off a fresh effort on Monday to pressure Congress to pay for a wall along the southwestern border, most likely setting up another showdown with Democrats who have vowed to block his signature project.Mr. Trump, who failed to extract even a single extra dollar for his wall during a winter battle that shut down parts of the federal government for a record 35 days, will request $8.6 billion in the annual budget proposal, aides said. He will also ask Congress for another $3.6 billion to replenish military construction funds he has diverted to begin work on the wall by declaring a national emergency, for a total of $12.2 billion.“I would just say that the whole issue of the wall and border security is of paramount importance,” said Larry Kudlow, the president’s top economic adviser. “We have a crisis down there.” Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” Mr. Kudlow acknowledged that “there will be” a fight over the issue in Congress.That may be an understatement. Just as Mr. Trump has relentlessly made the wall his highest domestic priority as he gears up for a re-election bid next year, Democrats who took control in the House in January have made it a litmus test of their determination to stand up to his immigration policies.Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, did not even wait for the new wall request to reach Capitol Hill before declaring it dead on arrival on Sunday.“Congress refused to fund his wall, and he was forced to admit defeat and reopen the government,” they said in a joint statement. “The same thing will repeat itself if he tries this again. We hope he learned his lesson.”The budget Mr. Trump will send Congress on Monday will serve more as a statement of values and a vehicle for political positioning than a plausible outline for how the government will actually raise and spend money in the 2020 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Aside from the proposed wall funding, administration officials said, the president will call for a sizable increase in military spending and significant cuts in domestic programs, neither of which Democrats are likely to accept.Mr. Trump’s fiscal plan will also indicate that he will not balance the budget during his presidency even if he wins a second term, despite his campaign promise not only to eliminate the annual deficit but to pay off the entire national debt accumulated over generations as well. His budget blueprint promises a balanced budget only in 15 years, long after he will have left office, aides said, and even that is predicated on growth estimates that seem unrealistically inflated to independent economists.At a time when most economic forecasters see growth slowing in the United States and around the world, the budget projects American growth will actually rise this year — to 3.2 percent, up from 2.9 percent for 2018. That is nearly a full percentage point higher than the 2.3 percent forecast by the Federal Reserve.Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said on Sunday that administration economists expected continued boosts to growth this year from the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts that Mr. Trump signed in 2017, including further increases in labor force participation by older workers.Other economists have criticized the sustained forecast of 3 percent growth over a decade as overly optimistic. Mr. Hassett defended it by pointing to the administration’s forecast for last year, which was only slightly above the actual growth rate. “We have the same forecast we had last year,” Mr. Hassett said, “because we got last year precisely correct.”The budget is the first of Mr. Trump’s tenure to theoretically adhere to spending caps that Congress adopted under President Barack Obama, only to bust in the years since. But Mr. Trump accomplishes this only through budgetary legerdemain by pushing much of his 4.7 percent military spending increase out of the regular budget and into an account called Overseas Contingency Operations that has been used mainly to finance wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria and has therefore been exempt from congressional caps.At the same time, domestic discretionary programs would be cut 5 percent, an idea certain to go nowhere with Democrats. Mr. Trump is hoping to avoid a repeat of last year’s budget deal, in which he was forced to agree to major domestic spending increases to secure his military boost. But he has even less sway now than he did last year, when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress.The overseas operations fund would receive $165 billion, compared with $69 billion this year, even as Mr. Trump is scaling back military operations in Afghanistan and Syria. The last time the fund had so much money was in the 2010 fiscal year, when the United States had nearly seven times as many troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.Among those who have criticized the overseas operations budget category as a “slush fund” is Mick Mulvaney, a Republican former congressman who served as Mr. Trump’s first budget director and is now the acting White House chief of staff.On the wall, the president seems more intent on proving to conservatives his commitment to building it than to finding a compromise with Democrats. Administration officials said the new $8.6 billion Mr. Trump is seeking would enable him to complete the project, with a total of 700 miles of barriers, most of it new, though with some sections refurbished.Mr. Trump, who spent the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, golfing and raising a reported $7 million for the coming elections, lashed out at Ann Coulter, the conservative commentator who has accused him of giving up too much on the wall.“Wacky Nut Job @AnnCoulter, who still hasn’t figured out that, despite all odds and an entire Democrat Party of Far Left Radicals against me (not to mention certain Republicans who are sadly unwilling to fight), I am winning on the Border,” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday.“Major sections of Wall are being built and renovated,” he added, “with MUCH MORE to follow shortly. Tens of thousands of illegals are being apprehended (captured) at the Border and NOT allowed into our Country. With another President, millions would be pouring in. I am stopping an invasion as the Wall gets built.”In December, Mr. Trump refused to accept $1.375 billion for barriers along the border — though not steel or concrete walls — and demanded that Congress instead give him $5.7 billion, resulting in the partial government shutdown that left agencies closed and 800,000 workers without pay.After five weeks, he gave in and agreed to reopen the government without concessions by the Democrats. The spending deal that ultimately passed both the Democratic-controlled House and the Republican-controlled Senate included just the $1.375 billion he had originally turned down.He signed grudgingly but then declared a national emergency to justify raiding $3.6 billion from a military construction fund for wall money. Relying on a president’s more traditional authority to move money around in limited ways, he also diverted another $3.1 billion from counternarcotics programs and an asset forfeiture fund. Combined with the $1.375 billion, that gave him about $8 billion for border barriers.Democrats and some Republicans objected to the national emergency declaration on the grounds that Mr. Trump was abusing the Constitution by appropriating money that Congress had explicitly refused to spend for that purpose. The House has voted to overturn his declaration, and enough Republicans have signaled that they will join Democrats to do the same in the Senate, presumably prompting what would be the first veto of Mr. Trump’s presidency. Critics do not have enough votes to override his veto, but lawsuits have been filed seeking to block his move.The budget to be unveiled on Monday would backfill the $3.6 billion from military construction projects, but officials did not say whether the other diverted money would be restored.Given the anger on the left over the national emergency declaration, it seemed hard to imagine that Democrats would agree to sanction it by reimbursing the money he took. “This ridiculous request, like the rest of the Trump budget, is not even worth the paper it’s written on,” said Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York and the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee."
31,"McALLEN, Tex. — President Trump traveled to the border on Thursday to warn of crime and chaos on the frontier, as White House officials considered diverting emergency aid from storm- and fire-ravaged Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California to build a border barrier, perhaps under an emergency declaration.In a sign of growing unease about the partial government shutdown, some Senate Republicans came off the sidelines to hash out a deal that would reopen the government as Congress worked toward a broader agreement tying wall funds to protection for some undocumented immigrants and other migrants.But before those negotiations could gain momentum, they collapsed. Vice President Mike Pence and other members of Mr. Trump’s team let it be known privately that the president would not back such a deal.“It kind of fell apart,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who was among those Republicans seeking a deal.“It is time for President Trump to use emergency powers to fund the construction of a border wall/barrier,” he said later in a brief statement. He added, “I hope it works.”The administration appeared to be looking into just such a solution: using extraordinary emergency powers to get around Congress in funding the wall. Among the options, the White House has directed the Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether it can divert for wall construction $13.9 billion allocated last year after devastating hurricanes and wildfires, according to congressional and Defense Department officials with knowledge of the matter, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the possibility.Administration officials are debating whether they could make such a move without the president declaring a national emergency, an action the White House counsel’s office has explored.But Mr. Trump’s advisers, including his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, have urged him to try to find other approaches than declaring a national emergency. Mr. Kushner’s role was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.The advisers have warned him of a range of possible negative outcomes, particularly the risk of losing in court, people familiar with the discussions said.Aides have suggested that Mr. Trump would be giving a dysfunctional Congress a pass from fulfilling its duties if he makes an aggressive move. And some of his more conservative advisers have suggested a national emergency declaration is a form of government overreach that is antithetical to conservative principles.As the shutdown neared Day 21 — the second longest in history — Mr. Trump used a visit to a border facility in McAllen, Tex., to blame the protracted shutdown on Democrats, charging that their opposition to a wall was responsible for brutal crime and violence.“You’ll have crime in Iowa, you’ll have crime in New Hampshire, you’ll have crime in New York” without a wall, he warned.“We could stop that cold,” he added.Mr. Trump also repeated his demand for the money from Congress while saying that Mexico would somehow provide funds indirectly for the wall, a contradiction of what he said in December when he wrote in a Twitter post, “I often stated, ‘One way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.’ ”“I didn’t say they’re going to write me a check for $10 billion or $20 billion,” Mr. Trump said on Thursday. “If Congress approves this trade bill, they’ll pay for the wall many times over. When I say Mexico’s going to pay for the wall, that’s what I mean.”It was among the bewildering statements that underscored his often contradictory attempts to force Democrats to capitulate. Mr. Trump renewed his threat to declare a national emergency and build his wall without congressional approval.“We can declare a national emergency,” Mr. Trump said. “We shouldn’t have to.”Later, standing just by the Rio Grande with military vehicles and border agents as his backdrop, he said he would consider a compromise that would allow undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, often known as Dreamers, to maintain legal status they lost when he ended the Obama-era program that protected them.“I would like to do a much broader form of immigration,” Mr. Trump said. “We could help the Dreamers.”Only hours earlier, Mr. Pence had rejected such a deal, saying the president wanted to wait until the Supreme Court ruled this spring on whether the program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was constitutional. “No wall, no deal,” Mr. Pence declared in a briefing with reporters on Capitol Hill. “We’re going to keep standing strong, keep standing firm.”The vice president faulted the Democrats, but he has essentially blocked potential solutions for the impasse. He has made it clear that Mr. Trump would not drop his insistence on funding for a wall on the southwestern border, which Democrats have branded a nonstarter.Mr. Pence also indicated that the president was disinclined to accept the idea behind a bipartisan plan that had been under discussion in the Senate that would trade wall funding for legal status for undocumented immigrants facing the threat of deportation, including the Dreamers and people who previously held Temporary Protected Status.Privately, he told Mr. Graham’s group that the president also would not support a proposal that would reopen the government for three weeks while Republicans and Democrats work to hash out a broader legislative deal on the wall and temporary grants of legal status for the two groups.“We’re kind of stuck,” Mr. Graham conceded.Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, also showed no signs of budging, urging the Republican-controlled Senate to take up a measure that the House passed on Wednesday to reopen part of the government. The House passed two more measures on Thursday, this time funding the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Transportation and Agriculture, as well as the Food and Drug Administration.A dozen Republicans crossed party lines to support one of the measures — slightly more than in previous votes, but no indicator that the patience of Mr. Trump’s own party was wearing thin.“We say to them: ‘Take yes for an answer. This is what you had proposed,’” Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference. “Why are you rejecting it at the expense of the health, safety and well-being of the American people? Do you take an oath to the American people, or to Donald Trump?”The showdown has forced 800,000 federal workers to go without pay and placed federal benefits for millions more in jeopardy, with the fallout being felt across the United States. Without debate on Thursday, the Senate unanimously passed legislation to ensure that workers who go without salaries receive back pay when the government reopens. Senator Mitch McConnell Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said Mr. Trump had assured him he would sign the bill.The partial shutdown will almost certainly become the longest in American history on Saturday, eclipsing a 21-day lapse that began in December 1995. Mr. Trump tweeted Thursday that he would skip a planned trip to the World Economic Forum  in Davos, Switzerland, slated to begin Jan. 22, because of the impasse.The implosion of the congressional deal left lawmakers bracing for Mr. Trump to declare a national emergency. Senior Democrats were exploring both legislative and legal options to challenge the move.The president is allowed to divert unspent money from projects under a national emergency. But a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe confidential discussions, questioned the legality of using Army Corps funding, saying it would be subject to restrictions under the Stafford Act, which governs disaster relief. The official said the process was as much a political exercise intended to threaten projects Democrats valued as a pragmatic one.“That would be a travesty,” Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon and the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said in an interview.“It’s all speculative at this point,” he said, alluding wryly to Mr. Trump’s penchant for abrupt announcements at all hours of the day and night. “Until we get a tweet at 2:30 tomorrow morning, we won’t know.”Still, Republican senators who had called for reopening the government while the debate over border security continues said they were disappointed.“It’s very difficult when we’re dealing with people who do not want to budge at all with their positions, and that’s the president and Speaker Pelosi,” Senator Susan Collins of Maine said. “They’re each very dug in on their position, and that’s made this very difficult to resolve.”"
32,"WASHINGTON — President Trump will declare a national emergency as early as Friday to bypass Congress and build his long-promised wall along the nation’s southwestern border even as he agreed to sign a spending package that does not finance it, White House officials said Thursday.The announcement came just minutes before voting began on the spending measure, which then cleared both houses, ending a two-month war of attrition that closed much of the federal government for 35 days and threatened a second shutdown on Friday. The Senate passed it 83 to 16, and the House followed later in the evening, 300 to 128.But if he declares a national emergency to access billions of dollars for his wall, Mr. Trump could instigate a constitutional clash over who controls the federal purse and test the bounds of presidential authority in a time of divided government. Democrats and some Republicans instantly condemned the move, with some vowing to challenge it through legislation and lawsuits.[Trump will declare a national emergency. What happens next?]The president’s plan would combine money included in the spending package for fencing along the border with funds that he can divert from other programs using traditional presidential discretion on top of still other money he would tap by declaring an emergency.Altogether, an administration official said, Mr. Trump would be able to dedicate about $8 billion for barriers, more than the $5.7 billion that Congress refused to give him.“President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action — including a national emergency — to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border,” said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. “The president is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border and secure our great country.”Mr. Trump’s announcement capped hours of last-minute drama as he came under pressure on Thursday morning to not sign the spending legislation from conservative figures like Laura Ingraham, who denounced it on Twitter as a “monstrosity” and a “Total SCAM!”A balky president was concerned that signing the measure could impose restraints on his ability to tap other funds and was urged by his chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to tell Republican leaders to instead pass a short-term bill to keep the government open while reopening negotiations, according to a Republican briefed on the situation.Such a move would have unraveled the delicate bipartisan balance favored by Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, who wanted to move beyond the wall fight. In a telephone conversation on Thursday, Mr. Trump asked Mr. McConnell whether the spending measure included any hidden provisions or “land mines,” and the senator reassured him it did not, according to a person familiar with the call.Similarly, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, and White House lawyers told him that he could still move money around, and Ms. Nielsen said that the spending package was actually better than a short-term measure. Mr. McConnell argued that it was a win over Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Ultimately, Mr. Trump was persuaded to sign the bipartisan spending measure after all, and at least some close to the president doubted that he was ever really wavering and instead was just enjoying the suspense.But Mr. McConnell chose not to take a chance, rushing to the floor and interrupting a colleague’s speech to announce Mr. Trump’s decision, in effect locking it in before he could change his mind.In agreeing to end the spending fight for now, however, Mr. Trump essentially started a new one with his vow to declare a national emergency, one that crosses party and ideological lines as liberals and conservatives alike objected to what they called presidential overreach.Seven Senate Democrats, including four announced or possible presidential candidates, immediately introduced legislation intended to block Mr. Trump from diverting money from disaster relief for the wall. Some House Democrats, including Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, began endorsing a joint resolution to essentially nullify a national emergency declaration.A parade of liberal advocacy organizations sent out pre-written statements promising to challenge any such declaration in court as “an outrageous abuse of power” by an “unstable and increasingly autocratic” president, as one of the groups, Public Citizen, put it.“The president is doing an end run around Congress,” Ms. Pelosi told reporters. She suggested that Mr. Trump was setting a precedent for future Democratic presidents to act on issues like gun control — precisely the scenario that scares Republicans.“You want to talk about a national emergency, let’s talk about today,” Ms. Pelosi said, reminding Mr. Trump that it was the anniversary of the shooting massacre last February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Seventeen students and staff members were killed. “That’s a national emergency. Why don’t you declare that emergency, Mr. President? I wish you would.”Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, echoed her criticism and said Congress would defend its prerogatives. “The public was more opposed to the emergency declaration than they were to the wall,” he said in a brief interview. “And they were opposed to the wall.”About a half-dozen Senate Republicans quickly spoke out against the move, as well. “I don’t think this is a matter that should be declared a national emergency,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. “We as legislators are trying to address the president’s priority. What we’re voting on now is perhaps an imperfect solution, but it’s one we could get consensus on.”Senator Susan Collins of Maine said such a declaration was “of dubious constitutionality,” while Senator Marco Rubio of Florida called it “a bad idea.” Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said, “We have a government that has a Constitution that has a division of power, and revenue raising and spending power was given to Congress.”Still, other Republicans backed Mr. Trump, including an ally, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, who faces re-election next year. “He feels that declaring a national emergency gives him that flexibility that he wants and needs, so I’m supportive of that,” Ms. Capito said of the president.“For goodness’ sake, we tried for 35 days in December and January, right, to get the Democrats to do what everyone knows needs to happen except Democrats,” said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio. “I support the national emergency declaration 100 percent.”Among the Republicans who privately warned Mr. Trump against an emergency declaration was Mr. McConnell, who expects that House Democrats will pass a resolution terminating it in a form that the Republican leader cannot block from a floor vote. At least five or six Republican senators are likely to vote against the president, making a majority along with the Democrats, and potentially forcing Mr. Trump to veto it.[Read the first edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up for it here.]A person familiar with the discussions said that Mr. McConnell said that he has warned Mr. Trump that he has less than two weeks to try to persuade wavering Republicans to support his national emergency effort, otherwise he will face the prospect of a bipartisan rebuke by Congress.The spending legislation that passed on Thursday drew strong bipartisan votes in a Congress that has been deeply divided along party lines. In the House, 213 Democrats and 87 Republicans voted yes, meaning that Democrats were unable to pass it by themselves because they lost 19 of their own. Most Republicans, 109 in all, voted no.Ms. Pelosi, using nearly a dozen pens to sign the final bill, applauded the bipartisan majority, calling it “quite a remarkable show.”In the Senate, most of the 16 no votes were by Republicans, along with four Democratic presidential candidates — Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.The package includes the seven remaining bills to keep the remainder of the government open through the rest of the fiscal year at the end of September. House and Senate negotiators unveiled the 1,159-page bill on Wednesday just before midnight, leaving little time for lawmakers to actually digest its contents.The border security compromise tucked into the bill is perhaps the most stinging legislative defeat of Mr. Trump’s presidency. It provides money for 55 miles of steel-post fencing, essentially the same deal that Mr. Trump rejected in December.The measure prohibits construction in certain areas along the Rio Grande Valley and includes a provision, pushed by Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas, granting communities on the border time to weigh in on the location and design of the fencing.The bill also prohibits funds from being used to keep lawmakers from visiting and inspecting Department of Homeland Security detention centers, following a number of highly publicized instances where Democratic lawmakers tried to visit detention centers and were turned away.Lawmakers were drawn by the other six parts of the spending package that finance a number of agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service, which is in the middle of tax-filing season, and the Commerce Department. Allocations include $77 million to address the opioid epidemic, as well as money for natural disasters, including nearly $4 billion to wild-land fire programs and $12.6 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster relief fund.The package also negates an executive order that Mr. Trump signed to freeze pay for federal civilian workers, and instead extends a 1.9 percent pay increase. Vice President Mike Pence, cabinet officials and other high-level political appointees will receive raises of about $10,000 a year that had been frozen during the shutdown.Negotiators failed to resolve other matters, including back pay for federal contractors caught in the middle of the shutdown and an extension of the Violence Against Women Act, which expires Friday — although grants under the act are funded in the spending bill.Mr. Trump’s aides have told him he can add to the $1.375 billion by reallocating money from other related programs using his traditional discretion but a national emergency would allow him to access even more money. Exactly how that would work was still being debated; there were multiple drafts of the emergency order circulating within the government this week.A Defense Department official said one likely scenario would be to divert up to $2.5 billion in counternarcotics funds to the Army Corps of Engineers. The administration would then transfer existing federal land along the border to the Defense Department and acquire or condemn private land.The Army Corps could then go ahead and build a wall or other barrier to secure the Defense Department’s property using the newly diverted funds. Dozens of miles of barrier could be built this way, according to the official, who asked not to be identified discussing alternatives before the White House was ready to disclose a specific plan.Legal experts have said Mr. Trump can muster serious arguments that he can declare a national emergency under current law, but it would almost surely prompt a court challenge from critics arguing that he is usurping two centuries of congressional control over spending.Under Article I of the Constitution, Congress has the power to appropriate funds. “No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law,” it says.But Congress has passed laws in the past providing presidents with authority in national emergencies, laws that remain on the books. Indeed, 31 national emergencies declared by Mr. Trump and his predecessors remain active.Legal challenges could ultimately lead to a confrontation at the Supreme Court. The court is led by a five-member conservative majority, but it has shown skepticism of presidential excesses in recent years, reining in both President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama when the justices concluded they had overstepped their authority."
33,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Friday issued his first veto, rejecting legislation to overturn his declaration of a national emergency to fund a wall along the southwestern border. The bill had attracted significant Republican support in Congress, a rare and notable departure from partisan solidarity.“Today, I am vetoing this resolution,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “Congress has the freedom to pass this resolution, and I have the duty to veto it.” The president called the resolution “dangerous,” “reckless” and a “vote against reality.”Mr. Trump was flanked by Vice President Mike Pence, Attorney General William P. Barr and Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary. Mr. Barr said the president’s emergency order was “clearly authorized under the law” and “solidly grounded in law.”The veto, which was expected, will send the legislation back to Congress, which almost certainly does not have enough votes for an override. That means Mr. Trump’s declaration will remain in effect.Democrats were quick to condemn the president’s action.“It is no surprise that the president holds the rule of law and our Constitution in minimal regard,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement. “There is no emergency; Congress has refused to fund his wall multiple times; Mexico won’t pay for it; and a bipartisan majority in both chambers just voted to terminate his fake emergency.”To that, Speaker Nancy Pelosi added, “The House and Senate resoundingly rejected the president’s lawless power grab, yet the president has chosen to continue to defy the Constitution, the Congress and the will of the American people.”Mr. Trump has long insisted that there was a security and humanitarian crisis at the border with Mexico, an assertion that was undercut by Mr. Trump himself when he acknowledged that he could have waited to issue a declaration. But on Friday, he offered a flurry of statistics to support his contention, though many were vague. He blurred numbers that reflected a humanitarian problem with those he said represented a security issue.Democrats had seized on his earlier words and cited other government data that shows there has been no flood of criminal migrants coming into the United States. Some Republicans shared that view.But others said they opposed the president on the grounds that it was the duty of Congress to appropriate taxpayer dollars and that Mr. Trump had exceeded his authority. On Thursday, a dozen Republicans joined Senate Democrats in voting to overturn Mr. Trump’s emergency declaration, 59 to 41.“Never before has a president asked for funding, Congress has not provided it and the president then has used the National Emergencies Act of 1976 to spend the money anyway,” Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said after the vote. Senator Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas, said he thought Mr. Trump’s declaration was unconstitutional.The president said on Friday that he understood why some Republicans believed he had overreached. “They’re doing what they have to do, and I put no pressure on anybody,” Mr. Trump said. “I actually said, ‘I could have gotten some of them to come along.’ I said: ‘I want you to vote your heart. Do what you want to do. I’m not putting any pressure.’”“I’ll let them know when there’s pressure, O.K.?” he added. “And I told them that. I said, ‘When I need your vote, I’m going to let you know.’ I didn’t need the vote because we all knew it was going to be a veto, and they’re not going to be able to override. It’s going to go very quickly.”Mr. Trump has held broad sway over congressional Republicans in his first two years in office. The decision by the dozen Senate Republicans to side with Democrats on an issue central to the president’s agenda was seen as a reclaiming of the role of Congress as a coequal branch of government.Mr. Trump was undeterred by the Republican opposition and quickly signaled his next step when he tweeted “VETO!” not long after the vote. The president said on Friday that there was nothing less than an “invasion” of the United States by migrants, and he added that so many of them had been apprehended that there was “nowhere left to hold all of the people that we’re capturing.”Even if Congress fails to override the veto, the emergency declaration is already drawing court challenges.A coalition of 20 states, including California and New York, sued last month over Mr. Trump’s use of emergency powers, arguing that the president does not have the authority to divert funds for building a wall along the Mexican border because it is Congress that controls spending.Xavier Becerra, the attorney general of California, said that Congress had sent a clear message that “your supposed ‘emergency’ isn’t one.”He added, “We are determined to stop his fabricated emergency in its tracks.”Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement that “even members of President Trump’s own party are beginning to realize that he is a one-man constitutional crisis.”“The president’s veto is as meaningless as his signature on the national emergency declaration,” he added. “Congress has rejected the president’s declaration, and now the courts will be the ultimate arbiter of its legality. We look forward to seeing him in court and to the shellacking that he will receive at the hands of an independent judiciary.”"
34,"THE END OF THE MYTH From the Frontier to the Border Wall in the Mind of AmericaBy Greg GrandinIn a speech in 1932, Franklin Delano Roosevelt reminded a San Francisco audience of what had always distinguished the United States from other nations since its earliest days. “At the very worst,” Roosevelt declared, “there was always the possibility of climbing into a covered wagon and moving west where the untilled prairies afforded a haven for men to whom the East did not provide a place.”Well, yes and no. It is the mission of this fine, elegantly written history to explore the ever-shifting role of the frontier in the American story. Just who was welcome in that west-facing “haven,” Greg Grandin explains, was never as simple as Americans liked to proclaim. But “The End of the Myth” has a shadow theme. How is it, Grandin wants to know, that the symbol of America was once a boundless, beckoning frontier and today is a dark and forbidding wall?The first person to articulate the frontier thesis was a University of Wisconsin historian who was little regarded at the time, Frederick Jackson Turner. In 1893, he read a paper on “The Significance of the Frontier in American History” to a sleepy audience. No one asked a question.The world quickly woke up. Turner’s idea was that the United States had been blessed by geographic good fortune. The seemingly infinite West would solve the problems that arose whenever too many people were jammed into too small a space. The frontier, in Grandin’s summary, “would reduce racism to a remnant and leave it behind as residue. It would dilute other social problems as well, including poverty, inequality and extremism, teaching diverse people how to live together in peace.”It was a pretty picture and a profoundly optimistic one. The frontier, Turner declared, was “a magic fountain of youth in which America continually bathed and was rejuvenated.” Grandin deepens and enriches that picture. Though Turner depicted the frontier as “a place where individualism sprouted from the land like prairie weeds,” in Grandin’s summary, that got the story backward. The reality, Grandin argues, was that “the state preceded the frontier.” Before the settlers arrived, the government had bought the land and surveyed it and built roads across it. Above all, the United States Army removed Native Americans and Mexicans from the settlers’ way, in brutal and deadly fashion.But this is a measured, careful work, not a “People’s History” polemic. Grandin is a fine explainer with a knack for pithy summary. Turner’s frontier was a restrained place, “more James Stewart than John Wayne.” America was “a nation founded on unparalleled freedom and unmatched unfreedom.” The appeal of the frontier myth was that it took problems in the “here and now” and shifted them to the “there and then.”Grandin keeps his cool — he prefers the stiletto to the club — but he grows angrier as his history reaches the present day. “The frontier was, ultimately, a mirage,” he writes, because it promised “a limitless world” where “all could benefit; all could rise and share in the earth’s riches.” The wall, on the other hand, is “a monument to disenchantment,” a deafening shout that “there’s not enough to go around.”The wall stands as our new emblem, Grandin writes, and “it is a symbol of a nation that used to believe that it had escaped history, or at least strode atop history, but now finds itself trapped by history.” Disenchanted and bewildered, we have become, so Grandin contends, “a country that increasingly defines itself by what it hates.”"
35,"Thursday was a chaotic day in Washington, from the former deputy F.B.I. director’s confirmation that the bureau considered invoking the 25th Amendment against President Trump to the president’s plan to declare a national emergency to build a border wall.Here is a recap of some of the biggest stories:Congress approved a spending package that would avert another government shutdown, and the president said he would sign the bill — but also declare a national emergency to build a wall along the southern border. That move supersedes Congress and will test the limits of presidential power.The bill passed by Congress allotted $1.375 billion for fencing, a much smaller amount than the $5.7 billion Mr. Trump wanted for a border wall. “The president is doing an end run around Congress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker.Additional Reading: • Trump Plans National Emergency to Build Border Wall as Senate Passes Spending Bill• National Emergency Powers and Trump’s Border Wall, ExplainedAndrew G.

Mr. McCabe made the statement on a preview of a “60 Minutes” interview set to air Sunday, which kicks off his promotional tour for a memoir.The New York Times reported in September that Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, discussed “recruiting cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment” against the president. At the time, Mr. Rosenstein said the report was “inaccurate and factually incorrect.”Mr. Trump responded to Mr. McCabe’s claim on Twitter, calling him a disgrace to the bureau and the United States. The Justice Department also disputed Mr. McCabe’s statement and said Mr. Rosenstein had “no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment” against Mr. Trump.Additional Reading: • McCabe Says Justice Dept.

38,"[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]BROWNSVILLE, Tex. — Homar Veloz lives in South Texas, but on the wrong side of the border wall — separated from the rest of the United States by a long line of vertical steel bars standing up to 18 feet high.His house on the 1600 block of Milpa Verde is located in an odd swath of Brownsville, Tex., that runs between the border wall and the Rio Grande — a netherworld that is officially still America but which somehow got left on the Mexican side of the wall.Visitors often get confused, including Mr. Veloz’s daughter, who was nervous the first time she visited the house, and reminded him that she hadn’t brought her passport.“She said, ‘Dad, don’t tell me we’re in Mexico,’” he recalled. “Because she’d gone past the fence.”One of his neighbors made a homemade billboard that she posted at the end of her driveway to make things clear: “We’re Part of America.”On long stretches of the Southwest border, a clearly visible boundary separates the United States and Mexico. In parts of Southern California and in the Arizona desert, it takes the shape of a wall running right along the line, with one country on each side.But in South Texas, things get fuzzy. The border there, by tradition and international treaty, is the Rio Grande, and no one has yet figured out how to build a border wall in the middle of a river. As a result, the fence that elsewhere would trace the southern edge of the United States can run, as it does in Mr. Veloz’s neighborhood, more than a mile north of the river.That has created an oddly isolated zone of homes, ranchland, industrial sites and nature preserves that locals call a no man’s land, between the barrier and the border — a place that dozens of Texans call home.President Trump’s border security plans call for miles of new border fencing in South Texas, much of it in the Rio Grande Valley, which has emerged as a key corridor for unauthorized migration into the United States. The border wall proposal has raised questions about cost and effectiveness across the country, but one of the biggest issues here in Texas is the way the plan would significantly add to the buffer zone, a bizarre region that has amused, angered and isolated the people who live and work there.“It was a bunch of yo-yos up in D.C.,” said Cuban A. Monsees Jr., 71, who lives north of the fence, not far from Mr. Veloz, but owns more than four acres on the south side. “It should be closer to the river, No. 1,” Mr. Monsees said of the fence. “Where it should have been was within 150 feet of the river bank, rather than, in some cases, a mile and a half away.”This netherworld between the end of Mexico and the visible beginning of the United States is a subtly off-kilter place unlike any other in America.Residents, property owners and ranch hands in South Texas gain access through dozens of openings and gates, in many cases by punching in secret access codes on a keypad. One household south of the fence in Brownsville put its mailbox on the north side, presumably to make life easier for the letter carrier.The pace is slow, the property cheap: Mr. Veloz rents his house for $350 a month. Another resident doesn’t have a mailbox because the mail never comes, and burns his trash because the refuse collector never shows up.The fencing that created the netherworld went up during the George W. Bush administration, but limitations on where the fence could be constructed are much older.A treaty signed by the United States and Mexico in 1970, and later ratified under President Richard Nixon, to resolve some boundary disputes also prohibits construction of anything that would obstruct the normal flow of the Rio Grande. It applies not only to the river’s main channel, but also adjacent lands, hence the decision to keep the fencing well clear of the river.The fencing was intended to help keep out drug smugglers and unauthorized migrants. But in some ways it has complicated the Trump administration’s attempts to halt the waves of migrant families from Central America who have been crossing the border recently. Those who cross in the Rio Grande Valley do not have to breach a border wall to claim asylum, because they reach United States soil and gain that right as soon as they have crossed the river. So for them, the situation is no different than it would be if there were no wall or fence at all.A number of legal battles have broken out between the Trump administration and property owners along the river, over the government’s plans for additional barriers north of the river that would cut off and fragment ranches, nature centers and historical landmarks.Life on the south side of the Bush-era fence has been difficult for the nonprofit Nature Conservancy. It owns the Southmost Preserve near Brownsville, a nesting habitat for rare birds and the site of one of the last two large stands of native sabal palm trees in the country. Most of the preserve — 831 of its 1,014 acres — is south of the fence.At one time, a preserve manager lived in a house on the site, and many donors and researchers visited or even stayed overnight. But after the wall was built in 2009, slicing through the preserve, the live-in manager was moved out for safety reasons, and visits by donors and researchers dwindled. There have also been negative ecological impacts, including disruptions to the free movement of ocelots, an endangered species.The federal government initially offered the Nature Conservancy roughly $100,000 for a right of way through the preserve, but the group sued and was awarded nearly $1 million — less than one-third of the $3.1 million it spent to purchase the preserve.“Visitation in general is not what it was,” said Laura Huffman, the Nature Conservancy’s state director. “It’s changed the story about the preserve. One hundred percent of the time now the conversation about Southmost Preserve is not about sabal palms and habitat protection for the ocelot. It’s about a border wall, and that’s not our conservation work.”In some ways, this region is not unlike other rural parts of Texas. There are vast, carefully maintained fields of corn and sugar cane, horse stalls, dirt roads, power lines and tail-swishing cattle. There are radio towers and quaint ponds and houses with swimming pools and unleashed dogs chasing passing vehicles.Brownsville officials say Mr. Veloz and his neighbors on Milpa Verde are provided the same municipal services as any other residents.“Our response times are not affected,” said Jarrett Sheldon, chief of the Brownsville Fire Department. “People on the other side of the wall, they’re going to get the same response.”Residents south of the fence don’t need to rely solely on Brownsville emergency responders for their security, in any case: They live in one of the most heavily patrolled communities in the country. Border Patrol agents come through regularly in vehicles and helicopters, along with sheriff’s deputies, constables and state troopers. Cameras are mounted high atop the fence, many of them aimed at the openings and gates, and residents have long grown accustomed to being photographed and filmed as they travel to and from their homes.Mr. Veloz said it all makes him feel safer. Migrants and smugglers are a common sight. Years ago, he said, people used to knock on his door at night. “I wouldn’t answer,” he said, “because I don’t know what their intentions are.”Being Texans, though, many of the people who live between the fence and the river say they don’t count exclusively on the government to keep them safe. One recent afternoon, a retired refrigerator repairman wearing camouflage clothing strolled south of the wall with a handgun in a holster on his hip. Mr. Monsees was even more heavily armed as he spoke outside his home while sitting in his pickup truck.“This is a single-shot .410, and that’s a single-shot .22, and I keep the pistol between the seats,” he said.In another buffer-zone community along the river about 50 miles northwest of Brownsville, on a muddy dirt road outside the town of Donna, Arturo Munoz, 72, sat in the carport of his house just south of the border fence, sipping a Bud Light. His dog Max lay at his feet.“It’s just about the same as on the north side,” said Mr. Munoz, a retired welder and Vietnam veteran, though he conceded that he has no mail service, no landline telephone and no cable television.He said he bought the property nearly 15 years ago because he grew up nearby and feels a connection to the area. When it came time to build the border fence, he said, the government made him an offer he could refuse, and he did. He stayed put, and the wall went up just north of his white-brick home, right behind a line of trees in his back yard.“It’s a lot safer than in town,” he said. “I lived in town. I was renting, and got broke into three times.”He described riding his bicycle near his house one day and seeing a few migrants walking along. He said he waved to them and pedaled on. They had crossed the river on their journey to America, and had found it. Sort of."
39,"WASHINGTON — President Trump criticized Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras on Thursday for accepting monetary aid from the United States but doing nothing in return, a day after his homeland security secretary struck what she described as a historic agreement with three of those same countries to help strengthen security on the United States’ southwestern border.Mr. Trump also threatened to close the border, a move he has previously considered, which would have a significant economic impact by disrupting the flow of trade and labor.Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen met on Tuesday with Mexican officials in Miami and on Wednesday  with Central American officials in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, to discuss the humanitarian crisis and what the Trump administration considers a security emergency at the United States-Mexico border.“I’m pleased to announce the U.S. & our Northern Triangle allies have reached a HISTORIC agreement to confront the root causes of the crisis on our border,” Ms. Nielsen said on Twitter on Wednesday. “Working with Central American govts to increase security & prosperity in the region has been one of my greatest priorities.”The countries agreed to continue having conversations about ways to counter human trafficking, smuggling, organized crime and gangs, and to improve border security throughout the region.Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, said on Thursday that his country was in constant communication with the United States and would maintain “a very respectful relationship” with its neighbor.It was not immediately clear what caused Mr. Trump’s outrage early Thursday, and later he wrote that “Mexico, with the strongest immigration laws in the World, refuses to help with illegal immigration & drugs!” The remarks came on the heels of House Democrats’ refusal to sign off on a Defense Department request to redirect funds to be used to help build the president’s border wall.“Instead of focusing on readiness, hurricane recovery and other genuine issues, the administration continues to spend billions of dollars on an imaginary crisis,” Representative Adam Smith of Washington, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement on Tuesday.The Trump administration has long described the situation at the border as a national security emergency, but Democrats have disputed that characterization.The acting defense secretary, Patrick M. Shanahan, said on Wednesday that despite the objection from lawmakers, the Pentagon would move forward with the plan to reprogram funds to be used for the border wall.In February, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency on the southern border, providing for military funds to be shifted to help build the wall. The decision provoked outrage from Democratic and Republican lawmakers over the constitutional separation of powers. The president vetoed a resolution to block his declaration, and on Tuesday the House failed to overturn that veto.Defense Department officials have said they do not need congressional approval to divert funds and use them for the wall."
40,"From the border wall fight to conflict with Iran, it’s been a busy week in American politics. Here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed (and some links if you’d like to read further).___________________House and Senate negotiators agreed “in principle” on Monday to provide $1.375 billion for physical barriers at the southwestern border. The deal provided much less funding than the proposal President Trump rejected in December, and his border wall took a back seat in Congress’s budget negotiations, which instead focused on the record number of immigrants in detention. (Here are five takeaways from the deal.)Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he was “not happy” with the deal but that he didn’t think there would be another government shutdown. He sought to reassure supporters that he would not give up on his “build the wall” pledge, saying he had “options that most people don’t understand.”The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, persuaded Mr. Trump to agree to the bill, but it came at a price: The president would declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, he told the majority leader — and Mr. McConnell would have to back him.On Friday, the president declared a national emergency to access billions of dollars to build the wall, transforming a highly charged policy dispute into a fundamental confrontation over the separation of powers.Mr. Trump portrayed his announcement as a routine use of executive authority, but there is no precedent for what he has done.

41,"WASHINGTON — The House on Tuesday failed to overturn President Trump’s first veto, leaving the declaration of a national emergency at the southwestern border intact despite the bipartisan passage of a resolution attempting to nullify the president’s circumvention of Congress to fund his border wall.Despite concerns about the constitutional separation of powers and the effect of Mr. Trump’s move on local military projects, the 248-to-181 vote fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to kill the national emergency declaration.Republicans in both chambers had joined Democrats in passing the resolution disapproving his national emergency just weeks ago, voicing discomfort over the president’s intent to divert funding to the construction of a border wall without congressional approval. Mr. Trump, issuing the first veto of his administration, had called the resolution “dangerous,” “reckless,” and a “vote against reality.”But only 14 Republicans ultimately joined House Democrats in voting to override the veto, one more than the 13 who voted for the resolution of disapproval a month ago. (Representative John Katko, Republican of New York, had said he would support the measure, but missed the earlier vote.)Mr. Trump then thanked House Republicans “for sticking together.” “Today’s vote simply reaffirms Congressional Democrats are the party of Open Borders, Drugs and Crime!” he wrote on Twitter.Democrats had hoped that the publication of all the military construction projects that could see funding delays as Mr. Trump pursued wall money would sway their Republican colleagues. They framed the vote around both lofty constitutional principles and parochial home-district matters.“Even when the legislative branch disagrees with the executive, we respect the office the president holds and it’s his right to veto legislation,” said Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, speaking on the floor ahead of the vote.“But when those decisions violate the Constitution,” she added, “then that must be stopped.”House Republican leaders, however, derided the vote as political gamesmanship and a waste of time.Democratic lawmakers and aides say they have not ruled out the possibility of reintroducing the resolution in six months, and they could use other legislative options to block the president’s effort to take as much as $3.6 billion in military construction funds for the wall.For now, the political fight over Mr. Trump’s national emergency declaration shifts to the courts, where a number of states and organizations have joined lawsuits challenging the legal merits of the order. Xavier Becerra, California’s attorney general, warned in a statement that the 20 states involved in legal action “are ready to fight long and hard to stop his fabricated emergency in its tracks.”The judicial machinations will most likely prevent the president and Pentagon officials from immediately tapping military funds for border wall construction, and the Defense Department has yet to prepare a final list of what projects could have funding delays. It is unclear when the list will be available.In the interim, the Pentagon has taken the first steps to begin diverting money from other Defense Department funds toward constructing fencing at the border. On Monday, Patrick M. Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, authorized the transfer of up to $1 billion from military personnel funding toward the construction of 57 miles of border fencing, improving roads and adding lighting in Yuma, Ariz., and El Paso, according to a letter sent to the Department of Homeland Security.Military officials have said that they do not need congressional approval for such an action. But across Capitol Hill on Tuesday, lawmakers pressed Pentagon officials about the potential effect on military construction and the merits of a wall at the southwestern border.“To look at the Pentagon as a piggy bank, slush fund, where you can grab money for something when you need it really undermines the credibility of the entire D.O.D. budget,” said Representative Adam Smith of Washington, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.At a hearing on Tuesday, Mr. Smith warned Mr. Shanahan and General Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that Congress would respond to the reallocation of funds without congressional approval by curtailing the privilege of such reallocations in the spending bills for the next fiscal year.Mr. Shanahan, testifying before the committee for the first time as acting head of the Defense Department, acknowledged the “complexities of the southwest border situation” and said officials understood “significant downsides of losing what amounts to a privilege.”“Those risks were weighed, and given the legal order from the commander-in-chief,” Mr. Shanahan said. “We are executing on that order.”In a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, also pressed Army officials on whether readiness and modernization should be prioritized over security at the southwestern border.“It is not for me to say one is more important than the other relative to the whole national security of the United States,” said Gen. Mark A. Milley, the Army chief of staff."

Here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed (and some links if you’d like to read further).___________________House and Senate negotiators agreed “in principle” on Monday to provide $1.375 billion for physical barriers at the southwestern border. The deal provided much less funding than the proposal President Trump rejected in December, and his border wall took a back seat in Congress’s budget negotiations, which instead focused on the record number of immigrants in detention. (Here are five takeaways from the deal.)Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he was “not happy” with the deal but that he didn’t think there would be another government shutdown. He sought to reassure supporters that he would not give up on his “build the wall” pledge, saying he had “options that most people don’t understand.”The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, persuaded Mr. Trump to agree to the bill, but it came at a price: The president would declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, he told the majority leader — and Mr. McConnell would have to back him.On Friday, the president declared a national emergency to access billions of dollars to build the wall, transforming a highly charged policy dispute into a fundamental confrontation over the separation of powers.Mr. Trump portrayed his announcement as a routine use of executive authority, but there is no precedent for what he has done.

43,"WASHINGTON — House lawmakers on Tuesday denounced Defense Department plans to use military funds to pay for President Donald Trump's border wall, telling Pentagon leaders the ""unbelievably irresponsible"" maneuver will threaten the agency's future ability to shift money around when needed.Both Republicans and Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee said there is little support for tapping military construction projects for the wall, about a week after Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan sent a list of vulnerable projects to Capitol Hill.""Whatever one feels about the border wall, to look at the Pentagon as sort of a piggybank - slash - slush fund, where you can simply go in and grab money for something when you need it, really undermines the credibility of the entire DoD budget,"" said Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., chairman of the panel. ""Funding a border wall out of the Department of Defense is also unbelievably irresponsible.""As the hearing continued, Smith sent a letter from the committee to the Pentagon denying the department's first formal request to shift about $1 billion in surplus personnel funds to a counter-drug account in order to pay for barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. The panel doesn't have the legal authority to block the transfer, but could make changes in the law to block any funding shifts in the future.""Historically they've asked for our signature to consent. This time they're not asking for our consent,"" said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. ""That kind of changes the working relationship and it's likely to change the next defense appropriations bill. I would be surprised if you didn't find language that spells out reprogramming in the future is going to be handled a lot differently.""The Pentagon said it was exploring the potential impact of that letter and what steps the department would take next.The House committee's top Republican, Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, also said he opposes using defense funding for other purposes. But he noted that Shanahan is facing ""a lot of criticism for decisions that you had nothing to do with.""In response, Shanahan said he knew that maneuvering around Congress to fund the wall was risky and would have long-term negative effects on the department. But he said the department was executing a ""legal order from the commander in chief.""The Pentagon last week sent to Capitol Hill a list of more than 400 military construction projects, totaling about $13 billion, that might be tapped for wall funding. But Shanahan has said that any money for military housing or barracks would not be touched, as well as any projects that will have contracts awarded before the end of this fiscal year, Sept. 30. When those projects are removed, about 150 remain, totaling about $4.3 billion.Shanahan has also said that projects deemed necessary for military readiness or other high priorities will be protected. But those haven't been identified yet.Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and David Norquist, the department's budget chief, were also at the Tuesday hearing.Both the House and Senate voted to overturn Trump's declaration of a national emergency to use construction money to fund the wall. Trump vetoed that bill.A number of lawmakers also objected to the Pentagon's assumption that Congress would simply refund the affected projects next year, calling it a political maneuver to get Congress to pay for the wall.Other lawmakers, such as the entire New Jersey congressional delegation, have written to Shanahan to defend the projects in their state. In their letter, they told Shanahan that they ""adamantly oppose"" diverting any money for a border barrier, adding that Congress, not the executive branch, has the power to appropriate funds for specific projects.A plan to spend $41 million at the Picatinny Arsenal's munitions disassembly complex in New Jersey is on the list of projects that could be affected.On Monday, Army Secretary Mark Esper told The Associated Press that he and other military service leaders will go through the list and work to protect critical projects.""I will prioritize based on readiness, lethality and things like that,"" he said, noting that something like a training complex could be protected if it's designed to help soldiers face emerging threats from competitors such as Russia and China.Esper added, however, that there are clearly some projects that could be used.""I can tell you what's not a priority. It's the parking garage, the cemetery,"" Esper said, referring to two projects planned at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in New York.The garage could be affected, but the cemetery money would not be touched because the contract award date is June, and would therefore be exempt under rules set up by Shanahan.___Associated Press writer Andrew Taylor contributed to this report."

47,"WASHINGTON — As new polls released on Wednesday showed that a majority of Americans had cooled to the idea of a protracted government shutdown over his long-promised border wall, President Trump woke up with the same two options facing him as the past 33 days: He could fight back or concede.Or maybe he could try rhyming?“BUILD A WALL & CRIME WILL FALL!” Mr. Trump wrote in his daily morning Twitter address. “This is the new theme, for two years until the Wall is finished (under construction now), of the Republican Party. Use it and pray!”Two minutes later, Mr. Trump tweeted the rhyme again for emphasis.Mr. Trump, a born marketing machine, brought to the White House a history of selling Americans everything from steaks to questionable real estate credentials to the catchphrase “You’re Fired!” And his red-and-white “Make America Great Again” hat is instantly associated with Mr. Trump, an accessory that, as Americans were reminded last weekend, draws controversy like a laser beam.When Mr. Trump fires off a tweet, the president gets visibly excited when he comes up with a message he believes will go over well with his base — he peers over his phone with a “watch this” expression, according to two people who have observed such a process.The wall rhyme appears to fit into that same bull’s-eye category. The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment about the origin of Mr. Trump’s latest catch phrase on Wednesday. But a senior aide to the president said that Mr. Trump came up with it himself, and credited the new slogan to his “marketing genius.”There are a few hitches: Mr. Trump’s rhyming sales pitch that a border wall will reduce crime is not credible, and the facts he uses to bolster his claims are often correctable.First, despite the president’s repeated claims, construction has not yet started on the border wall: The “under construction now” in his morning tweet needs more context. Customs and Border Protection has begun or completed several projects to replace old fencing with new barriers, but no additional miles of wall have been added yet. Construction to build a new levee wall system in Texas is scheduled to begin in February, the first extension of existing barriers.Second, Mr. Trump’s rhyme that a wall will lead to falling crime rates may be catchy, but it’s at odds with what data shows about the influence immigration has on crime.Law enforcement agencies rarely release crime data that includes immigration status, but several studies have found that immigration does not lead to an increase in crime. Others have shown that immigrants — including those who are undocumented — are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans.Also, a border wall would not suddenly alter the population of undocumented immigrants already in the country, as the president suggests; most of them are here because they overstayed temporary visas, not because they crossed the border illegally.The statistics Mr. Trump often uses to portray a criminal threat are also misleading. He has pointed to 17,000 criminals caught trying to cross the border, omitting the fact that a majority were stopped at legal ports of entry, not wall-less areas of the border. He has recounted that officials have made 260,000-some arrests of immigrants with criminal records in the last two years, though the charges included a range of crimes, many nonviolent like traffic violations or illegal entry.He has also issued baseless warnings of terrorists infiltrating the border, despite State Department and counterterrorism officials saying there is no credible threat.Mr. Trump, known to be more concerned with the broad contours of his messaging than the particulars, continued to push his new slogan on Wednesday, targeting a segment on MSNBC that showed immigrants slipping across the border into the United States from Mexico.“Even Trump Haters like (MS)NBC acknowledge you ‘BUILD A WALL & CRIME WILL FALL!’” Mr. Trump wrote, his delight undimmed by his new rhyme."

It’s neither as terrifying nor as trouble free as it’s portrayed.— MARC LACEY, National editorThere are no one-way signs at the border. Surging north are migrants, truck drivers, shoppers, smugglers and numerous others. Going the other way last week were two men in an old tan pickup truck.Following in a long tradition of Americans heading to Mexico in a hurry, the men, driving south out of Nogales, Ariz., made a swift and sudden run across the border. A Customs and Border Protection agent opened fire. The truck roared about 20 feet into Mexico and plowed into a concrete barrier.“He’s alive, he’s alive!” somebody screamed as Mexican police officers rushed forward.A few yards away, a tamale vendor named Francisco said he was pretty sure that the driver had tried to run over one of the agents. Then “they shot him in the head,” said Francisco, who is known by other vendors as “El Toro,” but declined to give his last name.The U.S. authorities did not give a detailed account of the shooting, but the Mexican police told the newspaper Nogales International that the driver had indeed been shot in the head.A mistaken step on the accelerator? Or a 21st-century outlaw, the latest in a long line of Americans who have found what seemed to be a good reason to head for Mexico?So far, the authorities aren’t saying. Customs and Border Protection agents said investigators with the agency’s Office of Professional Responsibility and others were examining the shooting, which left the 21-year-old driver, still officially unidentified, in critical condition. After being taken to a hospital in the Mexican town of Nogales, the agency said, he was transferred to a facility in Southern Arizona for advanced medical care. The passenger was released after questioning by the Mexican authorities.“No further details are expected to be immediately released,” C.B.P. said in a statement.We asked the nurses who the injured driver was and what happened to him. “No comment,” they said. We asked the local sheriff what he knew. “Nothing,” he replied.Like so much these days at the border, which is often seen as a bright line between Mexico and the United States, exactly what took place is blurry.— JOSE A.

Mr. Trump also visited the border in March 2018, when he inspected prototypes for a border wall in San Diego. In August 2017, he visited a border post in Yuma, Ariz.This year’s visits, coming amid a congressional showdown over the border wall, were meant to help the president shore up support for what he has called a “crisis” of illegal immigration. Both times — here in McAllen and here in El Paso — local residents complained that the president misstated the level of crime in their towns.This week, as the country inched closer to a Friday deadline to avert another government shutdown, congressional leaders announced a possible compromise to avoid it. On Thursday, the House and the Senate passed legislation to fund the government, and on Friday, the president announced he would declare a national emergency in order to build the wall.Here are five great ways to dive into the debate:• “In pursuit of a wall, President Trump ran into one.” This analysis of the expected deal lays out how the president came to accept a defeat, over the objections of some of his supporters.• There are nearly 2,000 miles of border between the United States and Mexico. Here’s a look at the barriers that already exist, including 700 miles of fencing built by the United States government since 2006.• Representative Will Hurd of Texas is the only Republican congressman who represents a border district.

49,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's first veto was more than a milestone. It signals a new era of ever perilous relations between the executive and legislative branches of government.Trump's agenda was stymied even before his party lost unified control of Washington at the start of the year and he has grown increasingly frustrated by his dealings with Congress, believing little of substance will get done by the end of his first term and feeling just as pessimistic about the second, according to White House aides, campaign staffers and outside allies.Republicans in Congress are demonstrating new willingness to part ways with the president. On the Senate vote Thursday rejecting the president's national emergency declaration to get border wall funding, 12 Republicans joined Democrats in voting against Trump.The 59-41 vote against Trump's declaration was just the latest blow as tensions flare on multiple fronts.Trump tweeted one word after the vote: ""VETO!"" And he eagerly flexed that muscle on Friday for the first time, hoping to demonstrate resolve on fulfilling his 2016 campaign pledge.GOP senators had repeatedly agitated for compromise deals that would give them political cover to support Trump despite their concerns that he was improperly circumventing Congress. But the president was never convinced that any of the proposals ensured the resolution would be defeated, said a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking.A last-ditch trip to the White House by a group of senators Wednesday night only irritated Trump, who felt they were offering little in the way of new solutions.As the vote neared, Trump repeatedly made clear that it was about party fealty and border security and suggested that voting against him could be perilous.""It's going to be a great election issue,"" he predicted.Looking past the veto, Trump's plans for future collaboration with Congress appear limited. With the exception of pushing for approval of his trade deal with Mexico and Canada, the president and his allies see little benefit for investing more political capital on Capitol Hill. Trump ran against Washington in 2016, and he is fully expected to do so again.Trump once declared that ""I alone can fix it."" But that was before getting hamstrung in Washington, and he is now exploring opportunities to pursue executive action to work around lawmakers, as he did with his emergency declaration on the border wall. He is directing aides to find other areas where he can act — or at least be perceived as acting — without Congress, including infrastructure and drug prices.Trump made his intentions clear recently as he assessed that Democrats would rather investigate him than cooperate on policy: ""Basically, they've started the campaign. So the campaign begins.""His dealings with Congress were inconsistent even when Republicans controlled both chambers, and he has made few overtures to Democrats since they won control of the House.Trump initially predicted he could work across the aisle, but that sentiment cooled after the bitter government shutdown fight and in the face of mounting investigations. His frustrations are evidence of the difficulty that the Washington neophyte and former business executive has had with the process of lawmaking, and the challenges yet to come.The White House argues there are still opportunities for collaboration, listing ratification of the Canada-Mexico trade pact as a priority. But passage is anything but assured.Trump's ire has been directed at both parties for some time, aides said. He was upset with the Republicans' performance during the recent congressional hearing featuring his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, telling allies that he was not impressed with their questioning.Trump's budget proposal this past week was viewed as a shot at Democrats, with its proposals to increase money for the border wall and cut to social safety net programs. The plan, which had little in the way of new or bipartisan ideas, was declared dead on arrival by Democratic House leaders.Further stoking tensions, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., invited NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg to address an upcoming joint meeting of Congress, in what was widely seen as a rebuke of Trump's criticism of the trans-Atlantic alliance. The invitation was backed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and followed votes earlier this year in which Republicans voiced opposition to Trump's plans to draw down U.S. troops in Syria and Afghanistan.Presidential complaints about Congress — and efforts to find a workaround — are nothing new.President Barack Obama in 2014 resorted to what became known as his ""pen and phone"" strategy.""I've got a pen to take executive actions where Congress won't, and I've got a telephone to rally folks around the country on this mission,"" he said.Obama's strategy yielded years of executive orders and regulatory action, but many proved ephemeral when Trump took office and started unwinding them."

52,"MEXICO CITY — A caravan of some 1,200 migrants from Central America and Cuba began moving towards the U.S. border from southern Mexico this weekend, migration authorities said on Sunday.The National Migration Institute said the migrants were already inside Mexico when they opted to form a caravan in the southern city of Tapachula on the border with Guatemala.Early on Saturday, the large group of people set off towards the town of Huixtla in the southern state of Chiapas, a route followed by previous groups heading north, the institute said.Caravans of migrants bound for the United States have sparked friction with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused Mexico of failing to contain illegal immigration and wants a border wall built to stop people crossing.The new government of leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pledged to curb the migrant flows by better regulating the movement of people, and by offering job opportunities and better pay for those willing to stay.The migration institute said the roughly 1,200 migrants were from Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Cuba.

54,"WASHINGTON — As President Donald Trump struggled with mounting Republican defections over his emergency declaration to pay for a border wall, his acting White House chief of staff wasn't on Capitol Hill cajoling former colleagues or in the West Wing making calls.Instead, Mick Mulvaney was in Las Vegas for an annual getaway with friends and family.It was a telling example of Mulvaney's laissez-faire approach as he settles into a role that has bedeviled those who came before him.His predecessor, retired four-star Gen. John Kelly, tried to micromanage Trump but ended up grating on the president and antagonizing outside allies. Mulvaney has made clear he believes his job is to manage the staff and not the president, according to current and former officials and people close to him. And he's OK with that.Mulvaney doesn't try to limit whom the president speaks with or curb access to the Oval Office. He just asks that those who talk to Trump fill him in on what was discussed to avoid surprises. While former staffers compare the current atmosphere in the West Wing to the early, chaotic days of the administration, when the Oval Office had the feel of Grand Central Station, Mulvaney understands that's how Trump likes it.The former South Carolina congressman has focused on and succeeded in improving staff morale in a building known for infighting and damaging leaks. Shortly after his arrival, Mulvaney organized a staff retreat at Camp David. He also has worked to build relationship on Capitol Hill, where he served for years. He schmoozed with lawmakers on the sidelines of the State of the Union speech and invited them to a Camp David retreat as well.It's an approach that some outside the building question.""The chief of staff has to be able to manage down as well as up,"" said Chris Whipple, author of ""The Gatekeepers: How the White House chiefs of staff define every presidency."" ''I don't think he's been empowered and I think that's a mistake.""Mulvaney's tenure has coincided with an especially tumultuous time in Washington, beginning with the fight over border wall money that caused the longest government shutdown in the nation's history.He was at the table in Vietnam for Trump's abruptly terminated summit with North Korea's leader and has watched as newly empowered House Democrats have launched investigations into Trump's dealings.Trump has been known to make remarks undercutting Mulvaney in front of him, giving some the impression that Trump already may be souring on his third chief of staff in as many years.But by all accounts, Mulvaney is a happy warrior who generally gets along well with the equally blunt president, is well liked by staff and brushes off slights. Though Trump gave Mulvaney the job on an ""acting"" basis last December, Trump doesn't appear likely to replace him anytime soon.Mulvaney has the added benefit of getting along well with Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, both senior advisers with enormous internal power. Mulvaney, who has personal experience working in a family business, understands their unique positions. He built relationships with both as Trump's budget director and has had dinner with their family.""He's trying to do the best he can with what he has to work with,"" said Leon Panetta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton who also served as budget director, defense secretary and CIA director.Like others interviewed, Panetta said it would be impossible to serve as a typical chief in Trump's White House. ""All you can do is be there, respond to the president when you can, try to maintain some semblance of order and try to keep things at least halfway on track and not collapsing into total chaos,"" Panetta said.Mulvaney, who technically also retains the title of budget director , remains engaged in policy and budget issues, which made his absence in recent days especially notable. He left on Wednesday afternoon as the White House was mounting a final effort to try to stop GOP senators from backing a resolution to block Trump's emergency order. Mulvaney was absent for Thursday's vote, when a dozen Republican senators joined Democrats in rebuking the president. And he was still gone Friday when Trump issued the first veto of his presidency, overruling the vote to terminate his declaration.The White House defended Mulvaney's decision to take the trip, which senior strategy adviser John Czwartacki said was part of a 25-year tradition.Mulvaney was to return to Washington on Saturday, in time to appear on the Sunday talk shows, and worked throughout his trip, talking to senators and at least a half-dozen staffers and receiving briefings on the shooting in New Zealand, Czwartacki said.Czwartacki also said the president was fine with Mulvaney's absence and that the chief of staff had a team in place empowered to operate without him.Indeed, in a quiet sign of his influence, Mulvaney has brought on a half-dozen new staffers, including communications aides.Panetta, however, said it was ""very unusual"" that Mulvaney hadn't played a more prominent role in this year's budget talks, saying he should have been ""the primary person trying to guide negotiations.""David B. Cohen, a political science professor at the University of Akron who is also writing a book on the chief of staff role, echoed that perception, saying previous chiefs, especially those with experience like Mulvaney's, ""were essentially handed the keys and told, 'Get this done.'""Mulvaney is ""good at television, he's good at communication. But I think at this point, he's little more than an administrative assistant for Trump,"" Cohen said.The White House pushed back on the idea that Mulvaney should have been charged with steering the border wall talks, saying it made sense for Vice President Mike Pence and the White House legislative affairs director to take the lead.Mulvaney appears happy to be promoting Trump's agenda, even when the president's policies stand in conflict with ideas that Mulvaney has long championed.In the months before he signed the emergency declaration, Trump argued to his staff that the situation at the border was a national security crisis and demanded to know why he, as president, couldn't stop what he deemed an ""invasion.""Other aides told Trump there was nothing he could do. But Mulvaney, a longtime fiscal hawk who had blasted former President Barack Obama for using executive action to dictate immigration policy, went back to his colleagues at the Office of Management and Budget and asked them to start identifying various sources of money the White House might be able to access without Congress' approval to start building the wall.___Associated Press writer Catherine Lucey contributed to this report."
55,"President Trump’s greatest hurdle in persuading Americans that there is a national security crisis on the southwest border may well be his own credibility.Mr. Trump is using a rare currency — a prime-time address to the nation — to make the case for a border wall with Mexico, an issue that has forced a partial shutdown of the federal government.His penchant for superlatives — “the best,” “the worst,” “never,” “always,” and now, “crisis” — and his record of falsehoods, misstatements and exaggerations on the topic will likely be challenged as never before.Here is what to watch for and some of the larger issues the president faces.Mr. Trump will deliver his speech at 9 p.m. Eastern Time. It will be aired by major broadcast and cable news networks and streamed live at www.nytimes.com.Mr. Trump could try to circumvent Congress by declaring a national emergency to order that the wall be built, but administration officials who had seen a draft copy of his speech said the president was not preparing to do so.This would be an extraordinary use of presidential authority. For example, President George W. Bush invoked emergency powers following the Sept. 11 attacks.The rationale for the emergency power is to give the president the capacity to act quickly to deal with matters like an urgent security threat.There are currently 31 national emergencies that are ongoing. The oldest dates back to 1979, when President Jimmy Carter invoked one to freeze Iranian government assets. The Trump administration has issued three emergency declarations so far, most recently in late November freezing the property of certain Nicaraguan officials.Saying a situation is a crisis does not make it so, but Mr. Trump and other senior administration officials have been using the word repeatedly in recent days. They point to a direct connection between the flow of drugs from Mexico and the opioid epidemic in the United States. They say that migrants, particularly women and children, are victims of crime as they journey to the United States. And Mr. Trump has also strongly suggested that terrorists may be slipping across the border.These threats are greatly exaggerated, if not fabricated. Migrant border crossings have been declining for nearly two decades. The majority of heroin enters the United States through legal ports of entry, not through open areas of the border. Immigrants are less likely to commit crimes in the United States than native-born Americans. The State Department said in a recent report that there is “no credible evidence” that terrorist groups had sent operatives to enter the United States through Mexico.Despite all of this, Mr. Trump could repeat some of these statistics, which other administration officials have cited misleadingly.Of the nearly “17,000 criminals” attempting to cross the border — a number used by officials recently — about 63 percent were stopped while attempting to enter legal ports of entry.Of the “10 individuals on the terrorist watch list” stopped daily by the Department of Homeland Security, most were attempting to enter by air travel. And the watch list itself includes people who are suspected of having ties to terrorism — not necessarily those convicted of terrorism crimes.And the more than 3,000 “special interest aliens” who have been stopped at the southwest border refers to people who come from countries that have exported terrorism or who exhibit travel patterns that indicate “a possible nexus to nefarious activity,” according to the Department of Homeland Security. A recent analysis from the libertarian Cato Institute found that of 45,000 “special interest aliens” caught at the border since 2007, none has committed terrorist attacks.So far, Democrats have been highly unified in their opposition to Mr. Trump’s wall proposal. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has called it immoral. Instead, Democrats have demanded that the president immediately end the shutdown and allow Congress to pass funding legislation to keep the government functioning. Only then will they allow a debate on border security.After television networks agreed to air the president’s speech, Ms. Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, demanded that their side be given time.To further dramatize his case for a border wall, Mr. Trump is set to head to Texas’ border with Mexico on Thursday.According to The Monitor of McAllen, Tex., the president’s trip would come about a month before border wall construction in the area would begin, relying on previously appropriated funding. The construction could affect several environmentally sensitive areas. Representative Vicente Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, told the newspaper that a border wall was not the answer.“I would remind the president that there are 7,500 open positions with Customs and Border Protection that have not been filled, and that this should be their top priority,” Mr. Gonzalez said in a statement Monday. “With updated resources, technology and more Border Patrol agents, Customs officers and agriculture inspectors, we can keep this nation prosperous and protect our citizens from those who wish to harm us,” he said.The crime rate in the city of McAllen has been generally in decline for nearly 30 years."

57,"President Trump reeled off a list of his favorite media personalities on Friday when asked who might have influenced his decision to declare a national emergency after Congress refused to give him money for a border wall.Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham — a powerful bloc of conservative voices who have railed against any budget compromise on wall funding — all received shout-outs in a Rose Garden news conference.“Sean Hannity has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do,” Mr. Trump said of the Fox News commentator.He praised Mr. Limbaugh for his ability to command an audience. “He can speak for three hours without a phone call,” Mr. Trump said. “Try doing that sometime. For three hours he speaks. He’s got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world. I mean, this guy is unbelievable.”The president added that none of the favorites he mentioned, most of whom work for Fox News, drove his decisions: “They don’t decide policy,” he said.The question that got Mr. Trump to discuss his cable and radio cheering squad came from the NBC News reporter Kelly O’Donnell. It seemed apt after what had occurred in December, when the presidency seemed perhaps more entwined than usual with prominent figures in conservative media.At the time, Mr. Trump appeared willing to sign a continuing resolution to prevent a government shutdown, even without money for the wall. Then a few of his most influential supporters, including Mr. Hannity and Mr. Limbaugh, lasered in on the lack of wall funding and pleaded with Mr. Trump to refuse to sign the bill. He did exactly that, leading to a 35-day shutdown, the longest in the government’s history.This week, as the deadline on the temporary spending measure that ended the shutdown loomed, the president was willing to go ahead with a newly proposed budget, even though it had less money for a border wall than was on the table at one point last year.In contrast to December, Mr. Trump reached out to a synod of conservative commentators in an effort to assuage their concerns.His administration talked with Mr. Hannity and Lou Dobbs, the Fox Business Network host. The purpose was to politick the right-wing media with the message that Mr. Trump deserved support for the new bill because he had forced concessions.He also would declare a national emergency as a way to get around Congress and provide dollars for the wall, a move conservatives championed.“We’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and we’re going to do it one way or the other,” Mr. Trump said in the Rose Garden. “It’s an invasion. We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country.”But not everyone in the right-wing punditocracy endorsed Mr. Trump. Ann Coulter, who was an early supporter of the president, has now become a thorn in his side.In December, she published a blistering column on her website calling Mr. Trump a “gigantic douchebag” for not having made headway on a border wall. This week, as many anticipated Mr. Trump’s willingness to approve the spending bill, she didn’t let up, saying on Twitter that the goal of the national emergency “is for Trump to scam the stupidest people in his base for 2 more years.”The president spoke of Ms. Coulter on Friday, but not in the most glowing terms.“I don’t know her,” the president said Friday. ""I haven’t spoken to her in way over a year. But the press loves saying ‘Ann Coulter.’”He continued: “I have nothing against her. In fact, I like her for one reason. When they asked her, right at the beginning, who is going to win the election? She said, ‘Donald Trump.’ And the two people that asked her that question smiled. They said, ‘You’re kidding, aren’t you?’ ‘Nope, Donald Trump.’ So I like her.”A few seconds later, he added, “But she’s off the reservation, but anybody who knows her understands that.”After the news conference, Ms. Coulter tweeted: “He seems to think ‘the reservation’ is HIM, not his campaign promises.”Three minutes later, she posted another, this time about the constitutional provision allowing for the removal of a president from office: “No. 1 trending topic on Twitter: 25th Amendment.”Mr. Trump also cued up one of his old anti-press hits during the news conference. When Jim Acosta, the CNN reporter whose White House credentials he suspended late last year, asked about “critics who say you’re creating a national emergency in order to get your wall,” the president was ready.“Your question is a very political question, because you have an agenda,” he said. “You’re CNN. You’re fake news.”"
58,"WASHINGTON — President Trump famously declared that in his administration the nation would become tired of all the winning. So on Friday he tried a little losing.After the longest government shutdown in history, Mr. Trump surrendered with nothing concrete (or steel) to show for the battle, taking essentially the same deal that was on the table in December that he originally rejected, touching off a 35-day impasse.With Senator Mitch McConnell on the telephone, rank-and-file Republicans in revolt and televisions in the White House showing air traffic slowing in the Northeast because of the shutdown, Mr. Trump bowed to the inevitable and agreed to reopen the government until Feb. 15 without the money for his border wall that he had demanded.For a president who believes in zero-sum politics and considers compromise a sign of weakness, it was a bruising setback, a retreat that underscored the limits of his ability to bull his way through the opposition in this new era of divided government. As it turned out, the art of the deal at this stage of Mr. Trump’s presidency requires a different approach and the question is whether he can adjust.“By any measure, it was an unequivocal loss,” said Patrick J. Griffin, who was the White House legislative director for President Bill Clinton during the government shutdowns of the 1990s. “No interpretation is needed. No wall and probably lost votes rather than gain or strengthen his base.”[Some conservatives accused President Trump of folding on a central promise.]The next three weeks will test whether Mr. Trump can rebound as he faces a new deadline to come up with an agreement. If he can find common ground with Democrats led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer while making progress on his wall, he may yet emerge from this searing ordeal claiming a political victory.If not, however, he may discover his disgruntled fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill less willing to go along with a renewed government shutdown, forcing him to decide whether to provoke a constitutional clash by declaring a national emergency to bypass Congress altogether and build the wall without legislative approval.White House officials argue that there are more moderate House Democrats who are willing to support a wall even though Ms. Pelosi has called the project “immoral” and opposed spending even a single dollar on it. In the days to come, they hope to either peel off those Democrats and force Ms. Pelosi to meet somewhere in the middle or to drive a wedge among Democrats highlighting their own divisions.“Moving forward for the next three weeks, have the Democrats boxed themselves into a corner with zero for wall funding that makes them look weak on border security?” asked Marc Short, who was Mr. Trump’s White House legislative director earlier in his presidency. “Will the White House be able to work around Pelosi to gain enough Democrat support for some wall funding?”After watching Ms. Pelosi this week disinvite Mr. Trump from delivering the State of the Union address while the government remained closed, Mr. McConnell concluded that she would never cave and decided to come off the sidelines to try to end the standoff. He scheduled votes for Thursday on two plans to end the stalemate, one on Mr. Trump’s terms and another Democratic version, mainly to demonstrate to the president that he did not have enough support to prevail.After both bills failed to muster the 60 votes required for passage on Thursday, Mr. Trump was fed up and ready to get it over with, according to advisers. He was eager to get the dispute resolved at least temporarily so he could deliver his State of the Union address. He told Vice President Mike Pence and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, to give him options.They came back with four ways to reopen the government: a three-week spending bill that included a prorated portion of money as a down payment on the border wall pending further negotiations; a “clean” short-term spending bill that included no such money; a clean short-term bill with a bipartisan House-Senate conference committee to negotiate border security; or a declaration of national emergency that Mr. Trump would use to move money on his own while resuming government operations for the rest of the fiscal year.Mr. McConnell met with Mr. Schumer and raised the idea of a down payment, but the Democrat rejected it. Mr. Schumer then suggested a short-term spending bill with a conference committee to negotiate. Mr. McConnell let the White House know that Mr. Schumer would sign onto that.As late as Friday morning, though, Mr. Trump appeared set to make an emergency declaration. But when he spoke with Mr. McConnell again, the senator and Mr. Kushner argued against it. Mr. Trump backed off and agreed to the short-term reopening without wall money, telling aides that he knew it would result in a bad news cycle for several days, but that it was the right thing to do and would eventually yield a long-term victory.His resolve to change the subject was fortified as he watched television on Friday morning to see his associate Roger J. Stone Jr. marched off to court by heavily armed F.B.I. agents arresting him in connection with the special counsel’s Russia investigation. The “icing on the cake,” as one official put it, were reports about air traffic out of La Guardia Airport in the president’s hometown and elsewhere in the region slowing because of the government shutdown.The president scheduled an announcement, and the scene in the Rose Garden was surreal. Cabinet officers and White House aides lined up and applauded when the president emerged from the Oval Office as if he were declaring victory in his confrontation with Democrats in Congress. And the president sounded as if he was doing just that, opening his remarks by saying that he was “very proud to announce today that we have reached a deal to end the shutdown.”Only there was no deal, just a retreat. The president who said he would never reopen the government unless he secured money for his border wall agreed to reopen the government without money for his border wall.Supporters of a wall were hardly fooled, excoriating Mr. Trump for giving in. “Good news for George Herbert Walker Bush: As of today, he is no longer the biggest wimp ever to serve as President of the United States,” Ann Coulter, the conservative commentator who prodded Mr. Trump to take a firmer stand in December, wrote on Twitter.Breitbart News, the conservative news site once run by Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s former senior adviser, made clear the disappointment among Mr. Trump’s base with its banner headline: “Government Open ... And Border. No Wall.” So did The Daily Caller, another leading voice on the right: “TRUMP CAVES.” And The Washington Examiner agreed: “Trump blinks.”Democrats were not exactly gracious in victory, barely containing their delight. “Hopefully, it means a lesson has been learned: Shutting down government over a policy difference is self-defeating,” tut-tutted Mr. Schumer. “It accomplishes nothing but pain and suffering for the country and the American people.”By late in the day, a defensive Mr. Trump was insisting it was not a defeat. “I wish people would read or listen to my words on the Border Wall,” he tweeted. “This was in no way a concession. It was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the Shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days, if no deal is done, it’s off to the races!”Until now, of course, he had expressed little if any concern for those hurt by the shutdown, insisting instead that many of the 800,000 who went without pay for five weeks were on his side and wanted him to stand strong. Whether this episode prompts Mr. Trump to change his approach to governing, it has altered the politics of shutdowns leaving federal workers caught in the middle.“The great irony is that the shutdown only proved the indispensable value of the very government Trump so often expresses such disdain for,” said Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House aide who is now the strategic adviser at the Progressive Policy Institute, a center-left research organization.Mr. Short, the former aide to Mr. Trump, said history had shown that government shutdowns could be hazardous to one’s political health. “Most people who have initiated shutdowns find it’s a hard negotiating position to be working from,” he said.As Mr. Trump has now discovered, whether he acknowledges it or not."
59,"(Reuters) - President Donald Trump will nominate a Washington attorney, Christopher Landau, to be the next United States Ambassador to Mexico, the White House Press Office said on Monday.The nomination comes at a time of strained relations between the neighbors amid trade disputes, Trump's complaints about undocumented immigrants crossing the border, and his efforts to build an extended border wall.Roberta Jacobson, the previous U.S. ambassador, stepped down in May, joining a list of senior U.S. State Department officials to resign during Trump's presidency.Landau, now a partner at the law firm of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, was a law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016, and then for Justice Clarence Thomas, both considered court conservatives.The White House described Landau as a constitutional and appellate attorney who has briefed and argued appeals before the Supreme Court, Federal courts of appeals, and State appellate courts.He previously headed the appellate litigation practice at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis LLP. In 2017, Landau served a three-year term as a member of the Judicial Conference Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules, the White House said.No formal diplomatic experience was mentioned in the White House statement, which said Landau is fluent in Spanish.Landau could not immediately be reached for comment.

60,"It’s been more than two weeks since the partial government shutdown took effect. On Tuesday, President Trump delivered a national address on immigration to make his case for a border wall again, but Democrats and a growing number of Republicans are ready to reopen the government. These three books offer perspective on the current shutdown: the inner workings of the government offices affected, the political precedent for the present bipartisanship and the debate over a border wall.THE FIFTH RISKBy Michael Lewis221 pages. W.W. Norton & Company. (2018)Lewis has a reputation for livening otherwise dry material, and according to our reviewer, “you’ll be turning the pages” of this story about government bureaucracy. The fifth risk in his title (after an attack by North Korea or war with Iran, for instance) is project management, or rather the mismanagement he details within the Trump administration. Key government positions remain unfilled, and others are occupied by nonexperts in their respective offices. “The Fifth Risk” provides insight into how government offices function, particularly under the current administration.THE RED AND THE BLUEThe 1990s and the Birth of Political TribalismBy Steve Kornacki497 pp. Ecco/HarperCollins Publishers. (2018)In this book, Kornacki argues that the political battles between President Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich, including a 21-day long government shutdown over budget disagreements, set the stage for the political divisions of today. “The early Clinton era is presented as a parade of confrontations — over welfare, balanced budgets, health care — that, for a time, emboldened Gingrich’s showdown wing of Republicanism,” wrote our reviewer. The government shutdown of 1995-96 is the longest on record, and this book explains the political tensions that caused it.WALLSA History of Civilization in Blood and BrickDavid Frye320 pp. Scribner. (2018)The idea of building walls to protect and separate societies is not new, and in this accessible history, Frye chronicles walls from ancient Greece to Berlin to China. He explains that early walls were built as protection from neighboring tribes, and how the walls in China assured traders safe passage. In addition to exploring walls’ role in the development of civilization, Frye also reckons with the psychological impact they can have on the migrants and refugees they keep out."
61,"LONDON — Two very different presidents, Donald J. Trump and Emmanuel Macron of France, are each pursuing a time-tested strategy for leaders trying to push through a major policy change: marshaling a sense of crisis.For Mr. Trump, claims of mayhem at the border, which far exceed the reality there, are meant to draw support for a border wall. For Mr. Macron, the very real threat of climate change is meant to compel economic policy shifts, including new taxes.Each is arguing that existential stakes demand drastic action, with Mr. Trump threatening to declare a national emergency, which would grant him extraordinary powers. And each is attempting to rally his country’s voters and policymakers around a common mission.But each faces disappointment. Mr. Trump, three weeks into a government shutdown, so far has neither sufficient public nor congressional support for a border wall. Mr. Macron’s agenda has been derailed by mass protests.Their setbacks illuminate when a sense of crisis does or doesn’t take hold — and when leaders can and can’t exploit that to get their way.Time and again, in democracies and nondemocracies around the world, voters and government officials have shown that they will support drastic actions, and defer more readily to their leaders, during crises.Power-hungry leaders have long exploited crises, real or engineered, to justify seizing control. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey used a failed coup against him, in 2016, to justify sweeping political purges.It is not always about grabbing power. Leaders often use crises to promote policies that they see as necessary but that voters might otherwise not support.“You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,” Rahm Emanuel, President Barack Obama’s chief of staff, said in 2008, referring to Mr. Obama’s proposals for stricter regulations in response to the financial crisis. “This crisis provides the opportunity for us,” he said, “to do things that you could not before.”There is, of course, no central authority or accepted checklist for determining when a crisis is real, and severe enough to merit drastic action. It’s a matter of subjective public perception. But there is growing research into what leads people to support drastic steps from their leaders.Take Mr. Trump’s push for a border wall. Whatever his intentions — to win the wall, to rally the base, to distract from setbacks or merely out of impulse — during his election campaign, and again during the midterm elections, he has hit squarely on two psychological triggers that can make people want a strong leader to take control.The first is a sense of demographic and cultural change, particularly when that change feels uncontrolled. Among some white Americans, the growing prominence of minority groups in politics and popular culture has created a sense of demographic threat, according to researchers, leading those voters to desire a strong leader who would impose control.Mr. Trump used warnings about unauthorized immigration to cultivate a sense of crisis — though unauthorized immigration has been declining for a decade (and the migrants traveling to make asylum applications are exercising a basic legal right) — that hit on those fears. And he used promises of a border wall to reassure frightened voters that he would protect them.The second trigger is fear of a specific kind of violence. People feel a sense of acute crisis if they believe that they may be attacked for their membership in a demographic group, such as race or religion, according to research by Daphna Canetti-Nisim, a University of Maryland political psychologist. They become more supportive of harsh policies to control outsiders, such as torture or extrajudicial detention, and more supportive of a strong leader who will go outside the law.Mr. Trump tapped into this as well, warning that Hispanic and Muslim migrants posed a grave danger, though the threat was almost entirely invented. In Britain, proponents of withdrawal from the European Union, or Brexit, followed a similar playbook.Meanwhile, Mr. Macron has struggled to find an audience for his warnings about climate change. That threat is perilously real. But it is also abstract and impersonal. It does not target individuals based on their identities or hit other triggers that make something feel like a crisis. So French voters, far from mobilizing behind Mr. Macron’s priorities, have protested against economic challenges that feel more immediate.Mr. Trump’s case for a border wall may have cultivated a sense of urgent crisis among his supporters, helping his unlikely presidential bid succeed. But there was another audience he never quite captured: the policymaking and government elites who control the levers of power.In a strong democracy, leaders need both voters and elites to radically change the national agenda. The Sept. 11 attacks, for instance, created a sense of crisis among regular Americans as well as policymakers in both parties, allowing President George W. Bush to make sweeping changes in domestic and foreign policy.But elites and voters perceive crises very differently. Mr. Trump has yet to win enough support from congressional Republicans, much less from within the policymaking bureaucracy, to build his wall. Elites who otherwise supported the president were not as moved by his tales of dangerous foreigners.Typically, when voters see something as a crisis but elites do not, the result is gridlock, as Mr. Trump found with plans for his wall. In weaker democracies, this sometimes tempts leaders to push elites and institutions like the courts aside, denouncing them as hurdles to popular will. It's why dictators love crises, the democracy scholars Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt have written, as an excuse to grab power — often to cheers from their supporters.Sometimes leaders face the inverse problem, particularly with slow-moving crises like climate change that might worry elites more than voters.Mr. Obama was able to rally international leaders behind a global climate agreement in 2015 — no small task — but struggled to pass legislation on the issue at home. Mr. Macron, likewise, has had more success with fellow European leaders than with his own voters.Convincing voters to trust elites on what constitutes a crisis has not always been a such a challenge. Voters once tended to defer on complicated policy issues to trusted leaders or their preferred political party, according to research by Elizabeth N. Saunders of Georgetown University.During the Cold War, for instance, governing elites in Western Europe considered the threat from the Soviet Union a major crisis, pushing through sweeping changes to military and foreign policy. European voters were more concerned with day-to-day economic issues, generally leaving their leaders to conduct foreign policy as they wished.But, in recent years, public trust in establishment elites has broken down across the West. Voters are more skeptical of the elite’s priorities.Some in France, not totally without reason, see Mr. Macron’s climate change agenda as a smoke screen for plans to shred the social safety net. In Britain, many voters shrugged off elites who told them that Brexit would bring disaster. And in the United States, some Republican voters came to believe that their party’s establishment was selling them out.That widening mismatch in priorities between elites and voters has provided an opening for populist leaders. By telling voters that elites are ignoring the real crisis, populists can portray the establishment as part of the threat, justifying drastic action like Mr. Trump’s threatened declaration of emergency.These breakdowns can bring their own sorts of crises — real ones.In France, weeks of violent protests by the Yellow Vest movement have brought political uncertainty.And in the United States, many migrants and refugees are trapped in detention facilities or at the border. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are going without paychecks.For the families broken apart or going without pay, there is little doubt that this is a crisis. But as long as many Americans and their leaders do not consider it an emergency, little appears likely to change."
62,"Some of the most prominent voices in the conservative base were furious at President Trump on Friday after he agreed to reopen the government without getting money for a border wall — the sort of terms he had spent more than a month rejecting. They derided the deal as a capitulation by a leader who they had trusted to stand firm.Among those leading the charge was the conservative author Ann Coulter, one of Mr. Trump’s earliest and firmest supporters. She told The Times columnist Frank Bruni last year that “implementing the principles of ‘The Communist Manifesto’” would be less of a betrayal by Mr. Trump than retreating on the wall, one of his central campaign promises. Some on the right picked up on that theme of betrayal on Friday.Much of the criticism centered on toughness and steadiness, two qualities that Mr. Trump has long bragged about having. “Weak,” “wimp,” “beta” — these insults were hurled at the president from the right on Friday.Peter Wehner, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center who worked for Presidents Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George W.

No, he said, Mr. Trump didn’t get any money for the wall in this deal — “but he’s going to.”"
63,"Some of the most prominent voices in the conservative base were furious at President Trump on Friday after he agreed to reopen the government without getting money for a border wall — the sort of terms he had spent more than a month rejecting. They derided the deal as a capitulation by a leader who they had trusted to stand firm.Among those leading the charge was the conservative author Ann Coulter, one of Mr. Trump’s earliest and firmest supporters. She told The Times columnist Frank Bruni last year that “implementing the principles of ‘The Communist Manifesto’” would be less of a betrayal by Mr. Trump than retreating on the wall, one of his central campaign promises. Some on the right picked up on that theme of betrayal on Friday.Much of the criticism centered on toughness and steadiness, two qualities that Mr. Trump has long bragged about having. “Weak,” “wimp,” “beta” — these insults were hurled at the president from the right on Friday.Peter Wehner, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center who worked for Presidents Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush, wrote that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had “exposed” Mr. Trump “as pitifully weak, all bluster, a pathetic negotiator,” and that his backing down would undoubtedly hurt the president with his base.

64,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Monday that he has rejected a proposal by Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina to temporarily reopen the government in an effort to jump-start talks with Democratic lawmakers on funding a border wall.“I did reject it,” Mr. Trump said of the proposal, speaking to reporters as he boarded Marine One outside of the White House, en route to delivering a speech to a farm convention in New Orleans.In an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Mr. Graham, a close ally of the president, pitched Mr. Trump on a plan for the president to agree to a vote by Congress to reopen the government for about three weeks “before he pulls the plug on the legislative option.” If there was no progress made during that time, Mr. Graham said, the president could then declare a national emergency as a way to obtain funding for a border wall without congressional action.But Mr. Trump said that he did not want to extend the impasse over funding for the wall. It was not clear, however, what Mr. Trump saw as an alternative. “I’m not looking to call a national emergency,” he said on Monday. “This is so simple you shouldn’t have to.”Mr. Trump, advisers said, has refused to allow his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, or anyone else negotiating on his behalf to compromise on his demand for $5.7 billion in border wall funding. That has led to awkward moments in front of congressional leaders.In a meeting at the White House with lawmakers from both parties on Jan. 4, Mr. Trump castigated Mr. Mulvaney for proposing a compromise figure between Mr. Trump’s desired $5.7 billion for a wall and the Democrats’ offer of $1.3 billion for border security, as a way to end the shutdown.Using an expletive, the president blamed his acting chief of staff for messing up the negotiations. The salty exchange was first reported by Axios.Mr. Trump emerged on the South Lawn on Monday after spending a snowy weekend without leaving the White House grounds. It was a rare occurrence for a president who typically spends weekend afternoons during winter on his golf course in Palm Beach.But Mr. Trump’s physical presence in the capital has become one of the ways he has tried to demonstrate his willingness to negotiate with Democrats on funding the wall, even as he has staked out an intractable position on the issue. It is a point of pride he has highlighted on Twitter and in interviews, as he has become concerned about the perception that he is being outmaneuvered by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a veteran negotiator who even Mr. Trump has praised in the past.“I haven’t left the White House in months,” Mr. Trump told Jeanine Pirro, the Fox News host who is also a personal friend of the president’s, in a phone-in interview on her show Saturday night. In fact, Mr. Trump traveled to the Texas border earlier in the week.On Monday, Mr. Trump again highlighted his physical presence in Washington as a selling point. “I’ve been here all weekend,” Mr. Trump said. “A lot of the Democrats were in Puerto Rico celebrating something. I don’t know, maybe they’re celebrating the shutdown.”While about 30 Democratic lawmakers, most of whom are members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, spent the weekend at an annual winter retreat in Puerto Rico, Ms. Pelosi spent the entire weekend in Washington, a spokesman said.Mr. Trump, advisers said, still believes he has the upper hand with Democrats. But people in the White House have become increasingly concerned as the shutdown drags on and public opinion polls have shown that the majority of the country pins the blame on Mr. Trump.About 53 percent of Americans see Mr. Trump and the Republicans as mainly at fault for the shutdown, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted between Jan. 8 and 11. Only 29 percent blamed Democrats in Congress for the partial government shutdown that has left 800,000 federal employees working without pay, or furloughed.Adding to Mr. Trump’s rigidity in the shutdown negotiations is the anticipation among White House officials that a report from the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, could be delivered to the Justice Department in the coming weeks. Mr. Trump is agitated by the prospect of Mr. Mueller’s report, according to people who have spoken with him, even as advisers have tried to downplay what might be in it."
65,"WASHINGTON — It was a festive but awkward opening of the new Congress.Newly sworn-in members celebrated their electoral success surrounded by family, Democrats cheered their returned speaker and Republicans applauded their expanded majority in the Senate.But a substantial portion of the government that they oversee was closed, and the 800,000 federal workers who are not being paid lingered over the festivities on Thursday, an unfortunate circumstance that dampened the usual pomp. Adding to the tension was deep uncertainty about how to resolve the partial government shutdown that bridged the departing 115th Congress and the incoming 116th.The two parties seemed dug in, suggesting the shutdown would continue, a possibility that was underscored on Friday by President Trump’s warning to congressional leaders that it could last months, even years, if Democrats did not capitulate and provide money for a border wall.“Each side is testing the other’s resolve at this point,” said Tom Davis, the former House Republican leader from Virginia who came to the Capitol to observe the start of the new Congress. “There are no guardrails.”Previously, such guardrails included a desire by both parties to not be seen as irresponsibly shuttering government agencies that provide needed services to their constituents. Or to not be viewed as so incapable of governing that they allow partisan, philosophical and funding differences to leave hundreds of thousands of government employees without paychecks.“I think we should be blunt about this — there is never an excuse for a shutdown of the government,” said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee. “There is never an excuse even for a partial shutdown of the government.”But part of the government was definitely shut down, and the impasse seemed different from the partisan funding fights of the Clinton and Obama eras. Both sides claimed to want to end the stalemate, but there were no signs of frantic talks about trying to find a resolution and reopen agencies as quickly as possible. Democrats and Republicans traded not proposals and counterproposals, but instead lodged accusations about who was responsible and recriminations over competing legislative approaches.After seizing power and restoring Nancy Pelosi to the speakership after eight years in the minority, House Democrats approved measures to reopen the government without the $5 billion in border wall funding demanded by Mr. Trump — the sticking point in the entire exercise.But Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, had already declared that he would not put any measure before the Senate unless Mr. Trump had agreed to sign it. The president was definitely not signing the House measure — at least at this point — and actually threatened to veto it.Mr. McConnell was moving very cautiously. Before the holiday break, he had pushed through the Senate with no objection a resolution to extend funding for all federal agencies into February, only to see it quickly torpedoed by Mr. Trump and House conservatives. It was an embarrassing outcome for the Senate leader, and Mr. McConnell was in no rush to make that mistake again, preferring instead to wait for a White House plan to end the shutdown.On the other side of the aisle, Democrats would typically be furiously trying to find a way to get the government back online. Early last year, Senate Democrats relented just a few days into a shutdown and capitulated on an immigration issue to reopen the government. This time, Democrats believe Mr. Trump has boxed himself in with his demand for money for a wall that they consider ill advised and publicly unpopular. They are not about to help him out of his predicament.“President Trump is holding the government hostage over his wall, using the well-being of millions of Americans as hostage in a futile attempt to get what he wants: a concrete border wall,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.Democrats, looking at a much more favorable Senate map in 2020 compared with a difficult 2018, do not see much political risk in standing firm against Mr. Trump. In fact, at this point, they see picking a fight with the president as politically advantageous.They view the shutdown as damaging to Republican senators who could face difficult re-election challenges in 2020, including Cory Gardner of Colorado, who has broken with his colleagues and called for reopening the government without border wall funding.Mr. Trump and his allies, on the other hand, see the fight as critical to his political standing. Facing an emboldened and empowered Democratic House, the president intends to keep his conservative base firmly in his corner, and standing up for his long-promised wall is one way to do so. Early signs last month that he would relent on the wall money drew a quick rebuke from the right.It is a recipe for a prolonged impasse.Other factors are also at work in keeping the government shut down. The first two and a half weeks of the interruption have occurred during the holidays, when many workers are off and the demand for government help is not as great.Some of the most vital government services — the military, veterans affairs and health and education programs — were funded in separate spending measures that already passed and were signed into law, limiting the scope of the shutdown.And most government workers have not yet begun missing paychecks.As the shutdown persists, though, pressure will mount on Congress and the White House to find a resolution. Already, there are calls from Democrats and a few Republicans to pass a package of bills that would fund the rest of the government with the exception of the Department of Homeland Security, which is the agency caught up in the wall funding dispute.There are also a few ideas circulating to draft a compromise that would exchange wall funding for Democratic priorities such as making permanent a program for undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country as children.While it remains unclear just how the standoff will be resolved, lawmakers in both parties say they will ultimately have to put aside their differences and find a solution.“People have to be able to pull back from this,” said Representative Mike Simpson, Republican of Idaho and a veteran member of the Appropriations Committee. “Sure, we are Republicans and Democrats, but at some point we are the Congress.”At this point, however, it is a new Congress caught up in old divisions between lawmakers and the president, conflicts that suggest a difficult and contentious two years ahead."
66,"WASHINGTON — As a partial government shutdown entered its third week, negotiations between Vice President Mike Pence and congressional aides from both parties yielded little progress on Saturday while the impact on government services and on federal workers was worsening by the day.“Not much headway made today,” President Trump conceded on Twitter, not long after the vice president’s office characterized the roughly two-hour talks, held next to the White House at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, as “productive.”The two sides are scheduled to meet again Sunday afternoon, but there was little hope that the broad divide between Mr. Trump and Democrats over his demand for more than $5 billion for a border wall would be bridged anytime soon. Saturday’s talks came a day after Mr. Trump said the government shutdown could continue for “months or even years” if Democrats did not relent on their steadfast refusal to grant him the wall money.The negotiations on Saturday focused on priorities for security rather than a dollar figure for the border wall, the vice president’s office said. While Mr. Trump has stood by his $5.7 billion demand, Senate Democrats have offered $1.3 billion for border security, including fencing, while Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, have repeatedly said that they will not agree to any wall funding. Ms. Pelosi has called a border wall an “immorality.”The vice president’s office said that Mr. Pence had reiterated the president’s position that any deal needed to include funding for the wall. The office also said that Democrats had requested additional information from the Department of Homeland Security about its needs to deal with border issues.Democratic staff members asked for a formal budget justification for the administration’s insistence on its $5.7 billion proposal, a Democratic official familiar with the discussion said, adding that Mr. Pence made clear that the White House would not budge from that figure. The Democrats told the vice president that there would be no movement on the dollar figure until after the government is reopened.It is unclear just what kind of authority Mr. Trump has granted Mr. Pence to speak for him in negotiations. Last month, when Mr. Pence made a $2.6 billion counteroffer to Democrats in an effort to avert the shutdown, Mr. Trump quickly shot down the proposal.During the talks on Saturday, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, offered a briefing on what the administration has deemed a “crisis” at the border. Ms. Nielsen had tried to give a similar briefing earlier in the week to congressional leaders and White House officials gathered in the Situation Room, but she was cut off by Ms. Pelosi, who questioned Ms. Nielsen’s facts.In addition to Ms. Nielsen, the vice president was joined on Saturday by Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, and Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Kushner is said to have raised the prospect with Democratic lawmakers that if they give the president the full $5.7 billion in wall funding or something close to it, they might in exchange get an agreement for new protections for the young immigrants known as Dreamers. The prospect of such a deal has alarmed some conservatives.For his part, the president seemed to be goading Democrats with a morning tweet that implied that he was ready to talk with them at the White House, even though it was Mr. Trump who had announced on Friday that the meeting would be at the staff level.The president also repeated his claim that the bulk of federal workers who are going without pay are Democrats — a claim rebuffed by federal union leaders — but said their political affiliation was not relevant to him. On Friday, he had said that most federal workers supported his demand for a border wall and were willing to sacrifice their paychecks to achieve it.As the shutdown reached its 14th day, the finances of government agencies continued to show signs of strain. On Saturday, Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said the agency had about one month’s funding left for some of its activities.There have also been a few new signs of fraying political fealty to the president among Republicans. On Friday, Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, became the third member of his party in the Senate to call for an end to the shutdown, joining Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado and Senator Susan Collins of Maine. All three are expected to face difficult re-election battles in 2020.In an op-ed article for the newspaper The Hill published Friday evening, Mr. Tillis encouraged Congress to strike a deal that would provide “long-term certainty to the DACA population” — the Dreamers brought to the United States as children — and “force out the extreme elements on either side of the aisle.”“When it comes to securing our borders, it’s important to note that the real solution is not going to be a big, literal physical wall, but rather an all-the-above, all-hands-on-deck approach,” he wrote, adding his support for solutions including “physical barriers and steel fences.”The op-ed came just a day after the campaign arm of the Senate Democrats released statements to local news media targeting Republican senators up for re-election.In a move to keep pressure on the president and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, Ms. Pelosi announced Saturday afternoon that House Democrats would begin passing individual appropriations bills next week to reopen all government agencies, beginning with legislation that would reopen the Internal Revenue Service.“This action is necessary so that the American people can receive their tax refunds on schedule,” Ms. Pelosi said in a statement. “The certainty of the tax returns of hard-working families should no longer be held hostage to the president.”Mr. McConnell has largely stayed on the sidelines in the shutdown fight, saying that any solution must be reached between Mr. Trump and Democrats. In an opinion column on Friday, The Courier-Journal of Louisville, the largest newspaper in Mr. McConnell’s home state, called on him to “get into the game” and end “a crisis that really doesn’t need to be happening.”"
67,"Before reading the article: Watch the video “Trump Says He ‘Didn’t Need to’ Declare an Emergency” (above). How does President Trump characterize other emergency declarations by previous presidents? How does he compare and contrast those instances with his declaration on Feb. 15 regarding the wall he wants built on the United States border with Mexico?What reasons does Mr. Trump give for declaring this emergency? What steps does he say will be taken so that the cost of the wall will be funded? Why does he bring up the 2020 presidential election?In Mr. Trump’s remarks, he predicts that the process for gaining the funding for the wall will be similar to what happened in June 2018 when the Supreme Court upheld his executive order to ban travel from several predominantly Muslim countries.Do you think his prediction will be correct? Why or why not?Now, read the article, “Trump Declares a National Emergency, and Provokes a Constitutional Clash,” and answer the following questions: 1. Why did President Trump opt to bypass Congress in declaring the emergency?2. How did the House Judiciary Committee respond? What about House Democrats? If both houses of Congress vote in favor of blocking the emergency claim, what could President Trump then do?3. How much money is Mr. Trump looking to secure for the wall? From what budgets might this money come?4. A related interactive states, “President Trump’s plan to divert military construction money to fund a border wall is an unusual use of emergency powers.” How does the interactive give evidence to this claim? What category do most of the previous declarations of emergency have? When was the last time a president declared military action?5. What did the spending package passed on Feb. 14 by Congress include funding for? What funding requested by the president did it not include? Why did Mr. Trump sign the package into law even though it did not include what he wanted? What did he want to avoid happening again?Finally, tell us more about what you think:In the related article, “In Wielding Emergency Powers, Trump Paves a Dangerous Path Forward,” Carl Hulse writes:Do you think President Trump’s emergency declaration designed to secure funding for a wall at the southern border of the United States sets a “dangerous” precedent in regard to the balance of power that exists between the branches of the federal government?

69,"WASHINGTON — Time and again — when President Trump stood by Saudi Arabia after the killing of a Virginia-based journalist, when it looked as if he might intervene in the special counsel’s Russia investigation and when he threatened to declare a national emergency to pay for his border wall — lawmakers on Capitol Hill warned him not to push them too far.This week, in a remarkable series of bipartisan rebukes to the president, Congress pushed back.On Wednesday, with seven Republicans breaking ranks, the Senate joined the Democrat-led House in voting to end American military aid to Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen in protest over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post. On Thursday morning, the House voted unanimously on a nonbinding resolution to make public the findings of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.And on Thursday afternoon, 12 Republican senators abandoned the president to pass legislation, already adopted by the House, that would block Mr. Trump from declaring a national emergency to build his border wall — an act of defiance that he has vowed to overturn with the first veto of his presidency.“We’re saying today, ‘No, we do not acquiesce to this,’” Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said after voting to block the emergency declaration. “We do not agree that the president should be able to come in and go against the express intention of the Congress when it comes to these appropriated funds” for his wall.The series of votes vividly demonstrated a newfound willingness to stand up to the president among some of his Republican allies on Capitol Hill. And they underscored a deep frustration in Congress about the president’s supposed scorn for a coequal branch of government.“We have an issue that has been litigated and adjudicated through Congress. I mean, what was more litigated than this very question? We had a government shutdown for crying out loud,” said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, referring to funding for the border wall, which Mr. Trump is trying to secure with an emergency declaration that would circumvent Congress.“It’s about separation of powers,” Mr. Toomey said. “It’s about respecting the principles of the Constitution.”For some Republicans, particularly those who have typically voted in lock step with the president, the votes were a moment of soul searching during a harried week before recess, when most lawmakers were looking forward to getting out of town. The Yemen vote was an exceedingly rare invocation of the 1973 War Powers Act, passed after the Vietnam War to restrain the president’s authority to use military force.“We don’t often have great votes about great questions around here about separation of powers,” said Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, adding, “I don’t think you can overstate how important it is that for the first time in the history of the country, the full Congress voted to tell the president that we can’t be in a war.”Mr. Trump made it clear he would fight the bipartisan challenges to his authority.“He feels good,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, a close ally of Mr. Trump who talked to the president shortly after the vote. “He said, ‘My veto will be sustained?’ I said, ‘Yeah, overwhelmingly.’ He feels like his commitment to build the wall is moving forward.”But the rare coalition of Democrats and Republicans could bolster legal challenges to the emergency declaration that could tie up wall funding indefinitely. And the mere act of defying Mr. Trump foreshadows potential new difficulty for the president as he seeks to push his agenda through a Democrat-controlled House and a less pliant Republican-controlled Senate.“There are moments where you see a partisan rebuke” of the president by Congress, said William G. Howell, a political scientist at the University of Chicago and the author of “Power Without Persuasion: The Politics of Direct Presidential Action.” “They are really pretty infrequent, and when you do observe them it speaks to real tumult in the party.”Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said he hoped “the votes this week are green shoots: Republicans, out of courage, out of principle and maybe out of principle or maybe exasperation, are beginning to constrain the president when he goes too far.”Most Republicans cast their votes as a matter of conscience, and some Republicans who fashion themselves “constitutional conservatives,” such as Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, tied themselves in knots explaining how vexed they were to side with the president. Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, one of the first Republicans to declare his support for overturning the emergency declaration, faced a huge backlash from conservatives and flipped his vote at the last second.House Republicans, who joined Democrats in voting to call for Mr. Mueller’s report to be made public, insist there was no tumult.But Democrats saw it as an important declaration of principle. “Congress is finally asserting its authority under the Constitution — with enthusiasm,” said Representative Donna E. Shalala, Democrat of Florida, who spent eight years in the executive branch as health secretary to President Bill Clinton.The rejection of Mr. Trump’s national emergency declaration could also give ammunition to a half-dozen legal cases challenging the president’s exercise of that power under the 1976 National Emergencies Act, said Jack L. Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor who led the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel under President George W. Bush.“Some judges may count that as evidence of congressional intent,” Mr. Goldsmith said, though he added that he disagreed with that view.Dror Ladin, a staff lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, said Congress’s action would help convince federal judges that the president was acting illegally to fund his wall.“This vote reinforces that the president has no right to that money,” Mr. Ladin said.But as a political matter, Mr. Trump could use the congressional votes to his advantage on the 2020 campaign trail, portraying himself once again as the outsider candidate battling an unpopular Congress and the establishment in Washington.Congress has for decades been what Ross K. Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University, calls a “constitutional weakling” — excessively deferential to the president. But there have been moments in history where the legislative branch seeks to assert its power and relevance, particularly with respect to the military and foreign engagement.That happened in the 1970s with the passage of the War Powers Act, which gave Congress the ability to compel the removal of military forces absent a formal declaration of war. Congress exerted its authority in 1991 and again in 2002, when it authorized the president to use military force in the run-up to both wars in Iraq.In 2005, amid a public uproar over the torture of detainees, Congress tightened antitorture laws to ban the infliction of “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment” on prisoners — including those held overseas by the C.I.A. — over the objections of President Bush.Now the fight over wall funding may incite yet another round of congressional muscle-flexing. A number of Republicans are pushing legislation to claw back the powers that Congress gave the president in the National Emergencies Act, which Mr. Trump invoked to declare an emergency along the southwestern border.“The Senate’s waking up a little bit to our responsibilities,” said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee."
70,"Donald J. Trump’s highly personal management style as a businessman — impetuous, impolitic, sometimes immature — worked. At the very least, it wasn’t publicly discredited very often.Mr. Trump ran his own private company. It was small and largely hidden from the prying eyes of shareholders and government regulators. He was surrounded by longtime loyalists and family members. His main public exposure unfolded in staged settings, on softball talk shows or his own reality-TV show.Now President Trump is running a much larger enterprise. Two years into the Trump administration, it’s increasingly apparent that while the management traits he developed in the private sector may have propelled him into the White House, they’re not serving him well now that he’s there.As Doris Kearns Goodwin, the presidential historian and author of the recent book “Leadership: In Turbulent Times,” told me this week, Mr. Trump manifestly lacks a long list of traits associated with effective leadership: “humility, acknowledging errors, shouldering blame and learning from mistakes, empathy, resilience, collaboration, connecting with people and controlling unproductive emotions.”The last of these was on display this week, when Mr. Trump stormed out of a negotiating session with Democratic leaders and denounced the meeting in a tweet as “a total waste of time.”The consequences are also becoming apparent: With the government shut down over Mr. Trump’s demand for funding a border wall, the loss of a Republican majority in the House of Representatives and scant legislative achievements beyond the 2017 tax cut, his presidency is emerging as a case study in how not to govern.“With a modicum of management skill he could have gotten his wall, and he would probably be on the path to re-election,” said Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. “But he has very few accomplishments to his credit.”That’s not to say Mr. Trump hasn’t displayed some effective management techniques, albeit ones that are rarely discussed in America’s business schools.As Mr. Pfeffer told me this week, Mr. Trump exhibits several qualities that are prevalent among many leaders, including narcissism and dishonesty.“We claim we want nice people, but we don’t,” Mr. Pfeffer said. “Studies show that people want to associate with people who win.”“I’ve always won, and I’m going to continue to win,” Mr. Trump reportedly said in 2016.And Mr. Pfeffer noted that the “reality distortion field” that Mr. Trump deploys — ignoring the truth and creating an alternate set of facts — was once associated with the Apple founder Steve Jobs and remains prevalent in Silicon Valley and among entrepreneurial start-ups.Paul Glatzhofer, director of talent solutions at the consulting firm PSI International, agreed that Mr. Trump displayed some positive qualities of effective leadership, such as decisiveness, setting ambitious goals and self-confidence. “You may not like the idea of a wall, but it’s an ambitious goal,” Mr. Glatzhofer said.Nonetheless, he cautioned that the president’s other, negative traits could far outweigh any positives. “When we assess senior leadership, it doesn’t matter how many strengths they have if they also have these flaws that can derail their careers,” he said.Mr. Trump also gets credit for being himself, especially from passionate members of his base. “A quality he seems to have is that he doesn’t care what other people think,” Mr. Pfeffer said. “Not many of us are like that. But there’s a certain power in violating conventional norms.”These qualities helped Mr. Trump win in 2016, but they haven’t translated into effective governance, at least not yet. “People often equate the success of an individual with the success of an organization, but they’re not highly correlated,” Mr. Pfeffer said.Mr. Trump was able to assemble a relatively stable and loyal team of people who worked for him for years when he ran his private business. His failure to do so at the White House — save for a couple of survivors including Kellyanne Conway and family members like Jared Kushner — may be his most perplexing and conspicuous management failure.In the first year of Mr. Trump’s presidency, one-third of his top White House appointees left — unprecedented for the country’s chief executive. For the top dozen appointees, the rate was 50 percent. This past year with still more churn, the total turnover rate hit 83 percent, according to the Brookings Institution, which is tracking personnel moves at the White House. No other president has come close in his first two years.The only survivors among the top 12 White House appointees are Bill McGinley, a low-profile adviser and the cabinet secretary, and Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.“He’s an extreme case,” Mr. Pfeffer said. “He’s never really had to moderate his behavior or compromise or answer to a real boss. In the real world, you can’t just fire everybody.”Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, senior research fellow at Brookings and author of the staff turnover study, said, “The turmoil inhibits his ability to complete his campaign promises.”She added: “It creates an environment of anxiety and chaos. The stress and long hours are bad enough under normal circumstances.”And the unceremonious way in which Mr. Trump has pushed people out is likely to deter job candidates. Ms. Tenpas cited the failure to find a permanent successor to Mr. Kelly as chief of staff, a position “that in any other administration people would be jumping up and down for.”"
71,"WASHINGTON — Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, was confident in his ability as a good-faith negotiator who could find a compromise to end the government shutdown.His pitch to Democratic lawmakers was simple: He told them he was the person who could “land this plane.”Buoyed by his success in helping pass a criminal justice bill, Mr. Kushner, a senior White House adviser, agreed to take the lead when the president asked him to find a way to end the monthlong stalemate. He hoped his experience winning over Democrats skeptical of the Trump administration during negotiations for that measure would produce a similarly successful conclusion.But negotiating a broad immigration deal that would satisfy a president committed to a border wall as well as Democrats who have cast it as immoral proved to be more like Mr. Kushner’s elusive goal of solving Middle East peace than passing a criminal justice overhaul that already had bipartisan support.For one, Mr. Kushner inaccurately believed that moderate rank-and-file Democrats were open to a compromise and had no issue funding a wall as part of a broader deal.“If Jared Kushner thinks there is any daylight between House Democratic leadership and rank-and-file members on this issue, then the extent that he lands this plane it will land in the Alamo,” said Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York.And Democratic leaders like Senator Chuck Schumer, party officials said, did not believe that Mr. Kushner had the power to circumvent Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser to the president. In meetings, they also noticed, Mr. Kushner appeared to prop up Mr. Miller as an expert on immigration, noting that Mr. Miller’s reputation as a hard-liner was out of sync with his reasonable nature.On Friday, President Trump did what Mr. Kushner had privately insisted was not an option on the table: He folded.Standing in the Rose Garden, Mr. Trump announced he was ending the standoff, during which he had failed to convince Democrats to fund a $5.7 billion border wall, and was reopening the federal government for three weeks.It was a stunning setback for the president and for Mr. Kushner, who had told colleagues that public opinion would move to their side and that Speaker Nancy Pelosi would emerge as the one who looked unreasonable and intransigent.Mr. Kushner had advised the president against declaring a national emergency, which would enable him to get funding for his wall without approval from Congress. Instead, he ultimately pushed Mr. Trump toward the announcement he made on Friday, supporting it as a way to buy more time to reach a deal.Mr. Trump, White House aides said, has been frustrated at everyone around him for not delivering a deal he can accept. And he has become wary of his son-in-law’s advice on this issue, the aides said.This account is based on interviews with more than a dozen congressional officials, White House aides and people involved in the immigration debate.On Capitol Hill, aides said, Mr. Kushner had positioned himself as the person who could sell the president on a compromise, casting himself as a facilitator who did not lobby for details of any proposal but simply wanted to find a solution that both sides could claim as a victory.Mr. Kushner has told Mr. Trump that he should spend the next three weeks trying to achieve a broader immigration package. That challenge has eluded both parties for years, but Mr. Kushner has suggested to colleagues that it is worth trying for, according to West Wing aides.The president appears to have internalized the advice. “21 days goes very quickly,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday morning. “Negotiations with Democrats will start immediately. Will not be easy to make a deal, both parties very dug in. The case for National Security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the Border & through dialogue. We will build the Wall!”But Democrats said they do not believe that Mr. Kushner will have better luck drafting a larger deal in the next few weeks. “Unless he’s able to convince his father-in-law to abandon his obsession with building a medieval border wall, then he’s not going to be successful in finding a bipartisan agreement,” Mr. Jeffries said.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, however, noted that Mr. Kushner was still seen internally as one of the administration’s most successful negotiators, pointing to his involvement with the criminal justice bill as well as the new North American trade deal. “Jared is a key player in the administration and will continue helping the president accomplish his top priorities,” she said in an email.But for now, Mr. Kushner appears to have few allies, occupying what people close to him describe as a no-win position.Mr. Kushner finds himself with little sway over Democrats, who consider the substantial changes that the White House keeps proposing for asylum seekers to be poison pills. And conservatives are not convinced Mr. Kushner is the right person to negotiate a deal. They recognize he has Mr. Trump’s ear, but worry he does not understand the fault lines of the debate or what proposals will anger Mr. Trump’s base. One proposal that was reviewed, which would give green cards to 700,000 undocumented young immigrants, enraged conservatives.Within the White House, several aides said, Mr. Kushner is not interested in opinions that vary from his, and tends to view people who disagree with him as problems, closing them out of discussions. People close to Mr. Kushner, however, speaking on the condition of anonymity, have described him as working well with West Wing colleagues, particularly the legislative affairs director, Shahira Knight, a veteran of Capitol Hill.But even Mr. Kushner’s allies concede that when it comes to immigration, he has not grasped the emotional nature of the fight the way he did when he tackled the criminal justice overhaul, an issue that was personal because of his father’s own incarceration.Mr. Kushner, allies said, sees the $5.7 billion request for border wall money as reasonable, and has compared it to one month of troop deployments in Afghanistan. He views Ms. Pelosi as “trophy hunting,” or trying to take down the president politically with the shutdown.Allies of Mr. Kushner say that not all of his discussions with Democrats have been publicized, and that he has gained trust partly because he keeps his conversations confidential. But on Capitol Hill, many Democrats said discussions on immigration have been scarce.Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, was given no notice about Mr. Trump’s announcement last weekend in which he offered temporary protections for young undocumented immigrants in exchange for wall money, according to a congressional aide. Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, heard from Mr. Kushner only once, when he phoned before the president’s prime-time address from the Oval Office to warn him that the moment would move public opinion to the president’s side. Mr. Jeffries, who worked closely with Mr. Kushner on criminal justice reform, had no conversations about forging a bipartisan immigration bill.Some Democrats, however, gave Mr. Kushner credit for at least trying to keep a dialogue going, even if it did not result in a compromise.“We disagreed on the issue, but talking is essential in a divided government, especially if we want to solve any problems,” said Representative Josh Gottheimer, Democrat of New Jersey."
72,"If you had the word “crisis” in your presidential address drinking game, my sympathies.In President Trump’s first televised address from the Oval Office, and the rebuttal from Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Charles Schumer, there was a lot of crisis talk: “Crisis of the heart,” “Manufacturing a crisis.” The president cast the crisis as a dire, dangerous wave of immigration coming across the Mexican border. For the Democrats, the crisis was the extended government shutdown, precipitated by Mr. Trump’s insistence on funding for his promised border wall.What there was not, after two days of media drama, was a convincing argument for why this needed to be a prime-time event at all. There was no news. There was no new argument. There was just a wall of sound, and the American viewing audience paid for it.Nor was there much compelling television, unless you’re an avid maker of internet memes. This was not a friendly setting for either party.The Oval Office, which can confer gravitas on a typical president, simply saps this atypical one. Mr. Trump comes alive playing off a crowd, like the ones he drove wild with promises that Mexico would pay for the wall. Plopped behind a desk, sniffling, reading sleepily from a teleprompter, he was a comedian playing an empty room.Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer, meanwhile, shared a lectern in a hallway, side by side, one glaring as the other spoke, looking unfortunately like a cross between Grant Wood’s “American Gothic” and the twins from “The Shining.”There was a bit of new rhetoric from Mr. Trump (his prepared speech referenced morality, something he rarely does off the cuff), and a few sound bites from the opposition (“We don’t govern by temper tantrum,” Mr. Schumer said). But you heard nothing you couldn’t absorb from a few minutes surfing cable news, or political Twitter, any time of the day.So what did all this accomplish? Well, it got Mr. Trump on TV, his true home. After a run of headlines for the new Democratic House, it gained him two days of newscasts about him, him, him. Cable reporters gave hourly updates on whether the president might declare a national emergency. He became the protagonist again, the home audience hanging on for the dramatic reveal.The real crisis revelation, honestly, was a crisis of TV standards, which came long before the cameras started rolling. On Monday, the networks hemmed, wobbled, then decided to give Mr. Trump unfiltered access to their audience, on a topic on which he has a clear record of, well, “lies,” “falsehoods,” “misstatements” — I’ll leave it to you and your thesaurus.Whatever the semantics, the networks know they can’t trust Mr. Trump to tell the truth. They know this because he went on live TV twice last week — in a Cabinet meeting and in a long Rose Garden ramble — and said numerous things about this very topic that were demonstrably, empirically false.Assessing whether a source is credible isn’t bias. It’s not political. It’s journalism. In this case, the networks had more evidence than Charlie Brown did about Lucy and her football. (This comparison may be unfair to Charlie Brown, who did not act out of fear that the football would tweet mean things about him.)Instead, the broadcast networks carried Mr. Trump’s address live, and without the real-live, onscreen fact-checking that news outlets have experimented with in other speeches.ABC scrambled to cram in speed-talking fact-checks between speeches, its correspondents correcting information about the number of illegal border crossings, fact-checking Mr. Trump’s claim that Mexico would pay for the wall and noting that most heroin comes into the U.S. through legal border crossings. NBC and CBS focused more on the politics of the shutdown, going forward. (The cable networks, of course, had all night to debate and speculate.)CBS’s screen graphics were especially friendly to the president. The chyrons under its analysis read “President Trump: ‘The Border Wall Will Pay for Itself’” — with no assessment of the claim — “President Trump: Border Wall Is ‘Just Common Sense’” and “Pres. Trump: Securing Border a ‘Choice Between Right and Wrong.’” There were no captions quoting the Democratic rebuttal.Live airtime for Oval Office addresses isn’t an entitlement. The broadcast networks declined to air a 2014 speech by Barack Obama — on immigration! — on the grounds that it would be essentially political. They could have done the same for Mr. Trump, then covered the news he made, if there was any, with context and fact-checks.Instead, they made a gutless decision to put appearances or tradition or the fear of a presidential ragetweet over their responsibility to keep their audience from being misinformed, and for a partisan fizzle of a news event.We will see how Mr. Trump fares with the Democrats. But the TV networks put up as much of a barrier as a wall made of toothpicks."
73,"MIAMI — Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said on Wednesday he would push ahead with plans to transfer $1 billion to help fund President Donald Trump's wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, even as he acknowledged a likely backlash from Congress.Democratic Representative Adam Smith, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said on Tuesday that the panel did not approve the proposed shift in Pentagon expenditure. Any decision to go ahead anyway could prompt Congress to create new restrictions that could impact the Pentagon in the future.Asked whether his plan was to move ahead regardless, Shanahan said: ""Yes, it is.""""There are going to be consequences. I understand the position of the committees. I also have a standing legal order from the commander-in-chief,"" he said.Congress could attempt to cut off the Pentagon's authority to reprogram funds, something Smith hinted at during the hearing. Asked whether he expected Smith to follow through, Shanahan said: ""I would expect that to happen.""Still, the Pentagon insists it has the authority to shift the $1 billion. The House failed on Tuesday to override Trump's first veto of the ""national emergency"" he declared last month to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall that Congress has not funded.Smith told the hearing that Trump's proposed $750 billion defense budget would not pass as it was proposed. That budget included $100 billion in a ""slush fund"" meant to fund ongoing wars but which the Pentagon intends to use to boost the amount of money it has available to avoid budget caps.Shanahan said losing the ability to reprogram funds could present problems for Pentagon planners, who have to shift resources around to deal with natural disasters and other emergencies. ""It's a very difficult situation and ... we're going to have to be artful to manage this,"" he said. ""I don't think it's going to be easy.

74,"WASHINGTON — Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said Monday that her department may have been founded to combat terrorism, but its mission is shifting to also confront emerging online threats.China, Iran and other countries are mimicking the approach that Russia used to interfere in the U.S. presidential election in 2016 and continues to use in an attempt to influence campaigns on social media, she said. Under threat are Americans' devices and networks.""It's not just U.S. troops and government agents on the front lines anymore,"" Nielsen said. ""It's U.S. companies. It's our schools and gathering places. It's ordinary Americans.""Devices and networks are ""mercilessly"" targeted, she said. Those responsible are ""compromising, co-opting, and controlling them.""Nielsen was speaking about the priorities of a sprawling department created after the Sept. 11 attacks. It handles counterterrorism, election security and cybersecurity, natural disaster responses and border security — President Donald Trump's signature domestic issue.The president on Friday issued his first veto , to secure money for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. Nielsen did not specifically mention that fight, but made clear that she sees a humanitarian and security crisis at the border because of an increasing number of Central American families crossing into the U.S. to seek asylum.While the overall number of migrants coming into the U.S. is down from a high of 1.6 million in 2000, the number of families crossing the U.S.-Mexico border has reached record highs. The system is at a breaking point, she said.Nielsen said the department has introduced tougher screening systems at airports and is working with the State Department to notify other countries of stricter information-sharing requirements. She said the countries that work with the U.S. will make the world safer, and those that do not ""will face consequences."""
75,"To the Editor:Re “Trump Declares National Emergency to Build Border Wall” (nytimes.com, Feb. 15):If some migrant workers and asylum seekers illegally crossing the southern border constitute a “national emergency,” then what to think of the tens of thousands of Americans lost to gun violence each year, the growing number of Americans without access to affordable health insurance and the existential threat of our increasingly extreme climate?If Republicans in Congress do not immediately rebuke this reckless and unconstitutional subversion of Congress’s own power of the purse, and if the increasingly partisan federal judiciary signs off on this obvious abuse of authority, then a dangerous precedent has indeed been set.And in that case, I very much look forward to a Democratic president declaring a state of emergency to ban assault weapons after the next school shooting, to create a universal Medicare opt-in for the uninsured, and to impose a large-scale reordering of our fossil fuel-based economy after the next devastating wildfires or hurricanes.Republicans will rue this latest capitulation to this lawless president — yet perhaps the country will come to be better off for it.Nikhil SinghShelton, Conn.To the Editor:How much waste of time, money and energy is it going to take for this country to come to its senses and demand that President Trump and Congress get serious about the business of government?Mr. Trump has conjured up a national emergency where none exists and has tied the entire country in knots for months over a useless wall he wants to build on our southern border to protect us from imaginary threats. Meanwhile, nothing is being done about the issues that will eventually have real consequences for the country.If this isn’t dereliction of duty, I don’t know what is.Stuart MathNew YorkTo the Editor:To paraphrase that famous quote: First the president came for the Justice Department, but the Republicans in Congress did not speak out because they were not part of the Justice Department. Then the president came for the free press, but the Republicans in Congress did not speak out because they were not journalists.And now the president has come for you, Congress. He means to usurp your power over appropriations — the most fundamental constitutional power granted to you by the framers. Will you leave it to the courts to defend your prerogatives — hoping that there are still some judges and Supreme Court justices left who are free of Trumpian influence? Or will you finally, finally speak out for yourselves, forcefully and with one unified voice? Nancy StarkNew YorkTo the Editor:There is no better demonstration of President Trump’s failure at leadership and governance than his reliance on his emergency declaration powers in order to assemble the funds necessary to build his wall.I am reminded of the spoiled kid who resolves to take his ball home because he can’t win the game by playing by the rules — in this case, our constitutional separation of powers. Of course, it is his teammates — the Republicans in Congress — who stand to lose the most because they are no longer in the ballgame. They have kowtowed to their neighborhood bully once too often and may as well go home themselves.If Mr. Trump’s border wall truly had merit, the case to be made would be straightforward.

77,"WASHINGTON — President Trump plans to use his State of the Union address on Tuesday night to outline a bipartisan and optimistic vision of the country, a senior administration official said on Friday.It could be a difficult sell.In the past few weeks, as he has tried to navigate his way out of a political standoff with Democrats, Mr. Trump has ramped up his anti-immigration messaging, stormed out of meetings with Democratic leaders and refused to accept any compromise that does not ultimately include funding for a border wall.And while the White House said on Friday that the goal of the speech was to bring together a divided government and a divided nation, the official said immigration would emerge as the main theme.Mr. Trump is also expected to make an appeal to his evangelical anti-abortion base by talking about the “fundamental importance and respect for human life,” the official said. And he will focus a large portion of his remarks on the importance of ending illegal immigration.But the official, who refused to be identified according to the ground rules of the briefing, framed the speech as an opportunity to change the tone of the current political debate.“Together we can break decades of political stalemate,” Mr. Trump is expected to say, according to an excerpt from the speech shared by the official. “We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future. The decision is ours to make.”The overarching theme of the speech, the official said, will be “Choosing Greatness,” and it will focus on issues where there is a possibility of bipartisan consensus: infrastructure, lowering health care and prescription drug costs, protecting American workers affected by what he described as “decades of flawed trade deals” and safeguarding national security.The president will also call on Congress to replace what he described as the “Nafta disaster” with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and discuss the trading relationship with China.In his first State of the Union address last year, Mr. Trump also sought to strike a unifying tone that was a contrast to the political attacks and divisive messaging that he is better known for. But the promises in last year’s speech, including bringing Democrats and Republicans together behind a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan, have not materialized, while the more contentious policies of his presidency have continued.This year, Mr. Trump will address the nation after a 35-day government shutdown caused by his insistence that Congress approve funding for the border wall. And although the president agreed to three weeks of negotiations to end the impasse, he said on Thursday that the talks are “a waste of time” and strongly hinted that he would declare a national emergency to bypass Congress and obtain wall funding.Mr. Trump suggested on Friday that he would announce his decision on declaring a national emergency during the State of the Union speech.“I don’t want to say,” he told reporters when asked if he was planning to do so. “You’ll hear the State of the Union and let’s see what happens,” he said.White House officials have been warning him against the action, but they also view it as a potential last-ditch exit ramp if they cannot find another face-saving solution.Last month, in the midst of the shutdown, Speaker Nancy Pelosi told the president she wanted to postpone the address, initially scheduled for Jan. 29, until after the government reopened, and suggested he deliver the speech in writing.Mr. Trump retaliated by grounding the military plane that was supposed to take Ms. Pelosi and other lawmakers on a fact-finding trip to Afghanistan. Then, when Mr. Trump pressed ahead, insisting he wanted to give the speech, Ms. Pelosi disinvited him. But this week she and the president agreed he would give the speech on Feb. 5."
78,"Welcome to Crossing the Border, a limited-run weekly newsletter from The New York Times. Like what you see? Send this to a friend. If someone forwarded it to you, sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox.By Manny Fernandez in McAllen, Tex.Here in Texas, America has two southern borders. I live 10 miles from one, 60 miles from the other.The first border is the one you know about: the tall steel barrier you see on the news, the physical and symbolic line that is patrolled, topped with razor-wire and debated.The second is well north of that, and it has been quietly setting Southwestern cities apart from the rest of America for years. This other “border” is the line of federal traffic checkpoints that operate up to 100 miles north of the existing fence. There are more than 30 permanent Border Patrol checkpoints across Arizona, California, Texas and New Mexico.More than the fence line, the checkpoint line is in many ways the true border wall — more undocumented immigrants die trying to circumvent the checkpoints than they do trying to get around the fence, and many fear the checkpoints more than they fear the fence. Every day, hundreds of thousands of people who pull up to these checkpoints have to do something other Americans in other cities don’t have to do on the highway: Answer a uniformed officer’s question about whether they are a United States citizen.These checkpoints were suddenly in the news this week, after the Border Patrol took the rare step of temporarily closing some of them in the El Paso region and in New Mexico. Border Patrol officials said they did it in response to the influx of Central American families seeking asylum. Agents working those checkpoints are being diverted elsewhere to help process the migrants that officials said are overwhelming their resources along the border.“Two weeks ago, I briefed the media and testified in Congress that our immigration system was at the breaking point,” the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Kevin K. McAleenan, told reporters in El Paso on Wednesday. “That breaking point has arrived this week at our border.” There were a total of 13,400 migrants in custody along the border Wednesday morning, he said. “A high number for us is 4,000. A crisis level is 6,000. Thirteen thousand is unprecedented.”The closures have brought the checkpoints back into the national spotlight and have raised a host of questions. The Border Patrol has pumped a considerable amount of time, taxpayer money and personnel into these inland checkpoints, designed to intercept any drugs or unauthorized migrants that might have made it through the main ports of entry.When I visited one of the busiest checkpoints on the border in 2015 — located in the middle of South Texas ranchlands near the town of Falfurrias on Highway 281 — a Border Patrol official told me: “Without the checkpoints, then you have narcotics and people just coming straight up the highways.”One must presume those narcotics and people are coming straight up the highways now in the parts of Texas and New Mexico where the checkpoints are now closed — for all the talk of toughened border security.Last month, I moved temporarily from Houston to the South Texas city of McAllen to help expand The New York Times’s coverage of the border. I can’t drive north back to Houston without passing a checkpoint, and I can’t pass a checkpoint until I roll down my window and answer a Border Patrol agent’s question: “Are you a U.S. citizen?”Sometimes the agents ask me where I’m headed, and on at least one occasion they asked me to pop the trunk. Once, an agent joked about the Barbie and “Trolls” stickers my 6-year-old daughter had stuck on a back window. Another time, one of the Border Patrol dogs that sniff the vehicles responded to something in my trunk, and I had to pull over for a secondary inspection (which proved uneventful).In a nation where police stop-and-frisk tactics are the subject of much debate, Americans who live on the border have normalized government intrusion.“It’s destabilizing to the people who live in these regions, in subtle ways, nuanced ways,” said Francisco Cantú, a former Border Patrol agent who is the author of “The Line Becomes a River,” a memoir. “I think it’s part of creating the ‘state of exception,’ creating this idea that the borderland is somehow ‘other’ — other than the regular full United States.”The interactions at the checkpoints don’t always go as smoothly as mine have. Numerous motorists and activists who have refused to answer the citizenship question have posted videos of the encounters on YouTube. One video shows a California teacher at a New Mexico checkpoint as she questioned an agent’s authority to stop her. Agents in those situations usually make reference to U.S. v. Martinez-Fuerte, the 1976 Supreme Court ruling that established that vehicle stops at the checkpoints were consistent with the Fourth Amendment’s restrictions on unreasonable search and seizure.One thing I often wonder: I was born in Fresno, Calif., but would I get questioned as often at the checkpoints if I weren’t Mexican-American? Several white friends and colleagues have told me that agents have waved them through without questioning their citizenship status. That doesn’t happen to me. I’ve passed through several Border Patrol checkpoints in Texas dozens of times. I get asked whether I’m an American citizen, every single time.Manny is one of a team of New York Times journalists currently reporting from the border.

79,"Here’s what the president said, and how it stacks up against the facts.Democrats have offered $1.3 billion in funding for border security measures like enhanced surveillance and fortified fencing. They do not support Mr. Trump’s border wall.At a meeting with Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer in December, Mr. Trump took responsibility for the partial government shutdown.“I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I’m not going to blame you for it,” he said.— Linda QiuIn November, the agency, which is actually named Customs and Border Protection (and which oversees the Border Patrol), apprehended 51,856 people trying to cross the border illegally. That’s about 1,700 per day.The agency also deemed another 10,600 “inadmissible,” which refers to people who seek lawful entry into the United States but are barred from doing so. Together, that would be over 2,000, but “inadmissible” is not the same thing as illegal entry.— Linda QiuTwenty-six Senate Democrats — including Mr. Schumer — voted for a 2006 law that authorized about 700 miles of fencing along the southwest border. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump characterized the 2006 legislation as inadequate, dismissing it as “such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall.”As part of his campaign, Mr. Trump promised to build a 1,000-mile concrete border wall. He sometimes calls the wall a fence, though he has also rejected suggestions that it is a fence.— Linda QiuSome economists argue that immigrants drive down available jobs and wages for Americans only if they are competing for the same jobs as the domestic work force. In many cases, immigrants — legal or illegal — are seeking jobs that American citizens do not want to do.Kevin Hassett, the White House’s top economist, argued before joining the Trump administration that immigration spurs economic growth and that the United States should double its intake of immigrants.— Alan RappeportMost heroin smuggled into the United States does come through the southwest border, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration’s latest National Drug Threat Assessment report. But most of it is smuggled into the United States through legal ports of entry at the southern border, not through the desert, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration’s 2018 annual drug threat assessment.A border wall would not address what experts see as the next, more deadly phase of the opioid epidemic: fentanyl.Fentanyl is a narcotic that is used to treat severe pain and is a key contributor the opioid crisis. It is also sometimes mixed with heroin. Most fentanyl enters the United States from packages mailed directly from China through traditional ports of entry, according to the report, and through Canada from China. A lower-potency, lower-cost grade of fentanyl is also smuggled across the southwest border from Mexico. The fentanyl directly from China is far more lucrative for sellers because of its higher purity.

80,"As the government shutdown over President Trump’s demand for border-wall funding moves through week three, the administration is looking to cut a deal with Democrats by emphasizing the deepening humanitarian crisis at the border — a crisis caused in large part by this administration’s inhumane policies, political grandstanding and managerial incompetence.In a letter Sunday to lawmakers, the White House laid out its latest proposal for addressing the border tumult. The administration called for more immigration and Border Patrol agents, more detention beds and, of course, $5.7 billion to build 234 new miles of border wall. The White House also demanded an additional $800 million for “urgent humanitarian needs,” such as medical support, transportation and temporary facilities for processing and housing detainees.Translation: Mr. Trump’s mass incarceration of migrant families is overwhelming an already burdened system that, without a giant injection of taxpayer dollars, will continue to collapse, leading to ever more human suffering.The situation is an especially rich example of the Trump Doctrine: Break something, then demand credit — and in this case a lot of money — for promising to fix it.Late last week, frustrated by his standoff with Democrats, Mr. Trump even threatened to declare a national emergency in order to get his wall built without Congress’s approval — a move guaranteed to prompt a ferocious legal challenge.Any attempt to sell Mr. Trump’s cruel immigration agenda with a veneer of humanitarian measures should be viewed with skepticism. This administration has long held that the best way to deal with asylum seekers fleeing the horrors of their home countries is to increase their suffering upon reaching the United States to discourage others from even trying. There is no question but that the administration remains ill equipped to cope with the fallout from its narrow fixation on deterrence. Migrant children are being piled into holding cells where they fall ill — or worse. The number of detainees at Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities has swelled to unprecedented levels, requiring periodic mass releases. Without preparation or planning, hundreds of migrants are simply dropped off at bus stations in border cities. The Times found that, in the final week of December, some 600 migrants were unceremoniously released onto the streets of El Paso.Mr. Trump’s spiteful choice to shut parts of the government is only making the situation messier. Immigration judges are being furloughed, further slowing the processing of asylum requests. Border Patrol agents are working without pay, eroding morale. In perhaps the choicest twist of fate, some $300 million in new contracts for wall construction cannot be awarded until the shutdown ends. With Democrats now controlling the House, the president is right to assume that he will need a new negotiating approach. But the answer isn’t for lawmakers to throw good money after bad, or to try to prettify a retrograde agenda with humanitarian trimmings.The Trump administration is asking Congress and the American public to embrace warped logic, that its policies are going to continue and that the only question is whether any money should be spent on measures to ease the suffering caused by those policies. After two years of watching this administration run amok, surely Democratic lawmakers can come up with a better approach."
81,"One clear lesson from the elections of 2016 and 2018 is that President Trump and his fellow Republican candidates win where white voters are losing ground.Take a look at the 2018 congressional results in the upper Midwest and Pennsylvania, states that provided the Electoral College votes crucial to Trump’s capture of the White House.John C. Austin, the director of the Michigan Economic Center and a senior fellow at Brookings, analyzed economic trends in 15 congressional districts that changed hands last year — 12 from Republican to Democrat, three from Democrat to Republican — in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota and Iowa.Austin found a striking pattern. In the majority of districts that went from Republican to Democrat:The accompanying graphic reveals the extent to which economic considerations shaped the outcome in these districts.The same general pattern emerged in state after state in the recent midterms.In September 2018, Siobhan Hughes and Dante Chinni of The Wall Street Journal took the 70 congressional races ranked as most competitive by the Cook Political Report. They then ranked the races on the basis of an “economic-health index created by the Institute of International Finance.”Of the ten districts ranked highest on economic health, eight were categorized “lean Republican” by the Cook Political Report, and two “lean Democrat.” Before the November election, nine of those 10 seats were held by Republicans.On Election Day, Democrats carried eight out of 10 of these districts.Mark Muro and Jacob Whiton, both of Brookings, worked with John Harwood of CNBC to analyze Democratic and Republican-held congressional districts in the aftermath of the 2018 election. Their conclusions reinforce the findings of Austin, Hughes and Chinni.The key result: the 20 most prosperous districts are now held by Democrats, while Republicans represent 16 of the 20 least prosperous, measured by share of G.D.P. The accompanying chart illustrates their analysis.The authors’ calculation of the contribution to the G.D.P. of every congressional district showed that Democratic districts produce $10.2 trillion of the nation’s goods and services and Republican districts $6.2 trillion.This trend creates a significant dilemma for Trump and the Republican Party. Candidates on the right do best during hard times and in recent elections, they have gained the most politically in regions experiencing the sharpest downturn. Electorally speaking, in other words, Republicans profit from economic stagnation and decline.Let’s return to John Austin of the Michigan Economic Center. In an email he describes this unusual situation succinctly: “A rising economic tide tends to sink the Trump tugboat,” adding“Certainly more people and communities that are feeling abandoned, not part of a vibrant economy means more fertile ground for the resentment politics and ‘blaming others’ for people’s woes (like immigrants and people of color) that fuel Trump’s supporters.”In June 2017, Austin demonstrated the importance of struggling white communities to the Republican Party. His study of the 2016 presidential results in the Midwest showed how strong turnout among voters in regions facing economic deterioration can help Republicans. In that earlier report, Austin wrote:This pattern is not limited to the United States. There are numerous studies demonstrating that European and British voters who are falling behind in the global economy, and who were hurt by the 2008 recession and the subsequent cuts to the welfare state, drove Brexit as well as the rise of right-wing populist parties.One paper, “Measuring the Effects of Economic Austerity on Pro-Sociality: Evidence from Greece,” by Nicholas Sambanis, Anna Schultz and Elena Nikolova, political scientists at Penn, Duke and University College London, found, for example,In a July 2018 paper, “Did Austerity Cause Brexit?” Thiemo Fetzer, an economist at the University of Warwick in Coventry, England, argues that austerity policies adopted in the wake of the 2008 financial collapse were crucial both to voter support for the right-wing populist party UKIP in Britain and to voter approval of Brexit.These political movements “are strongly and causally associated with an individual’s or an area’s exposure to austerity since 2010,” Fetzer writes. Examination of economic trends, welfare policy and polling data shows, according to Fetzer, thatThere are significant parallels between voting patterns for and against Brexit and the patterns in the 2016 and 2018 elections in this country.In a separate 2017 paper, “Who Voted For Brexit,” Fetzer and two fellow economists at the University of Warwick, Sascha O. Becker and Dennis Novy, found that “in particular, fiscal cuts in the context of the recent U.K. austerity program are strongly associated with a higher Vote Leave share.” This heldThe results here and in England reinforce the conclusion that the worse things get, the better the right does.As a rule, as economic conditions improve and voters begin to feel more secure, they become more generous and more liberal. In the United States, this means that voters move to the left; in Britain, it means voters are stronger in their support for staying in the European Union.In his forthcoming book, “Democratic Capitalism at the Crossroads: Technological Change and the Future of Politics” Carles Boix, a political scientist at Princeton, describes how postwar prosperity from 1945 to the mid-1970s led to a liberal international consensus:As global competition, outsourcing and later, automation, began to produce significant economic disruption, beginning in the 1970s, this liberal consensus frayed.Boix writes,In the United States, economic adversity helped produce Trump, whose inaugural speech (reportedly the handiwork of Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller) Boix cites as emblematic of the hostility emerging with the fall of liberalism:Together, the trends described above raise an intriguing question: If the Republican Party now depends on the votes of those who are falling behind, does the party have a vested interest in economic stagnation and decline?I asked scholars and officials at the Niskanen Center — a Washington think tank that recently received favorable coverage for its efforts to resolve contemporary ideological division — whether they thought the Republican Party has come to recognize that prosperity helps Democrats, while economic adversity engenders hostility to immigrants, resentment of liberal elites and animosity among rural voters toward urban America. Does this awareness give politicians on the right a motive to support policies and actions that foster government dysfunction and further impair sections of the country that are in decline?Jerry Taylor, president of Niskanen, replied to my inquiry by making the case that “as conservatives see it, the more visible government dysfunction is, the better. It provides civic education.”Working from this premise, Taylor argued that as far as conservatives go,Taylor disputed the suggestion that “Republicans consciously or unconsciously labor to frustrate economic growth in rural white America.” Instead, he said, they are ideologically committed to the belief that economic growth isWill Wilkinson, the center’s vice president for research, wrote back to me:But, in actual practice moving from campaigning to governing, Wilkinson continued, Trump’sWhat’s more, Wilkinson noted,This has put the Republican Party in a painful position, according to Wilkinson:Brink Lindsey, vice president for policy, replied to my queries from a somewhat different angle: “You don’t need conscious intent to produce dysfunction to explain Republican governance failures.”In Lindsey’s view,This is not, according to Lindsey,In addition to the Mueller investigation, there are two major factors that will determine the sustainability of the Republican Party’s “rotten equilibrium.”The first, of course, is Trump himself. His victory in 2016 was a charlatan’s ascent, and his presidency has served to sustain distrust in government — fuel, in one sense, for the continued success of charlatans. For the moment, though, his failure to win money for the border wall has punctured his viability as a governing force.Trump’s second, if less heralded, achievement has been to invigorate the Democratic opposition. He has inspired an immense, rambunctious, intensely motivated and exceptionally diverse pack of candidates — some prepared, some less so, to dislodge him from the White House."
82,"CALEXICO, Calif. — The barbed wire overhead evokes danger and violence, but Maritza Hurtado cannot take it seriously. When the sharp coils were placed on top of the old border fence several months ago, running right along the main boulevard, she chalked it up to political propaganda from a White House that does not understand life along the Southwest frontier.“This is not a war zone,” Ms. Hurtado said from her tax and immigration consulting office in downtown Calexico, from which she can peer into Mexico. “I’ve had a business here for 30 years and we’ve never needed the barbed wire. Why now? To me, it feels as if I’m enclosed.”For nearly a year, President Trump has pointed with pride to a renovation project replacing two miles of border fencing in Calexico. He hailed it as “the start of our Southern Border WALL!” — to the great consternation of many of the town’s residents, who are wary of becoming the public face of a hard-line immigration policy that most here do not agree with. The attention the president’s tweet brought was surreal, in part because the construction replaced an unsightly stretch of steel fencing that was already there.Nationally, partisans and journalists began to debate whether the 30-foot-tall steel slats that make up the replacement barrier should be called a “wall” like the one Mr. Trump promised during his campaign. Others said it was just a “fence,” a distinction that has taken on great importance in Washington.Lost amid the battle over credit and semantics was how Calexico residents themselves felt about becoming characters in Trump-era political theater. For many, a sense of apprehension turned to anger when the military installed barbed wire on top of older border fencing, which runs through downtown.“This community is basically being used for political purposes,” said Ms. Hurtado, who served as the town’s mayor until December. “And it’s happening throughout these border cities that are just like ours.” She tried to remain diplomatic when television news crews asked her for comment about the barrier last spring, she said, to “avoid making more drama for this community that has nothing to do with the national problem.”But she said she felt incredulous over the administration’s insistence that the replacement fence is part of the wall: “Before we started this project here to do the replacement, Border Patrol came to visit us about three times to ask us to please participate in avoiding the drama. They came to say, three times, ‘You guys, just so you know, we’re starting this project, and it’s not the wall,” recounted Ms. Hurtado, a Democrat who did not vote for the president. “And then here comes Trump and says, ‘It’s the wall!’”[Read more about how the people who live on the border feel about the wall: ""We have other problems here that need fixing.""]The town has received a steady dose of attention from Trump administration officials since last spring. Vice President Mike Pence visited the barrier in April and said the administration was “committed to seeing the construction of a border wall.” In October, the Homeland Security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, visited to unveil a plaque crediting the president with the barrier.This month, the president tweeted again: “The Fake News Media keeps saying we haven’t built any NEW WALL,” he wrote, apparently in reference to the barrier in Calexico. “Below is a section just completed on the Border. Anti-climbing feature included. Very high, strong and beautiful! Also, many miles already renovated and in service!”Amid a continuing national debate about the border, which has resulted in the longest government shutdown in history, many in this town of 40,000 have struggled to reconcile ominous warnings they see projected from the White House about life on the border with their own experiences living in the quiet agricultural community 120 miles east of San Diego.Calexico has long celebrated its interdependent relationship with Mexicali, its sister city directly across the line; the two cities’ downtowns are bisected by pillars where the border lies. Shoppers from urban Mexicali, which has a population of about 1 million, are vital to Calexico’s small-town economy and cross to shop at large outlet stores on the American side. Americans head to the Mexican side on weekends for cheap health care, entertainment and concerts.“We’re right up against each other. Each city depends on the other,” said Hildy Carrillo, the executive director of the Calexico Chamber of Commerce, who like Ms. Hurtado did not vote for Mr. Trump. “The families are on both sides of the border. The businesses are on both sides of the border. And the education, the entertainment and the culture are on both sides of the border. Punto.”[Read about how charities are stepping in to help released migrants.]Rather than a border wall, residents here express enthusiasm for modernizing the Calexico West Port of Entry, which they hope will expedite traffic and allow for a fluid flow of business between the two sides. The number of legal northbound crossers each day, leading to hourslong lines, is astounding: about 20,000 pedestrians and up to 20,000 vehicles, according to the General Services Administration.Ground was broken in 2015 on the first stage of the renovation, a $121.9 million project completed in September 2018. Town officials are hopeful the second phase will be funded by Congress.“We have been waiting for that funding, for years, for our port of entry,” Ms. Hurtado said. “That’s been our struggle. We don’t need a wall. We’ve been struggling to get the money for the door.” The president’s previous threats to shut down the border had also concerned her. “We’re depressed and you’re going to kill us if you shut things down. It’s like, help us by knowing us, you know?”After Mr. Trump’s tweet about the “Border WALL!” Ms. Hurtado had T-shirts made and distributed. They read, “It’s Not A Wall.”The high volume of legal traffic does not mean that illegal border crossings do not happen here. The risk those migrants pose, however, and the characterization of the numbers who jump the fence is enormously overstated, Ms. Carrillo said.The real danger, many here said, lies in drug trafficking conducted through sophisticated tunnel systems built by cartels.During a drive through downtown Calexico, Victor Carrillo — Ms. Carrillo’s cousin and a former City Council member, mayor and county supervisor — pointed to a house where federal authorities found an expansive underground tunnel in 2016 that ran from the United States to Mexico. As he drove, Mr. Carrillo and a friend pointed to other areas where tunnels were found, where sink holes formed because of attempted burrowing and where the authorities suspect there could be new tunnels.“They’re everywhere. Every new apartment complex you see go up, you figure” there might be a tunnel there, Mr. Carrillo said.A wall, he pointed out, does not even begin to address that problem.The politics of the Imperial Valley are generally not with the president. The county gave Hillary Clinton 68 percent of the vote in 2016 compared with 27 percent for Mr. Trump. The 51st Congressional District, which runs along the southern border from the Arizona border to San Diego, supported the incumbent Democrat, Representative Juan Vargas, with 71 percent of the vote versus 29 percent for his Republican challenger. Eighty-four percent of Imperial County residents are Latino, according to 2018 data by the United States Census Bureau.That is not to say that there are not people here and in the broader Imperial Valley, which is a large agricultural region, who support the president’s policies. But in Calexico, it seems, few like to speak about it publicly. And even some of those who lean conservative have reservations about the president’s talk on immigration.John Renison, 70, an Army veteran and longtime Calexico resident who is a former City Council member and county supervisor, began his political career here in the 1990s as a Republican but is reluctant to identify with either party today. But he said the barbed wire running through Calexico is a distasteful statement, as is, he said, the president’s general rhetoric about immigration.“We do not have a crisis on the border. We are not in fear of being invaded like he said,” Mr. Renison said. “What’s really laughable is you think you’re going to stop illegal immigration by constructing walls and fences.”"
83,"Here’s what the president said, and how it stacks up against the facts.Democrats have offered $1.3 billion in funding for border security measures like enhanced surveillance and fortified fencing. They do not support Mr. Trump’s border wall.At a meeting with Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer in December, Mr. Trump took responsibility for the partial government shutdown.“I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I’m not going to blame you for it,” he said.— Linda QiuIn November, the agency, which is actually named Customs and Border Protection (and which oversees the Border Patrol), apprehended 51,856 people trying to cross the border illegally. That’s about 1,700 per day.The agency also deemed another 10,600 “inadmissible,” which refers to people who seek lawful entry into the United States but are barred from doing so. Together, that would be over 2,000, but “inadmissible” is not the same thing as illegal entry.— Linda QiuTwenty-six Senate Democrats — including Mr. Schumer — voted for a 2006 law that authorized about 700 miles of fencing along the southwest border. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump characterized the 2006 legislation as inadequate, dismissing it as “such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall.”As part of his campaign, Mr. Trump promised to build a 1,000-mile concrete border wall. He sometimes calls the wall a fence, though he has also rejected suggestions that it is a fence.— Linda QiuSome economists argue that immigrants drive down available jobs and wages for Americans only if they are competing for the same jobs as the domestic work force. In many cases, immigrants — legal or illegal — are seeking jobs that American citizens do not want to do.Kevin Hassett, the White House’s top economist, argued before joining the Trump administration that immigration spurs economic growth and that the United States should double its intake of immigrants.— Alan RappeportMost heroin smuggled into the United States does come through the southwest border, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration’s latest National Drug Threat Assessment report. But most of it is smuggled into the United States through legal ports of entry at the southern border, not through the desert, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration’s 2018 annual drug threat assessment.A border wall would not address what experts see as the next, more deadly phase of the opioid epidemic: fentanyl.Fentanyl is a narcotic that is used to treat severe pain and is a key contributor the opioid crisis. It is also sometimes mixed with heroin. Most fentanyl enters the United States from packages mailed directly from China through traditional ports of entry, according to the report, and through Canada from China. A lower-potency, lower-cost grade of fentanyl is also smuggled across the southwest border from Mexico. The fentanyl directly from China is far more lucrative for sellers because of its higher purity. The fentanyl sent through conventional mail packages has proved difficult for law enforcement to detect. Fentanyl coming from Mexico is often hidden in automobile compartments, much like conventional drug smuggling.The president’s opioids commission reported last November that “we are losing this fight predominately through China.”— Michael TackettIn the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested over 210,876 people with previous criminal convictions, and another 55,233 people with pending criminal charges.But it should be noted that these criminal convictions covered a range of offenses, including many that were nonviolent.

In 2014, when President Obama stated he would take executive action to protect four to five million immigrants from deportation, the House speaker, John Boehner, referred to the president as “an emperor” who had exceeded his constitutional authority. The point was amplified by Senator Ted Cruz, who described the president as a “monarch” whose actions were unlawful and unconstitutional.Now, as President Trump considers employing executive power to build a border wall that the majority of the country does not support, the G.O.P. remains silent. For all of the right’s criticism of Mr. Obama’s use of executive authority, Mr. Trump’s attempt to manufacture a national security crisis to fulfill a campaign promise is a blatant abuse of executive power far more invasive than any taken while Mr. Obama was in office.Laurence JurdemSan FranciscoTo the Editor:Does our president have the power to declare a national emergency and build the wall in defiance of Congress? Several legal scholars and many from the left-leaning media are saying he does not.This question has bounced around since the 1950s. During the Korean conflict, President Harry Truman attempted to seize the steel industry to support the war. The Supreme Court said no. Then in 1976, Congress passed the National Emergencies Act, which granted sweeping powers to the president. Since its implementation, this act has been used roughly 30 times, with little or no Democratic objection. In addition, federal regulations refer to an “immigration emergency” to deal with an “influx of aliens.”Please support our president for the sake of our national security.James W. AndersonTalladega, Ala.To the Editor:Republicans should be careful what they wish for regarding getting funds to build a wall by calling it a response to a national emergency. What is to stop a future Democratic president from calling a national emergency in response to the tens of thousands of gun deaths and confiscating all guns, or in response to climate change and spending billions of dollars to build windmills all across the country? Both are clearly more serious threats to Americans.Larry FeigNewton, Mass."
85,"As President Trump declared a national emergency on Friday to bypass Congress and build his long-promised wall, he again painted a portrait of a lawless, chaotic border and cited arguments about the effectiveness of the kind of barrier he has in mind that were not rooted in facts.Illegal border crossings have been declining for decades. While families are overwhelming an immigration system devised to handle single men, a border wall would not prevent them from seeking asylum, which is legal. Research does not show that immigrants commit more crimes than native-born Americans. And a wall would do little to prevent drugs and human trafficking at the border, as official ports of entry are the main route into the United States for both.Cumulatively, Mr. Trump’s unsupported or misleading statements undercut his rationale for declaring an emergency, a step that is widely viewed as testing both constitutional and political norms and is sure to draw legal challenges. Mr. Trump is correct that there were 23 murders in El Paso last year, compared with more than 1,200 murders in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. But the disparity predates the existence of border barriers separating the two towns.In 2007, the year before border fencing construction began, El Paso reported 17 murders while Juárez recorded about 320 homicides, before the drug war between cartels escalated.In 2010, after the barriers were largely completed, El Paso recorded five murders before the number increased to 16 a year later. That same year, murders in Juárez topped 3,600 before declining to over 2,000 in 2011. Mr. Trump was referring to the flow of drugs across the border and disputing arguments that most smuggling takes place not in remote areas where a wall might be built but through authorized border crossing points, or ports of entry. The relevant statistics come from Mr. Trump’s own agencies, not Democrats. Data from Customs and Border Protection shows that 80 percent to 90 percent of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl is seized at ports of entry (marijuana is the exception). The Drug Enforcement Administration noted that a “small percentage of all heroin” is seized at areas between ports of entry.You can. For example, the Justice Department recently detailed how an international sex trafficking ring committed visa fraud to transport women from Thailand into the United States and coerce them into the sex trade. About 80 percent of human trafficking victims passed through official ports of entry, according to a decade’s worth of data collected by the Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative. The Polaris Project, a group that works to prevent human trafficking in the United States, said in a statement that out of nearly 50,000 cases it has handled, “the vast majority of victims” arrive through ports of entry. Israel built a wall along its border with Egypt in 2013, and it has proved to be effective. Israeli officials have said that illegal crossings decreased to 12 in 2014 from more than 16,000 in 2011 — a 99 percent reduction.Whether that example could be applied to the United States is another matter, as PolitiFact has reported. The border between Israel and Egypt is much shorter than the United States-Mexico border, along flat land as opposed to mountainous terrain. Israel also invested in technology and manpower to guard its border.Mr. Trump is right that previous presidents have issued 58 national emergency declarations since 1978, 30 of which are still in effect. But those declarations have largely dealt with crises and conflicts abroad.Examples include blocking transactions with the Taliban, prohibiting the importation of diamonds from Sierra Leone, placing restrictions on North Korea and allowing faster treatment during the swine flu outbreak in 2009.Mr. Trump’s declaration, however, is extraordinary in that it addresses a domestic policy issue and involves redirecting money without the approval of Congress.The funding deal passed by Congress on Thursday authorized $1.375 billion for border fencing, which is less than the $1.6 billion that senators proposed last June and that Mr. Trump rejected. Asked about his reaction to the reduced funding, Mr. Trump misleadingly cited comments made by Speaker Nancy Pelosi.At a news conference in January, while the government was still partially shut down, Ms. Pelosi jokingly said that she would agree to give Mr. Trump $1 for his border wall. But Ms. Pelosi and Democrats have consistently drawn a distinction between the wall and border security, referring to employing technology enhancements and additional personnel as well as barriers. At that same January news conference, Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats promoted a bill that included $1.3 billion for border fencing and would have temporarily reopened the government. Mr. Trump also repeated four other claims about immigration and his border wall that The New York Times has previously fact-checked: Curious about the accuracy of a claim?

86,"EL PASO, Texas — The battle of the border was an epic desert showdown between two gifted politicians, each marshaling around 10,000 people, one blessed with the truth, the other peddling lies. And yet, to Donald Trump’s mystifying credit, the lie survived to fight another day. We tell some tall tales here in Texas. But no Texan is a match for this president.As day broke here in my hometown yesterday, it looked like after years, Mr. Trump’s lies about the border had finally run out. Amid his showdown with Democrats over his proposed border wall — which had already led to an unpopular 35-day-long government shutdown — Mr. Trump was coming to El Paso to make his case once again: “Build the wall.” The people of El Paso, with the local hero and presidential Hamlet Beto O’Rourke as their public face, had a response: “We’re safe not because of walls but in spite of walls. We’re safe not in spite of immigrants but because of immigrants.”Ahead of the president’s visit, normally taciturn local politicians turned on Mr. Trump for falsely claiming in recent weeks that El Paso, the second-largest border city in America, was swamped by an immigrant crime wave until a fence went up. The English-language daily, El Paso Times, proclaimed: “Local leaders ready to tell El Paso’s story.” The Spanish-language daily, El Diario, more startlingly heralded, “El Paso, National Battleground.” The officially nonpartisan mayor, Dee Margo, laid into Mr. Trump on Twitter, outraged: “El Paso was never one of the most dangerous cities in the U.S.”As Air Force One approached, winds whipped up to 50 miles per hour as people streamed toward the County Coliseum, formerly a site for livestock shows and rodeos, where Mr. Trump held what amounted to his kickoff rally for the 2020 election. This is not Trump country. After all, he’d branded the entire border, where millions of Americans live, a violent wasteland. Business leaders groused that the president had been bad for business, endangering $70 billion in local trade with Mexico while scaring away businesses with tales of immigrant mayhem. The County Commissioners Court is on the record opposing a wall cutting through downtown. El Paso voted nearly 3-to-1 against him in 2016.For a moment, it seemed the president would finally get his comeuppance here — a definitive and undeniable repudiation of his monstrous and unpopular pet project.On the merits, Mr. Trump should lose the battle hands down. The crime rate in El Paso peaked in 1993. Then it fell steadily for years finally settling at about 370 violent crimes per 100,000 people. Lower than a city El Paso’s size, like, say, Boston or the national average.Organized by some 50 local groups, the March for Truth gathered at least as many or even more people than Mr. Trump’s rally, winding its way to a field directly across from the County Coliseum. Some skewered Mr. Trump, sure; “Not today, Satan,” read one sign. But most people, like Cathy Benavidez, a retired social worker, came to defend their hometown’s reputation. “I’m just embarrassed by what Trump has said because it’s not true,” Ms. Benavidez said. Her hand-lettered sign said, in glitter, “Stop the wall, stop the lies, El Paso has always been safe.”Mr. O’Rourke appeared in shirt sleeves, despite plummeting temperatures, but with his usual upbeat attitude. In a brief interview over the rising voice of a mariachi singer, he said: “This is El Paso so I want to take every opportunity to support the cause, the culture and the community.”He helped bring out 10,000 supporters, according to local organizers, maybe as many as 15,000. Mr. Trump brought 6,700 to the old rodeo arena, according to the fire department, with a few thousand more stamping their feet in front of the parking lot Jumbotron. The truth — or at least the facts — made steady progress in El Paso.But that didn’t stop the lies, like Mr. Trump claiming 35,000 people came to see him while just 200 went to see Mr. O’Rourke. There is nothing the president won’t lie about. He even encouraged followers to chant “Finish That Wall,” though there’s been no construction since he became president on any kind of wall he promised, just fences ordered up since 2006. I tried to count the lies during his speech but had to stop after 10. My Stetson is off: The guy is a gifted and gratuitously generous liar.“Thanks to a powerful border wall in El Paso, Texas, it is one of the safest cities,” he insisted even after the uproar. And the crowd roared. Of course, I had parked my car by the 18-foot bollard border fence a block away; there was no wall, just like there were no 10,000 MAGA fans milling around outside.But the truth is plodding, getting its pants on, one leg at a time, while a lie races halfway around the world, as the old saw attributed to Mark Twain goes. Mr. Trump’s tales of kidnappings and mayhem, too, are far more racy than the truth. El Paso has problems. The international bridges carry tens of millions of people, cars, trucks and rail cars each year; they’re not getting inspected. But that is tedious. I grew up here and El Paso does have a crisis: too much poverty and too little education. But that is boring.Mr. Trump’s lies are dime novel, pulp fiction, heart-pounding, mesmerizing and that’s where they derive their power. Regardless, word came that evening that congressional negotiators would give Mr. Trump about $1 billion for more steel barriers, which he will call a wall and then declare victory. It will be anything but that.The president’s biggest cheerleader, Lindsey Graham, is absolutely right when he says “the wall has become a metaphor.” And Henri Rafael, a Trump fan I met at the rally, is absolutely right, too: “A border wall is very much needed. But it’s not about the wall anymore.” His friend in a pink MAGA hat, Monica DeMoss, chimed in: “These people need to go out and work.”The wall is about whatever you want it to be about: welfare, immigrants, race, class, socialism, you name it. It will never be an actual, 30-foot wall from sea to shining sea, as Mr. Trump once promised. He is, in fact, losing on the merits, bit by bit. But he will still get his monument: a metaphor that just as effectively divides the nation, even if a real wall never divides the border here, in El Paso.I’ll hand it to the guy: No Texan could tell a taller tale."
87,"WASHINGTON — So it has come to this: The president of the United States was asked over the weekend whether he is a Russian agent. And he refused to directly answer.The question, which came from a friendly interviewer, not one of the “fake media” journalists he disparages, was “the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked,” he declared. But it is a question that has hung over his presidency now for two years.If the now 23-day government shutdown standoff between Mr. Trump and Congress has seemed ugly, it may eventually seem tame in light of what is to come. The border wall fight is just the preliminary skirmish in this new era of divided government. The real battle has yet to begin.With Democrats now in charge of the House, the special counsel believed to be wrapping up his investigation, news media outlets competing for scoops and the first articles of impeachment already filed, Mr. Trump faces the prospect of an all-out political war for survival that may make the still-unresolved partial government shutdown pale by comparison.The last few days have offered plenty of foreshadowing. The newly empowered Democrats summoned the president’s longtime personal lawyer to testify after he implicated Mr. Trump in an illegal scheme to arrange hush payments before the 2016 election for women who claimed to have had affairs with him. Legal papers disclosed that Mr. Trump’s onetime campaign chairman shared polling data with an associate tied by prosecutors to Russian intelligence.New reports over the weekend added to the sense of siege at the White House. The New York Times reported that after Mr. Trump fired the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, in 2017, the bureau opened an investigation into whether the president was working for the Russians. And The Washington Post reported that Mr. Trump has gone out of his way as president to hide the details of his discussions with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia even from members of his own administration.What all this adds up to remains unclear. Whether it will lead to a full-blown impeachment inquiry in the House has yet to be decided. But it underscores the chance that with candidates already lining up to take him on in 2020, Washington will spend the months to come debating the future of Mr. Trump’s presidency and the direction of the country.“The reality,” said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former special assistant to Mr. Trump, is “that the next two years are going to be nonstop political war.”The White House has begun recruiting soldiers. The new White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, has hired 17 new lawyers, according to The Post, as he prepares for a barrage of subpoenas from House Democratic committee chairmen.But Mr. Trump’s inner circle has shrunk, and he has fewer advisers around him whom he trusts. His White House chief of staff is still serving in an acting capacity, and the West Wing is depleted by the shutdown. As he himself wrote on Twitter this weekend, “There’s almost nobody in the W.H. but me.”Mr. Surabian said the rest of the party must recognize the threat and rally behind the president. “Republicans need to understand that Democrats in Congress, beholden to the ‘resistance,’ aren’t interested in bipartisanship, they’re out for blood,” he said. “It’s a war we can win,” he added, “but only with fortitude, unity, coherent messaging and a willingness to fight back.”Democrats, for their part, say they are out for accountability, not blood, intent on forcing a president who went largely unchecked by a Republican Congress during his first two years in office to come clean on the many scandals that have erupted involving his business, taxes, campaign and administration.They plan to get started in the coming days. On Tuesday, they will grill former Attorney General William P. Barr, who has been nominated by Mr. Trump to assume his old office again, about his approach to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Barr wrote a private memo last year criticizing Mr. Mueller’s investigation, and Democrats will use his confirmation hearings to press him on whether the special counsel will be allowed to finish his work and report it to Congress.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, also plans to force a vote in the Senate this week on the Trump administration’s plans to lifts sanctions on the companies of Oleg V. Deripaska, a Russian oligarch close to Mr. Putin’s government, if he reduces his ownership stakes. Democrats plan to use the issue to argue that Mr. Trump has been soft on Russia.Even committees that are not usually in the investigation business are jumping into the fray. Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York and the new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told The New Yorker last week that he was eliminating the subcommittee on terrorism in favor of a subcommittee aimed at investigating Mr. Trump’s foreign policy.Lost in all this may be any chance of bipartisan policymaking. At stake in the current fight is just $5.7 billion for Mr. Trump’s promised border wall, roughly one-eighth of one percent of the total federal budget. If one-eighth of one percent of the total budget can prompt the longest government shutdown in American history, then the potential for further clashes over the remaining 99.87 percent seems considerable. On issues like health care, taxes, climate change, guns and national security, the two sides start this era of divided government far apart.“That’s the flashing yellow light here,” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, a former top White House aide to Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. “If you can’t do Government 101, what makes you think you’re going to do Advanced Placement Government like finding the money for an infrastructure bill?”Julian Epstein, who was the counsel for Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee during Mr. Clinton’s impeachment fight 20 years ago, said big issues like a shrinking middle class largely untrained for the 21st-century economy would go unaddressed during the battles to come.“The political class is now addicted to Manichaean conflict as a way of life,” Mr. Epstein said. “It’s become the mother’s milk — for base voters in both parties who together make up a minority share of voters, for cable television and for social media.”Given the investigations, Mr. Trump may prefer a battle over the wall as more favorable ground to fight even with 800,000 federal workers furloughed or forced to work without pay. Polls suggest he is not winning with the broader public but has rallied his base in the fight.More Americans blame Mr. Trump for the government shutdown than blame Democrats, and most oppose a border wall, according to a new survey by The Post and ABC News. But support for a wall has grown over the last year from 34 percent to 42 percent, fueled largely by Republicans, while opposition has slipped from 63 percent to 54 percent.Negotiations have broken down. While Mr. Trump had gambled that Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, would back down, she has made clear that she has no interest in compromise. She and Mr. Schumer have insisted that Mr. Trump reopen the government while negotiations over a border wall proceed, which the president has refused to do. Mr. Trump walked out of their talks last week after he asked Ms. Pelosi if she would support his wall if he reopened the government and she said no.“It’s all about their own sense of strength,” said John Feehery, a former senior House Republican aide. “Pelosi wants to be validated. She wants to be seen as a strong leader. Trump feels like he has to govern through strength. This is strength versus strength. Unfortunately, the people in the middle are the government workers who can’t afford to lose a paycheck.”Instead of talks to end the shutdown, the president spent at least part of his weekend defending himself against the suspicions about his affinity for Mr. Putin. He insisted that he has actually been tougher on Russia than his predecessors and that the F.B.I. was led by “losers that tried to do a number on your President.”He picked up the telephone on Saturday night to call into the Fox News show hosted by Jeanine Pirro, who participated in a campaign rally with him last fall. She asked him about the F.B.I. investigation reported by The Times with a tone of scorn.“I’m going to ask you, are you now or have you ever worked for Russia, Mr. President?” Ms. Pirro asked.“I think it’s the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked,” he answered. “I think it’s the most insulting article I’ve ever had written. And if you read the article, you’d see that they found absolutely nothing.”She then cited the Post article about his efforts to conceal details of his private meetings with Mr. Putin. “We had a great conversation,” he said. “We were talking about Israel and securing Israel and lots of other things, and it was a great conversation. I’m not keeping anything under wraps. I couldn’t care less.”Ms. Pirro expressed sympathy for the battles he was waging.“You’ve got such fight in you, it’s unbelievable,” she said.“Well,” he answered, “I guess I have good genes.”"

89,"To the Editor:Re “12 G.O.P. Senators Defect to Block Emergency Move” (front page, March 15):Perhaps, given the times, it is remarkable that 12 Republican senators defied President Trump’s trampling on the separation of powers by voting to block his national emergency declaration over border wall funding. But more remarkable is that 41 Republicans did not join them.It is spineless to fail to challenge this president on a blatant, authoritarian-type power grab that defies the Constitution that the senators have sworn to uphold. It is craven to cast a vote out of fear that Mr. Trump will seek revenge by suggesting that someone else ought to hold your Senate seat if you do not bend to his will. And yet, this is what they did.So while we give a shout-out to those 12 Republican senators who made the principled call, let us ponder what it says about the ones who did not.Felicia MassarskyAtlantic CityTo the Editor:Re “Cracks in the Senate’s Red Wall” (editorial, March 15):Let us not overreact to this action by a handful of Republican senators. It is not nearly time to suggest Mr. Trump’s unfettered desecration of our democracy is nearing a conclusion. What Mr. Trump did was blatantly defy the will of Congress in his declaration of a national emergency. It was not the policy but merely the procedure, the stripping of the power of Congress to control the purse strings, that was the precipitating cause for this mini-revolt.But fundamentally this was little but a symbolic slap on the wrist, quickly undone by presidential veto. And life will quickly return to the normal that we have unfortunately come to know.There will be no talk, at least no serious talk, of Republicans joining in a call for impeachment. There has been no growing of a backbone, no declaration that this is an irreparable bridge too far. It is a welcome moment when there is even a hint of something other than pure capitulation to Mr. Trump’s whims and tantrums. But unless and until he puts a crown on and announces he is now king, there will be no Republican mutiny. Just the occasional reminder that some in his party will not permit the president to cast all their votes for them.Robert S. NussbaumFort Lee, N.J. "

91,"WASHINGTON — The tentative deal reached late Monday by congressional negotiators to avert another government shutdown brought to the fore something President Trump has rarely seen in his time in office: reality-based programming.With Mr. Trump holding firm to his demand for a border wall with Mexico, Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill adopted another approach, namely flexibility.The agreement in principle is a new challenge for Mr. Trump as he navigates a divided government.Here are some key takeaways from the possible accord.Mr. Trump has rarely wavered in his arguments for a border wall, many of them false, including several of those made Monday night at a campaign rally in El Paso.The president insisted that the barriers built there on the border with Mexico had helped drastically reduce crime. But Republican and Democratic local officials, and federal crime statistics, showed otherwise.[Trump repeats false claim about El Paso crime, this time in El Paso]Republicans in Congress were mindful of this and the possible fallout from another shutdown. So they did what the president has chosen not to do: negotiate with Democrats to try to fashion a solution.The tentative deal does not come close to Mr. Trump’s demands, but does represent what Republicans were able to achieve given the strong resistance and the relative solidarity among Democrats.It delivers even less than a deal that Vice President Mike Pence proposed to Democrats in December. Republicans yielded on money and wall construction, while Democrats dropped demands for some aspects of migrant detention.When asked if the president would sign the deal if Congress approves, it, Senator Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama and chairman of the appropriations committee, told reporters, “We think so. We hope so.”By almost any objective measure, the president cannot claim victory based on this deal. That does not mean he will not try. In recent days, he has shifted his rhetoric from “building” a wall to “finishing” a wall.He was defiant at the rally in El Paso. “We need the wall and it has to be built,” he said.News of the possible deal broke just before Mr. Trump was to speak.He had the option of receiving a briefing on the compromise or making a scheduled appearance with Laura Ingraham of Fox News. He chose the latter. He has some work to do persuading his supporters on the right who see the wall as a core promise of his presidency. The early reviews were harsh. On Fox, Sean Hannity called the deal “a garbage compromise.”The president has retained the option of declaring a national emergency to build the border barrier. Now he will have to decide whether to accept the deal that top members of his own party in Congress negotiated, or to in effect go it alone.If Mr. Trump were to declare a national emergency, the move would assuredly draw a court challenge, and would not help him in further negotiations with Congress on other issues.Or he can continue to try to make the wall a potent issue of his 2020 re-election campaign, arguing that if he had a Republican-controlled Congress, he could deliver on his promise. That strategy failed in the 2018 midterm elections.Mr. Trump is not the only one with political imperatives in the border security debate.Members of Congress also possess a sense of self-interest that exceeds their allegiance to the president. Republicans in particular know that the wall is not broadly popular in the country, and that another government shutdown would probably hurt their party far more than Democrats. That much of the impetus for compromise seemed to come from Senate Republicans, who hold a majority in their chamber, is a clear signal they want to move past this debate.Democrats were vulnerable, too, though, as they would shoulder a sizable share of the blame for another government shutdown. And they cannot advance their agenda to show a contrast with Mr. Trump and Republicans if the government is closed.Congressional deals reached among small groups of even influential members have also been known to fall apart. For now, this deal looks promising, but nothing is final until it is final.The compromise needs to be written into legislation, both chambers of Congress need to pass it, and the president needs to sign it, all before Friday to avert another government shutdown."

93,"President Trump has been eager to show progress on construction of his long-promised wall on the border with Mexico. So eager that on Wednesday he sent a tweet showing the building of steel fencing in southern New Mexico with the video sped up to add a sense of both efficiency and urgency.He retweeted himself on Thursday with the all-caps proclamation “THE WALL IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW!” This is misleading.The government has built about 700 miles of wall and fencing along the border since 2006. The barriers, damaged by migrants trying to get through them or by the elements, need periodic repairs.The section of the barrier that Mr. Trump showcased this week was not new construction, but rather replacement for existing fencing. The money for the steel-slatted barrier came from a congressional appropriation in 2017, not from newly authorized spending in the recent deal that averted a government shutdown, or from money the president is seeking to take from other federal projects under his national emergency declaration from last week.A construction contract for the replacement bollard fencing was awarded on Jan. 22, 2018, to a company in Montana, according to a news release from United States Customs and Border Protection. “The area of the border wall replacement will be a 20-mile section of existing vehicle barrier located just west of the Santa Teresa Port of Entry and extending westward” in New Mexico, the release said. “The existing barrier will be replaced with an 18- to 30-foot-high bollard-style wall.”The contract called for the project to be completed in about 390 days. The agency also highlighted the benefits of the see-through characteristics of the bollard wall.Mr. Trump noted that the project finished ahead of schedule.Whether there will be new wall or fence construction in that area is an open question.

94,"By insisting on a border wall, President Trump is emphasizing an issue that may be popular with his base but seems unlikely to attract new supporters. There has been little polling since the government shutdown began last month, but what there is indicates that voters oppose a border wall, blame the president for the shutdown, believe the shutdown will have adverse consequences and don’t believe the government should be shut down over the wall. The wall has consistently been unpopular, with voters opposed by around a 20-point margin over months of national surveys. That makes it even less popular than the president himself. Support for the wall is closely tied to support for the president, though. Over all, polls show it consistently tracks just a few points beneath the president’s approval rating, and support for the wall is almost exclusively confined to voters who already support the president. In New York Times Upshot/Siena College polls of eight battleground congressional districts this past fall, 89 percent of voters’ views on the president and the wall were aligned, more than any other issues except the tax bill and the Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination. The relationship between support for the president and the wall is so tight that it’s hard not to wonder whether, at least for now, support for the wall is simply a function of support for the president. In other words, attitudes about President Trump might drive attitudes about the wall, rather than the other way around. It wouldn’t be much of a surprise, given how strongly voters feel about the president and the extent that he’s emphasized the issue.It’s hard to see how the issue can be used to help him win re-election. Midterm exit poll data, election results, voter file data and pre-election polls indicate that the president’s approval rating is below 50 percent in states worth at least 317 electoral votes (270 are needed to win).That’s actually a relatively healthy number for the president compared with his national approval rating (around 41 percent), but it could be a conservative estimate, and voters’ views might be unusually entrenched, given the stability of his ratings.Many presidents have won re-election after a midterm drubbing, and Mr. Trump’s approval rating isn’t particularly far from what he may wind up needing, given the G.O.P.’s current advantage in the Electoral College. But the wall has not helped so far. Data from the Fox News Voter Analysis of the midterms, a new competitor to the traditional exit polls, indicated that a majority of voters opposed the wall in states worth nearly 400 electoral votes, including in several states where the president’s approval rating was above water in the poll, like Ohio and Florida.There is tentative evidence in the Fox data that the wall is particularly unpopular in the relatively white and rural West, but somewhat more popular, at least with respect to the president’s approval rating, in the Northeast and inland South. This would follow a familiar pattern in American politics: It mirrors the president’s support in the presidential primary and tracks with longstanding measures of racial resentment. Even so, the wall still isn’t popular in Michigan or Pennsylvania, important battleground states. And voters in Ohio, a politically similar state, opposed the wall.None of these polls account for the government shutdown, but attitudes about it are unlikely to be fluid given the lack of movement on the wall during the Trump presidency. Tying the issue to an unpopular shutdown seems particularly unlikely to help and, historically, voters tend to drift against the policy preferences of the president’s party. That’s already evident on immigration more generally: Polls show voters more supportive of immigration than ever before. For all of the focus on the president’s base over the last two years, there is not much reason to think that the base, alone, is enough for the president to win re-election in a one-on-one race against a viable Democratic candidate. This could change. It has before. But with the midterms over, this is now the central political challenge facing the president. By that measure, it’s hard to see where a shutdown over the wall fits in."

(Although he did welcome his audience with an unveiled reference: “It is great to be back. I am happy to announce right now that the three-month ‘Conan’ shutdown is officially over.”)In their interview, O’Brien thanked Hanks for coming on the show despite not having a new film or book or product to discuss.

96,"An undocumented immigrant who worked at one of President Trump’s golf clubs in New Jersey for years and recently spoke out about her experience will attend his State of the Union address after being invited by her Democratic congresswoman, the woman’s lawyer and the congresswoman’s office said Wednesday.The undocumented immigrant, Victorina Morales, had worked as a housekeeper at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., since 2013, and spoke to The New York Times as part of an article published last month. The report revealed that the president’s company — the Trump Organization — was, for years, employing people at the golf club who are in the country illegally.In a brief interview on Wednesday, Ms. Morales said that on the advice of her lawyer, she stopped going to work on Dec. 4, two days before the Times article was published. Still, the lawyer, Anibal Romero, said that neither he nor his client had received notice that she had been fired. He said Ms. Morales’s employment status with the golf club was not entirely clear.Since leaving her job, Ms. Morales, who is from Guatemala, has campaigned for rights and fair treatment for undocumented immigrants. On Wednesday, she said she was pleased to have been invited to the State of the Union, that she has accepted the invitation and that she was “very proud because I am going to raise my voice for all of us immigrants.”“I’m not scared to show my face,” she said, speaking in Spanish. “I am not speaking for me, I’m speaking on behalf of millions of undocumented immigrants who live in the United States.”The congresswoman, Bonnie Watson Coleman, represents the New Jersey district in which Ms. Morales lives. The news that Ms. Morales had been invited to attend Tuesday’s State of the Union address as Ms. Watson Coleman’s guest was reported by The Washington Post on Wednesday.“Immigrants by and large are hardworking, trustworthy and skilled people who simply want to work and build better lives here,” Ms. Watson Coleman said in a statement. “For years these kinds of people were loyal and dedicated enough to be Trump Organization employees. I hope that in his State of the Union address, Donald Trump will finally acknowledge the real face of immigrants in this country — women and children fleeing violence; law-abiding, taxpaying people who would do almost anything to be Americans. And if he can’t, I’ve invited Victorina so that he may look her in her eyes to tell his lies to a familiar face.”The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday evening.Mr. Trump has made border security and protecting jobs for Americans cornerstones of his presidency, and his insistence on building a border wall led to the recent partial government shutdown. He has labeled illegal immigration “a major, major problem,” and pledged to build a border wall while his administration has carried out workplace raids and payroll audits.The Times article, published Dec. 6, said undocumented immigrants had been employed for years at the Trump National Golf Club as housekeepers, landscapers and kitchen staff. It also said they were kept on the payroll even though management was aware they had used phony documents to secure employment, as is common among undocumented immigrants.Ms. Morales previously told The Times that a manager at Bedminster had helped her secure a new fake Social Security number and legal permanent-residency card after telling her that those on file had expired.Since the article was published, about a dozen workers deemed ineligible to work in the United States because they lacked legal immigration status have been terminated at the Bedminster club, according to people familiar with the matter.Another dozen were fired at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, N.Y., this month, a development first reported by The Washington Post.The Trump Organization also said late Tuesday that it was putting in place a system to weed out undocumented immigrants who try to get jobs at its properties.“I must say, for me personally, this whole thing is truly heartbreaking,” Eric Trump, an executive vice president with the Trump Organization, said in the statement on Tuesday. “Our employees are like family, but when presented with fake documents, an employer has little choice.”He said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the Trump Organization, and that it “demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately.”"
97,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee on Tuesday denied the Pentagon's plan to shift $1 billion to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, a move that while largely symbolic, highlights the concern lawmakers have about using the defense budget to pay for the wall.Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan announced on Monday that the Department of Defense had shifted $1 billion from other military construction projects to build part of the barrier along the southern border.Democratic Representative Adam Smith, the committee's chairman, said the panel did not approve the proposed use of Pentagon funds.His stance could end up being symbolic, as the Pentagon insists it has the authority to shift the money. However, it could prompt Congress to change the law to prevent presidents from taking similar action in the future. A court battle over the issue is also likely.""The committee denies this request. The committee does not approve the proposed use of Department of Defense funds to construct additional physical barriers and roads or install lighting in the vicinity of the United States border,"" Smith said in a letter to the Department of Defense.During a House Armed Services Committee hearing that was in progress when Smith released his statement, Shanahan acknowledged that the decision to move money could impact the Pentagon's ability to reprogram funds in the future.""It was a very difficult discussion and we understand the significant downsides of losing what amounts to a privilege,"" Shanahan said.Shanahan's move to shift military dollars to pay for the wall without consulting Congress could lead lawmakers to cut off the Pentagon's authority to reprogram funds, something Smith hinted at during the hearing.Lawmakers from both political parties were critical of the decision to use military funds for the wall.""Changing decades of reprogramming practice is going to have difficult consequences for the whole government, but especially for the Department of Defense,"" Representative Mac Thornberry said in the hearing.The House failed on Tuesday to override President Donald Trump's first veto of the ""national emergency"" he declared last month to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall that Congress has not funded.Smith told the hearing that Trump's proposed $750 billion defense budget would not pass as it was proposed. That budget included $100 billion in a ""slush fund"" meant to fund ongoing wars but which the Pentagon intends to use to boost the amount of money it has available to avoid budget caps.

98,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump would not commit in an interview aired Sunday to making public the results of the special counsel’s investigation into Russia’s ties to his campaign, adding that it was time to “get rid” of the inquiry.In the interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Mr. Trump reiterated his belief that the attorney general would determine whether the public would see the results of the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. But he would not say whether he would be comfortable with the results being made public.“I don’t know,” the president said. “It depends. I have no idea what it’s going to say.”The law does not require the Justice Department to release a report, and Mr. Mueller has been silent on the issue. Last month, Trump advisers were pleased that William P. Barr, Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, opened the door to the possibility that the special counsel’s report could be shielded from the public during a Senate confirmation hearing.Mr. Trump’s wide-ranging interview with Margaret Brennan, the show’s host, was conducted days after the acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, said the investigation was nearing its end, and amid stagnant negotiations with Democrats over Mr. Trump’s demand for a border wall. Mr. Trump indicated at various points in the interview that he would use the power of his office to solve that matter and others facing his presidency.Among those matters, the president appeared to suggest, are national security and the military. He called the use of military force against Venezuela “an option.” And he indicated that he would like to keep troops in Iraq — a striking departure from his push to withdraw from Afghanistan and Syria — to “keep an eye” on Iran.“It’s perfectly situated for looking at all over different parts of the troubled Middle East rather than pulling up,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re going to keep watching and we’re going to keep seeing and if there’s trouble, if somebody is looking to do nuclear weapons or other things, we’re going to know it before they do.”On the border wall fight, the president reiterated his belief that “we have now set the table” to take action after a short-term deal to fund part of the government — a deal struck to end the longest government shutdown in history — expires on Feb. 15. In an interview with The New York Times on Thursday, Mr. Trump suggested that he had successfully made the case to Americans that the problem at the border was enough to constitute declaring a national emergency, and that Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, was doing a “disservice” to the country — both points he again made on Sunday.“People that didn’t have any idea,” Mr. Trump said. “They didn’t have a clue as to what was happening. They now know exactly what’s happening.”Mr. Trump is expected to make immigration a cornerstone of his State of the Union speech, which is scheduled for Tuesday. In the interview with CBS, Mr. Trump once again accused Democrats, in particular Ms. Pelosi, of ignoring urgent problems at the border, which included human trafficking and what Mr. Trump called an “invasion” of human traffickers into the country.Though Mr. Trump seems intent on ignoring congressional negotiations, lawmakers insisted on Sunday that they were still trying. Senator Richard C. Shelby, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a member of the committee working to reach a deal, admitted that it was too early to say whether the negotiations could be successful.“I think that the president is dead set on keeping his campaign promise,” Mr. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” He acknowledged that Mr. Trump probably had some legal merits for declaring a national emergency over the border wall, but he pleaded for the committee to be allowed to do its work.“If people leave us alone,” Mr. Shelby added, “we’ll get this done by Wednesday night.”He said that the committee had invited experts with knowledge of the southwestern border to testify this week on exactly what is needed for border security. Mr. Shelby expressed optimism that hearing from those experts “could move us off of” the semantic debate over a wall or fencing.“It’s a question of how do we get off the politics and on to the substance,” he said.Other members of the bipartisan committee — Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas, and Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota — doubled down on their respective party’s positions on “Fox News Sunday.” Mr. Cuellar, who represents parts of the border, dismissed the president’s reasoning for the wall as built on “a false premise.”In the CBS interview, Mr. Trump fought back against criticism of his wall and other policies. He responded to warnings that his administration was risking a resurgence of terrorist groups by promising the rapid withdrawal of troops from Syria and Afghanistan by saying that he “ran against 17 Republicans” and won.“I’ll leave intelligence there,” Mr. Trump said, “and if I see nests forming, I’ll do something about it.”Last week, Mr. Trump showed similar defiance in suggesting that his intelligence chiefs “go back to school” for issuing a threat assessment saying that North Korea was unlikely to give up its nuclear program and that Iran is not, for now, taking steps necessary to make a bomb.Mr. Trump said that he would ultimately rely on his own counsel if he disagreed with intelligence assessments.The president also indicated that the power of his affectionate letter writing with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, might persuade Mr. Kim to drop his nuclear plans. Mr. Trump has at least six letters from Mr. Kim that he enjoys sharing with people who visit him in the Oval Office.“We have had tremendous correspondence that some people have seen and can’t even believe it,” Mr. Trump said. “Now that doesn’t mean we’re going to make a deal. But certainly I think we have a very good chance of making a deal.”Other leaders did not receive such praise. Mr. Trump said that he had declined a meeting with Nicolás Maduro, the embattled president of Venezuela, days after the Trump administration said it recognized Juan Guaidó, the 35-year-old opposition figure, as the country’s rightful leader.“I decided at the time, ‘no,’ because so many really horrible things have been happening in Venezuela when you look at that country,” Mr. Trump said.With his cabinet in flux, Mr. Trump dismissed as “fake news” the reports that Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, had asked Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state and his most visible emissary in negotiations with North Korea, to consider leaving to run for a Senate seat in Kansas.Mr. Pompeo confirmed that discussion over a week ago. The secretary of state said that he had appreciated the call, but that he had a “very full plate.”The CBS interview was broadcast during the president’s first visit in months to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, where he spent Saturday golfing with Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus. On Sunday, the president hit the golf course again amid planning for his annual Super Bowl party.The president told CBS that he loved to watch football, but that he would not encourage his youngest son, Barron, 12, to participate in such a dangerous sport."
99,"Donald Trump has a Congress problem. He can’t get Republicans to promote his policies. And when he forces the issue — as with his border wall — he can’t win their support.But most Americans don’t know that. After all, Republican legislators voted with the president well over 90 percent of the time during the 115th Congress. Record numbers of appellate judges were confirmed, and the president signed major tax legislation. Many observers have concluded that Mr. Trump dominates the Republican Party, and his loyal base holds congressional Republicans tautly in line.But discerning legislative influence is more difficult than it appears. Throughout the first two years of the Trump presidency, Republican leaders in Congress skillfully used a variety of tactics to minimize the president’s influence and maximize their own control over public policy.Critically, congressional Republicans have adopted strategies that make the public — and more important, his conservative base — think Mr. Trump is in command. To casual followers of political news, the visible evidence from congressional votes and news releases suggests a powerful president leading a loyal congressional party. In reality, Republican legislators have hidden their influence, purposefully disguising a weak president with little clout on Capitol Hill while also preserving party unity.In his 1960 book, “Presidential Power and the Modern Presidents,” the political scientist Richard Neustadt argued that presidential power is “the power to persuade.” Strong presidents have significant influence over public policy because they wield informal power, developing a reputation for getting their way and punishing those who impede their progress. Weak presidents — like Mr. Trump — fail to persuade, allowing competing political actors in Washington to block their goals and assert their own influence.Mr. Neustadt identified a second resource that aids in presidential persuasion: public prestige. Political actors in Washington may not fear the president, but they may think twice about standing in his way if they perceive the public response to doing so may hurt them.On this dimension, Mr. Trump appears to be stronger. His overall approval rating is very poor, but he is extremely popular among Republican voters. And his sizable conservative base is ready and willing to turn on elected Republicans in primary elections should they displease the president. The infrastructure of conservative media — Fox News, talk radio — strongly supports (and influences) Mr. Trump, augmenting this public power. Mr. Trump may not have much ability to sway Democrats, but Republican officials credibly fear crossing him.Nevertheless, congressional Republicans have found a solution to this challenge: agenda-setting. Political power is not simply the ability to influence the positions citizens or lawmakers take on issues, but also the ability to control what issues are discussed and voted on.Throughout the last Congress, Republican leaders simply declined to take up legislation that reflected the priority of the president but not their own. There were no votes on immigration restrictions or funding for a border wall, protectionist trade legislation or infrastructure.The Trump budget proposals for the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years requested deep cuts in nondefense discretionary spending. Congressional Republicans quietly buried them and delivered bills both years that increased nondefense spending.Such “negative” agenda-setting leaves little trace; without a vote, it becomes difficult for opponents or voters to identify or understand what happened. President Trump’s priorities weren’t voted down in the House or the Senate; they were just never considered.Agenda-setting also provides congressional leaders “positive” power to set legislative priorities. Mr. Trump has famously shown little interest in the details of policy, and Republican leaders in Washington easily convinced him to accept as his priorities the party’s orthodox issues of Affordable Care Act repeal and tax cuts during his first year in office.By setting the agenda and having the president sign on, Republican legislators controlled policy while sharing the position of the president. When Republicans held a White House celebration after passing tax legislation, Mr. Trump claimed credit, and legislators publicly praised the “Trump” tax bill, and the president himself.This trade-off, in which orthodox Republicans get policy control and Mr. Trump gets the glory, is also apparent in the nominations of judges and executive branch officials. The president was quite successful in having judicial nominees confirmed. But virtually all of his confirmed judges have been standard conservatives; likewise, his successful executive branch appointments much more reflect Republican priorities than his own.By privately influencing Mr. Trump to nominate people who reflect Republican priorities, congressional leaders not only win substantively, but the president gets to show off a perfect record of confirmations on the Senate floor, and a high rate of Republican support for his nominees.Despite this, Mr. Trump has had an unusually large number of nominees rejected by the Senate, many of whom were put forth without previous input from congressional leaders. But this, too, has been done less visibly, with candidates withdrawing or being defeated in committee rather than being rejected in actual votes on the Senate floor.The logic of agenda-setting also explains the reticence of congressional Republicans to conduct meaningful oversight of Mr. Trump or his administration. Full-scale legitimate investigations require visible agenda-setting. They cannot be accomplished by omission or in private.Negative and positive agenda-setting served the Republican policy agenda well during the first two years of the Trump administration. In December, however, in backing out of a Republican-constructed Senate deal that would have kept the government open, the president forcefully asserted his own legislative agenda-setting.Given the power of the veto as a presidential tool of negative agenda-setting, exasperated Republican senators had little choice but to allow Mr. Trump to take control of the border wall negotiations.Congressional leaders, however, continued to use subtle agenda-setting tactics. The majority leader, Mitch McConnell, became largely absent from the public debate, declining to take part in post-negotiation news conferences at the White House and flatly declaring he would not bring legislation to the Senate floor until the president and Democratic leaders had reached a deal that could pass — and Republicans would not have to visibly cross the president in difficult public votes.These tactics yielded impressive results. While a majority of Americans blamed Mr. Trump for the partial government shutdown, very few blamed congressional Republicans. The G.O.P. leaders have managed to not get the blame for the shutdown or get blamed by the base for abandoning the president.Now that Democrats control the House, Republican leaders may find it more difficult to limit the president’s legislative role. Mr. Trump will be less likely to accept a mostly theatric role in interparty negotiations and, as shown in the shutdown, may be more interested than congressional Republicans in public confrontation.This bodes poorly for legislative prospects in the new Congress. In our current partisan environment, the visible engagement of the president in the legislative process tends to polarize debate on even seemingly nonpartisan issues. Republican leaders know they’ve lost much of their policymaking capacity. They may soon realize they also can no longer mask the weakness of Mr. Trump."
100,"SANTA ROSA DE COPAN, Honduras — Hundreds of Hondurans traveling in vehicles and on foot converged on the Guatemalan border on Tuesday, part of a new migrant caravan bound for the United States which President Trump has already used as fresh ammunition in his fight for border wall funding.The caravan began departing from the northern Honduran city of San Pedro Sula on Monday night. Others set off throughout the day on Tuesday. Honduran authorities estimated that between 800 and 1,000 people were in the caravan, while officials from Honduras’ National Human Rights Commission put the range between 1,500 and 2,000.Mr. Trump, whose dispute with Congress over his demand for $5.7 billion for a border wall between Mexico and the United States has led to a partial shutdown of the federal government since Dec. 22, warned on Twitter on Tuesday about the new mass migration.“A big new Caravan is heading up to our Southern Border from Honduras,” he wrote. “Only a Wall, or Steel Barrier, will keep our Country safe! Stop playing political games and end the Shutdown!”The new caravan is following in the footsteps of several other large migrant groups that left Central America last fall and crossed Guatemala and Mexico, with thousands of participants ending up in or near the city of Tijuana in northern Mexico.The Trump administration has excoriated Central American and Mexican governments for failing to stop the caravans, which met little resistance at the various international borders they crossed on the way north.In a show of muscle on Tuesday, however, the Honduran government vowed vigilance at its border with Guatemala and said it had detained 60 minors without proper travel documents to leave Honduras.“The border and the illegal crossings are reinforced,” Julián Pacheco, the Honduran security minister, told reporters on Tuesday. “If people are going to leave, they have to leave through legal, authorized points.”The Mexican government has also vowed to harden its southern border to block the passage of any undocumented migrants in the latest caravan. Olga Sánchez, the country’s interior minister, said that officials had identified about 370 illegal points of entry along its border with Guatemala and planned to monitor them to prevent illegal crossings.Tens of thousands of Hondurans and other Central Americans have migrated north in recent years, fleeing rampant violence and poverty. Some have chosen to move in large, semi-coordinated groups or caravans, offering participants a degree of security against the many perils that lurk on the migrant trail, including muggings, extortion and rape.Until last year, most caravans went largely unnoticed. But a migration that began in southern Mexico last spring drew the attention of Mr. Trump, who warned that the group posed a threat to the United States’ sovereignty.An even larger group set off from Honduras in October, drawing the ire of Mr. Trump as well as international media attention. It was followed by other groups and by mid-November, more than 6,000 migrants, nearly all from Central America, had made it as far as Tijuana.Hundreds of them have applied for asylum in the United States while others have tried to cross the border illegally. Still others have decided to remain in Mexico, availing themselves of the Mexican government’s offer of humanitarian visas and work permits. Hundreds more, frustrated with their inability to cross legally into the United States, have been voluntarily repatriated to their homes in Central America.But neither the dashed hopes of so many from last year’s caravans nor Mr. Trump’s threats seemed to discourage many of the participants in the latest caravan.“Even though a wall is being built, that’s not going to stop us,” said Junior Aleman, 17, who was walking with a group of about a dozen migrants through the mountains of western Honduras on Tuesday. The group had left San Pedro Sula on Monday night and, through a combination of walking and hitching rides, were making their way toward the Honduras-Guatemala border crossing at Agua Caliente.He intended to try to cross illegally into the United States and head for Virginia, where two of his aunts lived. There, he said, he planned to find a job — something that had been hard to come by in Honduras.“There’s no work and I want to help my family,” he said."

103,"“I didn’t need to do this,” President Trump insisted at a Rose Garden appearance on Friday, as he declared a national emergency aimed at shaking loose a few billion dollars in financing for his beloved border wall.The president’s assertion was both ludicrous and self-defeating. If a declaration was unnecessary and the wall on track (the wall is “very very on its way,” the president said earlier in the week), how could he claim to be addressing an emergency? As Mr. Trump explained it, “But I’d rather do it much faster.” A presidential desire for speed does not constitute a crisis — no matter how eager a president is to camouflage his failures.In reality, the wall is not a done deal, and Mr. Trump has spent the past few months — the past two years, really — failing to convince either Congress or Mexico to pay for it. This week’s bipartisan spending bill, which contained no more wall money than the one over which Mr. Trump shut down the government in December, was a particularly humiliating defeat.Desperate to save face, the president and his team cooked up a nonemergency emergency with the aim of seizing funds already appropriated for other purposes. Currently, the plan is to pull $2.5 billion from the military’s drug interdiction program, $3.6 billion from its construction budget and $600 million from the Treasury Department’s drug forfeiture fund. The White House plans to “backfill” the money it is taking from the Pentagon in future budgets.And so, in a breathtaking display of executive disregard for the separation of powers, the White House is thumbing its nose at Congress, the Constitution and the will of the American people, the majority of whom oppose a border wall.Even as he spun this as an act of strong leadership, Mr. Trump acknowledged that his declaration resolves nothing and creates a host of legal, legislative and political troubles. He predicted that the move would prompt swift legal pushback, which it did. Less than four hours after the announcement, a government watchdog group filed suit, demanding that the Department of Justice hand over “documents concerning the legal authority of the president to invoke emergency powers.” Soon after, the State of California announced its intention to sue. On Thursday, even before the announcement, Protect Democracy and the Niskanen Center announced plans to file on behalf of El Paso County and the Border Network for Human Rights. So the floodgates are open.Mr. Trump predicted that he would lose the first couple of court rounds, particularly in California federal courts, but would ultimately be vindicated by the Supreme Court. Critics of the move expect things to turn out differently. Whatever the outcome, the legal issues are complex, and the case could wind up bogged down indefinitely, meaning not much wall for now.Moving from the legal to the political realm, Republican lawmakers will very likely find themselves in a pickle. Congress has the power to override a national emergency declaration by passing a joint resolution. To prevent opponents from stalling the bill indefinitely, once one chamber passes the resolution, the other must hold a vote on it within 18 calendar days. House Democrats have already announced their intention to hold such a vote, and are expected to prevail. This will then put Senate Republicans in the position of having to vote on whether to support a presidential grab of Congress’s power. To survive a presidential veto, such a measure would need to pass with two thirds of the votes in both chambers — which seems unlikely. But the vote itself will prove awkward for Republicans, forcing them to go on record as to whether they have officially abandoned their constitutional duties.Then there’s the violence this will do the budget process — not exactly a smooth-running machine as is. But if members of Congress start worrying that money appropriated for one purpose will be clawed back by the White House and handed over for a different one, look for spending battles to get bloodier still. Some of the money to be raided for the wall will come from military construction projects in Republican states like Kentucky and North Carolina. Which brings us to the question of precedent. In defending his declaration, Mr. Trump and his team keep asserting that emergency declarations are not unusual. The president called them “a great thing” that other presidents have done “many, many times.”Since 1976, such declarations have been used 59 times. But most have been uncontroversial and involved matters of foreign policy. Declaring an emergency simply because Congress refused to fund the president’s pet project is seen even by members of his own party as setting a dangerous precedent. As Senator Susan Collins, the Maine Republican, warned, “For the president to use it to repurpose billions of dollars that Congress has appropriated for other purposes and that he has previously signed into law, strikes me as undermining the appropriations process, the vote of Congress and being of dubious constitutionality.”Speaker Nancy Pelosi raised broader issues on Friday. “This issue transcends partisan politics and goes to the core of the Founders’ conception for America, which commands Congress to limit an overreaching executive,” she said in a statement with Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader. “The president’s emergency declaration, if unchecked, would fundamentally alter the balance of powers, inconsistent with our Founders’ vision.”“We call upon our Republican colleagues to join us to defend the Constitution,” they added. “The Congress cannot let the president shred the Constitution.”Mr. Trump betrays no interest in the collateral damage wreaked by his actions. This move will come back to bite him and his party. The question is when, and how hard."
104,"EL CENTRO, Calif. — Donald Trump was on the television, but no matter. Ferdinando Galeana’s customers were watching their plates, not the president.As Mr. Trump delivered an ominous State of the Union address from Washington, which warned repeatedly about the dangers along the southwest border, Mr. Galeana dutifully tended to orders of tacos, horchata and micheladas at D’Poly, the Mexican eatery his family runs here about 10 miles from the Mexican border. What the president was saying on the screen behind him, said Mr. Galeana, would not help his small business, his family or his five dozen employees.“What we need here is someone to help people looking for jobs,” said Mr. Galeana, whose wife and American-born children work with him at the restaurant. “The things he says, they make me laugh.”Residents of El Centro and several other towns along the California-Mexico border have watched with curiosity and apprehension in recent years as the president has escalated his calls for a wall along the southwest frontier. Mr. Trump repeated his warnings about such perils again Tuesday.“Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis,” Mr. Trump said during his speech, delivered not long after a bitter impasse over funding for a border wall that shut down the government for 35 days. “Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our very dangerous southern border.”[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]On a busy Tuesday night at D’Poly, patrons occasionally glanced at the screen that played the president’s address to the nation. Most paid it no mind at all. Mr. Galeana and others said they had largely tuned out what the president has to say because, too often, his rhetoric is disconnected from what their communities really want. They have struggled to reconcile the president’s warnings about threatening conditions on the border with their own experiences living in this quiet, largely agricultural hamlet.“What he’s saying on the news is different from what we’re seeing here,” said Cecy Magallanes, 45, who is originally from Mexicali, not far across the border in Mexico, and works as a school bus driver.She said Mr. Trump’s previous calls for a border wall seemed “like a strategy to get votes.”“His wall — always his wall,” added Cesar Salas, Ms. Magallanes’s husband, shaking his head.Located on El Centro’s Main Street, D’Poly and its clientele embody the biculturalism of border towns across the Southwest. Farm workers, white-collar professionals, big families and off-duty Border Patrol agents congregate here for tacos, sopes and flavored juices. Modern and minimalist, the restaurant’s gray walls and dark wood floors could be the backdrop of an elegant Crate and Barrel photo shoot — save for an arresting pink mural of Frida Kahlo that instantly sets the room apart. Flashes of pastel pop from behind a tiled bar, which includes a display of “Dia de los Muertos” statuettes.[Read: State of the Union Fact Check: What Trump Got Right and Wrong]English and Spanish are heard virtually interchangeably at table after table. Latin pop plays in the background, songs like “Dónde Estarás” by the Mexican electrocumbia musician Raymix.Mr. Galeana, who owns the restaurant along with his wife, Teresa, said he and his family decorated with the idea of showcasing Mexican culture in a modern setting, a concept that “so often is lost” in Mexican restaurants in favor of stereotypical décor like sombreros.“Our idea was to show that Mexico is not just what the stereotypes say: It’s so much more,” he said. “We are proud of our culture, and we want to show that.”That is what many of those here say they wish the president understood: Immigration and cross-national exchanges are celebrated in these towns along the border.Hildy Carrillo, the executive director of the Calexico Chamber of Commerce, has been sharply critical of President Trump’s immigration policies. She watched with exasperation last year when Mr. Trump called the replacement of the town’s border barrier “the start of our Southern Border WALL!” She said she feared the president’s remark would turn Calexico into an anti-immigration symbol and make it seem unsafe.For that reason, Ms. Carrillo, a Democrat, chose not to watch the speech Tuesday — “one of the few I’ve ever missed,” she said. She went shopping instead, she said, because “I refuse to get stressed out having to listen to him.”Such frustrations are frequently expressed in towns along the southwest border, which spans nearly 2,000 miles from California to Texas. Public officials from El Paso took to social media after Tuesday night’s speech to accuse the president of intentionally misleading the public after he said a border barrier had turned around high crime rates in the city. “Simply put, walls work and walls save lives,” Mr. Trump said.“He lies. @POTUS is once again lying and using the #SOTU address to spread falsehoods about our beloved city of El Paso,” Representative Veronica Escobar, a Democrat who represents El Paso, said on Twitter.A fact check by The El Paso Times on the matter, prepared in January but circulated heavily again on Tuesday night, found the city’s crime rate peaked in 1993, but by 2006 had sharply declined to its lowest level in decades. Construction on the border fence that Mr. Trump appeared to reference began in 2008.The paper also pointed out that, before the Bush-era fence was approved, El Paso and Ciudad Juárez had been separated by a border barrier for decades.Before the speech on Tuesday, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, a Democrat, denounced “the president’s charade of border fear-mongering” and ordered the withdrawal of most National Guard troops stationed at the border in her state.Many people living along the border, including Mexican immigrants, say they understand the desire for strong border security. But in conversations here in El Centro on Tuesday, even those who agreed with some of the president’s positions were quick to point out that his statements about immigrants, and Mexicans in particular, made them disinclined to support him.Aleyda Montejano, 21, who is Mexican-American, lives in the town of Imperial but goes to hairstyling school in Mexicali because it is less expensive. She said that she agreed with the president that there needed to be a deterrent to illegal immigration. But she said that message was difficult to separate from his tone.“The way he talks about Mexicans, I just don’t agree with it,” she said. “The reason people come here is to have a better life. But, about the border, there are some people that cross illegally and that’s not right.”Brian Arturo Posada, 19, an American citizen who grew up in Mexicali, said that he was sympathetic to some of the things Republicans in Washington talk about, like preventing abuse of social benefits such as unemployment insurance. But he said the president’s tone in past speeches too frequently crossed the line when he talked about immigrants and Mexican laborers.“The only thing that really I didn’t like was when he said all Mexicans are gangsters,” he said. “That’s not true, it’s not true. And when he was keeping those kids in jails, that made me really mad.”Meanwhile, several Mexican laborers in the region said they fear that the president’s warnings about immigrants and crime exacerbates discrimination against them.Cristina Bejarano, 34, a Mexican laborer who picks cilantro and lives in Calexico, about 12 miles south of El Centro, said that life for her and other immigrants in the region can be difficult because of the nature of farm work. But she said she moved to the United States two years ago because, even if farm labor is backbreaking, her life and prospects are better here than in Mexico.She said she wished President Trump and others could understand that.“A lot of people haven’t had a chance to meet any Mexicans,” Ms. Bejarano said. “They say we’re all criminals when we’re not. Just because we’re brown doesn’t mean we’re dirty.”"
105,"“Arrested Development,” the comedy about the Bluth family that upended so many television conventions, is coming back. Again.On Tuesday, Netflix announced that eight episodes comprising the second half of its fifth season will be released on the streaming service on March 15.In these episodes, according to a news release, “Pressures mount on the Bluth family as Buster heads toward a murder trial. The Bluth company is on the hook to build a ‘smart’ border wall that puts them in debt and risks exposing a software hoax perpetrated by George-Michael. Soon the gay mafia is involved and it appears that even Michael can’t save the family this time. And Tobias becomes a Golden Girl.”Last spring, the show’s public image came under harsh scrutiny during the press tour for the first half of Season 5 after The New York Times published a controversial interview featuring most of the main cast. Tensions ran high when the subject turned to Jeffrey Tambor (who plays George Sr.), who had recently been fired from the Amazon series “Transparent” following accusations of sexual misconduct on set. Tambor admitted he “had a temper” and “yelled at people.”In response, Jason Bateman (Michael) suggested that Tambor’s “atypical behavior” was the nature of the entertainment industry. Alia Shawkat (Maeby Fünke) interjected: “But that doesn’t mean it’s acceptable.”Jessica Walter (Lucille) teared up when she spoke of her own experiences with Tambor: “Verbally, yes, he harassed me, but he did apologize.”Almost 60 years of working, I’ve never had anybody yell at me like that on a set and it’s hard to deal with,” Walter continued, “but I’m over it now.”Following criticism of the statements made seemingly in defense of Tambor, Netflix canceled its U.K. press tour; some of the actors, including Bateman and his co-star Tony Hale, who also participated in the interview, publicly apologized for their comments.It’s unclear whether these new episodes of “Arrested Development” will be the last. In an interview on the “Late Night with Seth Meyers Podcast,” David Cross (Tobias Fünke) said, “I’ve learned to say ‘never say never,’ but I can’t see it happening again, I think for a number of reasons.”"

107,"From the ongoing government shutdown to foreign policy changes in the Middle East, it’s been a busy week in American politics. Here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed (and some links if you’d like to read further).___________________The partial government shutdown has entered its 22nd day, making it the longest in American history.Privately, many Republicans say the stalemate over the border wall has been made exponentially worse by White House ineptitude on Capitol Hill. On Friday, the president stepped back from declaring a national emergency under pressure from congressional Republicans, but there is still no end in sight.On Tuesday night, President Trump used his first prime-time Oval Office address — one that was filled with misleading assertions — to pressure Congress into paying for his long-promised border wall.A day after storming out of a meeting in the White House with congressional leaders, Mr. Trump traveled to the southern border on Thursday to bolster his case for a wall, and he canceled his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.As effects of the shutdown pile up, more Americans are feeling the bite. The nation’s air travel system could be at risk; farmers that stood with Mr. Trump during the election are at a breaking point; and 800,000 federal employees still haven’t received a paycheck.Additional Reading•  A Shut Down Government Actually Costs More Than an Open One• The Many Ways Trump Has Said Mexico Will Pay for the Wall•  On the Border, Little Enthusiasm for a Wall: ‘We Have Other Problems That Need Fixing’•  Before Trump, Steve King Set the Agenda for the Wall and Anti-Immigrant PoliticsIn the days after President Trump fired James B.

A formatting error by Paul Manafort’s lawyer revealed that Mr. Manafort, a former manager of the Trump campaign, shared polling data with a man tied to Russian intelligence.House Democrats summoned Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, for a classified briefing about the government’s plans to end sanctions on companies linked to a Russian oligarch, Oleg V. Deripaska. Mr. Mnuchin told lawmakers that the White House played no formal role in the decision, and he said later that he would consider delaying the lifting of the sanctions so skeptics in Congress could have more time to review it.Additional Reading• Prosecutors Examining Ukrainians Who Flocked to Trump Inaugural•  Supreme Court Stays Out of Secret Case That May Be Part of Mueller Probe• Democrats Start Investigative Gears, but SlowlyPresident Trump’s national security adviser, John R.

The speech was scheduled for last month, but was postponed because of the partial government shutdown, prompted by Mr. Trump’s demand that Congress pay for a wall along the southern border with Mexico.Were you watching? Why or why not?Though we welcome your reactions to what the president said — and to the Democratic response — in this forum we’re chiefly asking how you think our country is doing right now.Are we better off than we were a year ago? Two years ago? Why or why not? What are the main issues we face, in your opinion? In general, how strong is the state of our union right now?In Trump Asks for Unity, but Presses Hard Line on Immigration, The Times summarizes the speech and the reaction to it:Students, please tell us:— Is the state of our union strong, in your opinion? In other words, how do you think the country is doing right now? Are we doing better, worse or the same as we were a year ago? What should be the nation’s priorities? What are the biggest issues we face? For instance, do you agree with President Trump’s focus on immigration and the need for a border wall?— What is your reaction to President Trump’s State of the Union address? What, to you, were the most memorable moments or lines? How effective do you think it was over all?— What reactions to the address — whether from political commentators, members of Congress, social media or your friends and family — did you find most interesting? Why?— Which descriptions of the state of our union that you have heard or read this week do you find most compelling or persuasive?

111,"During the June 1788 convention at which Virginia ratified the Constitution, Patrick Henry, a critic of the proposed government, accused James Madison, its foremost defender, of failing to protect against corrupt or lawless politicians. “Is there no virtue among us?” Madison replied. “If there be not, we are in a wretched situation. No theoretical checks — no form of government can render us secure.”That exchange is worth recalling as the House of Representatives prepares for a vote scheduled for Tuesday on whether to override President Trump’s veto of a congressional resolution to nullify the national emergency he declared to build a border wall. The House is almost certain to fail to muster the two-thirds majority required of both legislative chambers to override a presidential veto. It seems likely that the Senate, for its part, will not even do its constitutional duty and try. Republicans, especially Republican senators, are being justifiably excoriated for failing to defend congressional authority.But blaming them alone misdiagnoses the constitutional problem. Congress’s impotence indicates an appalling failure of constitutional awareness and education in the United States. The Republican base — like the Democratic base during President Barack Obama’s tenure — is demanding, and getting, a constitution of expediency rather than of law.As many observers have noted, the Republican senators who criticized the emergency declaration and then voted to uphold it — Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina foremost among them — all face re-election in 2020. Mr. Trump is popular in their states, and their constituents are evidently more concerned with building a border wall than with the constitutional niceties according to which it is funded. These senators’ failure to “refine and enlarge the public views,” in Madison’s phrase, is a dereliction of their duty under Article I of the Constitution. But the root problem is the constitutional views that elected officials are supposed to refine.One Republican senator who voted against the emergency declaration, Roy Blunt of Missouri, was disinvited from a political event in his state by a local party official who demanded of him, “Why could you not support my president in the emergency declaration?” So long as the public does not care whether Congress protects its institutional turf — or, worse, is hostile to it doing so — the constitutional architecture cannot stand.Madison understood this. One of the most consistent themes of his writings is that the public always governs eventually in the United States. “In republican Government the majority however composed, ultimately give the law,” he wrote before the constitutional convention. Alexander Hamilton, too, explained that liberty in the United States “must altogether depend on public opinion, and on the general spirit of the people and of the government.”The constitutional imperative is to slow down policymaking so that passion can dissipate and reason can take hold. That requires civic virtues that constitutional education must teach. They involve not merely knowledge but ultimately temperament. The foremost is patience: Constitutional mechanisms work slowly by design. Another essential virtue is public-spiritedness: In a sprawling republic, those with strong views must recognize that they share the political community with fellow citizens whose competing views are equally intense. Both patience and public spirit entail caring not just what happens, but also how it happens.If, by contrast, civic education focuses solely on outcomes at the expense of process, it will produce a politically entitled people immune to these virtues or to any civic quality other than demanding what you want when you want it. Yet this is substantially how civic education — which occurs in schools but also in the public square, when the news media reports on issues and when public figures discuss them — treats the constitutional order.In schools, civic education tends to accord outsize importance to the Bill of Rights at the expense of the more complex topics of separation of powers, federalism and other pillars of the constitutional edifice. Hamilton had opposed a Bill of Rights in part because he thought these mechanisms safeguarded rights better than protections inscribed on paper could. Journalists and politicians equally obsess over winners and losers. The public hears whose ox is being gored, but too rarely the importance of the constitutional process by which the goring occurs.A Madisonian people, by contrast, will care about constitutional integrity in addition to political outcomes. This is for constitutional reasons but also for selfish ones: The power whose use one celebrates today will be wielded by a leader with whom one disagrees tomorrow, a lesson Democrats who endorsed Mr. Obama’s unilateral executive orders are now learning. Such citizens will also understand that they occupy the country along with more than 325 million fellow citizens whose views must be accommodated.Crucially, they will not tolerate members of Congress who surrender legislative authority, even for results to some voters’ momentary liking, because they will prioritize enduring constitutionalism over transient policies. They will realize, too, that maintaining legislative authority, which is more immediately responsive to local concerns, serves their own interests as well.Finally, some group among a Madisonian people will have the foresight to step off the cynical and anti-constitutional carousel according to which President George W. Bush did it so Mr. Obama could do it so Mr. Trump might as well, too.None of this excuses members of Congress from their duties, which sometimes include withstanding public opinion. Even the Democratic justification for an override vote sure to fail is, as the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, put it, to create a record so the issue can be resolved by the courts.To her credit, Ms. Pelosi did say that “we are Article I, the first branch of government.” But she was less reticent about executive power when Mr. Obama acted unilaterally on immigration. In both cases, the House should have defended its constitutional turf. It is no solution — on the contrary, it presents its own constitutional problems — for one party to ask the courts to provide the institutional protection the whole House declined to provide itself.As for the Senate, one purpose of its members’ six-year terms is to enable what Madison called “great firmness” in resisting public whims and defending constitutional principles. So much for that. Every legislator is accountable for how he or she votes on the emergency declaration, but Madison expected those immediately facing re-election to capitulate more easily to public opinion. There are worse political sins. Harsher criticism should be reserved for senators who caved without facing immediate electoral consequences.But their constituents who demanded this constitutional surrender — especially those who profess fidelity to the Constitution as the bedrock of their politics — deserve the sternest rebuke. It is an axiom of republican politics that everyone incurs criticism sooner or later, except the people. Yet if the people care solely about expediency at the expense of law, we are in a “wretched situation” from which the Constitution will not rescue us."
112,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s plan to spend billions of dollars more on his border wall than Congress approved involves more than his invocation of emergency powers to redirect military construction funds. Before spending any of that money, Mr. Trump first intends to tap $2.5 billion in other Defense Department funds under a different claim of executive authority.The Pentagon has not yet determined which programs will be cut to meet Mr. Trump’s demands. The acting defense secretary, Patrick M. Shanahan, told reporters over the weekend that he had set in motion a process to identify candidates, but had made no decisions.“I just want to make a point of this,” Mr. Shanahan added. “We are following the law, using the rules, and we’re not bending the rules, O.K.?”No. Mr. Trump is planning to tap different pots of money in sequence, and only the fourth and last pot involves the emergency-powers statute. Before reaching that last pot, Mr. Trump plans to spend the roughly $1.4 billion that Congress approved for new border barriers in the recent spending deal and then about $600 million from a Treasury Department asset-forfeiture fund.The third pot of potential wall money would be $2.5 billion drawn from a military counterdrug account under a different statute — one that does not involve any emergency declaration. In it, Congress has authorized the Pentagon to support other agencies’ counternarcotics efforts by constructing “roads or fences and installation of lighting to block drug-smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States.”On its face, the statute appears to authorize spending only for construction. If it cannot be stretched to encompass land acquisition, the $2.5 billion would most likely be useful only for building barriers on property the government already owns. Either way, time is short. Mr. Shanahan said that “the money that could be reprogrammed for counterdrug is money that would have to be spent in this year.” The fiscal year ends on Sept. 30.No. When Congress passed the most recent Pentagon spending law last September, it appropriated about $517 million for counternarcotics support activities. Of that amount, about $100 million remains readily available for border barrier spending, an administration official said.The Trump administration plans to use the counterdrug account as a temporary way station for more than $2 billion in funds taken from unrelated military programs. The administration will first transfer the funds into the counterdrug account, and then treat them as money that can be used for border barriers.But the Defense Department has not yet decided which other programs to drain of their funding.One military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the Pentagon had been scouring its $700 billion budget in search of accounts with unspent funds to target. For example, the official said, an Army personnel account designated for paying bonuses to new recruits appears to have excess money because the service has been falling short of its recruiting goals lately.But reaching the total will require some painful decisions.“All of this money has been assigned for other purposes,” Mr. Shanahan said, adding, “It really is a trade-off.”A federal law, the Anti-Deficiency Act, generally makes it a crime for an official to spend money on something in excess of what Congress has appropriated for that purpose.But the Trump administration says it can lawfully move other military funding into the Pentagon’s counterdrug account under “general transfer authority,” a power Congress has given to the defense secretary. This power gives Mr. Shanahan, under certain conditions, the flexibility to move up to $4 billion around from one purpose to another.But there are certain limits. Among them, it can be used only on an item that is “higher priority” than its original purpose and meets a standard of “unforeseen military requirements” and “in no case where the item for which funds are requested has been denied by the Congress.” This raises the question of whether Mr. Trump’s desire to spend more on his wall than Congress appropriated qualifies under that standard.Martin Lederman, a Georgetown University law professor who helped run the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel during the Obama administration, said that he had found no example of litigation in which a court had tested such “arcane language and conditions” in the transfer law, leaving few guideposts for how far the administration can stretch it.Maybe. A deluge of lawsuits are asking judges to block Mr. Trump’s executive actions on wall spending. A lawsuit filed by a coalition of 16 states, for example, includes the accusation that Mr. Trump exceeded his legal authority in seeking to divert the funding for the military counterdrug account to use on border barriers.The “general transfer authority” provision says Mr. Shanahan must notify Congress promptly of all such transfers. Another military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the Defense Department had scheduled a meeting of senior officials on Thursday to iron out where redirected funds will be taken from, and planned to take those recommendations to the appropriations committees in Congress on Friday.As a matter of constitutional law, if Congress has given the executive branch the authority to redirect funds, the appropriations committees cannot veto any particular exercise of that power. But as a matter of political reality, executive branch officials generally heed committee objections. The idea is to preserve a harmonious relationship with appropriators who could slash their next budget.Especially because the House is controlled by Democrats, this norm appears likely to put the Pentagon in a bind. The House Appropriations Committee chairwoman, Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, has expressed deep skepticism about Mr. Trump’s plan, blasting him for ignoring “Congress’s refusal to fund his wasteful border wall,” which she called “a political vanity project.”The Defense Department declined to address what it will do if congressional appropriators tell it not to move the money."

114,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s evolving definition of a border wall animated negotiations to end a partial government shutdown on Sunday, while House Democrats moved to increase pressure on the president by vowing to pass individual bills to reopen targeted departments that handle critical functions like tax refunds and food stamps.“I informed my folks to say that we’ll build a steel barrier,” Mr. Trump told reporters after returning to the White House from a senior staff meeting at Camp David. He added of the Democrats, “They don’t like concrete, so we’ll give them steel.”The president characterized the second day of talks between Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic congressional aides as “productive” after saying earlier in the day that he did not anticipate much progress. But Mr. Trump also said that, if no deal could be reached over his demand for $5.7 billion for the border wall, he was still considering using “emergency” authority to build the barrier with other government funds.For their part, Democrats said there was no progress as the shutdown entered its 16th day, and asked again that the government be reopened before negotiations on border security money begin.A day before, they had asked the administration for a detailed plan of how such money would be used, and the Office of Management and Budget responded with a letter on Sunday evening reiterating the president’s request for $5.7 billion for the construction of “a steel barrier” along the southern border. Democrats have rebuffed that figure.But the letter also provided a fuller picture of Mr. Trump’s border demands. In a small gesture to Democrats, it said the president wanted $800 million “to address urgent humanitarian needs,” including enhanced medical treatment. It also asked for funds to support 52,000 detention beds and 2,000 more law enforcement agents.The shutdown, which is threatening to become the longest in American history, is affecting about 800,000 federal workers, many of whom will soon miss their first paycheck, and has curtailed the functions of numerous government agencies. The impasse has also added another crisis to Mr. Trump’s turbulent presidency as he adjusts to working in an era in which he must now share power with Democrats.The party’s leaders gave little indication that they would come to terms with the president if he simply changed the materials used to construct the wall. Mr. Trump has been talking at least since mid-December about building a wall made up of “artistically designed steel slats” instead of concrete, but he seized on the idea on Sunday to a new degree.“There’s no requirement that this government be shut down while we deliberate the future of any barrier, whether it’s a fence or a wall,” Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”But Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, said that while he thought the shutdown was “going to drag on a lot longer,” Mr. Trump’s shift in wall materials could provide a semantic opening to advance the talks.“If he has to give up a concrete wall, replace it with a steel fence in order to do that so that Democrats can say, ‘See? He’s not building a wall anymore,’ that should help us move in the right direction,” Mr. Mulvaney said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “If that’s not evidence of the president’s desire to try and resolve this, I don’t know what is.”While Mr. Trump had expressed little hope for the talks on Sunday, he indicated that the coming days would offer a chance to show that resolve. “I think we’re going to have some very serious talks come Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,” he said.Democrats believe they have a plan to bring new leverage to the negotiations. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House would begin considering individual appropriations bills this week that would reopen the government, starting with legislation that would return workers to the Treasury Department, including the Internal Revenue Service, followed by measures to open the Departments of Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, and the Interior.Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and the majority leader, said on “Meet the Press”: “We’ll do it bill by bill so we can help taxpayers, we can help people who need food assistance, we can help people who need housing vouchers, people who need flood insurance. ”Those bills have little chance in the Senate, where Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has held fast to his pledge that he would not put any legislation on the floor that the president would not approve.Congressional Republicans employed a bill-by-bill strategy of their own in 2015 on the brink of a government shutdown over funding for Planned Parenthood, only to have Democrats block all 12 spending bills approved by the Appropriations Committee.The president said last week that he opposed that approach, and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said last month that the president would need to publicly support any funding measures before they were considered, adding that “we can’t have another situation when the president signals support at first but then reverses himself.” Mr. Trump did just that in December after the Senate passed bills to avert the shutdown.Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, whose state has one of the highest concentrations of federal workers, has suggested that Democrats block the consideration of all bills unrelated to opening the government until Senate Republicans allow a vote on the House bills.There may be added pressure on Mr. McConnell from his own ranks. Three Senate Republicans — Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Thom Tillis of North Carolina — have called for reopening the government. Two other Republican senators who have been critical of the shutdown, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Pat Roberts of Kansas, have announced that they will not seek re-election in 2020, so they would not face the electoral consequences of incurring Mr. Trump’s wrath.However, some other lawmakers, like Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who is continuing to advocate a deal in which Mr. Trump would get his wall funding and Democrats would get new protections for the young immigrants known as Dreamers, view the shutdown with less urgency.“I do want to open the government, but the goal is not to open the government. The goal is to fix a broken immigration system,” Mr. Graham said. He added later, “It was pretty clear to me that we’re never going to have a deal unless we get a wall as part of it.”Ms. Pelosi, in her first sit-down interview on network television since reclaiming the speaker’s gavel last week, blasted Mr. Trump for suggesting that he may unilaterally move to build the border wall.“The impression you get from the president is that he would like to not only close government, build a wall, but also abolish Congress so the only voice that mattered was his own,” Ms. Pelosi told Jane Pauley in the interview, which aired on CBS News’s “Sunday Morning.”Representative Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington and the new chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said Mr. Trump did have the power to declare a national emergency to build the wall. “Unfortunately, the short answer is yes,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.” But he said the president would face a court challenge asking “Where is the emergency?”"

118,"EL PASO — Ahead of President Trump’s scheduled rally in this West Texas city aimed at building support for his proposed wall on the border with Mexico, people from across the ideological spectrum in El Paso had a message for him on Sunday: Don’t speak for us.“The president is just wrong about the wall and wrong about El Paso,” said Jon Barela, a lifelong Republican and chief executive of the Borderplex Alliance, an organization promoting economic development in a cross-border industrial hub with a combined population of more than 2.7 million, taking in the cities of El Paso, Ciudad Juárez and Las Cruces.Mr. Barela disputed Mr. Trump’s widely discredited assertion that border fencing had cut violent crime in El Paso, pointing to F.B.I. data showing that the city has ranked for decades among the safest urban areas its size in the United States — long before American authorities started building some fencing along the border about a decade ago.“As a fiscally conservative Republican, I just don’t understand how spending $25 billion on a wall with limited effectiveness is a good idea,” Mr. Barela said in an interview. “Mexico is an economic and strategic ally of the United States, and an antiquated effort to place a barrier between us just won’t work.”[This month, we’re launching a limited-run weekly newsletter about life on the border, far from the tug-of-war of Washington politics. Sign up here to receive the first issue of Crossing the Border when it launches.]Dee Margo, the Republican mayor of El Paso, voiced similar criticism of Mr. Trump’s description of El Paso, in his State of the Union address, as “one of the nation’s most dangerous cities” before the barrier went up on the border. Representative Veronica Escobar, a Democrat recently elected to Congress to represent El Paso, is asking Mr. Trump to apologize and meet with migrant families seeking asylum in the United States.The tension surrounding Mr. Trump’s planned visit to El Paso on Monday is revealing political fissures. A Democratic bastion in a state where Republicans have long wielded dominance in statewide politics, El Paso is also home to Beto O’Rourke, the former local congressman who is a star of the Democratic Party and a potential challenger to Mr. Trump in the 2020 presidential election.At the same time Mr. Trump is scheduled to speak before about 6,000 people at the El Paso County Coliseum, Mr. O’Rourke will speak at another rally a mile away. Mr. O’Rourke said in an essay on Medium that Mr. Trump “will promise a wall and will repeat his lies about the dangers that immigrants pose.”El Paso, where Hispanics account for about 80 percent of the population, was already hostile ground for Mr. Trump. In the 2016 election, he took only about 26 percent of the vote in El Paso County.[Read our latest story on Trump and Beto’s rallies in El Paso.]Still, the president shouldn’t have a problem filling the venue. Some of his supporters in the city remain eager to hear what Mr. Trump has to say.“I’d like to see a wall go up along the entire border,” said Joshua Ascencio, 21, a cavalry scout in the United States Army who has plans to become an agent with the Border Patrol when he leaves the military. Mr. Ascencio said he was looking forward to Mr. Trump’s rally.“I’m a supporter of the president and I think it’s important to be there for him,” said Mr. Ascencio. “I want to hear him on border security.”Still, for many others in this city of immigrants the mere idea of Mr. Trump coming to El Paso to promote his administration’s crackdown on immigration raises hackles.“The president of the United States is, disgracefully, nothing more than a racist,” said Mayra Cabral, 37, an immigrant who grew up across the border in Ciudad Juárez and now cleans tables at a restaurant in El Paso, where she has lived for the last 19 years after marrying an American citizen.Ms. Cabral laughed out loud when asked about Mr. Trump’s claims that Hispanic immigrants bring crime to the United States. She said that El Paso is normally so calm that it’s “boring here sometimes.” Ms. Cabral added that she and her family were not getting waylaid by talk of the president’s visit; on Saturday night, they hosted a quinceañera for her 15-year-old daughter attended by about 300 people.“I was able to do this for my daughter because I work at a job that people born in the United States won’t do,” Ms. Cabral said. “Trump likes to call us criminals, but what about all the Americans in the country who commit violent crimes? Why doesn’t he talk about them for once?”Mr. Trump appears to have homed in on El Paso after meeting with Republican officials from Texas in January in McAllen, a city affected by a large influx of migrant families traveling through the Rio Grande Valley. At that meeting, Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas told Mr. Trump that the construction of border fencing in El Paso caused crime to fall in the city.But while El Paso has long been relatively safer than other American cities its size, the violent crime rate in the city actually climbed briefly just before and in the two years after authorities installed fencing on the border as part of an effort to improve border security during the administration of George W. Bush.Mr. Paxton tried to back up his assertion that a border wall in El Paso had cut crime rates by referring to a “131-mile fence that was completed in 2010.” PolitiFact, the nonpartisan fact-checking website owned by the Poynter Institute, questioned Mr. Paxton’s claim, pointing out that while Texas does have 131 miles of fencing not all of it is even in El Paso.The contested assertions of a senior state official comes at a time of ratcheting tension in Texas over the treatment of Latino voters by Republican state officials, who in January called into question the citizenship status of nearly 100,000 voters. County officials found that the list of voters, which was referred to by Mr. Paxton in a campaign fund-raising email with the headline “VOTER FRAUD ALERT,” actually included scores of naturalized citizens.The Mexican American Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit this month against Mr. Paxton, Gov. Greg Abbott and Secretary of State David Whitley of Texas, arguing that they conspired to purge Latinos from voter rolls following a surge in turnout by Latino voters in the midterm elections.Governor Abbott and United States Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican who narrowly defeated Mr. O’Rourke to hold on to his seat in November, are among the Republican officials from around the state who are expected to attend the rally on Monday in support of Mr. Trump.But elsewhere along the border, there has been rising opposition among state and local officials to the president’s security strategies.[Read: Butterflies, Bulldozers and Barbed Wire Rally Border Wall Opponents]New Mexico’s governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, announced last week that she had ordered a partial withdrawal of National Guard troops from her state. “New Mexico will not take part in the president’s charade of border fear-mongering by misusing our diligent National Guard troops,” Ms. Grisham, a Democrat, said in a statement.Early Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California announced that his state, too, would withdraw National Guard troops sent earlier to help the federal government boost security at the border.In Nogales, Ariz., the City Council on Wednesday passed a resolution condemning the recent installation of new barbed wire along the existing border wall in that city, calling it an “indiscriminate use of lethal force” that is “typically only found in a war, battlefield or prison setting.”Gaining public support for the idea of a wall at an event such as the rally in El Paso will be important for Mr. Trump, as talks for a bipartisan agreement on border security appeared to have stalled on Sunday amid lingering disagreement over how much should be spent on a border barrier. President Trump, who initially proposed spending $25 billion on a wall, now is looking for $5.7 billion. Democratic lawmakers have talked about a figure closer to $1.3 billion to $2 billion.A second government shutdown could be in the works if no agreement is reached.Bob Giles, a car dealer from Lafayette, La., who is building a new Volvo dealership in El Paso, said that he understood how Mr. Trump’s proposed wall could seem like a good idea from an “outside perspective.”“But when you spend time in El Paso and talk to people, it’s clear they take offense that a wall made a difference in the city,” said Mr. Giles. While Mr. Trump often speaks of a crisis on the border, Mr. Giles said he hasn’t seen one.“That’s not the word I would choose,” he said. His own hope is to sell cars not just to Americans, but also to business executives from Juárez who have homes in El Paso. “This is an incredibly vibrant market with lots of construction going on,” he said. “It makes a difference when you see it with your own eyes.”"

The president has crossed a red line, and the people know it.If you have Republican members of Congress, right now is the time to tell them, in no uncertain terms, that you will absolutely not vote for them in 2020 unless they reject President Trump’s unconstitutional abuse of authority in declaring an emergency when no such emergency exists.The only thing that will change the course of events in this country is when Republicans start to see their power erode and say “no more.” When we promise that their own jobs are on the line unless they stand up to President Trump’s blatant act of autocracy, the tide will turn and we will begin to reclaim our democracy.Republicans, and Americans who have Republican lawmakers, only you can prevent dictatorship. Call your members of Congress today.Peggy Lee ScottBerkeley, Calif.To the Editor:One of the critical pillars of the American system is that we do not use the military to manage the people. Declaring a false emergency to support government by tantrum is the camel’s nose: a powerful step toward the dictatorship that President Trump dreams of. This is the blatant bridge too far. If Congress fails to remove this clear and present danger, we must put down our pens and our devices and head, peacefully, into the streets.Ann Norvell GrayRichmond, Va.To the Editor:If President Trump were smart, he would focus on a wall that is actually needed: a firewall against foreign intrusion into our data infrastructure.But our cyberspace isn’t a tangible object, like Trump Tower, to which he can point and claim credit.

TrowbridgeNew YorkTo the Editor:Re “A Detailed History of Trump’s Signature Promise, in His Own Words” (graphic, Feb. 17):Your list of President Trump’s promises that Mexico would pay for a border wall parallels earlier lists of President Trump’s many other such promises. These lists leave us with an overarching question: Did the president know that he was lying — that Mexico would never pay for a wall — in which case he has to be the greatest scoundrel in American political history?Or does he really think that he is uttering actual truths, in which case he is the most delusional person in American political history?Fellow citizens, choose your poison!Manfred WeidhornFair Lawn, N.J."
120,"From the government shutdown to the start of a new Congress, it’s been a busy week in American politics. Here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed (and some links if you’d like to read further).___________________Early in the week, House Democrats agreed on a proposal to end the partial government shutdown that would extend current levels of funding for the Department of Homeland Security, but that didn’t include money for President Trump’s border wall. Mr. Trump rejected the idea in a White House meeting on Wednesday, saying he would look “foolish” if he compromised.After the Democrats took control of the House on Thursday, they passed two bills to reopen the government, knowing they would likely go nowhere in the Senate. The majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, said he would not bring up any legislation Mr. Trump did not support. Few Republicans called for an end to the shutdown.On Friday, the president threatened to keep agencies closed for “months or even years.” Mr. Trump also said he was considering declaring a national emergency to build a border wall without congressional approval.As the president holds firm on the shutdown, he hasn’t publicly addressed the 800,000 federal workers going without pay. The administration said it would freeze pay raises for Vice President Mike Pence and other high-level officials.Additional Reading• Government Shutdown May Turn a Day in Court Into a Four-Year Wait• Shutdown Leaves Workers Reeling: ‘We Seem to Be Pawns’•  As Shutdown Persists, New Congress Opens With Celebration and UncertaintyThe 116th Congress was called to order on Thursday, with ebullient Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives and electing Nancy Pelosi as speaker.Ms. Pelosi is the first lawmaker to win two separate terms as speaker in more than half a century, cementing her place as the highest-ranking and most powerful female elected official in the history of American politics. To win back the gavel, the California representative had to put down a rebellion in her caucus — and there are still dissenters in her ranks.Wasting no time, House Democrats on Friday unveiled details of ambitious legislation devised to lower barriers to the ballot box and require presidents and candidates for the nation’s highest offices to release their tax returns.

123,"This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.President Trump’s emergency declaration for a border wall is based on an obvious falsehood: There is no emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border. And because he was goaded into the declaration by Sean Hannity, the episode makes a mockery of the federal government.But in the relative scheme of Trump’s misbehavior, the emergency declaration doesn’t rank very high. It’s not corruption or obstruction of justice. It’s not an attempt to undermine America’s alliance with Western Europe. And it doesn’t even matter much for immigration policy. If you’re trying to calibrate your Trump-related outrage, you can take a deep breath this morning.“A presidential declaration of emergency in order to construct a wall would be stupid,” Lawfare’s Quinta Jurecic wrote. “It would be wasteful. It would test the limits of the president’s authority under the law in question. But it would not, in itself, be a step toward authoritarianism.” (Here’s the longer version of her case.)[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]“This will be challenged in courts immediately, and it will be pretty easy to throw this thing out,” Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general, predicted on Lawrence O’Donnell’s MSNBC show last night.“Trump’s fake emergency is a sign of weakness not strength,” tweeted The New Yorker’s John Cassidy. “He ran on the wall, he had two years of Republican control of Congress, and he still couldn’t get it financed. Weak president.”And Philip Klein of The Washington Examiner made the conservative case against the declaration: “The only hope for limited government conservatives is that any emergency declaration gets quickly enjoined, and eventually nixed, in federal court. At least then, the silver lining would be that a legal precedent would be set that the president cannot attempt such an end around Congress.”The China rivalry“I’ve always thought Americans would come together when we realized that we faced a dangerous foreign foe,” my colleague David Brooks writes. “And lo and behold, now we have one: China. It’s become increasingly clear that China is a grave economic, technological and intellectual threat to the United States and the world order.”I agree that the United States has been too complacent about the geopolitical challenge that China poses."

125,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has invited representatives from cable and broadcast news channels to an off-the-record lunch at the White House ahead of his prime time speech Tuesday night, an address in which he is expected to frame his demand for border wall funding as a response to a national security and humanitarian crisis.The White House has requested about eight minutes of broadcast time from the networks for Mr. Trump’s Oval Office remarks. The president appears to be preparing for the event as if he is delivering a miniature State of the Union message — typically, television anchors meet with the president over lunch ahead of his annual address to Congress.As the partial government shutdown enters its third week, Mr. Trump’s aides have been making the case that there is a crisis at the border in briefings with staff members on the Hill and in meetings with journalists.The White House has floated the idea of invoking emergency powers to build a wall along the country’s southwestern border without approval from Congress. But while Democrats have been bracing themselves for him to make that declaration on Tuesday night, administration officials who had seen a draft copy of his speech said the president was not preparing to do so.Uncertainty around a possible emergency declaration is not out of character for a president who often likes to upend expectations. When he met with television reporters ahead of his State of the Union message last year, for instance, Mr. Trump suggested that he would announce a comprehensive immigration deal, an announcement that did not materialize later that night.White House officials are keeping the content of Mr. Trump’s speech close to the vest, saying only that the president wants to deliver a message that there is a crisis at the border, and asserting that he is writing the speech himself. They have admitted privately, because they were not authorized to speak publicly, that they worry they are on the verge of losing a messaging battle over the shutdown.Tuesday’s lunch is expected to take place in the Roosevelt Room at the White House."
126,"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans introduced a measure Tuesday night that would curtail future presidential emergency declarations in a last-ditch effort to save President Trump’s current border wall emergency from an embarrassing rejection by senators charging constitutional overreach.Four Republican senators have publicly said they will support a House-passed resolution of disapproval when it comes up for final passage in the Senate on Thursday. That would be just enough to ensure passage of a measure overturning the national emergency that the president declared to secure border wall funding over Congress’s objection.But that near certainty appeared to shift on Tuesday as Vice President Mike Pence pressed Senate Republicans at a closed-door meeting before their weekly policy lunch. A measure sponsored by Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, and supported by more than a dozen Republican senators, would curtail the president’s powers under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, requiring a congressional vote of approval for any new emergency declaration after 30 days.And one of the Republicans who said he favored the resolution of disapproval, Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, appeared to be wavering, according to multiple people at the policy lunch. Without him — and barring any other defections — the resolution would fail to reach the president’s desk.“If you would have asked me before this lunch then I would have said, in the Senate, the president is going to lose,” said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, who opposes the resolution. “But I’m not so sure now. A lot of people are trying to think of a way to express their support for the president, but at the same time express their concern” about ceding too much power to the White House.While Mr. Lee’s bill would not retroactively apply to Mr. Trump’s border emergency declaration, it would give Senate Republicans cover — and offer their only chance of defeating the House resolution by easing concerns that a future Democratic president could take advantage of the precedent set by Mr. Trump.Speaker Nancy Pelosi sought Wednesday to deny senators that cover, saying flatly she would never put Mr. Lee’s legislation on the House floor for a vote.“Republican senators are proposing new legislation to allow the president to violate the Constitution just this once in order to give themselves cover,” she said in a statement. “The House will not take up this legislation to give President Trump a pass.”Republicans were ready to persist. Mr. Lee, who declined to say how he would vote on the resolution, recast the issue as the Senate reasserting its constitutional prerogatives — in the future.“Over the last 80 years, Congress has voluntarily relinquished a whole lot of legislative power, handed over to the executive branch,” said Mr. Lee, speaking to reporters about his bill. “We’ve deviated so far from the structure put in place by the Constitution.”Passing the resolution to overturn the border emergency would represent a rare assertion of legislative prerogative by Senate Republicans, who have been loath to buck Mr. Trump over the last two years. The measure would almost certainly be vetoed, the first of Mr. Trump’s presidency, but it could also bolster several lawsuits contesting the president’s emergency declaration as a flagrant violation of the Constitution, which grants Congress the power to decide how to spend federal tax dollars.Senate Democrats responded incredulously to the Republican maneuver.“I think Leader McConnell all too often has abandoned what is good for the comity in the Senate and the institution of the Senate to go along with President Trump,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, said in an interview on Tuesday.He said Democrats would oppose any attempt to curtail future abuses of executive power without addressing Mr. Trump’s actions.The resolution of disapproval has squeezed Mr. Tillis between conservatives in his home state angered by his stand and the swing voters he needs for his re-election in 2020.Mr. Trump has added his own pressure. In conversations with staff members and lawmakers, the president has made an emotional case for opposing the resolution, telling them that a vote in favor would be seen by their constituents as “a vote against border security” and warning that such a move would be regarded as disloyalty, according to three Republicans with direct knowledge of his actions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.“This is not a free vote. The president is paying attention,” Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, told the conference during their weekly lunch at the Capitol, according to a person in attendance.Mr. Lee then delivered an upbeat assessment of a meeting with Mr. Pence, telling his colleagues that the vice president agreed, in principle, to the idea of limiting the scope of an emergency declaration to 30 days without congressional approval — but insisted that it be measured in “legislative” days rather than calendar days, which could extend a president’s latitude for action, the person added.Mr. Tillis, to the surprise of some in the room, embraced the idea — although he did not go so far as to say he would reverse his public support for the resolution. He is a co-sponsor of Mr. Lee’s bill.It is unclear if Mr. Pence’s concession will be enough. A handful of other Republicans have privately signaled they may also buck the West Wing to ensure a clear statement from Congress that a president cannot use an emergency declaration to secure funds for a project that was explicitly rejected by the branch of government constitutionally granted control of federal spending.“We’ve got a short window for something to come together,” Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, told reporters on Tuesday.Other senators, he said, would likely “feel comfortable in the end voting against the resolution as long as they had something they could point to that actually is modernizing the underlying statute.”Both Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, have publicly declared their intent to disapprove of Mr. Trump’s declaration and gave no indication on Tuesday that they had changed their minds.Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, is also a “yes” vote, and told reporters on Tuesday that while it was unlikely that he would change his mind on supporting the resolution, he would support reforming the National Emergencies Act.The compromise proposed by Mr. Lee also seemed to soothe other Republican senators who have criticized the president’s actions but have been unwilling to publicly support the motion of disapproval.Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, has not publicly said how he will vote on the resolution, but he thought the Lee bill would help keep defections to a minimum. Mr. Trump had been a sharp critic of presidents exceeding their authority when the president was Barack Obama.“The president had problems, as a candidate, with the Obama overreach,” Mr. Blunt said. “He’s been on the record for some time on this topic, and I think this would give him a chance to get back to where he was three years ago.”"
127,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. Investigators don’t know  what caused the deadly crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight on Sunday, and probably won’t for at least a few weeks or months. The Boeing 737 Max 8’s “black box” data recorders have been found, but they can take a while to analyze.Here’s what we do know. The plane plunged six minutes after its takeoff from Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, after the pilot sent a distress call. Above, rescuers work at the scene of the crash.The same model of plane crashed off Indonesia in October. Nearly two dozen airlines have now grounded their Boeing 737 Max 8 planes while another dozen are keeping them in operation.The victims in Sunday’s crash were from 35 countries, and included eight Americans, 18 Canadians and 32 Kenyans. More than 20 were employees of U.N.-affiliated agencies._____2. What air travelers need to know. The Federal Aviation Administration said it was monitoring developments but did not order any groundings. American Airlines and Southwest Airlines are among the airlines still flying the 737 Max 8, pictured above.Ask our reporters about the 737 Max 8 here.Most travelers are probably out of luck if they want to switch a flight simply because of the airplane model, but Southwest, which has 34 of the planes in operation, does not charge change fees. Read our guide for passengers.Boeing shares dropped 13 percent on Monday, but rebounded, ending the day just 5 percent down._____3. The record $4.75 trillion budget request that President Trump sent to lawmakers has no chance of passage.Congress, which controls spending, has not embraced Mr. Trump’s budgets even when Republicans controlled both houses.Instead, our Washington reporters write, the proposal serves as a declaration of Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign priorities: $8.6 billion for the construction of a border wall and increased military spending, and cuts to education, environmental protection, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security._____4. Tough times for the National Rifle Association. The powerful gun-rights group is engulfed in challenges. A series of mass shootings created a new generation of gun-control activists. Falling membership dues put the organization under further strain. The group’s possible ties to Russia and its tax-exempt status are under scrutiny.Now, it’s facing an internal debate over its streaming service, NRATV.Produced by an ad firm, Ackerman McQueen, NRATV sends out apocalyptic, hard-right messages; warnings of race wars; and, in September, a diatribe against diversity that featured the talking trains on the popular children’s show “Thomas & Friends” in Ku Klux Klan hoods. Above, pictures of the group’s leading figures at its annual meeting and exhibit last year._____5. In today’s 2020 news:Beto O’Rourke is probably going to join the Democratic presidential field, according to interviews with people who have spoken to him and other top Democrats.Mr. O’Rourke, a former Texas congressman, is making his potential opponents nervous even though he hasn’t demonstrated the kind of intensive preparation — like building national political infrastructure — typical of top-flight presidential campaigns. Above, Mr. O’Rourke carries his son at a border wall protest last month.And Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who is running for president, is under scrutiny after revelations that her office may have mishandled a sexual harassment complaint._____6. The blackout that plunged Venezuela into darkness is unlikely to end anytime soon.Looting and protests have been seen in parts of the country. And the government declared that today, the fifth day of the outage, would be a public holiday.Electrical workers say a fire caused the blackout. Experts point to years of underinvestment and mismanagement; the government blames saboteurs. Above, Caracas in the dark.And speaking of blame, The Times analyzed previously unpublished footage that contradicted a widely circulated U.S. claim that President Nicolás Maduro’s forces burned an aid convoy, showing instead that a protester appeared to have set the cargo on fire accidentally._____7. On the eve of a critical Brexit vote, Prime Minister Theresa May flew to Strasbourg, France, to attempt to rescue her unpopular withdrawal plan.It’s unclear what kind of concessions she can win in the 11th-hour meeting that would prevent Parliament from voting the plan down. The vote comes less than three weeks before the deadline for Britain to leave the E.U. Above, the E.U.’s chief Brexit negotiator kisses Mrs. May’s hand in Strasbourg.If she loses, Mrs. May has promised to offer a vote on whether Britain should leave the bloc without a deal — a scenario that could brutally upend the country’s economy and one that most lawmakers oppose._____8. Raheem Sterling, the English soccer star, has become part of the global conversation about racial equality led by figures like Colin Kaepernick and LeBron James. Pictured above, Mr. Sterling controls the ball during a match last month.After a fan screamed a racial obscenity at him at a Premier League match in December, he made a pointed Instagram post. In an interview with our reporter, he expanded on themes of racial abuse and racist tropes the British media uses to describe him.“It is a stereotype of black people: chains and jewelry, bling and money,” he said._____9. A strike in the world of classical music.Musicians with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra are not playing as they press their demand to keep their pension plans, among other things. The orchestra’s management says the growing expense of the plan is unsustainable.And our classical music critic, Anthony Tommasini, went to Carnegie Hall, above, for nine concerts over seven days. He confirmed it offers a sprawl of the classical field better than almost anywhere else._____10. Finally, the Beat goes on. Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the poet, publisher, painter, social activist and co-founder of San Francisco’s famed City Lights bookstore, above, is turning 100, and the city is celebrating his legacy.We took a walking tour through old-school San Francisco, with special emphasis on the Beat Generation. For figures like Jack Kerouac, City Lights was a nerve center.Can you dig it?_____Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

129,"Good morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) If you weren’t already confused about the status of California’s controversial bullet train after Gov. Gavin Newsom’s State of the State address, you might be soon.During his speech last week, the governor said the high-speed rail network as it was initially envisioned — as a link between Los Angeles and the Bay Area — was taking too long and costing too much. So, he announced, the project would be scaled back for the time being, instead stretching from Bakersfield to Merced.Eventually, Mr. Newsom backtracked and blamed the news media for overstating the change of plan.But not before President Trump seized the opportunity to hammer a favorite target, tweeting that “California has been forced to cancel the massive bullet train project,” and saying that the federal government wanted back $3.5 billion.(Read more about the long-running debate over California’s bullet train here.)That was a week ago, before a new battle between the president and the Golden State took shape. This time, it was over Mr. Trump’s declaration of a national emergency on the border in order to access more money for a border wall. California and 15 other states sued, arguing that the move was an illegal way of diverting funds that Congress designated for other things.“Our message to the White House is clear: California will not be part of this political theater,” Mr. Newsom said in a statement in support of the legal action.Yesterday, though, the tension escalated when the Transportation Department said it was exploring legal options to force California to pay back $2.5 billion in federal money that has already been spent on the project. The Trump administration said in a separate letter that it planned to end a $929 million grant to the California High-Speed Rail Authority.Both Mr. Newsom and President Trump linked the fight over the border wall with the renewed efforts to claw back rail funding.“This is clear political retribution by President Trump, and we won’t sit idly by,” Mr. Newsom said in a statement. “This is California’s money, and we are going to fight for it.”President Trump tweeted that what he described as California’s “failed Fast Train” system “is hundreds of times more expensive than the desperately needed Wall!”Still, it’s not clear whether the federal government has the authority to keep the $929 million grant from California.Which means that the fight over the bullet train — like so many of the clashes between the Trump administration and California — is likely to end up in court.(We often link to content on sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

130,"This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.Congressional Republicans offered up two conflicting storylines yesterday, and it’s worth keeping both in mind.1) Multiple senators hypocritically supported President Trump’s emergency declaration for a border wall.Thom Tillis of North Carolina was the most blatant. Two weeks ago, he opposed the Trump move as an unacceptable power grab, writing in a Washington Post op-ed: “There is no intellectual honesty in now turning around and arguing that there’s an imaginary asterisk attached to executive overreach — that it’s acceptable for my party but not thy party.”[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]As recently as Wednesday, his staff sent nasty emails of denial to Aaron Blake of The Post when Blake described Tillis as turning “wobbly.”Yesterday, however, Tillis caved. He did so after conservatives began talking about supporting a primary challenge to him in 2020 if he voted against Trump. “This is Trump’s party,” Rachel Bitecofer of Christopher Newport University notes.Of the seven Republican senators facing competitive races next year, six voted with Trump yesterday. They are evidently more scared of losing a primary than of losing a general election, as Jonathan Bernstein of Bloomberg Opinion points out.Cory Gardner of Colorado was another Republican who supported the emergency declaration yesterday. The Denver Post’s editorial board, which had backed Gardner in his 2014 campaign, responded with: “Our endorsement of Cory Gardner was a mistake.”2) And yet Trump is a weak president.As nervous as congressional Republicans may be about primary challenges, they also keep showing that their support of Trump is almost purely self-interested — and not very deep. Even with the hypocritical support, 12 Republicans voted against Trump’s declaration, allowing the measure to pass 59-41 and presumably forcing him to issue a humiliating veto. The vote, The Times editorial board writes, “is a big deal. In practical terms, it could fortify the multiple lawsuits pending against Mr. Trump’s absurd declaration, a faux emergency so nakedly political that even he admitted it was unnecessary.”Not long before the Senate vote, the House yesterday passed a resolution — in a 420-to-0 shutout — demanding that the Justice Department release the Mueller report. The combination of the two votes was a remarkable rebuke. Yes, congressional Republicans are doing far less than they should to stand up to Trump. Many of them, like Tillis, have made themselves look foolish in the process. But it’s also the case that Trump receives less support from his own party than any other president in recent history.His presidency, as Bloomberg’s Bernstein has written, is entering “a dangerous phase” for him."
131,"WASHINGTON — Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, on Wednesday tersely defended a now-defunct Trump administration practice of separating migrant children from their families at the border, sidestepping whether she supported it as a way to deter illegal immigration.In tense exchanges with House Democrats, Ms. Nielsen instead implored Congress to confront what she called a “humanitarian catastrophe” on the southern border by changing laws to crack down on illegal border crossings.She also said the Trump administration’s family separation practice was similar to those of previous presidents — even if only sporadically enforced in earlier cases.“It was a policy by this administration that only ended when there were pictures of little kids in cages that had been ripped away from their parents,” Representative Kathleen Rice, Democrat of New York, told Ms. Nielsen during a hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee.Ms. Nielsen replied that Ms. Rice mischaracterized the administration’s enforcement.“That’s a policy,” Ms. Rice said. “You should admit it.”Ms. Nielsen noted that parents are generally separated from their children when they go to jail for illegal activities. But “that wasn’t the point” of the immigration policy, she said.“The point was to increase prosecutions for those breaking the law,” she added.[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]The hearing was Ms. Nielsen’s first since Democrats took control of the House this year. She backed President Trump’s request to declare a national emergency at the border — which would give him access to funding to build a border wall — and cited new data from her department showing that the number of immigrants entering the United States illegally had doubled from a year ago.Immigration officials are on track to apprehend one million people crossing the southern border this year, Ms. Nielsen said.“This is not a manufactured crisis,” Ms. Nielsen said. “This is truly an emergency.”Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, later accused Democrats of refusing to acknowledge a crisis at the border. She also chastised Senate Republicans who did not support the president’s emergency declaration.“If you had done what you were elected to do on the front end, then the president would not have to fix the problem on his own through a national emergency,” Ms. Sanders said.Some Republicans at the House hearing said they supported building a wall along the border.Representative Daniel Crenshaw, Republican of Texas, acknowledged the concerns about family separations but said physical barriers were crucial to securing the long stretches of land between ports of entry.Mr. Crenshaw said he now doubted that “we all value the rule of law and value the ability to manage our border effectively” — a view he admitted was cynical.The Department of Homeland Security has opened three investigations into the Trump administration’s immigration policies, the agency’s acting inspector general, John V. Kelly, said in a separate hearing on Wednesday.Mr. Kelly said one investigation is looking into the department’s systems for tracking migrant children separated from their families; another is examining whether asylum-seeking families are being separated at the border.Department investigators were also reviewing whether parents facing deportation were given the option of bringing their children back home with them. In the hearing with Ms. Nielsen, Ms. Rice asked whether every relative facing deportation was, in fact, allowed to do so.“To the best of my knowledge, every parent was afforded that option,” Ms. Nielsen said.In the past, most undocumented immigrants entering the United States from Mexico were single men looking for work. But over the past year, the number of migrants traveling together as a family has soared — a point that Ms. Nielsen sought to underscore.Officials have said migrants — and the smugglers who exploit them — know they are unlikely to be detained if they travel with a child.Under a court order, the government is prohibited from keeping children in holding facilities at the border for more than 72 hours. Children must either be transferred to immigration detention facilities suitable for minors, or be released.The government has allowed thousands of detained migrants to go free each week because it lacks enough beds to hold them in family detention facilities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a branch of Ms. Nielsen’s department, can accommodate only 3,326 parents and children in its three residential family centers.Democrats also criticized Ms. Nielsen for not adequately keeping track of migrant children who were separated from their parents last year.“You let kids be separated without tracking them. Do you know how outrageous that is, Madam Secretary?” said Representative Nanette Barragán, Democrat of California. “You have no feeling, no compassion, no empathy here.”Ms. Nielsen did not respond.The practice, part of a “zero tolerance” immigration policy that drew swift condemnation after it was publicly announced last spring, quickly became a symbol of the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration. At the time, Ms. Nielsen repeatedly denied that her department had a policy of routinely separating migrant children from their parents at the border, despite mounting evidence that thousands of families had been broken apart.During a news conference in June at the White House, she said she was offended by accusations that she would authorize separating children from their parents to send a message of deterrence. But the department continued to separate families until Mr. Trump, facing enormous public pressure, signed an executive order meant to end the policy.Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the committee’s chairman, said he had requested documents on the treatment of asylum seekers at the border and family separations. After Wednesday’s hearing, Mr. Thompson told reporters that he expected that information within a week and was prepared to use subpoena powers as a “last resort.”“The secretary can choose whether to be complicit in this administration’s misinformation campaign,” Mr. Thompson said, “or she can correct the record.”For much of her tenure, Ms. Nielsen has been the subject of Mr. Trump’s ire over illegal immigration and border security.Mr. Trump berated her privately for not doing enough to stop illegal immigration and accelerate construction of a wall along the border with Mexico. The president grew repeatedly angry with Ms. Nielsen for telling him that his ideas to stop immigration would be illegal or improper.By year’s end, reports were rampant that Mr. Trump wanted to fire Ms. Nielsen, but her credibility with the president has since improved. During the government’s 35-day shutdown over funding for the president’s border wall, Ms. Nielsen was a fierce advocate for the wall.And on Wednesday morning, Ms. Nielsen made clear she would not stray far from the president’s anti-immigrant language.“We face a crisis — a real, serious and sustained crisis at our borders,” Ms. Nielsen said."

133,"PARKERSBURG, W.Va. — On Day 20 of the partial government shutdown last week, a small band of federal workers, shivering in 25-degree weather, staged a rally to send what their organizer, Eric Engle, said was a message to Senator Shelley Moore Capito: “We need to end this shutdown. If it takes overriding the president, that’s what it takes.”But here in the heart of Trump country, that message is decidedly muffled, even in Parkersburg, where the federal government is one of the two largest employers. So strong is support for President Trump, who remains dug in on his demand for $5.7 billion to build a border wall, that even some furloughed workers insist Ms. Capito must stick with him.“We need the wall,” Jessica Lemasters, 29, an accountant on furlough from the Treasury Department, said over lunch at the Corner Cafe, a few blocks from the rally. “I don’t like being furloughed, but it happens.”Those conflicting sentiments help explain why Senate Republicans like Ms. Capito remain in lock step with Mr. Trump, even as the longest government shutdown ever enters its fourth week and 800,000 federal workers miss their paychecks. The 24th day of the shutdown slipped by with no progress toward a resolution, and while polls show that a majority of Americans blame Mr. Trump and Republicans and do not support a border wall, Republicans are reading a different line in the polling: Support for the wall is growing and hardening among Republican voters.“I am concerned for my people,” said Gregory D. Blaney, an aerospace engineer who runs a NASA facility in Fairmont, W.Va., and is working without pay. But, he added, “I’m willing to endure some impact if it means border security.”Mr. Trump’s verbal gyrations on the wall and the shutdown have left Senate Republicans bewildered — and twisting wildly themselves. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close ally of the president who is also running for re-election in 2020, has gone from trying to negotiate a bipartisan compromise to advocating a presidential emergency declaration to calling on Mr. Trump to temporarily reopen the government while continuing negotiations on the wall.On Monday, Mr. Trump bluntly responded to that last one: “I did reject it.”Early last week, Ms. Capito, a freshman up for re-election next year, seemed to be wavering when she suggested she might be able to “live with” negotiating border security after reopening the government — the Democrats’ position.But after Mr. Trump addressed the nation from the Oval Office and traveled to the border, she walked back those remarks, telling a local television station, “I think President Trump is going to stand strong, and I’m going to stand strong with him.”So far, only three Senate Republicans — Cory Gardner of Colorado, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — have decisively broken with Mr. Trump and called for the government to reopen without a border wall deal. Mr. Gardner and Ms. Collins are up for re-election in Democratic-leaning states; Ms. Murkowski was re-elected in 2016.Others are expressing their unease with caution. Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has put distance, if only a tiny bit, between herself and Mr. Trump by saying that while she strongly supports a wall, it does not need to cover the entire southern border. Senator Martha McSally of Arizona has asked that her pay be withheld until the shutdown is over. Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has called for Republicans to strike a deal that included “long-term security” for the young immigrants known as Dreamers who were brought to the country illegally as children. All will face voters in 2020.“The question for Republicans up in 2020 is how long can they let this go on,” said Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes Senate races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. “The more uncomfortable they get, the closer they get to breaking with Trump. But they have to watch the base.”Here in West Virginia, where Mr. Trump clobbered Hillary Clinton by more than 40 points in 2016, the shutdown’s effects are severe. The federal government employs nearly 3.5 percent of West Virginia workers — a bigger share than in all but six other states and the District of Columbia, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The state has six federal prisons whose correctional officers are working without pay. Other federal agencies have built big installations here to escape the high cost of office space in the Washington region. The F.B.I. has a major fingerprint center on 986 acres of land in Clarksburg. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA share a sprawling technology park in Fairmont. All have employees working without pay.Just last month, after Congress approved legislation championed by Ms. Capito, Mr. Trump renamed the NASA facility in honor of one of the women who inspired the Academy Award-nominated film “Hidden Figures.” Now it is mostly shuttered.But border security is an issue that resonates in West Virginia, in large part because of the state’s opioid epidemic. While Mr. Trump overstated the amount of opioids flowing into the nation through the southern border in his Oval Office speech, many here see the wall as one way to stop the tide.“We see every day the effects of the opioid epidemic,” said Ms. Lemasters, the furloughed worker, explaining why she is so strongly in favor of the wall.Mr. Trump’s language about unauthorized immigrants also resonates strongly here, where whites make up 94 percent of the population. “They come to this country, they are coming from Third World countries,” said Steve Plum, a retired police officer who owns the Corner Cafe with his wife. “They have absolutely nothing to offer.”As to Ms. Capito, she needs to “stand her ground,” he said.Ms. Capito, 65, declined requests for an interview. She votes with Mr. Trump 96 percent of the time, according to the website FiveThirtyEight, but her style is anything but Trump-like. She keeps a low profile in Washington and sees government not as an enemy but as an opportunity for West Virginia, whose residents rely heavily on federal support.“She’s not a bomb thrower. She’s never going to get too far out there on the edge. She’s very careful,” said Hoppy Kercheval, a prominent radio host in West Virginia, who had Ms. Capito on his show last week. “I would not call her a Trump cheerleader. I would call her a supporter of Trump policies.”Ms. Capito is also chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security, and in that role she put together a bill that allocated $1.6 billion for border security and fencing.It gained bipartisan approval in committee and has passed the Democratic-controlled House. But Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, refuses to take it up. So like other spending bills that could reopen the government, Ms. Capito’s measure is now stalled in the Senate.“I got $1.6 billion for the wall with 10 Democrats voting for this,” Ms. Capito told Mr. Kercheval, though the money was not supposed to be spent on a wall. “But I also realize that holding parts of the government that are unrelated to this hostage, with people missing paychecks and things of that nature after a while begins to wear on not just the folks who are most directly affected but everybody.”Tolerance may be eroding here in Parkersburg, a city of about 30,000 that sits across the border from Ohio.The Treasury Department’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service — which most people call by its old name, the Bureau of the Public Debt — employs about 2,000 people, though not all are affected by the shutdown. Disgust with Washington runs high.“I think they are acting like a bunch of freaking kids up there,” said Randy Beymer, a retired salesman, over a late breakfast with his sister, Donna Hewitt, who nodded in agreement.Many are directing their ire at Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “Pelosi and Schumer say a wall is immoral; they’ve got a wall around their house,” said Rod Sellers, 70, a truck driver, echoing conservative talking points that are not true.But Ms. Capito is already beginning to share in the blame. At the Oil and Gas Museum downtown, which chronicles the city’s history as a site for oil and gas exploration, Darla Uppole, who was visiting with her 11-year-old daughter from nearby Williamstown, said Ms. Capito needed to get off the sidelines and push Mr. Trump toward compromise.“He’s got to be pushed, but she’s got to support him too,” she said. “I do think we need the wall, but this is no way to run government.”"

135,"How fitting is it that President Trump’s first Oval Office address, which he requested be televised live in prime time by every major network, was aimed at stirring up the American public about a crisis largely of his own making?Not that the border crisis is one of Mr. Trump’s self-serving political fictions — like the deep state or widespread voter fraud. It may have started out that way, but the situation has, with the president’s nurturing, become something far more tragic.Pursuing poorly thought-out and even more poorly executed policies on the pretext of battling a nonexistent national security crisis, Mr. Trump has helped create a pressing humanitarian one. Desperate migrant families being detained en masse at the border are overwhelming a system pushed beyond its limits by an administration that chose to ignore the implications of its actions — overcrowding, children falling gravely ill and, paradoxically, the haphazard release of throngs of detainees into border communities stretching from California to Texas.Mr. Trump is now invoking the urgency of the situation as a justification for pursuing more wasteful, hard-line measures that most Americans do not support, chiefly the ludicrous border wall over which he has shut down critical pieces of the government. The president and his enablers have been busily knitting together inaccurate data, misleading anecdotes, exaggerations and other “alternative facts” about the flow of criminals, drugs and terrorists across the southern border. He seems to hope he can paint a dystopian landscape of security threats and human suffering so dire that the American people will rally to his side and pressure congressional Democrats to succumb to his demands for a towering wall — preferably concrete, but at this point, it seems, steel will suffice.Failing that, Mr. Trump has also been floating the possibility of stiff-arming Congress altogether. With his advisers increasingly anxious that Republican lawmakers are poised to abandon them on the shutdown, the president has raised the threat of declaring a national emergency, which he thinks would allow him to command the Pentagon to build his wall. Such a move would prompt a swift and furious legal challenge, if not a full-blown constitutional crisis, that could drag on indefinitely. It would, however, also give Mr. Trump a way to reach a wall-free funding deal with Congress without losing face, thus weaseling out of the shutdown box into which he has nailed himself.The border wall began life as an applause line at Mr. Trump’s rallies, and it has endured as the rare — perhaps even sole — policy objective that actually matters to him. The substance of true border security may not interest him much, but this symbol sure does. While Mr. Trump proved a wily campaigner and political street fighter, as president he has been painfully out of his element. Two years in, he remains ill suited to the complicated, thankless, often grinding work of leading the nation. Governance clearly bores him, as do policy details both foreign and domestic. He has proved a poor judge of talent. He prefers grandstanding to negotiating, and he continues to have trouble with the whole concept of checks and balances. While the Republican base remains enamored of him, most of the electorate has grown weary of his outrages and antics.Which is why, with his wall on the line, Mr. Trump so desperately needs to convince the American people that they are facing an acute crisis — maybe even a bona fide emergency.In times of trouble, an anxious public looks to its leaders, and the ability to telegraph strength, decisiveness and certitude assumes greater value than in periods of calm and prosperity. Circle-the-wagons patriotism, maybe even a little jingoism, becomes more appealing. People long to feel protected.With his demagogy, Mr. Trump managed to fuel a sense of insecurity and unease throughout his campaign, along with the idea that he alone could Make America Great Again. In office, he has attempted to perpetuate that angst by proclaiming existential threats to the Republic, be they migrant caravans storming the border, Muslim terrorists flooding the airports or violent immigrants roaming the countryside. Shutting down the government is only the most recent effort at getting what he wants by traumatizing the nation he has sworn to serve.Were Mr. Trump truly interested in securing the border, and easing the suffering his policies are making worse, there are immediate steps he could take. For starters, he could end this wretched shutdown so that the people responsible for protecting the border can get paid, immigration judges can return to processing asylum claims and, yes, the physical and virtual barriers already in place can be maintained and perhaps even improved.Beyond that, he would need to ease up on the my-way-or-the-highway swagger and sit down for a real discussion with lawmakers about how to address the deep dysfunction of this nation’s immigration system. None of which would be as sensational as grabbing some prime-time airtime.It would, however, be a sign that the president is at last getting serious about immigration concerns he has thus far done nothing but exacerbate."
136,"MCALLEN, Texas — A mother cradled a crying toddler as she waited in line with 20 other women to shower. Dozens of fathers quietly held their children's hands in an enclosure made of chain-link fencing.While these families were held at an overcrowded Border Patrol processing center, a fresh wave of migrants crossed the nearby river separating the U.S. and Mexico and waited for border agents to bring them to the same facility. One Honduran woman carried a feverish 7-month-old baby.The cycle is repeated multiple times a day. Waves of desperate families are trying to cross the border almost hourly and entering an overtaxed government detention system.The Border Patrol has become so overwhelmed in feeding and caring for the migrants that it announced plans this week to start releasing some families onto the street in the Rio Grande Valley to ease overcrowding in the processing center, providing the immigrants with a notice to appear at an upcoming court date.""We have an unprecedented crisis upon us,"" Robert Perez, deputy commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Border Patrol's parent agency, said in an interview.The Border Patrol says it made about 66,000 apprehensions of people crossing the border illegally in February, including 36,000 parents and children, an all-time monthly high. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, meanwhile, said since Dec. 21 it has released 107,000 family members while they await court dates.Immigration authorities expect the number of parents and children to surpass 50,000 in March during the traditional spring spike in migration and potentially reach 180,000 in May, according to two U.S. officials who were not authorized to speak publicly about internal documents.The Border Patrol ordered expanded medical screenings after the December deaths of two children in its custody. The agency received $30 million to upgrade its South Texas processing center and additional funding to build a similar facility in El Paso.The autopsy results for Jakelin Caal and Felipe Gomez Alonzo have not yet been released, but Customs and Border Protection has said both children were hospitalized after developing high fevers and nausea.Children with fevers, colds and the flu arrive daily at the border with their parents and sometimes wait for hours for the Border Patrol to pick them up.On a recent Thursday, Carmen Mejia's 7-month-old, Lian, was feverish, one of four sick children in her group of 20. His mother had heard about Jakelin and Felipe before leaving her rural town in northern Honduras.""It made me sad,"" she said. ""But imagine. I'm here, also looking for a future for my son.""Mejia said she hoped to find work to support Lian and two older children she had left behind with her mother.While she spoke, two more waves of people arrived. The group grew to around 50 before the Border Patrol could load everyone into vans and take them into detention.Some migrants blamed extortion for forcing them to close small businesses. Others said gangs had killed close relatives and threatened to kill them.President Donald Trump's administration says most adult border crossers are economic migrants who count on being released if they bring a child and seek asylum. Immigration agency officials have called for Congress to change laws that would allow them to detain more adults and children and deport people from Central America quicker.Trump's signature solution — and the reason for his declaration of a national emergency — is a border wall, especially in South Texas, where there are comparatively few barriers. But a border wall would not stop families who aren't trying to evade immigration authorities. Those families typically stop after crossing the Rio Grande and wait to be caught.The Associated Press visited the South Texas processing center where many migrants end up. It's an old warehouse, with overhead lighting that stays on around the clock and chain-link fencing that forms large cages.Detainees are issued mats and foil blankets to sleep on the concrete floor. Each detainee receives a medical screening.Dozens of children waited on their own. Many were 10 years of age or older and kept separately from their parents, who are in another wing of the facility at the same time.Some of the children waiting on their own talked among themselves. Others tried to sleep on mats under the glare of the lights, their foil blankets crinkling.The facility received worldwide attention last June, during the Trump administration's enforcement of a zero-tolerance policy that led to thousands of family separations. Around 1,100 people were detained at the facility then, many of them children who had been separated from their parents.The facility opened in 2014 during the Obama administration to address another surge of thousands of unaccompanied teenagers arriving from Central America.Now the processing center and other facilities in the sector deal with parents bringing young children and pregnant women who sometimes go into labor in detention.""It isn't meant for families,"" said Carmen Qualia, an assistant chief patrol agent for the sector. ""We're set up for individuals.""Agency guidelines require that parents are detained for no longer than 72 hours before being released or transferred to long-term detention centers with beds and more facilities. The average detention time for families late last week was about 60 hours.Most families are eventually bused to a Catholic Charities facility in McAllen, where volunteers provide food and medical checkups before taking them to the bus station or airport.The future of that facility is in jeopardy after McAllen city commissioners last month ordered Catholic Charities to vacate it by May, after complaints from neighbors.But the Border Patrol is relying on the facility more than ever. While a few hundred people are sent there daily, immigration authorities dropped 800 migrants at Catholic Charities in just one day this week, leading to volunteers posting pleas on social media for donations and help.Inside a small clinic behind the main building, Dr. Martin Garza listened to the heartbeat and lungs of 1-month-old Cesar Manuel Romero, cradled by his mother, 21-year-old Lily Romero of Honduras. Romero said she gave birth to Cesar on a bus as it passed through Monterrey, Mexico.After crossing the border, Romero said they were taken to a smaller Border Patrol station — what she and other Spanish-speaking migrants often refer to as ""la hielera,"" or the icebox. She said another woman in custody loaned her a sweater so she could keep Cesar warm because agents had taken many of her belongings.She said they were given water that was ""nearly frozen."" Afterward, they were taken to the processing center and eventually released to Catholic Charities.The Border Patrol says its facilities follow agency detention guidelines and that it investigates any complaints of mistreatment.Garza said agents and medical professionals inside detention almost always diagnose major illnesses or injuries. But colds and fevers persist, along with conditions that aren't obvious, he said.""Infants are wheezing. Infants are having trouble breathing, and some of those things may not get picked up,"" he said.___Associated Press writers Colleen Long in Washington and Astrid Galvan in Phoenix contributed to this report."

141,"WASHINGTON — President Trump agreed on Friday to reopen the federal government for three weeks while negotiations continued over how to secure the nation’s southwestern border, backing down after a monthlong standoff failed to force Democrats to give him billions of dollars for his long-promised wall.The president’s concession paved the way for the House and the Senate to both pass a stopgap spending bill by voice vote. Mr. Trump signed it on Friday night, restoring normal operations at a series of federal agencies until Feb. 15 and opening the way to paying the 800,000 federal workers who have been furloughed or forced to work without pay for 35 days.The plan includes none of the money for the wall that Mr. Trump had demanded and was essentially the same approach that he rejected at the end of December and that Democrats have advocated since, meaning he won nothing concrete during the impasse.Mr. Trump presented the agreement with congressional leaders as a victory anyway, and indicated in a speech in the Rose Garden that his cease-fire may only be temporary: If Republicans and Democrats cannot reach agreement on wall money by the February deadline, he said that he was ready to renew the confrontation or declare a national emergency to bypass Congress altogether.“We really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or steel barrier,” Mr. Trump said. “If we don’t get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on Feb. 15, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and Constitution of the United States to address this emergency.”[President Trump’s emergency powers, explained.]But Mr. Trump has already adopted some of the language that his Democratic adversaries have used during the longest shutdown in history. He conceded that “we do not need 2,000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea — we never did” and invoked the utility of “smart walls” that substitute some physical barriers for drones and other sensors. The semantic evolution provides both the president and Democrats with a face-saving way forward if they want it.The surprise announcement was a remarkable surrender for a president who made the wall his nonnegotiable condition for reopening the government and a centerpiece of his political platform. Some immigration hard-liners that make up a key part of his political base were incensed by the capitulation.“Good news for George Herbert Walker Bush: As of today, he is no longer the biggest wimp ever to serve as President of the United States,” the commentator Ann Coulter, who has aggressively pushed Mr. Trump to keep his campaign promise on the wall, wrote on Twitter.On Capitol Hill, though, jittery lawmakers from both parties greeted the news with relief. Mr. Trump relented as the effects of the shutdown were rippling with ever greater force across the economy, with fallout far beyond paychecks. On Friday, air traffic controllers calling in sick slowed air traffic across the Northeast; hundreds of workers at the Internal Revenue Service also did not show up; and the F.B.I. director said he was as angry as he had ever been over his agents not being paid.“None of us are willing to go through this again,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, referring to a half-dozen Republicans who voted on Thursday for a Democratic measure to reopen the government for two weeks. “And it’s not just a few of us. There are a great many in our conference that feel pretty strongly.”[How the shutdown reordered American life.]Democrats, who declined to revel in their clear victory, said they would work in good faith to strike a deal on border security. They have raised their offer on border security funding considerably and toughened their rhetoric on stopping illegal immigration.But Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated plainly that any compromise would not include money for a new border wall, which Democrats view as ineffective and overly costly even though many have supported border fencing in the past.“Have I not been clear on a wall?” Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. The two have repeatedly said they would support allocating additional money for technology and increased patrols along the border, like the ones Mr. Trump referenced on Friday.The cease-fire should pave the way for Mr. Trump to deliver his State of the Union address to Congress after all, but Ms. Pelosi said it would not be held this Tuesday, as originally scheduled. She had rescinded her invitation this week to come to the House chamber until the government was reopened, and on Friday, she said she would work with Mr. Trump to find a new date.“The State of the Union is not planned now,” Ms. Pelosi said. “When government is open we will discuss a mutually agreeable date.”As he announced the deal, Mr. Trump paid tribute to the federal workers who have endured five weeks without pay, expressing sympathy for them in a way he had not until now. “You are fantastic people,” he said.He promised to ensure that workers would be compensated for the paychecks they have missed since the shutdown began in late December “very quickly or as soon as possible.” To that effect, the Office of Management and Budget circulated a letter to affected agencies and departments on Friday afternoon instructing management to prepare for an “orderly reopening” and to prioritize pay and benefits for workers.But other costs will be more permanent. Many federal contractors do not expect to be repaid for their work during the shutdown. Its compounding effects will ultimately cost the federal government more money than if it was open. And though the long-term economic damage caused by the shutdown remains to be seen, it appears that at the very least the short-term pain was more costly than a down payment on the border wall.According to an analysis from Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, the United States economy lost at least $6 billion in the five weeks the government was partly shuttered — more than the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump had requested to build a steel or concrete barrier at the border.Mr. Trump offered no explanation for his surrender, nor did he acknowledge that it was one. On Twitter on Friday night, he said: “This was in no way a concession. It was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the Shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days, if no deal is done, it’s off to the races!”During the president’s speech earlier in the day, cabinet officials and White House aides lined the sides of the Rose Garden and applauded him. Mr. Trump began his remarks as if he had actually emerged victorious, saying that he was “very proud to announce” what he called “a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government.”Few lawmakers even in the president’s own party saw it that way.“I hail from a state that is very supportive of the president and border security with barriers, so that is a consideration for me, but there are a lot of other strategies we could employ that would work better” than a shutdown, said Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia.With polls showing the president enduring most of the blame by the public, Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, pressured Mr. Trump to agree to the temporary truce. Over the next three weeks, a House-Senate conference committee representing both parties will negotiate a border security plan, but if it fails to reach a consensus, government agencies could close again.The president’s concession came a day after two competing measures to reopen the government failed on the Senate floor. A Democratic bill, which would have reopened the government with no strings attached, received more votes than the bill backed by Mr. Trump, which included temporary protections for some undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion for his proposed border wall.Mr. McConnell and Mr. Schumer huddled on Thursday night after the failed votes to discuss a path forward. Mr. Schumer rejected the idea of offering a down payment for the wall to reopen the government and pitched Mr. McConnell on what ultimately became the agreement with Mr. Trump, according to a senior Democratic aide.Mr. McConnell, who viewed the shutdown as unnecessary from the start, found Mr. Trump eager to end the impasse, and in a series of calls, they ironed out the details. To the Republican leader, it was a way to ease much of the pressure on federal workers and get the Senate back to work.As late as early Friday morning, Mr. Trump appeared intent on declaring a national emergency at the border alongside the agreement to reopen the government, but Mr. McConnell and White House officials encouraged him to drop the idea, according to people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to discuss them.Republican leaders tried to rally their members during a closed policy luncheon before Thursday’s votes. But even as Republicans prepared to support Mr. Trump’s plan, the signs of mounting frustration after weeks of inaction were evident.Republican senators rose one by one to voice concerns about the effect on federal workers and the lack of forward momentum in an impasse that felt unbearable. They swore they would never stand by another government shutdown.“We’ve already lost,” lamented Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, according to people familiar with the remarks. “It’s a matter of the extent we want to keep losing.”At another point, during an exchange first reported by The Washington Post, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, vented at Mr. McConnell for putting Republicans in the position of having to vote on two competing approaches to reopen the government — one Republican and one Democratic — without consulting them first.“You put us in this position,” Mr. Johnson said, according to one of his aides.Mr. McConnell, who had largely been absent from negotiations to reopen the government until late last week, responded, “Are you suggesting I’m enjoying this?”"
142,"Vice President Mike Pence insisted on beginning the first meeting with a prayer, so the chief of staff to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, asked God “to bring us together” when negotiators met Saturday in Mr. Pence’s ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.The next day, Democrats began with their own prayer — offered by a member of Senator Richard J. Durbin’s staff — that noted that Jesus and Mary were both refugees.The two disparate prayers underscored the stalemate that lawmakers find themselves in as the shutdown drags into its third week: The two sides could not even agree on a pro forma invocation.Sixteen days into the partial government shutdown, Congressional Democrats and the White House have made little progress. The two weekend meetings, described by White House officials and Democratic staffers in attendance who wished to remain anonymous, showed in ways big and small how the distance between the two sides remains a wide gulf with no clear compromise on the horizon.The Democratic staffers, who on Sunday waited for about 45 minutes when Republicans were late to the scheduled meeting, said they would not negotiate on the border wall until the government was reopened, according to a White House official in the room. Mr. Pence made it clear that the White House would not budge from the $5.7 billion in funding it wants for a wall, and that the White House would not reopen the government by supporting the six-bill package that the House has passed, according to a Democratic official familiar with the meeting.And the White House had no response, Democratic staffers said, when they pushed to acknowledge that making Transportation Security Administration officials work without pay, and shuttering other agencies, was creating a security crisis in itself. When pressed to put their demands in writing, the gap between the sides seemed to widen even more as Republicans added requests for asylum port-of-entry changes that Democrats do not favor, and for additional presence of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement along the border.Republicans, for their part, were more eager to demonstrate that progress was made over the weekend.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, on “Fox News Sunday” called the meetings “the beginning of a conversation” and said, “The fact that they’re sitting down at the table is some progress.”But Democrats said they were left with the impression that the most senior officials in attendance were arguing that they were not empowered to make any agreements. Mr. Pence noted that no numbers for wall funding would be discussed because the meeting was not a principals’ meeting. And when he introduced the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as the person who knew Mr. Trump better than anyone, Mr. Kushner demurred, saying that distinction belonged to his wife, Ivanka Trump, the president’s eldest daughter, who was not in the meeting.A White House staffer in attendance described the weekend discussions as productive and cordial, but blamed Ms. Pelosi for being unwilling to look like she was negotiating with Mr. Trump to end the shutdown.While there was little common ground, some small advances were made, White House officials said. Republicans agreed that a concrete wall was a non-starter, and that any text of a bill would refer to steel and not concrete.And even though Mr. Pence said numbers would not be part of the weekend discussions, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, on Sunday provided Democrats with a written statement outlining why the administration needed $5.7 billion for a barrier along the southern border.In the meeting, Ms. Nielsen also gave the full briefing she had prepared to give Democratic leaders last week in the Situation Room, outlining what the White House has described as a crisis at the border. Several Democrats in the room, according to the White House official, said they agreed with her that a humanitarian border crisis did exist. But the Democrats who were interviewed said the two sides remained far apart about what constituted the correct response to a humanitarian crisis.Stephen Miller, the White House policy aide who has been the architect of the president’s immigration policies and its public face, occupied a seat along the edge of the room at Saturday’s meeting, not at the table, and spoke infrequently, according to attendees. He interjected memorably only once, to argue that the Flores agreement, which limits how long the government can detain immigrant children to 20 days, was creating a loophole for smugglers.Mr. Kushner at one point defended Mr. Miller, calling him an expert on the subject. White House aides chuckled when he noted Mr. Miller’s hard-line reputation as an immigration zealot was unfair. The Democrats, however, did not express any amusement. Mr. Kushner asked the Democrats at the table why they would not concede to changes in the Flores agreement, but Mr. Pence later clarified that changes were not a condition of their negotiations.At a news conference last week, Mr. Trump hinted that he might be willing to come to an agreement with Democrats on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, and addressing the issue of thousands of young immigrants who live in the country illegally. But the subject of a DACA-for-wall deal was never broached over the weekend, aides said.And when Democrats asked Mr. Pence about the possibility of the president declaring a “national emergency” in order to secure money to build a wall, as he floated to reporters on Sunday, Mr. Pence said the president has not yet made a decision.The White House made clear on Monday that Mr. Trump was standing firm on his insistence for a border wall. Ms. Sanders announced on Twitter that Mr. Trump would visit the southern border, to highlight the continuing “national security and humanitarian crisis.”"

144,"McALLEN, Tex. — President Trump traveled to the Rio Grande Valley earlier this month and made his case for building a wall on the Southern border — needed, he said, to keep America safe from a variety of dangers that are continuing to make their way across the frontier from Mexico.To help make his point, the evidence was laid out on tables: a big bag of cash, bundles of drugs, high-powered firearms, all confiscated by law enforcement agents working the borderlands in South Texas.“This is just all recent. This is all very recent,” Mr. Trump said, pointing to the illicit exhibit in front of him. Mr. Trump was not shy about his disgust for the illegal goods: “It looks pretty brutal. This is not a manufactured deal, as you say. This is the real stuff.”But the display at the president’s Jan. 10 round table, it turns out, had little to do with what happens along unfortified reaches of the border. An examination of the seized items suggests that a border wall would not have stopped most of the items from entering the United States, or, in the case of several weapons displayed in front of the president, from leaving the United States for Mexico.Many of the items on display were seized on international bridges on the Texas border, detected by canines and Customs and Border Protection officers. Some of them were found during traffic stops or, in one case, inside a South Texas home, and it’s hard to know how they entered the country.“It’s not complex,” the president said, after various officials described the items on the table. “If we don’t have a barrier, a very substantial barrier of some kind, you’re never going to be able to solve this problem.”But of course, the story of illegal border trafficking is complex. And one of the biggest takeaways to be gleaned from Mr. Trump’s exhibit table was that nearly all of the items were intercepted by vigilant border agents — federal employees who have not been paid since the fight over a border wall led to a partial shutdown of the federal government on Dec. 22.The tableau in front of Mr. Trump included an AK-47 assault rifle and multiple 9-millimeter handguns. Though Mr. Trump seemed to take credit for the “all recent” seizures of illegal goods, these weapons were actually seized in June 2016, the month before Mr. Trump officially won the Republican nomination for president.When a vehicle drove south from the Texas border town of Mission and onto the Anzalduas International Bridge bound for Mexico, C.B.P. officers searched the car and found the weapons, according to an agency spokesman. There were also 20 ammunition magazines found in the vehicle, the spokesman said.American-made guns have illegally flowed south into Mexico in large numbers for years. A 2013 study by the University of San Diego found that nearly half of American firearms dealers are dependent on Mexican sales, with an estimated 253,000 firearms purchased annually between 2010 and 2012 to be taken across the border.Stacks of $20 bills bundled in a plastic bag totaling $362,062 sat on one table. Just days before the president arrived in McAllen, the cash had been inside the South Texas home of Edsgardo Coss-Vallejo.Mr. Coss-Vallejo had been living in the United States on a visa, but overstayed his allowed time in the country. When Hidalgo County authorities and federal agents showed up at his house to investigate, Mr. Coss-Vallejo allowed them inside to conduct a search of his home. Border Patrol canines alerted on a duffel bag containing the cash. Mr. Coss-Vallejo denied ownership of the money.Mr. Coss-Vallejo was arrested on suspicion of marriage fraud and currency smuggling, and he was deported to Mexico.After a large X-ray scanned a tractor-trailer entering Texas from Mexico at the Pharr-Reynosa International Bridge in September, Customs inspectors wanted a closer look. Canines did the rest and detected the drugs, according to a C.B.P. spokesman.Authorities found 117 kilograms of methamphetamines and 12.5 kilograms of heroin concealed in the ceiling of the truck, the spokesman said. A majority of heroin that enters the United States from Mexico crosses not through remote stretches of unfenced desert, but through legal ports of entry, such as the border crossing in Pharr, Tex. “But there’s no way to know how much gets through,” said Fulton T. Armstrong, who has worked as a national intelligence officer at the Central Intelligence Agency, on the National Security Council and on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, focusing on Latin America.“The biggest shipments come through legal, established ports of entry,” Mr. Armstrong said in an interview, though he added that there are also examples of drug smuggling that do not occur at official border crossings. Mr. Armstrong added: “Carrying this stuff requires sophistication. You don’t just put it in your pocket, you don’t carry large suitcases or bags when you come through non-ports of entry.”This has raised questions about Mr. Trump’s argument that a wall would help curb drug flows.“Would setting up a fence help? No. There’s no evidence at all,” Mr. Armstrong said.A .50-caliber sniper rifle took up a big part of one wooden table, with an AR-15 rifle positioned flat on its side alongside it.In November 2017, Homeland Security Investigations agents, working on a tip from C.B.P., found the sniper rifle during a traffic stop in South Texas, according to a C.B.P. spokesman. The AR-15 was found the same way — by H.S.I. agents in South Texas, but in January 2018.It is unclear where the weapons were headed, or whether they even originated in Mexico. Border Patrol agents infrequently encounter firearms smuggled across the Rio Grande, or into the United States between bridge crossings. Again, most seem to be heading the other way.“The thing that’s missing from the debate is the southbound stuff,” Mr. Armstrong said. “The weapons, the cash.”"
145,"El Espace is a column dedicated to news and culture relevant to Latinx communities. Expect politics, arts, analysis, personal essays and more. ¿Lo mejor? It’ll be in Spanish and English, so you can forward it to your tía, your primo Lalo or anyone else (read: everyone).On trips back to the campo where my parents grew up, and where I spent the first few years of my life, I rarely need to introduce myself. Many stop me on my way to the colmado or a relative’s house to ask, “¿Y es que tú no te acuerdas de mi?” But I never do recognize them. I left when I was a toddler, so while they see a lineage in my face — my mother’s eyes, my father’s nose — they are strangers to me. And while my aunts, who grew up carrying bath water in buckets from the river and walking around barefoot in the grass, can name all the flowers (framboyán, buganvilla, cayena) in the vast, lush backyard of their childhood, I have to ask questions, taking notes on my iPhone so I can learn to describe this place.For an immigrant (or a descendant of one) growing up in America, it can be difficult to determine when or where one’s story begins. Many feel groundless and displaced, existing between two cultures and languages. The Chicana scholar Gloria Anzaldúa described this feeling as a third space, the “borderlands,” in her groundbreaking work of feminist and cultural theory, “Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza.” A common refrán puts it more plainly: ni de aquí, ni de allá (neither from here, nor from there).Most Latinos feel a strong connection to their country of origin: More than 60 percent describe themselves in relation to their ancestral homeland (as Mexican or Colombian-American, for example) or engage in transnational activities like sending money back home, calling family members regularly or traveling back to visit. In my experience, though, it always feels like a negotiation of two identities. In New York, I am a black Dominican; in Santo Domingo, I am an American.Geraldine Isabelle Abad, a Dominican-American who plans tours for people visiting Cuba and the Dominican Republic, said that taking solo trips to her family’s country of origin has helped her integrate the different parts of her heritage. “It was eye-opening,” she said in a recent call. “It made me understand that a Dominican is not just one thing. We’re complex and diverse. There are different cultures here.” She mentioned the community of hikers she encountered while hiking Pico Duarte, the Caribbean’s highest summit, and the social justice activists creating safe spaces for queer artists in the capital as examples of the country’s cultural diversity.Being apart from her family living in the Dominican Republic wasn’t easy. “Our community values here are so strong, and that’s a gift, but it makes it hard for us to grow our own self-awareness,” Ms. Abad said. And for women in particular, there’s “that fear that a woman should have somebody to accompany her. It’s almost radical for a woman to be alone and traveling. People are afraid for us.” She hopes to dispel the misconception among Dominican-Americans that the island is unsafe outside of Punta Cana, so she created the Dominican Diaspora Heritage Tours, a culturally immersive experience curated for Dominicans living elsewhere.Reconnecting with our native countries on our own terms is one way to merge our present-day selves with our family history. A friend from New York offered another idea: She has only felt fully herself within the four walls of her apartment, the home she built after leaving home. Maybe belonging isn’t found, but crafted.Here are more stories to read this week. The program will remain in place (for now), and a decision about its future likely will not be made until 2020.Yalitza Aparicio, the breakout star of Alfonso Cuarón’s “Roma,” received an Oscar nomination for her role in the film. It’s kind of a big deal.The strikes that began last week ended on Tuesday, after the Los Angeles teachers’ union reached an agreement with the school district that will add more support staff to schools and place a cap on class sizes.President Trump recently claimed that a border wall could stop the flow of drugs into the country from Mexico, but 10 weeks of testimony at the trial of the drug lord Joaquín Guzmán Loera, better known as El Chapo, tell a different story.Tens of thousands of Venezuelans hit the streets on Wednesday to protest President Nicolás Maduro, heeding the call of a young leader for the opposition party, Juan Guaidó, who declared himself interim president after criticizing Maduro as an illegitimate dictator. Guaidó has so far gotten backing and recognition as the formal leader from various counties in Latin America as well as the United States.As we reflect on Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy this week, this essay about “the talk” many black people receive from their parents about how their skin color will affect their lives feels particularly poignant. “You are going to have to fight to be treated equal. Even to be treated fairly,” the writer’s father told her when she was 13. But in addition to offering “a warning,” he also encouraged her to see her race as a point of pride. “I want you to remember, you are lucky to be black,” he said. “Be proud, but be careful.”Do you have suggestions for El Espace?

146,"Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.WASHINGTON — I had a flight to Palm Beach booked for the day after Christmas. President Trump was scheduled to spend 16 days at his Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, over the holidays, and our White House team had divided up the hardship assignment, with most of us taking three-day shifts in the sun. (Last year on the gig, Michael S. Schmidt scored an unplanned interview with the President.)Destination Mar-a-Lago was a big reason many people close to the president predicted, at first, that the shutdown might be short-lived. Unaccustomed to spending winter weekends in Washington, the president would be eager to resume his more familiar, golf-all-afternoon routine, his friends and allies said. He wouldn’t let the fight with Congress over a border wall ruin that.But my flight came and went, and I was not on it. New Year’s Eve came and went, and no one on our team ever had to travel to Florida, because the president didn’t.One of the biggest changes of covering Mr. Trump’s West Wing during the shutdown, now on its 34th day, is that he is here, almost all of the time. It’s become a point of pride for Mr. Trump: that he is waiting patiently in the White House — “I am all alone (poor me) in the White House,” he wrote on Twitter over the holidays — for Democrats to come back to the table and make him a deal, i.e., fund his border wall.But aside from Mr. Trump’s physical presence in Washington, there are fewer changes than one might think on the White House beat.Mr. Trump’s days are filled, sort of, with meetings with his vice president or a cabinet secretary, maybe an afternoon briefing on border security, or a meeting with lawmakers from the Hill. (Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, however, haven’t come over since Jan. 9, when they said that Mr. Trump stormed out after declaring their meeting a “total waste of time.”)But the schedule is always light. Mr. Trump’s day, almost every day, starts with three hours of unstructured and unexplained “executive time,” which in the mornings often means he hasn’t left the residence. If you track his morning tweets with the cable chyrons (the text at the bottom of the screen during broadcasts), what it often means is that he is taking in the morning shows. The first meeting on his private schedule rarely occurs before 11 a.m.There have been no briefings from the press secretary during the shutdown, but that’s not new either — those have been quietly phased out since last September.The White House had no clear domestic policy agenda before the shutdown. There is little other work going on inside the building these days, but it’s not clear what short-term projects senior staff members have been diverted from.The whole city is quieter. You can always get a seat on the Metro. Traffic is light. The Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where overflow staff and other departments work from, has become a ghost town of empty offices. But the West Wing is still buzzing with its typical antagonistic energy.All of the senior White House officials who have become household names are still working. Many of them want the shutdown to end. Some of them are bored. When you visit their offices, they’ll tell you they’re not worried about their own missed paychecks, but many of them will admit they are annoyed that there are empty chairs where their assistants usually sit.Twitter also still works during the shutdown. And Mr. Trump’s thumbs have been as quick as ever when he sees an opportunity to belittle the press or amplify what looks like a brewing culture war. He relished a statement from the special counsel’s office that disputed a report that he had directed Michael D. Cohen, his longtime lawyer and fixer, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a Trump skyscraper in Moscow. And he was quick to take sides in a race-driven controversy, declaring that the white, male students from Covington Catholic High School had become “symbols of Fake News and how evil it can be” after a viral video captured them in a standoff with a Native American man at the March for Life in Washington, D.C.Some parts of my job have become more frustrating. “Communications with the media will be limited to events and issues involving the safety of human life or the protection of property, or those determined to be essential to national security,” was an automatic email response I got recently from a spokeswoman at the State Department. I had contacted her to obtain public information that was supposed to have been published online but that has not been, because of the shutdown. The White House has also stopped distributing guidance for the week ahead. Now, we find out the night before what’s on the president’s agenda for the next day.On Tuesday, I spoke with someone intimately involved in the shutdown discussions. The person assured me that Mr. Trump was never, ever going to cave on the wall, and that there has been a silver lining to the shutdown, even as 800,000 federal workers are missing their second paycheck. This person said the shutdown has been an opportunity to make a national case about border security.It sounds like pure spin, but there’s something to that. In a White House where every major development is supplanted before its significance can be fully digested, the shutdown has overshadowed many things. James Mattis, the defense secretary, resigned over what he considered a rash decision to pull troops out of Syria. The Trump Foundation was forced to close amid allegations that the family was using it for personal benefit. The stock market lost more in a month than it had since the Great Depression. Meanwhile, the shutdown has turned the White House into a one-issue building, and its reporters into a one-story crowd."

150,"As a self-described political conservative, Reagan Larson might seem to be a natural fit for the Republican Party. The 19-year-old college student from South Dakota grew up in a Catholic household that objected to same-sex marriage, and she remains firmly opposed to abortion.But in many ways, that is where the ideological similarities end. Ms. Larson, a dual major in biology and Spanish at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minn., does not oppose the legalization of marriage equality. She views climate change as undeniable, believes “immigrants make our country richer,” and disagrees with her parents on the need for a border wall.Ms. Larson is part of Generation Z, one of the most ethnically diverse and progressive age groups in American history. People born after 1996 tend to espouse similar views to the age cohort just ahead of them, the Millennials, but they are far more open to social change than older generations have been, according to the findings of a new report by the Pew Research Center. The findings mark a shift that could substantially reshape the nation’s political and economic landscape.According to the study — which was based on online surveys of 920 youths aged 13 to 17 and nearly 11,000 adults 18 or older — only 30 percent of Generation Z respondents said they approved of President Trump’s performance; more than half believed humans were fueling climate change; and 70 percent said they wanted the government to do more to solve the nation’s problems. Those views roughly mirror attitudes held by Millennials, and together, the two age groups may add up to a powerful voting bloc at odds with Republican orthodoxy, political scientists say.“This should be an alert to the Republican Party as they think about generational replacement,” said Elizabeth Bennion, a professor of political science at Indiana University South Bend.Each succeeding generation of Americans tends to be more progressive than those that came before, Ms. Bennion noted, a trend that potentially poses a long-term threat to the Republican Party’s power.“If there isn’t a will to change within the party,” she said, “it could become permanently in the minority moving forward.”Democrats of all ages tend to align fairly closely on major social and political issues, but the report highlights a sharp generational divide among Republicans. For example, more than half of the youngest Republicans surveyed said that racial and ethnic diversity was good for American society, a view shared by fewer than 40 percent of their Millennial counterparts, 34 percent of Generation Xers and just three in 10 baby boomers.Young Republicans are also more likely to approve of same-sex marriage and accept transgender people.Michael Schaefer, 18, a politically conservative college freshman from Youngstown, Ohio, said he was in the sixth grade when some classmates came out as gay, and had a number of transgender students as friends in high school.“For over half my life, I’ve been shown the other side of sexuality and gender,” he said. “I don’t care about their sex or gender, I just care about the individual.”More than one-third of Generation Z respondents said they knew someone who preferred to be addressed using gender-neutral pronouns, the Pew study found, compared with 12 percent of baby boomers.More than 68 million Americans belong to Generation Z, representing about 22 percent of the nation’s population, according to 2017 survey data from the United States Census Bureau — a share larger than the Millennials’ and second only to the baby boomers’.Contrary to conventional wisdom, Americans’ political and social views do not tend to drift to the right as they age, according to Kim Parker, who oversees research into social demographic trends at the Pew Research Center.“The differences we see across age groups have more to do with the unique historical circumstances in which they come of age,” she said, noting that demographers have not seen a generational pattern of growing more conservative or more Republican over time.Paulina Aceves, 18, a high school senior in Scottsdale, Ariz, embodies the complexities of her generation. The daughter of Mexican immigrants, she proudly identifies as a Christian and a Republican. But she does not support a border wall, nor does she believe the government should be less involved in American society.“The right solution is definitely for the government to take a more active role,” she said.The Republican Party has lost younger Americans like Travis Gaither, though, as it has moved farther to the right on issues like immigration, gun control and climate change.Mr. Gaither, who grew up in Tennessee, described his parents as “typical southern white Republicans” who belong to two country clubs and are active in the Chamber of Commerce.But Mr. Gaither, 20, was chairman of the High School Democrats of Tennessee during his senior year, a political transformation fueled by his liberal social views and cemented by his outrage over Mr. Trump’s hard-line policies.The Pew study found that two-thirds of Mr. Gaither’s generation believe, as he does, that black people are treated less fairly than whites in the United States. He said his feelings on the subject were shaped by an early brush with racism in high school, where a black girl he knew was menaced by a white football player who threatened to lynch her. And then his views were solidified last summer, he said, after a police officer in Nashville killed an unarmed black man.“I feel like I’ve moved toward the left, as the Republican Party has shifted toward the right,” he said.[For more stories about Generation Z and Millennials, please sign up here to have The Edit newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.]"
151,"ATLANTA — Vice President Mike Pence's visit Thursday to Atlanta included a stop at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's field office and a conversation about the ""broader mission of border security.""He also blasted Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms over her decision last year to bar the city jail from holding federal immigration detainees and thanked the men and women who work for ICE.Pence highlighted some of the ICE arrests made in the area, including one Wednesday night in Riverdale, Georgia, news outlets reported.""Atlanta and Georgia are safer today because of the outstanding work of the men and women of ICE in Georgia,"" Pence said.The visit also comes amid President Donald Trump's declaring a ""national emergency"" at the U.S.-Mexico border in an attempt to get more than $8 billion for a border wall — a move Congress tried to block last week. Trump has vetoed Congress' move.After Bottoms terminated the city's relationship with ICE, the federal agency entered into an agreement with a private facility in Clayton County to house detainees. There are three other detention centers in Georgia, hours away from Atlanta, in Lumpkin, Ocilla and Folkston.""It is amazing to think the mayor actually said — in her words — she would not be complicit in an immigration policy that intentionally inflicts misery,"" said Pence, flanked by Gov. Brian Kemp, U.S. Sen. David Perdue and U.S. Rep. Doug Collins.""I would say to the mayor that criminal illegal immigrants — gang members on our streets — are what inflict misery. The flow of illegal drugs like cocaine and meth and fentanyl inflict misery and wreck our families and communities. Human trafficking inflicts misery.""The mayor has said her move was prompted by the Trump administration's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy on the southwest border, which led to the separation of many immigrant families last year.""If there are politicians whose family values include ripping children from their parents' arms,"" she said in a statement Thursday, ""I fundamentally disagree and believe my decision to end that agreement fully reflects my values.""Pence took aim at Bottoms on his way to a campaign fundraiser for Perdue, who is up for re-election next year. Among Perdue's possible Democratic challengers is Stacey Abrams, a former Georgia House minority leader who narrowly lost the race for governor against Kemp last year. After Bottoms signed her executive order last year, a spokeswoman for Abrams commended the mayor's ""efforts to combat the impact of the administration's cruel and inhumane family separation policy. Anyone who stands against keeping families together lacks any kind of moral compass.""Pence also sought to link what is happening on the southwest border, including the flow of illegal drugs and human trafficking, to Atlanta.""I don't have to tell any of the ICE agents gathered here that we have a crisis on our southern border,"" he said. ""That crisis on our southern border is driving drugs and crime and human trafficking here in the streets of Atlanta.""""Walls work and we are going to build that wall,"" Pence said. ""We are going to secure our border, and we are going to continue to support the men and women of ICE here in Georgia and all across the country."""

154,"HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — After Doug Jones scored an upset win in the Alabama Senate race in 2017, elated Democrats nationwide dreamed of winning in other deeply red corners of the country. Mr. Jones seemed to offer a model, rejecting labels like progressive or conservative and calling himself a “Doug Jones Democrat.”Now, as the longest government shutdown in history rolls into a fifth week, Mr. Jones finds himself holding the same position as Nancy Pelosi, the liberal House speaker: Reopen the government, then negotiate on border security.Mr. Jones is the only red-state Senate Democrat up for re-election in 2020. By taking on President Trump and the border wall, which are both popular in Alabama, and refusing to give ground on the shutdown, the senator may be the last “Doug Jones Democrat” to win here anytime soon.Alabama has one of the largest groups of federal workers in the country, and the economic pain of those who are out of work because of the shutdown is rippling through local businesses across the state.“I voted for Jones, I did,” said Ann Lynch, an 86-year-old retired schoolteacher, as she did her grocery shopping wrapped in a fur coat on a brisk afternoon in Huntsville, where more than half of the local economy is tied to federal spending. “But he doesn’t support the wall. I don’t like that, of course. I think we need it. Trump knows we need it.”Mr. Jones’s opposition also underscores the challenge Mr. Trump faces in fulfilling one of his key campaign promises, and the fierce partisanship that has come to define the stalled shutdown negotiations. If the president can’t convince a Democrat from Alabama — the most vulnerable senator up for re-election in 2020 — to back his wall, who can he sway?“I’m just not going to throw money at anybody who is with a gun to my head,” Mr. Jones said in an interview, referring to Mr. Trump’s $5.7 billion request for the wall. “Let’s get the government open.”In Huntsville, the impact of empty offices at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center on the Army’s Redstone Arsenal base has rippled through the contractors, restaurants and hotels that power Rocket City. With 5,000 workers furloughed across the state, the pain is being felt by people like Angie Gates, whose small family restaurant lost out on $600 worth of lunch business recently because a prison training program was shut down during the wall standoff.“For us, because we’re a small town, the shutdown is kind of difficult. But there’s also things in politics that may be worth doing,” said Ms. Gates. “If Doug Jones doesn’t support the wall, I don’t support him.”Democrats argue that the politics of the shutdown favor their party, pointing to surveys showing that a majority of Americans blame the president for the stalemate and oppose the wall.But that political calculus may not hold for Mr. Jones, who won a special election to fill the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he was appointed attorney general. Polling also shows that support for the wall among conservatives, who make up much of Alabama’s electorate, has remained strong during the shutdown. Even supporters of Mr. Jones think he’s in trouble.“He’s a dead man walking,” said former Representative Parker Griffith, a conservative Democrat who helped Mr. Jones in his election and continues to support him. “He leaned into his base, and his base is not big enough to elect him.”The partisanship that has become a hallmark of the Trump era has not been kind to moderate Democrats: Of the five other Democrats from Trump-supporting red states who were in the Senate when Mr. Jones arrived last year, three lost their 2018 re-election bids after opposing Mr. Trump on various fronts, including the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.One who survived last year, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, has stood closer to Mr. Trump on the border wall than any other Democrat in the Senate, running an ad during his campaign touting his support for the proposal and saying he would back a presidential declaration of a state of emergency, if it would end the shutdown.Mr. Jones has adopted a different playbook. While he has voted with Mr. Trump half of the time, according to the website FiveThirtyEight, more than nearly any other Senate Democrat, he has stood with national Democrats on high-profile issues, including opposing Justice Kavanaugh. He used his first speech on the Senate floor to call for new gun control measures, tackling an issue that has long been anathema to many Southern Democrats.Democrats hope voters will value Mr. Jones’s decision to stick with his gut when it comes to difficult political issues, even if that means siding with the national party.“He’s a guy who’s going to be true to himself,” said John Anzalone, a Birmingham-based Democratic pollster. “Authenticity is what sells in a place like Alabama.”But there’s also little question that Mr. Jones hit the political jackpot with his special election in 2017 by facing Roy S. Moore, an already-controversial Republican opponent who became all but radioactive after charges of sexual assault against underage girls. Even with that baggage, Mr. Jones beat Mr. Moore by only about 20,000 votes.A number of Republican officials in the state, including Representative Bradley Byrne and the Alabama State Senate president pro tempore, Del Marsh, are considering challenging Mr. Jones next year. None have the liabilities of Mr. Moore, who motivated a surge of black Democratic voters while prompting some Alabama Republicans to cross party lines and others to stay home from the polls.On top of those local challenges, Mr. Jones will also be running against the backdrop of the 2020 presidential election, a contest that will both highlight the national Democratic platform and bring out conservative voters eager to support the president.Even some of his supporters don’t expect to be represented by Mr. Jones for much longer.“Senator Jones, bless his heart, he’ll be a one-term senator,” said Sheila Pressnell, 61, as she walked through a Huntsville shopping center popular with employees of NASA and other government agencies. “The only reason he got it was because he was up against a child predator.”In the interview, Mr. Jones said he is seeking bipartisan solutions to the shutdown, saying the debate “is just nothing but political noise right now” and blaming both parties for the stalemate.Republicans from his state have taken a starkly different approach.“The president is not going to blink, and he shouldn’t,” said Senator Richard C. Shelby, Mr. Jones’s Republican colleague in the Senate, adding that he would tell furloughed federal workers to “get your Democrat friends to the table and negotiate with us.”While shutdowns rarely determine the outcome of elections that come months or years later, the current political climate delivers a political double whammy to Mr. Jones’s standing in the state, as some voters blame Congress, bitter that lawmakers are collecting paychecks as government workers struggle, and others want the border wall.Sandra Snell, a Transportation Security Administration agent at the Huntsville International Airport, said she doesn’t believe anyone in Washington understands the economic struggles she now faces. Before the shutdown, she was preparing to sign a loan on a new house. Now, she’s worried about paying her bills.“You’re a federal employee, I’m a federal employee,” Ms. Snell, 51, said she would like to tell members of Congress. “I’m having to go to work without pay. You’re going to work with pay. I’d like to see my check, too.”In Huntsville, local lenders and utilities are offering ways for furloughed workers to negotiate lower rates. Restaurants near the base say they have seen a nearly 50 percent drop in customers since the shutdown began. Churches offer counseling for furloughed workers. Food banks are stocking up on nonperishable, hearty fare like pasta, beans and tuna. And pawn shops are doing brisk business.Mr. Jones has been working with constituents to help them find services, and he has been an active presence on television and on the Senate floor pushing for a resolution. He has pushed to meet with Mr. Trump, saying the White House should come and brief members of Congress beyond just the party leadership.But for some in Alabama, the crisis offers another reminder to voters that Mr. Jones doesn’t back the president — or his top campaign promise. Pam McGriff, the owner of a custom interior car detailing shop in Holly Pond, didn’t vote in Mr. Jones’s first election but said she would consider supporting him in 2020 if he supported Mr. Trump.“If he would go up there and balk the Democrats, like Schumer and Pelosi, and say, ‘Hey, I think Trump is right,’ and all that kind of stuff, I wouldn’t mind splitting my ticket,” said Ms. McGriff, 56, a Republican.Her husband, Wayne, disagreed, saying that sitting out Mr. Jones’s election wasn’t a choice he would be likely to repeat after watching the senator in office.“He should support what the people of Alabama want, which is the wall,” he said. “He shouldn’t be there, and next time he’ll be voted out.”"
155,"LONDON — President Trump’s push for a border wall hints at a problem that populist leaders are facing across the Western world.After a year of setbacks, populist leaders and parties are trying to rejuvenate their fortunes by revitalizing the sense of crisis on which they thrive. But as with Mr. Trump’s demand for a border wall — which has brought a two-week government shutdown — this may say more about populism’s weakness than its strength.Immigration and terrorism crises, which aided populism’s world-shaking rise in 2016, have waned. Populists have faced disappointing election results in Germany, the United States and even Poland, shattering the image of the movement’s inevitability and its claims to represent true popular will.The West’s populist leaders and parties have grown defensive, retreating into ever-starker messages of us-versus-them. The approach excites their most dedicated followers. But it can be risky, forcing voters to pick sides at a moment when the populist right holds declining appeal.Cas Mudde, a Dutch political scientist and leading scholar of populism, has predicted that the movement’s once-meteoric rise will become “modest” and “uneven” in 2019, with more setbacks ahead.Populism is hardly dying. It holds power in the United States, Italy and a few Eastern European countries, as well as meaningful parliamentary minorities in much of Western Europe, where populist parties now reliably win about one in six votes.Still, without a crisis to justify populism’s hard-line policies, its message has been stripped down to its most core element: opposition to liberal ideals of pluralism, multiculturalism and international cooperation.The result is a new phase in the populist era, one that will test populism’s appeal — and that of its ideological rival, postwar establishment liberalism — as never before.This story, playing out across Western democracies, may be encapsulated best by the still-unfolding drama of Mr. Trump, the government shutdown and the border wall.Two years after he won the presidency, threats supposedly posed by immigration and terrorism in the United States have not materialized.Illegal immigration continued its 10-year decline. A spate of terrorist attacks inspired by the Islamic State occurred before Mr. Trump took office.Americans lost enthusiasm for strict policies like Mr. Trump’s promised wall on the Mexican border, which polls poorly. Republicans suffered a devastating defeat in the midterm elections. Mr. Trump’s divisive message, rather than pulling more voters in, had pushed some away.But populists, who thrive on conflict against an existential threat, cannot bend with popular will as easily as mainstream parties. Rather than giving up on his wall and compromising his vision, Mr. Trump has dug in.Populists in Europe had a similarly rocky year.In Britain, support for Brexit has slipped below 50 percent. Polls suggest a majority of voters want a second referendum. Brexit hard-liners in the governing Conservative Party tried and failed to eject Theresa May, the prime minister, over her support for a softer Brexit.In Germany, the rise of Alternative for Germany, a far-right party, has stalled. It performed worse than expected in elections in the border state of Bavaria, where immigration is a major issue, and worse than it fared a year earlier.When Bavaria’s center-right party tried to co-opt the populist message and challenge Chancellor Angela Merkel over immigration, it suffered election losses. Ms. Merkel survived, her approval rating spiked and she lined up a centrist successor.Many Western populists are falling back to their message of besiegement and threat, as much out of the paranoid worldview that is central to populism as out of any conscious strategy.Brexit hard-liners are pointing to the 470 people who illegally crossed the English Channel by boat last year, a drop in the bucket compared with the hundreds of thousands of arrivals to Europe in 2015 and 2016. Mr. Trump has claimed, with no hard evidence, mayhem at the Mexican border.But dividing the world into us versus them works only if voters want to belong to “us” and oppose “them,” typically establishment elites and cultural outsiders.In Europe, many more voters have had contact with migrants since 2016, which research suggests can lessen fear and resentment. In the United States, the buoyed economy has undercut fears of economic competition from immigrants.One of the countries most often cited as a populist success last year may also underscore the movement’s challenges.The Sweden Democrats, a populist party, won 17.5 percent of the vote, its highest share ever, in a national election in September. If populists could surge this high, this fast even in Sweden, a bastion of liberalism, surely it represented a global shift.But polls tell a different story.Support for the Sweden Democrats has not grown since the end of 2015, just as the refugee crisis began tapering off. And the party’s share of the vote last year was only slightly more than that of Dutch far-right populists in 2017, which had been considered a disappointing setback for the movement.Sweden’s experience may suggest that Western populists rose only with the refugee and terrorism crises and that, as those crises have faded, populism has stalled out well below the numbers needed for it to sustainably hold power.A review of populism’s global performance, conducted by Jordan Kyle and Limor Gultchin of the London-based Institute for Global Change, reached a similar finding.Populists today hold 20 governments worldwide — the same number they held in 2010, have held most years since and have never surpassed. What we perceive as a new wave may in fact be populism shifting out of poorer countries, often in Latin America, where they have since suffered setbacks, to the West.But there is another way to read cases like Sweden: not as the populist wave cresting, but as the liberal consensus breaking. Even if populists win power only occasionally, struggle in office and mostly consign themselves to an angry minority, that they play any role at all represents a seismic change.Their rise, even if it never progresses much further, could still reshape Western politics in ways we are only beginning to understand.Stripped of claims to be responding to an immigration crisis, the populist message is taking on a certain clarity — and proving an enduring, if narrow, appeal.Though these parties surged in support only recently, their slow but steady rise dates to the 1960s, when postwar liberalism took hold.Ever since, they have used crises to hit on deeper fears of demographic and cultural change brought about by liberalism. And they have channeled opposition to an establishment consensus that called it taboo to question liberal ideals.There has always been some discomfort with the aspect of liberalism that populists are most aggressively challenging: the notion that democracies must extend rights and protections to outsiders.Western populists have surfaced that discomfort and given it voice. By winning at least enough votes to force the world to listen, they have opened up space for Western voters to reject liberal strictures explicitly.Parties like the Sweden Democrats and Alternative for Germany may no longer have much hope of leveraging crises to win power outright. But there appears to be enough latent opposition to liberalism to keep populists well involved in politics.Border crises, real or imagined, are ideal for this message. They highlight aspects of liberalism that people find most objectionable: promises to protect outsiders, demands that countries compromise sovereignty and the softening of fixed, racially defined national identities.So perhaps when Brexit hard-liners or Bavarian populists play up border crises that may seem exaggerated they are speaking to a deeper concern among their small but dedicated base.That may be enough to keep them in national legislatures and conversations. Even if populists in the West never advance beyond their heights in 2016, they will remain in a strong position to challenge liberalism’s postwar hold over Western democracies.Even in countries like Germany or France, where centrist leaders hold power, the establishment party system has collapsed. Seva Gunitsky, a University of Toronto political scientist, has argued that the distinction between democracy and authoritarianism is already blurring, with more elected leaders taking on the tools and tactics of strongmen.Postwar liberal democracy is simply too new of a system, scholars of democracy say, to know whether it can survive these challenges. We may look back at 2016 as a populist blip associated with one-off crises, or as the beginning of a process of chipping away at liberal democracy from within.“For anyone who was hoping for a break in the hectic politics of the past years,” Mr. Mudde wrote in his assessment of populism’s prospects, “2019 won’t be it.”"
156,"House Republican leaders removed Representative Steve King of Iowa from the Judiciary and Agriculture Committees on Monday night as party officials scrambled to appear tough on racism and contain damage from comments Mr. King made to The New York Times questioning why white supremacy is considered offensive.The punishment came on a day when Mr. King was denounced by an array of Republican leaders, though not President Trump. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, suggested Mr. King find “another line of work” and Senator Mitt Romney said he should quit. And the House Republicans, in an attempt to be proactive, stripped him of the committee seats in the face of multiple Democratic resolutions to censure Mr. King that are being introduced this week.Those measures would force Republicans to take a stand on the House Democratic majority’s attempt to publicly reprimand one of their own.Mr. King, who has been an ally of President Trump on the border wall and other issues, has a long history of making racist remarks and insults about immigrants, but has not drawn rebukes from Republican leaders until recently. In November, top Iowa Republicans like Senator Charles E. Grassley endorsed Mr. King for re-election even after one House Republican official came out and denounced him as a white supremacist.[Steve King has a history of making racist remarks. Read them and more here.]But in an interview with The Times published last week, Mr. King said: “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?”Speaking to reporters on Monday night after the House Republican leadership team acted, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, said he was not ruling out supporting a censure or reprimand resolution against Mr. King. He said the Republicans are not removing Mr. King from the G.O.P. House conference itself, so he can still attend its party meetings, and it was up to Iowans whether Mr. King should stay in office.“This is not the first time we’ve heard these comments,” Mr. McCarthy said of Mr. King, an acknowledgment of the racist language the congressman has used before. “That is not the party of Lincoln and it’s definitely not American.”Mr. McCarthy, who conferred privately with Mr. King for an hour before the vote, did not say why the most recent comments were a breaking point given Mr. King’s long public record of similar remarks. “Maybe I did not see those, but I disagree with these.”The full Republican conference must still technically ratify the leader’s decision, but Mr. McCarthy presented the matter as closed.Mr. King remained defiant after losing his committee seats, releasing a long statement insisting that his comments in the Times article had been misunderstood. He said he had been referring only to “western civilization” when he asked “how did that language become offensive,” not “white nationalist” or “white supremacist.”“Leader McCarthy’s decision to remove me from committees is a political decision that ignores the truth,” he said.He said he told Mr. McCarthy, “You have to do what you have to do and I will do what I have to do.” He pledged to continue to “point out the truth” and serve his district for “at least the next two years.”The push to condemn Mr. King illustrated how alarmed senior Republicans are about the party’s image just two months after they lost 40 House seats, most of them in suburban or diverse districts — including seven in Mr. McCarthy’s home state of California, where the G.O.P. is on the brink of extinction.The condemnations of Mr. King stood in stark contrast to the lawmakers’ willingness to tolerate President Trump’s  frequent offensive and insensitive remarks about migrants, black people, Native Americans and other minorities.Just last week, the president used the Oval Office to unleash a blistering assault on undocumented immigrants, portraying them as criminals in a fashion that harked back to an earlier era of American politics but rarely heard from a president in modern times. And on Sunday night, Mr. Trump invoked the Wounded Knee massacre of hundreds of Native Americans as an attempt to joke about Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.“I’m glad that they are finally taking action after all of these years of Steve King slandering immigrants and Hispanics, but the president of the United States is also doing that and he just said something about Elizabeth Warren a few evenings ago that was also racially ugly and we haven’t heard a word of condemnation from anyone in the Republican Party about that,” said Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]Congressional Republicans have continued to embrace the president and his hard-line immigration politics, averting their gaze from his inflammatory rhetoric out of fear their core voters will punish them if they stray from Mr. Trump.The president, when asked by reporters on Monday about Mr. King’s remarks, said, “I haven’t been following it.”Republicans are now trying to get ahead of a fast-moving political problem while the country is in the midst of a lengthy government shutdown over a border wall by President Trump, who in many ways patterned his immigration policies and rhetoric on those of Mr. King.Mr. McCarthy called a special meeting of the Republican Steering Committee to remove Mr. King from Judiciary — which has jurisdiction over immigration, voting rights and impeachment — and Agriculture, which is a prized committee for Iowans. Mr. King also lost his seat on the Small Business Committee. The steering committee vote was unanimous.While Republican officials quickly turned on Mr. King, the party also came in for criticism from the Senate’s lone black Republican, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina. He noted that the G.O.P. has long remained silent in the face of racist comments.“Some in our party wonder why Republicans are constantly accused of racism — it is because of our silence when things like this are said,” Mr. Scott wrote in a Washington Post opinion column.It is not clear what, if any, additional steps congressional Republican leaders will take with Mr. King. The National Republican Congressional Committee indicated Monday that they were not ready to step away from him.“The N.R.C.C. does not get involved in primaries and isn’t going to comment on a hypothetical general election two years away,” said Chris Pack, a spokesman for the House campaign arm.Democrats are moving to censure or reprimand the Iowa congressman, a stinging penalty. Among them were Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, the highest ranking African-American in Congress, who introduced a measure Monday night in the form of a resolution of disapproval of Mr. King’s comments and white nationalism.Democratic leaders in the House have yet to say what they will do with the competing censure resolutions, but are inclined to allow a vote of some sort related to Mr. King’s remarks, according to one senior Democratic aide.In the interview with The Times, Mr. King also reflected on the record number of minorities and women in the new Democratic-controlled House. “You could look over there and think the Democratic Party is no country for white men,” he said.Mr. King’s hard-line immigration policies and demeaning comments about Hispanics foreshadowed Mr. Trump’s nativist rhetoric in his 2016 campaign, in his two years in the White House and during the government shutdown over a border wall. The president once boasted to Mr. King that he raised more money for him than anyone else, Mr. King recalled in the Times article, which traced how the Iowa congressman helped write the playbook for white identity politics that dominate the Republican Party under Mr. Trump.He has already drawn one serious primary opponent, state senator Randy Feenstra, for the 2020 campaign and some high-profile Republicans have indicated they will not embrace his re-election.“It does open the door for other individuals to take a look,” Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa said in a television interview last week of Mr. King’s closer-than-expected victory last year.Ms. Reynolds said she was staying out of the primary “right now,” but multiple Iowa Republicans said the state’s senior elected officials were unlikely to endorse Mr. King again and would wait until there is more clarity in the primary field before rallying to one of his G.O.P. challengers. Other Western Iowa Republicans are expected to challenge Mr. King, who has fended off primaries before but did so with the support of his party and its top leaders.In addition to Ms. Reynolds’s criticism, Iowa Republican chair Jeff Kaufmann said the state party would “remain neutral” in Mr. King’s primary.Also, Iowa’s two Republican senators, Mr. Grassley and Joni Ernst, along with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who had appointed Mr. King a co-chairman of his 2016 presidential campaign, all rebuked Mr. King in recent days.All had eagerly embraced him in the past because of his standing with the state’s most conservative voters — keys to winning statewide elections in Iowa, which holds the first-in-the-nation presidential nominating contest.Mr. Grassley had endorsed Mr. King in November for re-election, even after the chairman of the House Republican election committee denounced Mr. King as a white supremacist.“Iowa needs Steve King in Congress,” Mr. Grassley said in that endorsement. “I also need Steve King in Congress.”Ms. Ernst, who faces re-election in 2020, appeared with Mr. King at a rally in his district the Monday before Election Day last year, after he had endorsed a Toronto mayoral candidate with neo-Nazi ties."
157,"On the 12th day of the federal government shutdown, the 45th president of the United States of America posted a meme on his Instagram account: an image of his half-glowering, half-smirking visage, hovering gigantically above the Southwestern desert, dwarfing the picture’s centerpiece — a rendering of his signature campaign promise — and, in a familiar font, some explanatory text: “The Wall Is Coming.” It’s an image that makes you think, That’s from HBO’s hit series “Game of Thrones” — sort of, and then makes you think about the unique privileges and burdens of living in this moment in history.There are so many unusual aspects of Donald Trump’s presidency that his willingness to communicate with the public through internet memes is often overshadowed. Typically, he retweets images made by his most enthusiastic backers — in November he shared one of the Clintons, Barack Obama, Huma Abedin, Robert Mueller, his own deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and others, all locked up in a prison cell together — but the wall meme appears to be a White House original. It is also the second “Game of Thrones” meme the president has shared in the last two months. He does this sort of thing so often that the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, recently felt compelled to tweet, like an exasperated high school teacher, “Enough with the memes.”It’s impossible to overstate how peculiar it is that the most powerful man in the world, who will turn 73 in June, posts memes. It’s a behavior more often associated with youth, irreverence and a surfeit of free time — though certainly plenty of old, aggrieved people have picked up the habit in recent years. In 2016, the Trump campaign united message-board trolls and Facebook boomers, and together they disseminated so many memes that some of them began to believe — both jokingly and not — that their “meme magic” had helped Trump win the election.In current usage, “meme” refers most often to an image with text overlay, designed for distribution online. They’re like the bumper stickers of the digital realm, in that any one concept can be endlessly remixed to convey just about any sort of sentiment (Calvin can pee on anything). What began more than a decade ago as a fun way to imagine how cats might talk has evolved into a surprisingly fertile mode of political communication. The online database Know Your Meme has confirmed the existence of some 4,066 successful memes in the wild — including newcomers like Big Chungus, a fake series of video games starring an obese rabbit, and classics like Doge, which featured a shiba inu speaking broken English. The actual number is certainly much higher.You might find this very silly, and you wouldn’t be wrong. But keep in mind: The president posts them.All of this represents a long fall from the meme’s origins. The word was coined by the British ethologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book, “The Selfish Gene,” as a way to conceptualize the transmission of culture in biological terms. For Dawkins, a meme, shortened from the Greek mimeme — “an imitated thing” — was a unit of culture, a building block of our mental architecture. “Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from body to body via sperms or eggs,” Dawkins wrote, “memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain.” They could be as small and short-lived as a tune or catchphrase, he explained, or as large and consequential as “God” and “eternal damnation.”Genes, Dawkins argued, do not aim to propagate a species; they seek only to propagate themselves. Memes, he believed, were similarly selfish. Dawkins spends most of his chapter on memetics fixating on religion, and because he has since become such an aggressively outspoken atheist, reading the book today it is easy to get the sense that he considers religion almost parasitic. The concept of “God,” he figured, endures because it offers a psychological salve to people, while “eternal damnation” survives because it is useful as a means of social control. Thus both live on, copied from generation to generation, latching on to humanity and perpetuating themselves too effectively to be got rid of. “Selection favors memes that exploit their cultural environment to their own advantage,” Dawkins wrote.Ideas, in this view, have lives of their own, and the environment in which they struggle for survival is the human mind — our limited processing power means that only the toughest will persevere. “If a meme is to dominate the attention of a human brain,” Dawkins wrote, “it must do so at the expense of ‘rival’ memes.” He conceded that a meme would also have to compete for airtime on the radio or TV, billboard space, column inches and book pages. But, writing back in the 1970s, he had no reason to consider what would happen if those scarcity conditions vanished. If they did, you would find yourself in a terrifyingly fecund primordial soup in which all sorts of ideas could develop, mutate, cross-pollinate, do battle, die off and be reborn. You would find yourself, well, online.And while this primordial soup has brought forth many novel concepts, and resuscitated some old, corrosive beliefs, the things we call “memes” today are largely just joke formats — mechanisms for the efficient production of humor. They develop less like new ideas and more like algal blooms, spreading until they block out the sun and consume all the oxygen, before dying out naturally (people get sick of them) or getting hit with bleach (explainer journalists write about them). Individually, these memes leave little mark on our culture. Worse than being forgettable, they become, within a year or two, embarrassing to think back on for even one second.But taken as a whole, this swarm of cultural mayflies represents a meaningful shift in our culture. Joke-making, a sometimes cruel enterprise, has been mechanized and democratized. Humor now emerges from the ether, authorless or, more accurate, authored and improved upon by everyone. Jokes are communal now, and constant. Online, everything that happens all day — in politics, in culture, in the news — is rapidly repurposed for laughs, by everyone, all at once.For the most part, this is harmless. After all, what could possibly go wrong in a culture where all anyone wants is to be perpetually amused?Before Trump’s border wall was the cause of a government shutdown, it was a mnemonic device — less a policy proposal than a string tied around the finger. According to a recent article in The Times, the wall was a “memory trick for an undisciplined candidate.” Trump’s advisers Sam Nunberg and Roger Stone knew that getting tough on immigration would play well to a right-wing audience, but they also knew the man they were dealing with. He has a mind for the tactile, so they gave him something gigantic to hang onto: an 1,800-mile-long slab of concrete.But Trump’s talking points were never just talking points. They were more like bits. His campaign rallies were rambling, unscripted affairs, almost like an open-mic comedy set: Not a fearsome Nuremberg rally, but an aging showman road-testing material, seeing what caught the audience’s attention. Early on, his speeches were “all over the place,” the NBC reporter Katy Tur told “Frontline,” but as time passed, “he started to really hone his message, and he started to remember what lines worked.” In the same episode, the writer Marc Fisher said Trump told him that he would simply wait to see the red lights on the TV cameras in the press box turn on, indicating he was live, and then he would say “whatever it took to keep the red light on.”The border wall kept the lights on. At a 2016 rally in Burlington, Vt., Trump mentioned the wall to tremendous, wonderful applause, then paused and asked his audience, “And who’s gonna pay for the wall?” The crowd roared back, “MEXICO!” They — he and his crowd — did this two more times together, then Trump laughed. “I’ve never done it before, I swear,” he said, throwing his arms up as if surprised it had worked. “That was pretty cool. We’re gonna have to use that.”This incentive structure, in which an easily distracted person says a bunch of stuff he kind of means to an assembled audience, slowly learning what generates a reaction and what doesn’t, is familiar: It’s like posting online. This is the process that nudged the wall ever closer to reality, despite the fact that it was only ever supposed to be a metaphor, a shorthand, a catchphrase. It is an idea with no real owner or creator, passed from person to person, from lectern to grandstand to TV and Twitter and back again, copying itself and growing and mutating until it became big, beautiful and tipped with spikes forged from American steel. The border wall is, in the truest sense, a meme: an idea that persists not because it will benefit us but simply because it thrives in our environment. It was so effective at doing whatever it did that it couldn’t be contained, spilling out of the president’s brain and spreading throughout our entire body politic, cooling and hardening like bacon grease, until it finally brought everything to a standstill. And I hate to admit it, but that is a little funny."
158,"WASHINGTON — A day after California filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump’s emergency declaration on the border, the Transportation Department said it was exploring legal options to claw back $2.5 billion in federal funds it had already spent on the state’s high-speed rail network.The Trump administration also said it was terminating a $929 million federal grant to the California High-Speed Rail Authority, according to a letter the Transportation Department sent Tuesday.The $77 billion Los Angeles-to-San Francisco bullet train, which has been a goal of California transportation planners for decades, has long faced opposition from Mr. Trump and other Republicans. But on Tuesday morning, the president explicitly tied the rail line to efforts to stymie construction of the Mexican border wall.“The failed Fast Train project in California, where the cost overruns are becoming world record setting, is hundreds of times more expensive than the desperately needed Wall!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, who announced last week that he was scaling back the project, said the Transportation Department’s move was retaliation for the border wall lawsuit, filed on Monday with 15 other states.“It’s no coincidence that the administration’s threat comes 24 hours after California led 16 states in challenging the president’s farcical ‘national emergency,’” Mr. Newsom said in a statement. “This is clear political retribution by President Trump, and we won’t sit idly by. This is California’s money, and we are going to fight for it.”The battle over money is just the latest clash between California and the Trump administration, which have fought over immigration, environmental and criminal justice issues. Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general, has been a vociferous critic of the administration and has filed 46 lawsuits against it so far.(Read more about the long-running debate over California’s bullet train here.)On Tuesday, Mr. Trump disparaged the way California had spent the rail money and the state’s role in the national emergency lawsuit. California, which “has wasted billions of dollars on their out of control Fast Train, with no hope of completion, seems in charge!” the president tweeted.A White House spokesman declined to comment, referring questions to the Transportation Department. A spokesman for the agency said the reason for canceling the grant was clearly laid out in a letter from Ronald L. Batory, the administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration.Mr. Batory wrote that the federal funds were being pulled because the California High-Speed Rail Authority had “failed to make reasonable progress on the project.”The Transportation Department said in a separate statement on Tuesday that it was “actively exploring every legal option” to seek the return of the $2.5 billion. That threat, however, was not mentioned in Mr. Batory’s letter.Late Tuesday, a Trump administration official pointed to Mr. Newsom’s remarks last week as an indication that the project was too costly and would “never be constructed as planned.”Given that acknowledgment, the official said, the administration had a responsibility to taxpayers to “cancel the financial support for this boondoggle.”The lawsuit over the emergency declaration, filed in Federal District Court in San Francisco, argues that Congress controls spending and that the president does not have the power to divert funds for the construction of a wall.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said that he had been expecting the court challenge, but was not fazed. “We’re going to be very successful with the lawsuit,” he said, adding, “It’s an open and closed case.”The court challenge raises thorny legal issues over the scope of emergency powers granted to a president. Mr. Trump’s declaration is the first time a president has invoked emergency power statutes to circumvent Congress after it rejected funding for a specific policy being pushed by the White House.It is also unclear whether the federal government has the legal authority to withhold the grant from California, and state officials are likely to challenge the move in court.Dan Richard, who stepped down Tuesday as chairman of the board of the high-speed rail project, noted that the letter from the Trump administration said the federal government “intends to” terminate the agreement, rather than saying it was canceling it outright. He said he believed this gave California time to press for an agreement to keep the $929 million.“Of course it’s a serious matter — the federal government has a lot of power in this situation,” he said. “I’m hoping that the phrase ‘intends to terminate’ gives an opportunity for parties to resolve this issue.”The project has been a major employer in California’s Central Valley, where bridges and overpasses have been built. “We have to keep in mind that we’ve got real human beings working on this right now, thousands of them, whose jobs are at risk,” Mr. Richard said.The high-speed rail project was a signature issue of former Gov. Jerry Brown. Last week, a day after his successor, Mr. Newsom, announced that he planned to scale back the project, the president posted on Twitter that California owed the federal government $3.5 billion, adding, “We want that money back now.”Mr. Newsom replied that the president was wrong that the project had been canceled. “Fake news,” Mr. Newsom tweeted. “We’re building high-speed rail, connecting the Central Valley and beyond. This is CA’s money, allocated by Congress for this project. We’re not giving it back.”The high-speed rail plan has faced stiff opposition from Republicans for years, and it has never been clear how, exactly, the project would be financed. Last year, state officials said the cost of the project was likely to balloon to $100 billion, and the rail authority had so far come up with about a third of that. But Mr. Brown championed the initiative, which was the most expansive public transit project currently under construction in the country. Mr. Newsom never appeared to share that enthusiasm.“Let’s level about high-speed rail,” Mr. Newsom said last week in the State of the State speech in Sacramento, adding, “Right now, there simply isn’t a path to get from Sacramento to San Diego, let alone from San Francisco to L.A.”Aides to Mr. Newsom later appeared to walk back his comments, saying he was not shelving the project and simply wanted to focus on the Central Valley first.Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, said in a statement on Tuesday that it was time “to move on from the broken high-speed rail project and redirect our efforts to infrastructure projects that work for Californians.”The $929 million in funds that the Trump administration says it plans to take back have not yet been transferred to California. That money has been allocated, but not disbursed, meaning that the money is still in the hands of the federal government. To obtain those funds, California was obligated to match a previous grant of $2.6 billion in stimulus money. As of Tuesday, the state had matched 38 percent of that."

160,"WASHINGTON — President Trump stormed out of a White House meeting with congressional leaders on Wednesday after Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would not fund a border wall even if he agreed to reopen the government, escalating a confrontation that has shuttered large portions of the government for 19 days and counting.Stunned Democrats emerged from the meeting in the White House Situation Room declaring that the president had thrown a “temper tantrum” and slammed his hands on the table before leaving with an abrupt “bye-bye.” Republicans disputed the hand slam and blamed Democratic intransigence for prolonging the standoff.When the meeting was over, talks to reopen the government appeared to be in disarray. The contentious, brief and futile session underscored an impasse that is looking each day like an insurmountable gulf between the two sides. Mr. Trump will visit the border on Thursday in McAllen, Tex., leaving little hope of a resolution for a shutdown that will tie the longest in the nation’s history on Friday.“It wasn’t even a high-stakes negotiation; it was a petulant president of the United States,” Ms. Pelosi said as she returned to the Capitol. “A person who would say, ‘I’ll keep government shut down for weeks, months or years unless I get my way.’”Mr. Trump called the exercise “a total waste of time.”[View our story on the longest government shutdowns ever.]“I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye,” he posted on Twitter.Day 19 had begun with what looked like signs of splintering support within the president’s own party. Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, pledged to confront Mr. Trump in a closed-door lunch at the Capitol, while more mainline conservatives like Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, expressed misgivings about the president’s strategy.Though Senate Republicans had not yet reached a breaking point, Mr. Roberts said, “We’re getting pretty close.”But those differences largely had been papered over by day’s end. The House voted 240 to 188 to fund the Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies, including White House operations. The eight Republican defections exceeded last week’s vote to fund the government by only a single vote.Mr. Trump, for his part, held out the possibility that he might declare a national emergency to build his promised border wall and circumvent Congress altogether — a deeply divisive option even within his own party that could allow him to use money allocated for the military and one that would almost certainly be challenged in court.“There was no discussion about anything other than solidarity,” Mr. Trump said after his lunch with Senate Republicans and before the White House negotiating session.As the sides feuded, 800,000 federal workers were going without pay, and government agencies continued to reduce services, part of the cascading effect of a partial shutdown now possibly headed for a fourth week.So frayed were feelings after a frantic 24-hour period of accusations and recriminations, including dueling nationally televised addresses, that Republicans and Democrats emerged from the White House meeting unable to agree on what had happened in the room.On this they did: Mr. Trump insisted again on $5.7 billion in border wall funding, and asked Democrats, who he pointed out have supported money for physical barriers in the past, if they would capitulate if he agreed to reopen the government. Democrats told him again that they support increased funding for border security, but refused to commit additional money for a physical barrier that they believe is a waste of money. They laid out what they said was unnecessary damage being done to federal workers.“You are using people as leverage; why won’t you open the government and stop hurting people?” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, asked Mr. Trump at one point during the meeting, according to Democratic congressional officials and a White House official familiar with the exchange.“Then you won’t give me what I want,” Mr. Trump replied, the congressional officials said. The White House official said that Mr. Trump added, “I am trying to do the right thing for the country. This isn’t about politics.”But there are signs of strain. After his lunch with Senate Republicans, Mr. Trump declared that the party was “totally unified,” even if he faced some questions about “strategy.”Leading up to it, though, the number of Republicans uneasy about the president’s tactics appeared to be growing. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia and the chairwoman of the appropriations subcommittee on homeland security, had warned on Tuesday that she could potentially support reopening the government as talks continued on border security — the Democratic position.“I mean, I think I could live with that,” Ms. Capito said. She said she expected pressure from federal employees and voters in her state would only mount the longer the impasse drags on. “I’ve expressed more than a few times the frustrations with a government shutdown and how useless it is, so that pressure’s going to build,” she said.Ms. Murkowski had vowed to confront the president on the shutdown’s effect on her state. She and other moderate Republicans entered the lunch confident that senators were coalescing around the idea that the government should be reopened, but they left disappointed, convinced that for now, the party would follow Mr. Trump perilously further into a shutdown with an uncertain end.A handful of them, including Ms. Murkowski and Senators Cory Gardner of Colorado, Susan Collins of Maine and James Lankford of Oklahoma, pressed Mr. Trump on the mounting burden on federal workers and related industries in their states. His response was consistent.“I was able to raise the issues that I have with using a shutdown,” Ms. Murkowski said. “He listened and urged that we all stick together.”Several senators, including Ms. Collins, sought to find a way out of the impasse through a broader deal. In the meeting, she urged the president to reconsider an earlier deal that would have given him $25 billion for a wall in exchange for permanent protections for young undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children, according to Republicans familiar with the exchange.The president dismissed the idea. A handful of senators huddled Wednesday evening with the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, to hash over possible ways out of the impasse. But no apparent progress was made.For now, at least, the president seems to have maintained support for his uncompromising position.“He’s like the Missouri mule who sits down in the mud and says, ‘I’m not moving,’” said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana.Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said Mr. Trump had made the case that Republicans had a much better chance of prevailing if they remained united in opposition to spending bills to get the government funded again.“What did Benjamin Franklin say at the constitutional convention?” Mr. Cornyn told reporters. “We need to hang together or we’ll hang separately. That’s what it reminded me of.”Democrats, who are confident Mr. Trump is taking the brunt of the blame for the impasse, showed little sign of capitulation. The House vote to fund financial agencies and the White House was the first of several this week on individual spending bills that are intended to pick off uneasy Republicans. But in the end, it drew only one more Republican than a vote last week to reopen the government. A White House official said Wednesday that Mr. Trump would veto any such bill.In the Senate, Democrats had managed to grind to a stop unrelated foreign policy legislation to increase pressure on Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, to relent on his insistence that he will not put any bill to reopen the government up for a vote there without Mr. Trump’s support.Democrats offered other warnings to the White House. Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said he had warned Patrick Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, in a private meeting that a national emergency declaration by Mr. Trump would constitute a “major breach” of relations between the Pentagon and Congress.Mr. McConnell continued publicly to insist that the dispute was for Democrats and the president to solve. He has largely absented himself from negotiations, and did not speak during Wednesday’s White House session, a position that appeared to be validated on Tuesday by a Politico and Morning Consult poll that found only 5 percent of respondents blamed congressional Republicans for the impasse, compared with 47 percent who blamed Mr. Trump and 33 percent who blamed congressional Democrats.“I cannot urge my Democratic colleagues more strongly to get past this purely partisan spite, rediscover their own past positions on border security and negotiate a fair solution with our president to secure our nation and reopen all of the federal government,” Mr. McConnell said in remarks on the Senate floor."
161,"McALLEN, Tex. — When a president comes to town there are two realities, the one the White House hopes to create and the one that actually exists.President Trump arrived in this city on the Mexican border on Thursday to dramatize his desire for a border wall, a hardened position that has caused the partial shutdown of the federal government.He surrounded himself with border agents, victims of horrible crimes, a display of methamphetamine and heroin, an AK-47 and an AR-15 rifle, and a trash bag stuffed with $362,062 in cash that had been confiscated by law enforcement officials.In his view, it all added up to a single word, “crisis,” with a lone solution, building a wall — a point he emphasized in a discussion with the crime victims, law enforcement officers and McAllen residents.“That says it all,” Mr. Trump said of the contraband. “They didn’t have to go very far. This is all very recent.”But there was another reality. The display of drugs, weapons and cash was mainly the product of law enforcement actions stopping criminals at international bridges, where most drugs are smuggled, and conventional ports of entry.In a place where a wall is already in place, law enforcement officials boasted of apprehending criminals who had built a tunnel. The money was taken from a suspect who had overstayed a visa.In a meeting on Tuesday with network anchors before his prime-time address to the nation, Mr. Trump had dismissed the trip to McAllen as a waste of time, a mere photo op. But he gamely went forward after arriving here early Thursday afternoon.A few miles south of McAllen, he stood near a bluff above the Rio Grande, with Mexico in the near distance. There were more border agents, an array of military vehicles and a helicopter flyover for effect with agents saluting the commander in chief. The Fox host Sean Hannity stood nearby, waiting for an exclusive interview.Hundreds of people lined a nearby highway, many waving signs backing Mr. Trump. The border agents who assembled for the meeting also gave him hearty cheers. One supporter was Joe Cantu, a former police chief from a nearby town wearing a Make America Great Again baseball cap and T-shirt.“They’re coming over in Banzai waves,” Mr. Cantu said of immigrants crossing into Texas.Other signs told a different story. They said “No Wall, No Hate,” “We Are All Immigrants” and “Our Only Crisis Is Trump’s Failing Presidency.”On the route from the meeting to the photo op along the Rio Grande, the president’s motorcade also passed numerous product distribution centers, large, low-slung buildings that employ hundreds of people. Those businesses are a product of Nafta, the commercial agreement with Mexico and Canada that Mr. Trump has labeled the worst of all time, but that has transformed South Texas over the last two decades.The McAllen area is heavily Democratic and the local congressman opposes the wall, as do many local officials. Still, the scene was a draw.“I just wanted to get a picture,” said Veronica Whitacre, a local city commissioner and McAllen native. “It’s sad for South Texas that people believe we live in a dangerous place. When I go places, people ask where I am from and I say McAllen. And people say, ‘Are you O.K.?’”The city is certainly O.K. when it comes to crime, which is near a 30-year low. The president did not talk about that. “You’ll have crime in Iowa, you’ll have crime in New Hampshire, you’ll have crime in New York without a wall,” Mr. Trump said.Mr. Trump did not discuss the significant increase in cases of children being separated from their families as a result of his hard-line immigration policies. He spoke only a few blocks from a detention center, but did not go in. When asked by a reporter if he would visit it, the president said that he would like to, but that it would be up to the Secret Service. He did not go.He also criticized Democrats who have accused him of trying to manufacture a crisis to justify his $5.7 billion border barrier demand. “What’s manufactured is the word manufactured,” the president said.Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary who accompanied Mr. Trump to Texas, reiterated the administration’s position that what is happening along the border is a crisis.Those who claim it was manufactured, she said, “insulted” Americans. To that, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, who joined the president and his entourage, added, “When we see politicians go on TV and say the border’s secure and there is no crisis, they are ignoring reality.”Not to be outdone, Dan Patrick, the Texas lieutenant governor, added, “To those who say this is a manufactured crisis, it’s a manufactured cover-up by your opposition.”Democrats have insisted that the administration faces a large-scale humanitarian problem that is a direct result of Mr. Trump’s policy, but argue that a border wall is not the right solution and that Mr. Trump has failed to make the case that there is a true security crisis.A local pastor sympathetic to the president emphasized during a round-table discussion that the crisis was “humanitarian” in nature.Still, Mr. Trump said that he had a “feel about things” and could sense Democrats moving toward his position.“I know you don’t see it yet, but I have a feel about things, and I really believe the other side is starting to get it.”Representative Vicente Gonzalez, a Democrat whose district includes McAllen, was in Washington while the president visited his hometown. But he closely monitored Mr. Trump’s trip.“It’s all theatrics,” Mr. Gonzalez said in an interview, before insisting that Mr. Trump was somehow trying to escape the government shutdown with a victory.Mr. Gonzalez added: “He’s trying to land the plane, and I think he knows time is not on his side. So he came down to the border to try to make a final case.”"
162,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Friday pointed to nearly five dozen previous instances in which presidents of both parties have declared emergencies as justification for his invocation of extraordinary powers to build his border wall. But there is no precedent for what he has just done.None of the times emergency powers have been invoked since 1976, the year Congress enacted the National Emergencies Act, involved a president making an end run around lawmakers to spend money on a project they had decided against funding. Mr. Trump, by contrast, is challenging the bedrock principle that the legislative branch controls the government’s purse.“On the surface, this ‘Oh, other presidents do this, too’ line seems logical,” said Chris Edelson, an American University government professor and author of a 2013 book, “Emergency Presidential Power: From the Drafting of the Constitution to the War on Terror.” “But there is no example where a president asked for funding for something from Congress, Congress said, ‘No,’ and the president said, ‘I’ll use emergency powers to do it anyway.’”Mr. Trump sought to evade that distinction on Friday when he announced his border wall decision at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden. He portrayed his invocation of emergency powers as a routine use of executive authority that was never controversial when his predecessors did it.“I’m going to be signing a national emergency and it’s been signed many times before,” he said. “It’s been signed by other presidents. From 1977 or so, it gave the presidents the power. There’s rarely been a problem. They sign it. Nobody cares.”But a list of about 59 previous times when presidents since the Carter administration have invoked emergency powers, compiled for a recent study of presidential emergency powers for the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, shows none that look like Mr. Trump’s declaration in crucial respects.The overwhelming majority of those instances were moves by presidents to impose sanctions on various foreign officials and groups — freezing their assets and making it illegal for Americans to do business with them — for wrongdoing like human rights violations, terrorism or transnational narcotics trafficking. They attracted no controversy because Congress has wanted the executive branch to operate that way.Congress has also enacted a statute that gave presidents, in a declared emergency “that requires use of the armed forces,” the power to redirect military construction funds to build projects related to that use. It is that statute that Mr. Trump is relying upon, and his administration argues that this means he is exercising authority that lawmakers wanted the presidency to be able to wield.But Elizabeth Goitein, who oversaw the Brennan Center study, pointed to the widespread dispute over whether, as a matter of empirical reality, there exists a true emergency on the border that would be resolved by a wall, as well as to the fact that Congress already made clear it did not intend to spend extra billions of dollars on Mr. Trump’s wall.“There is nothing approaching an ‘emergency’ in this situation, no matter how loose a definition you use,” she said. “And Congress has made it as clear as it can that it does not want the president to use funds for this purpose, so this is the president using emergency powers to thwart the will of Congress. That is very different from how emergency powers have been used in the past.”In a briefing with reporters on Friday, the White House identified only two previous instances in which presidents relied on emergency powers to spend funds on something different than what Congress had appropriated them for. Both involved military construction associated with wars: one under President George Bush’s Persian Gulf war emergency declaration, the other under President George W. Bush’s emergency declaration after the Sept. 11 attacks. Neither funded projects that Congress had previously weighed and rejected.The idea behind emergency powers laws is that Congress wanted the president to have standby authorities to activate in a crisis, when the government must respond quickly. The Brennan Center study identified 123 such statutes.In the 1976 act, Congress turned off numerous old “emergencies” that had been lingering for many years and created a process presidents must follow when invoking such statutes. But the overhaul did not include defining limits on when a president could decide that a qualifying emergency existed, preserving White House flexibility.One check against abuse of that power eroded quickly: Congress had intended for lawmakers to have the power to overrule a president’s declaration by passing a resolution with a simple majority vote. After a 1983 Supreme Court ruling, however, presidents gained the power to veto such resolutions. That weakened Congress’s hand because it takes two-thirds of both chambers to override a veto.The other check against abuse has been self-restraint: Presidents have self-regulated and not invoked emergency powers to achieve policy goals Congress had rejected — or claimed that a qualifying crisis existed in disputed circumstances.Much of the criticism of Mr. Trump’s move has centered on fears that he was expanding executive power by establishing a precedent that future presidents — including Democrats seeking liberal ends — may someday use to circumvent Congress, too. On Friday, Mr. Trump dismissed a question from a reporter about that worry.“The people that say we create precedent — well, what do you have, 56, or a lot of times — well, that’s creating precedent, and many of those are far less important than having a border,” he said.But several legal experts said there was another possible long-term consequence that had received less discussion: by violating that norm of self-restraint, Mr. Trump may prompt Congress to eventually take back some of that power from the presidency — at least in a post-Trump era, when a succeeding president might be willing, or believe that it is politically necessary, to sign such a bill.Notably, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, on Friday accused Mr. Trump of “a gross abuse of power that subverts the key principles laid out in the Constitution” over which branch controls the appropriation of funds, and announced an investigation. In 1976, it was the House Judiciary Committee that drafted the National Emergencies Act.Stephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, Austin, said that legislators may react to Mr. Trump’s move by enacting a new overhaul of those laws that tightened restrictions on when a president could use them.Lawmakers could, for example, impose a strict definition of what qualifies as an emergency, taking away presidential flexibility to deal with unforeseen circumstances. Congress could also attach “sunset” clauses to emergency statutes, so that the president's special powers would automatically deactivate after a month or two without new action by lawmakers to extend them.“The risk the president runs is that Congress will take away much, if not most, of the discretion it’s given to the president,” Mr. Vladeck said. “And then the concern is that Congress could hamstring a future president from having all the tools he or she might need to react to a future emergency. So a short-term win for the president could become a long-term loss for the presidency.”"
163,"Good Friday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today._____________________• In a lengthy Oval Office interview, President Trump told The New York Times that negotiating with Congress over his long-sought border wall was a “waste of time” and that he would probably take action on it himself. He also spoke about the Russia investigation and the 2020 election. Here are five takeaways from the interview.• The Senate, in a stinging bipartisan rebuke to Mr. Trump’s foreign policy, advanced legislation to express strong opposition to his decision to pull troops from Syria and Afghanistan.• After two months of being cooped up in the White House, Mr. Trump will spend the weekend at his oasis, the place where he is most comfortable: Mar-a-Lago.• Mr. Trump said trade negotiations with China were going well but that no final agreement would be reached until he met with President Xi Jinping. He also warned that he was prepared to move ahead with higher tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing did not accede to America’s demands.• Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign reported raising $21 million in the final three months of 2018. Three out of every four dollars came from small donors, a contrast to many Republican midterm congressional campaigns, which relied more on wealthy contributors.• The top American diplomat on North Korea, Stephen Biegun, signaled that the United States might soften its demand that North Korea list all its nuclear assets as a first step toward denuclearization.• Mr. Trump signed an executive order that will push for federal dollars spent on infrastructure projects to go to American companies. The measure is meant to bolster blue-collar Trump supporters whose economic prospects have been shaken by the president’s trade policies.• Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a plan that would subject more wealthy Americans to the estate tax, joining a wave of left-wing politicians calling for new ways to tax the rich.• The Trump administration told Congress that it intends to make it much easier for gun manufacturers to sell firearms abroad. The administration also proposed to lower prescription drug costs by requiring insurers and middlemen to share the discounts they get with consumers.• Sexual assaults rose sharply at three American military academies over the last two years. Despite the Pentagon’s efforts to encourage students to report assaults, unreported cases surged by almost 50 percent during the 2017-18 academic year, a Defense Department study found._____________________Today’s On Politics briefing was compiled by Isabella Grullón Paz in New York.Were you forwarded this newsletter?

164,"With President Trump’s border wall tied up by his fight with congressional Democrats, and public opinion about the wall mixed, Kris Kobach wants to take matters into his own hands.Fresh from his defeat in the race for Kansas governor, Mr. Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state, is involved in an audacious new project — a privately-funded wall along the Mexican border.Mr. Kobach, a hard-line ally of President Trump known for his strident stand on immigration, has long advocated a tough border policy.He is currently an advisory board member of “We Build the Wall Inc.” a nonprofit group that has collected more than $12 million toward the effort. Mr. Kobach says the group has obtained the presidential seal of approval for the private initiative.President Trump gave the undertaking his “blessing” in a telephone conversation Wednesday night, according to Mr. Kobach. The White House press office did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Kobach, 52, says the group will begin construction soon on its first section of the wall on donated property, likely in Texas, and that the work can be completed cheaply and efficiently by the private sector.The private wall idea is an outgrowth of a plan started in December as a GoFundMe campaign by Brian Kolfage, a disabled Air Force veteran living in Florida who says the impetus for his project was mounting public frustration over the government’s failure to reach an agreement on border protection.After raising nearly $20 million, the organization was forced to contact donors because it hadn’t reached its initial goal of $1 billion. At that point, contributions would be automatically returned to donors unless they opted back in. Mr. Kobach said that efforts to retain contributors had been very successful, with 94 percent of those contacted transferring the money into the new effort.Mr. Kobach, who is considering a 2020 run for the United States Senate seat being vacated by Pat Roberts, said he is currently an unpaid adviser to the organization but added that he might take a major administrative role as the project grows. Asked whether he would be compensated at that point, Mr. Kobach said he was not sure.We caught up with Mr. Kobach this week by telephone. His remarks were condensed and edited for clarity. Q. I understand that you’re on the board of an organization that’s promoting a private wall. Can you tell me what the goal is? A. The goal is to facilitate construction of a border wall on private land with private funds along the southern border in conjunction with federal government efforts to construct the wall. Have you done any work to see how much that’s going to cost? We believe we can build the wall, or build sections of the wall, for well under half the price that the federal government is projecting and perhaps as low as a quarter of the price. Quite often the federal government purchases things at prices higher than individuals in the private marketplace. Do you have a location in mind right now? Do you have landowners who will donate land for this? We have landowners who are inviting us already. We’ll be hopefully breaking ground within weeks, but I don’t want to give the names yet. We haven’t selected where we’re going to start. It doesn’t require the donation of a large amount of land. The landowner retains the land. It’s not like we build the wall and take possession of the land.Do you think there’s a groundswell of support for this?I do think there’s a groundswell of support. It’s an objective that people conceive of very easily. It’s not rocket science. It’s not super high technology to construct border barriers.Democrats have proposed other kinds of mechanisms for securing the border — technology, drones, radar.We already have drones and sensors on the border and they seem to think that having more is adequate. Drones don’t stop people from coming across the border, they merely tell you that someone is coming across the border. I don’t think the people who are proposing the drones only are serious about stopping the flow of illegal immigration.What are people in Kansas telling you?In Kansas, support for the wall is very strong. We haven’t done any polling or outreach on the specific question of “We Build the Wall” organization, but certainly support for building a wall or a series of barriers on the border is very high.Have you reached out to people at Homeland Security? Are they on board with this idea?I have not personally but I believe others in our organization have. We intend to cooperate and to the extent possible collaborate with the Department of Homeland Security. The objective is to assist and to create a system of sections that ultimately connect and serve one another.I talked with the president, and the “We Build the Wall Effort’’ came up. The president said ‘the project has my blessing, and you can tell the media that.’Do you see this as an alternative to a federal project?I see it as a supplement to a federal project. The $5.7 billion would not secure the entire border, even if Democrats gave the president everything he’s asking for in the current discussion. There will be hundreds of miles of gaps collectively that still wouldn’t be secured. So these private efforts will help supplement and fill in the gaps that still exist after, if and when the president is able to complete the sections of wall that he’s proposing. Some people might say securing the border is a government function just like air traffic control.It is correct that securing the border is a government function, but when the government fails, it has a specific and significant impact on individual landowners. So the failure to secure the border affects me in Kansas indirectly and it affects you in New York indirectly. But the landowner who has the ranch right on the border is affected in a way that is 1,000 percent greater than what you and I would experience. The biggest effects are litter and security. The traffickers, as they’re bringing their migrants through, they’re constantly dumping clothing, food containers and trash on the ranchers’ land. And then there’s an environmental impact. But the biggest impact for individual landowners is security.Sounds like you’re looking at this from the standpoint of private property rights and the rights of private landowners?Exactly. In this project the rights of private landowners intersect perfectly with the objectives of the U.S. government. Ostensibly, members of both parties say they want to secure the border. The landowner needs to secure the border because of the damage being done in terms of litter and in terms of public safety and in terms of trespassing.I have heard stories of landowners who like the open border because they’ve made friends with people who live on the Mexican side and they’re neighbors.In that case if a landowner doesn’t want to have any fencing or barriers on his project, he wouldn’t be someone we would be working with."
165,"WASHINGTON — A dozen Republicans joined Senate Democrats on Thursday to overturn President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the southwestern border, arguing that the president had exceeded his powers in trying to build a border wall over Congress’s objections.The 59-to-41 vote on a measure already approved by the House set up the first veto of Mr. Trump’s presidency. It was not a big enough margin to override his promised veto, but Congress has now voted for the first time to block a presidential emergency declaration — and on one of the core promises that animated Mr. Trump’s political rise.“Never before has a president asked for funding, Congress has not provided it, and the president then has used the National Emergencies Act of 1976 to spend the money anyway,” said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee. “Our nation’s founders gave to Congress the power to approve all spending so that the president would not have too much power. This check on the executive is a crucial source of our freedom.”It was the latest sign that the cautious Republican majority in the Senate, spurred on by a far bolder Democrat-controlled House, was beginning to reassert its authority with a president who had gone virtually unchecked during his first two years in office.Mr. Trump had sought to frame the vote publicly as not only a declaration of support for his border security policies but as a sign of personal loyalty.“It’s pure and simple: It’s a vote for border security; it’s a vote for no crime,” Mr. Trump told reporters before the vote, which he had declared Thursday morning on Twitter to be “a vote for Nancy Pelosi, Crime, and the Open Border Democrats!”But he could not overcome concerns among Republican senators about the legality of redirecting $3.6 billion from military construction projects toward the border wall, even after Congress explicitly rejected the funding request.“I believe the use of emergency powers in this circumstance violates the Constitution,” said Senator Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas, in a statement written on lined paper. “This continues our country down the path of all powerful executive — something those who wrote the Constitution were fearful of.”Ultimately, nearly a quarter of Senate Republicans joined Senate Democrats in supporting the House-passed resolution of disapproval: Roy Blunt of Missouri, Susan Collins of Maine, Mike Lee of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rob Portman of Ohio, Mitt Romney of Utah, Marco Rubio of Florida, Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Roger Wicker of Mississippi, Mr. Alexander and Mr. Moran.The president tweeted that he was looking “forward to VETOING the just passed Democrat inspired Resolution which would OPEN BORDERS while increasing Crime, Drugs, and Trafficking in our Country.”The House vote to override the upcoming veto is expected on March 26, according to a Democratic leadership aide, though it is unlikely that the chamber can muster the two-thirds vote majority. And Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, promised that would not be the end to it; Democrats will keep forcing repeat votes on the resolution.“I believe the law allows us to bring it up every six months,” he said, “and certainly we would intend to do that.”Regardless, the action in both chambers could bolster a number of lawsuits contesting the emergency declaration as a flagrant violation of the Constitution’s separation of powers.The number of Republican defections underscored the turmoil within the Republican Conference, where senators were torn between supporting Mr. Trump’s vision for border security and asserting Congress’s constitutional prerogative to dictate federal spending.Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina and one of the first to publicly say he would support the resolution, announced he had changed his mind just minutes before the vote — to the disbelief of his colleagues, including Ms. Collins. He had been warned in recent days by North Carolina conservatives that he could face a primary challenger next year for his stand. He said conversations with the White House and his colleagues contributed to his changed vote.Other Republican senators agonized over their votes, as well. Three — Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Ted Cruz of Texas — interrupted Mr. Trump’s dinner with his wife, Melania, on Wednesday night at the White House to share their concerns about the constitutional precedent that Mr. Trump had established.Mr. Cruz initiated the meeting, hoping to sell the president on his own rewrite of the emergency declaration law that would restrict funding from military sources, according to a senior Republican aide with direct knowledge of the proposal. Mr. Trump summoned a lawyer from the White House Counsel’s Office, who said the plan would strip the president of powers he currently possesses. “No way,” an annoyed Mr. Trump told the trio, according to a person with knowledge of the exchange.In the end, all three men sided with Mr. Trump and voted against the resolution.Mr. Graham, along with other lawmakers supportive of the declaration, argued that the president’s declaration was within the jurisdiction of the National Emergencies Act, and was needed to address what the president and his supporters deem to be a crisis at the southwestern border.“I take Congress’s prerogative over appropriations extremely seriously,” said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader. “But,” he added, “the Senate should not be in the business of misusing specific resolutions to express opinions on more general matters.”The outcome of the vote was as much a reflection of Mr. McConnell’s ambivalence as Mr. Trump’s insistence.The majority leader had strongly advised Mr. Trump against declaring the emergency declaration, and he made a point of not pressuring senators to support the president, urging them to vote according to their consciences and political interests, according to seven Republican aides and lawmakers.At a party lunch in early March, Mr. McConnell canvassed his conference and found virtually no support for the president’s position, according to a person in attendance.The message was not lost on Mr. Trump, who told a visitor to Mar-a-Lago — the president’s club in Palm Beach, Fla. — last weekend that he felt let down by lackluster effort by Republican leaders.In a volley of phone calls with Senate Republicans over the past few weeks, the president warned of the electoral consequences of defying him and dismissed concerns about the constitutional precedent of his order.During a meeting on trade on Wednesday afternoon at the White House, Mr. Trump tried to cajole a handful of members to vote his way, emphasizing that a vote “against border security” would be noticed by the party’s base, according to two people who attended.When Mr. Paul, a libertarian who frequently bucks his party, announced his support for the resolution, the president flew into a rage, according to two people with knowledge of the situation, and called Mr. Paul to demand that he reverse himself. The senator refused.But Mr. Trump also undermined his own efforts at persuasion. He personally sunk attempts by Republican senators this week to limit the number of defections to a handful. Mr. Lee proposed an alternative measure — a bill that would restrict future uses of emergency declarations, but leave Mr. Trump’s order in place — and discussed it in a meeting with other undecided senators as well as Vice President Mike Pence.But the next day, Mr. Trump called Mr. Lee in the middle of a Republican policy lunch to tell him that he would not support the measure. Mr. Lee, who announced the president’s verdict to gasps from his colleagues, then declared his support for the resolution of disapproval.On Thursday, before the vote, the president appeared to reverse himself when he said he would support efforts to update the 1976 law “at a later date.”But it was not enough to overcome opposition from constitutional conservatives, appropriators like Mr. Blunt and Mr. Wicker and hawks who questioned his diversion of funding allocated to the military.As the Senate was delivering its rebuke, senior military commanders announced they would begin to scale back about 40 percent of the 6,000 troops deployed at the southwestern border at Mr. Trump’s request.“It’s a security challenge — not a military threat,” said Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the Joint Chiefs chairman, when asked Thursday morning during a Senate Armed Services hearing to assess the threat posed by an influx of migrants from the Mexican side of the border."
166,"WASHINGTON — In the two months since he stepped into Jim Mattis’s size 9½ shoes, the acting defense secretary, Patrick M. Shanahan, has sought to do what his predecessor did not — namely, stay in line with President Trump.Mr. Shanahan has repeated White House talking points at the Pentagon even during private meetings with allies and congressional members. He has done little to ameliorate the withdrawal of American forces from Syria — which prompted Mr. Mattis’s resignation in December — and refused to criticize the president’s decision to do so.And Mr. Shanahan has embraced Mr. Trump’s vision of bolstering the southwestern border against what he described as a “threat” by Central American refugees fleeing drug violence and heading to the United States.“The threat is real,” Mr. Shanahan said last month at a cabinet meeting. “The risks are real. We need to control our borders.”[Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty, conflict and consequence.]It is a view that few officials at the Pentagon share. And it is testing Mr. Shanahan’s ability to remain in lock step with his commander in chief while still placating lawmakers who will ultimately decide whether he will be confirmed as the defense secretary, should the president nominate him.On Tuesday, the House rejected Mr. Trump’s declaration of a national emergency along the southwestern border in a first step toward blocking his attempt to build a border wall with $3.6 billion in military construction funding. Much of that money could be pulled from projects — like schools or dining halls — that Congress generally protects for constituents.Earlier, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, angrily declared himself “now your adversary, not your friend” to Mr. Shanahan after what witnesses described as his repetition of Mr. Trump’s talking points on the Syria withdrawal to lawmakers at a security conference this month in Munich.The exchange came just days after Senator Jim Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, praised Mr. Mattis’s humility and said Mr. Shanahan did not share that trait. (Mr. Inhofe later told reporters he was kidding.)Interviews with more than a dozen congressional officials as well as current and former Defense Department officials provided insights on an acting defense secretary who is steeped in the details of procurement and expensive defense systems but shows little affinity for military strategy in combat zones. Nearly all the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity — including some for fear of losing their jobs — to discuss the internal tensions.Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, a spokesman for Mr. Shanahan, said he was “deeply engaged in the full spectrum of policy and operational issues” and received more than 1,000 intelligence and military briefings while serving as Mr. Mattis’s deputy.“Secretary Mattis maintained an aggressive travel schedule and in his absence, Deputy Secretary Shanahan frequently chaired and hosted operational updates and strategy reviews and briefings,” Colonel Buccino said in a statement on Tuesday.Mr. Shanahan is also balancing his scrupulous approbation of the president with trying to assure the 1.2 million active-duty service members that he is willing to defend their interests in military policies at home and around the world — like terrorism and border security.One Defense Department official said the situation had placed Mr. Shanahan squarely “between the dog and the fence post.”On Tuesday, Gen. Terrence J. O’Shaughnessy of the Air Force, the head of the military’s Northern Command who oversees homeland defense, told the Armed Services Committee that he saw no military threat from the border.But on Saturday, Mr. Shanahan toured the border at El Paso, where he fired a paintball gun that had been converted to shoot crowd-control pellets.“Any place where someone can cross the border and disappear within seconds or minutes, that’s where you need barriers,” Mr. Shanahan said. This month, Mr. Shanahan told reporters that he had not yet determined whether the border wall was a military necessity — an off-message aside that Defense Department officials quickly walked back as unintentional.Mr. Mattis had only grudgingly acquiesced to orders to put forces along the southwestern border, according to two people familiar with his thinking. But Mr. Mattis slow-walked the mission, keeping troops as far away from caravans of refugees as possible and ensuring that most forces were unarmed.Officials said Mr. Shanahan has tried to weather his first months at the Pentagon’s helm by sticking to Mr. Trump’s script, no matter what. That is not necessarily a bad thing, said Derek Chollet, a senior Pentagon official under President Barack Obama.“He seems like the best we can expect of the administration right now — he stays inside the box,” Mr. Chollet said. “The last thing we need is more turbulence and uncertainty.”Mr. Shanahan holds a master’s degree from M.I.T. and turned around Boeing’s troubled development of the 787 Dreamliner passenger plane. The vast majority of previous defense secretaries also came to the job from civilian positions; Mr. Mattis, a retired Marine general, was a rare exception.But Mr. Shanahan was largely shielded from many American foreign policy decisions, and has had to apply his more technical background to a steep learning curve of a plethora of political and security issues at the Pentagon.It has been an awkward transition.He has laughed obligingly at Mr. Trump’s corniest jokes, including one about how the Defense Department is really about “offense.” Two weeks ago, during his first trip overseas as the Pentagon chief — which was also his first trip to Afghanistan — Mr. Shanahan arrived in Kabul, the capital, dressed all in black, looking like a cross between Johnny Cash and Dr. No. It was an “all-out fashion assault on Taliban peace process,” snarked Task and Purpose, the website that covers the military. Mr. Shanahan shrugged it off as funny.Senior staff members at the Pentagon noted Mr. Shanahan’s frequent mentions of breakfast meetings with John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The officials described Mr. Shanahan as far more pliable with Mr. Bolton than Mr. Mattis, who voiced unhappiness with the National Security Council’s reluctance to hold meetings of top members of the administration’s security agencies.With the withdrawal of American troops from Syria, a presidential directive loathed by the Pentagon’s leaders and Mr. Mattis, several current and former officials said Mr. Shanahan may be sacrificing the Defense Department in hewing so closely to Mr. Trump.They credited a host of high-ranking, influential officials — Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Gen. Joseph Votel, the head of United States Central Command; a choir of Republican senators; and Mr. Bolton — who persuaded Mr. Trump to modify the drawdown, initially by leaving a small residual force of 200 American troops in Syria.Mr. Shanahan, the officials said, was not among the top authorities who held sway. And Mr. Trump’s latest Syria policy decision — for 400 American troops to remain and continue counterterrorism missions — caught leading Pentagon officials off guard.Particularly in matters of the wars overseas, Defense Department officials said, Mr. Shanahan has a way to go.In Afghanistan, his understanding of the conflict stirred chatter among military officials who said that he had been coached by Gen. Scott Miller, the commander of the American-led war effort there.After leaving the country, Mr. Shanahan was asked about the changing strategy on the ground. He spoke broadly about Afghan commandos — one of the only groups he had briefly met with — as evidence of progress."
167,"WASHINGTON — President Trump and Democratic congressional leaders dug in Wednesday for a lengthy partial shutdown in a newly divided government after a White House meeting — the first in 22 days — could not break an impasse over Mr. Trump’s demands for billions of dollars for a border wall.During the contentious meeting in the Situation Room, Mr. Trump made his case for a wall on the southwestern border and rejected Democrats’ proposals for reopening the government while the two sides ironed out their differences.“I would look foolish if I did that,” Mr. Trump responded after Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, posed the question to him directly, according to three officials familiar with the meeting who described it on the condition of anonymity. He said that the wall was why he was elected, one of the officials said.Democrats were equally adamant, according to another official who was present for the discussion. Pressed by Vice President Mike Pence and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the incoming minority leader, they refused to budge from their offer to devote $1.3 billion to border security. The official also insisted on anonymity to describe the private conversation.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said after the meeting that he had no intention of putting Democratic bills to reopen the government to a vote if Mr. Trump would not sign them.“We’re hopeful that, somehow, in the coming days and weeks, we’ll be able to reach an agreement,” Mr. McConnell told reporters at the Capitol, offering an ominous timeline.The events underscored the personal and political crosscurrents standing in the way of any compromise between a president unwilling to lose face with his core supporters on his signature campaign promise and newly empowered Democrats — poised to assume control of the House on Thursday — who refuse to give ground on an issue that has come to symbolize Mr. Trump’s immigration policies.With the partial government funding lapse dragging into its 12th day and affecting 800,000 federal employees, the confrontation in the Situation Room only served to highlight the depth of the divide.“Could be a long time, or it could be quickly,” Mr. Trump said of resolving the shutdown. “It’s too important a subject to walk away from.”Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who is in line to be elected speaker on Thursday, said: “We are asking the president to open up government. Why would he not do it?”“He could not give a good answer,” Mr. Schumer said.Mr. Trump tried creative ways to persuade the Democrats that they should support his wall. At one point, he said Ms. Pelosi should back it because she was “a good Catholic” and Vatican City is surrounded by a wall, according to one of the officials familiar with the discussion.[Vatican City has walls, but they do not enclose the entire territory and visitors can easily enter some parts. Read more fact checks from the president's cabinet meeting on Wednesday.]In her first legislative act as speaker, Ms. Pelosi plans on Thursday to bring up two bills to reopen the government. One would fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8, providing a month to break the impasse over border security funding, and a second would provide money for the remaining shuttered agencies and departments through September. The homeland security measure would devote $1.3 billion to border security measures, such as enhanced surveillance and fortified fencing, but not the wall.Mr. Trump’s rejection of those measures left the prospects of a resolution at their dimmest since the shutdown began on Dec. 22. It also highlighted the difficulty of the current situation, in which Democrats, Republicans and even some White House staff members have found themselves trying to anticipate what Mr. Trump will accept.The president asked the congressional leaders to return to the White House on Friday to continue the talks, after Democrats had completed their leadership elections, according to an official who attended the meeting. A second official who attended said Mr. Trump’s team believed it would be easier for Ms. Pelosi to negotiate once she was officially installed as speaker. Both insisted on anonymity to describe the private gathering.In a pair of evening tweets, Mr. Trump seemed to hold out hope of an agreement, writing: “I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let’s get it done!”But the path to such a deal is murky at best.Before he met congressional leaders on Wednesday, Mr. Trump publicly rejected a compromise that Mr. Pence floated privately with Democrats last month to stave off the government funding lapse, saying $2.5 billion in border security spending was insufficient. In the hours before a midnight deadline to avert a shutdown before Christmas, the vice president had broached that number, which his team has quietly continued to push in the days after parts of the government ran out of money.“No, not $2.5 billion, no — we’re asking for $5.6” billion, Mr. Trump said during a cabinet meeting, hours before the Situation Room briefing.His rejection of the figure seemed to confirm the concerns of Democratic leaders who had questioned whether they could trust senior White House officials to broker any compromise that could then be rejected by a president who has often shifted his position at the last moment, especially when it comes to immigration.The larger figure referred to the amount Mr. Trump has demanded for the wall, which the House endorsed in a vote last month, but which failed to garner even majority support in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to prevail.But inside the Situation Room later on Wednesday, the proposal resurfaced and Mr. Trump appeared open to it, according to one of the officials present, as Mr. Pence and Mr. McCarthy pressed Democrats to meet in the middle. Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer said $1.3 billion was their highest bid.Wednesday’s gathering in the Situation Room, a secure chamber in the basement of the White House where military operations are tracked and other sensitive discussions unfold, was a conscious effort by Mr. Trump and his aides to infuse a sense of national-security crisis into the immigration discussion. It was the president’s first face-to-face meeting with Democratic leaders since a combative session last month when he said he would insist that any government spending bill include money for a border wall — and would proudly own the consequences if that meant a shutdown.But it quickly turned tense as Mr. Trump argued for his wall and called on Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, who appeared via teleconference from the border in San Diego to stress the need for it, according to two of the officials who were at the meeting.Mr. Schumer interjected, calling on Ms. Pelosi, who disputed Ms. Nielsen’s statistics, two of the officials said. Ms. Pelosi then laid out the legislative proposals she planned to bring up on Thursday, detailing how the spending measures had all received broad bipartisan support either in committees or on the floor in the Republican-controlled Congress.The back and forth drew an angry response from the Department of Homeland Security.“Democrats in the room either don’t care that there is a humanitarian crisis on the border or just prefer ignorance,” Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement on Wednesday night. “It was incredibly disheartening that they don’t want to know the facts when making policy.”Yet hours before the meeting began, what was billed as a somber security briefing had already taken on the sharp tone of a political showdown, as Mr. Trump charged that Democrats were sacrificing border security for a partisan advantage in the 2020 elections.“The United States needs a physical barrier,” the president said during the cabinet meeting, comparing the southern border to “a sieve” that allows criminals and drugs to enter the country and facilitates human trafficking.“Walls work,” he added, claiming inaccurately that former President Barack Obama has one “around his compound” in Washington. (Parts of Mr. Obama’s home in the northwest section of the city are bordered by a low brick retaining wall, and others have iron or chain-link fencing.)Mr. Trump repeated his false claims about the border wall, including that Mexico was already paying for it, as he promised during his campaign, and that much of its construction had already been completed.Outside the White House, the search for a way out is getting more urgent. Some lawmakers have grown anxious about the shutdown’s impact on their constituents, including federal workers who are not receiving pay while their agencies are denied funding.Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, wrote an opinion article in The Washington Post suggesting three ways out: Grant the president the $1.6 billion for border security that he requested, without wall funding, plus an additional $1 billion for security at ports of entry; approve a bipartisan bill linking wall funding with protection for young immigrants brought illegally to the country as children; or resurrect the 2013 comprehensive immigration overhaul that included huge increases in border security measures, sweeping changes to immigration law and a pathway to citizenship for the nation’s 11 million undocumented immigrants.Incoming lawmakers vented new concerns about the shutdown’s effect. “This morning I requested that my pay be withheld until the shutdown is over,” Representative-elect Mikie Sherrill, Democrat of New Jersey, said Wednesday on Twitter, where she posted a letter to the chief administrative officer of the House making her request official.She noted that thousands of federal workers in her state were not receiving paychecks. “I came here to govern, not engage in partisan politics at the expense of hardworking Americans,” she said."
168,"President Trump’s defeat in his border-wall standoff with Congress has clouded his already perilous path to a second term in 2020, undercutting Mr. Trump’s cherished image as a forceful leader and deft negotiator, and emboldening alike his Democratic challengers and Republican dissenters who hope to block his re-election.The longest government shutdown in history inflicted severe political damage on the president, dragging down his poll numbers even among Republicans and stirring concern among party leaders about his ability to navigate the next two years of divided government. Mr. Trump, close associates acknowledge, appears without a plan for mounting a strong campaign in 2020, or for persuading the majority of Americans who view him negatively to give him another chance.Compounding the harm to Mr. Trump on Friday was the indictment of Roger Stone, his political adviser for several decades, on charges of lying to investigators and obstructing the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The indictment was taken by some Republicans as the surest sign yet that Mr. Mueller’s investigation is likely to grow more painful to Mr. Trump and his associates before it wraps up.Mr. Trump still commands the loyalty of a passionate electoral base that has rallied to him in trying moments, and advisers believe he will have room to right himself while Democratic presidential candidates are mired in a long nomination fight. Yet they are also growing anxious that he could face a draining primary of his own next year.Several prominent Trump antagonists are actively urging other Republicans to take on the president, and a popular governor, Larry Hogan of Maryland, has indicated he is newly open to their entreaties.In a sign of the White House’s determination to project party unity, a top Trump campaign official, Bill Stepien, traveled to the Republican National Committee meeting in New Mexico this week to orchestrate an ornamental resolution of support for the president. It passed unanimously on Friday afternoon, hailing Mr. Trump for his “effective presidency” even as his shutdown strategy collapsed.David Winston, a Republican pollster, said the burden was now on Mr. Trump to restore his stature as a leader by forging some kind of border-security deal with Democrats, and to deliver a stronger message on the economy.“Leadership means results,” Mr. Winston said. “When you have a shutdown, people look at it, basically, as: the political system has failed.”Mr. Winston said polling data suggested the border wall had been a problematic fight to pick. “Immigration is an important issue,’’ he said, “but people are waking up every day trying to figure out how they’re going to pay a set of bills in front of them.”For now, Mr. Trump remains wholly focused on appeasing his conservative base, comprising perhaps a third of the electorate, despite private G.O.P. polling suggesting that his agenda on immigration has failed to move the country in his favor, Republicans who work closely with the president said.But Mr. Trump emerged from the shutdown with nothing to show for it, having angered swing voters with his intransigence, while disappointing hard-line supporters by failing to secure any funding for a border wall.[Read about President Trump’s retreat on the shutdown.]Conservatives still believe that Mr. Trump cannot afford to abandon his crusade for a barrier. Not long before Mr. Trump agreed to reopen the government, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, a White House ally who leads the hard-line Freedom Caucus, argued that the wall fight was vital to the president’s re-election hopes.“It’s not lost on any of us that a central component of what he said when he ran in 2016 has to be addressed in a meaningful way,” he said in a recent interview.Privately, some of Mr. Trump’s 2016 aides have said they are pessimistic about his path to 270 electoral votes after his party’s midterm defeats in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. An Associated Press poll on Wednesday showed that Mr. Trump’s overall approval rating had fallen to 34 percent, with his support among Republicans dipping below 80 percent — a startling turn for a president who strives for total control of the G.O.P., and has usually achieved it.The Mueller investigation looms as another destabilizing force for the president. David Kochel, a Republican strategist based in Iowa who is opposed to Mr. Trump, said the special counsel’s eventual report could determine whether Mr. Trump is vulnerable in a primary.“That will be a focusing mechanism for the party,” Mr. Kochel said.While core Republican voters remain loyal to him and he is not currently facing a contest for the nomination, Mr. Trump’s low standing with political moderates and especially women is leading some G.O.P. officeholders to voice unease about having him at the top of the ticket next year.“I think it’s healthy and appropriate for the party to consider in 2020 whether this is really the path it wants to continue taking,” said David F. Holt, the Republican mayor of Oklahoma City, where a Democrat won a stunning House upset last year thanks in part to the suburban antipathy toward Mr. Trump.The 2020 election is nearly two years away and Mr. Trump has ample time to build a political operation, marshal support from financial backers and make his case to the American people. Mr. Trump captured the presidency with a largely improvisational candidacy, guided by his own instincts for personal combat and cultural division, and lacking the strategic discipline of most presidential campaigns.But even among his own political lieutenants, there is a general recognition that Mr. Trump currently lacks anything resembling a positive message.Mr. Trump is especially fixated on two well-known Democrats, speaking frequently about Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president whom Mr. Trump regards as his most dangerous potential opponent, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Some of his advisers are more preoccupied with two other would-be challengers, who would offer a starker generational contrast with the 72-year-old president: Senator Kamala Harris of California and Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas Senate candidate.In this volatile moment, however, Mr. Trump and his aides have been just as focused on heading off competition from fellow Republicans. In addition to helping direct a resolution of support from the R.N.C. — Mr. Trump tweeted approvingly Saturday morning, suggesting re-election “should be easy’’ — Mr. Stepien, the former White House political director, has been leading an effort to ensure there is no insurrection at next year’s convention in Charlotte, N.C.Now a top aide on Mr. Trump’s campaign, Mr. Stepien and his deputies have been consulting party leaders about shutting off avenues to a challenge and ensuring that states cannot put forward “favorite son” candidates to contest the president’s renomination.Mr. Trump has also dedicated a team of aides to guaranteeing that only political loyalists are elected to serve as delegates to the convention. To that end, Mr. Stepien dispatched some of his staff members this month to see that their preferred candidate remained in charge of the Maine Republican Party.The fruits of some of those efforts were on display at the R.N.C. meeting outside Albuquerque, where enthusiasm for Mr. Trump was undimmed, at least publicly. The party leaders ignored Mr. Stone’s arrest, which took place just hours before they gathered, and Ronna McDaniel, the party chair, did not deviate from her prepared remarks, lashing the media for promoting “manufactured scandals.”Jeff Kent, the party committeeman from Washington State, offered perhaps the most ferocious tribute to the president, brandishing his red “Make America Great Again” hat as he addressed officials.“To the press in the back of the room,” said Mr. Kent, his voice rising, “please go tell the world we will always proudly wear this hat and we will always proudly support our great president, Donald A. Trump.” (The president’s middle initial is “J.”)Other Republicans view Mr. Trump’s political stumbles as an opportunity to lure a challenger into the race, with Mr. Hogan emerging as a new subject of their efforts. At a December conference hosted by the Niskanen Center, a right-of-center think tank, Mr. Hogan spoke briefly with William Kristol, an implacable Trump critic in the conservative press, who argued that the president is weaker than widely understood, people briefed on the conversation said.Mr. Hogan, 62, is set to meet more formally in the coming weeks with Mr. Kristol and Sarah Longwell, a Republican strategist helping marshal opposition to Mr. Trump. Mr. Kristol and Ms. Longwell have been meeting with Republican donors and potential challengers, sharing focus-group and polling data about the president’s vulnerability with what they call “Reluctant Trump Voters,” according to a copy of their presentation reviewed by The New York Times.Mr. Hogan is planning a trip to Iowa in his capacity as an officer of the National Governors Association. But his advisers also recently reached out to Mr. Kochel, the Iowa-based strategist, to ask that he put together a dinner with similarly minded Republicans while Mr. Hogan is there, according to an associate of Mr. Kochel briefed on the exchange.Jerry Taylor, president of the Niskanen Center, said Mr. Hogan had “made it clear that the door is open to a potential candidacy, but no decision has been made.”In addition to Mr. Hogan, William F. Weld, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts, is weighing a challenge to Mr. Trump as a small-government moderate, people who have spoken with him said. Mr. Weld, 73, who was the Libertarian Party’s vice-presidential nominee in 2016, has discussed either opposing Mr. Trump in the Republican primaries or seeking the Libertarian presidential nomination.Mr. Weld declined to comment on his deliberations, and Mr. Hogan declined through an aide to be interviewed.Other Republicans known to be entertaining campaigns against Mr. Trump include John R. Kasich, the former governor of Ohio, who ran in 2016; Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska; and Jeff Flake, the former senator from Arizona. But Mr. Sasse is said to have grown uneasy about the idea, and Mr. Kasich and Mr. Flake are pursuing opportunities in television.Bruce Berke, a Republican strategist in New Hampshire aligned with Mr. Kasich, said he currently saw Mr. Trump as unassailable in a G.O.P. primary.“A primary challenge in 2020, as of today, would be futile for anyone,” Mr. Berke said.Still, Republican donors will want to know just how damaged the president may be by the end of this year before they truly commit to a challenge.Asked if he would be willing to raise money for a primary opponent to Mr. Trump, Stanley Druckenmiller, a New York-based investor who has given millions to Republican candidates, said, “If I thought such a candidate would be a good president and had a realistic chance of securing the nomination, yes, of course.”"
169,"From the moment President Trump began speaking Tuesday night, in an Oval Office address urging the public to support his controversial border wall, Democrats who may run for the White House in 2020 were responding in real time with sharp criticisms and common themes:• Mr. Trump is holding federal workers “hostage” — a popular word in the responses — and causing them economic hardship.• A wall would be ineffective and “medieval,” another popular word.• The president’s willingness to shut down the government over his demand for a wall has actually harmed border security by denying pay to Customs and Border Protection officials.• Mr. Trump, not congressional Democrats, is responsible for the shutdown. The Democrats repeatedly noted that the Senate unanimously passed a bill last month that would have kept the government open.• There is no immigration crisis at the border, and any crisis that does exist is a humanitarian one caused by the president himself.Here is a sampling of the responses from the 2020 Democratic hopefuls, which came mostly on Twitter.Senator Cory Booker, New JerseySenator Sherrod Brown, OhioFormer Representative John Delaney, MarylandMayor Eric Garcetti, Los AngelesSenator Kirsten Gillibrand, New YorkSenator Kamala Harris, CaliforniaSenator Amy Klobuchar, MinnesotaSenator Bernie Sanders, VermontSenator Elizabeth Warren, MassachusettsMs. Warren, the only top candidate to have officially declared that she plans to run, had not responded to the speech as of 10:15 p.m. A few minutes before it began, however, she tweeted that the way to make the country safer was not by building a wall, but by “ending this ridiculous #TrumpShutdown and making sure vital agencies like the US Coast Guard, TSA, and federal law enforcement have the funds they need to maintain our national security.”Congressional Democrats chimed in, too, from party leaders to new freshmen like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Colin Allred of Texas.Richard J.

170,"Good morning. Plan B for Brexit underwhelms Parliament, Greenland’s melting is accelerating, and the U.S. partial shutdown enters its fifth week. Here’s the latest: Prime Minister Theresa May returned to Parliament with an alternative blueprint for Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U.Infuriating some lawmakers, it looked a lot like her initial plan, which was voted down last week in one of the most resounding parliamentary defeats in British history.Why it matters: The face-off could become another epic political showdown that leaves the Brexit process where it has been for months — stuck in limbo with no obvious path forward.Go deeper: The speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has emerged as a surprise star of Brexit after he broke with precedent to wrest some control over the decision-making process.A new study warns that the ice sheet covering the massive island, which lies mainly above the Arctic Circle, is melting at such an accelerated rate that it may become “a major contributor to sea level rise” around the world within two decades.The study’s authors found that ice loss in 2012 was nearly four times the rate in 2003, adding to research showing that the melting is speeding up as the warming increases. Another study found that Greenland’s ice loss had reached its fastest rate in at least 350 years.Why it matters: The study is the latest in a series of papers published this month suggesting that scientific estimates of the effects of a warming planet have been, if anything, too conservative. Researchers say they collectively underline the need for a sharp reduction in emissions of planet-warming gases.President Trump, faced with increasing backlash over the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, made an offer over the weekend: temporary protections for roughly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants, known as “Dreamers,” in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall.Democrats called it “hostage taking” and refused to negotiate until the government reopens.Some of the 800,000 furloughed federal employees are turning to pawnshops and brokers for short-term loans. Subsidies for low-income renters have stopped.Go deeper: People who have done business with Mr. Trump over the years say his uncompromising fixation on a southern border wall is consistent with the negotiating tactics he used for decades in the private sector, focused foremost on claiming victory.In other U.S. news: In a rare public statement, the office of the special counsel running the Russia investigation disputed a BuzzFeed News report that Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, told prosecutors that the president had directed him to lie to Congress. England, Wales and Scotland are dotted by more than 100 rustic shelters called bothies (the word rhymes with “frothy”). Often little more than four walls, a roof, a stove and a stone floor — and no bathroom — they serve as remote way stations for a motley assortment of adventurers who take to Britain’s spectacular and sometimes forbidding countryside. Details: The bothies are free to use, and the vast majority are repurposed structures like shepherds’ huts and mining outbuildings. They came into recreational use in the 1930s as weekend getaways, sometimes used clandestinely, for working-class laborers. Future: Some longtime proponents of bothy culture fear that it is endangered by the internet, where map coordinates for the often hard-to-find dwellings can be obtained by all, rather than just by hiking insiders. But getting to bothies can be such a task — through cold, driving rain and bogs, and over trails that can be mere faint notions — that overcrowding may never become a problem. Google: The French authorities fined Google 50 million euros for not properly telling users how it collects data across its services, including its search engine, Google Maps and YouTube, to present personalized advertisements. It is the largest penalty to date under the E.U.’s privacy law known as G.D.P.R. Afghanistan: Hours before the Taliban announced that they had resumed peace talks with American officials, they attacked a base in central Afghanistan run by the national intelligence agency, killing dozens of people.Hidden painting: The opening of an Oscar de la Renta boutique in Paris is in flux because of a mysterious artwork more than three centuries old that resurfaced behind a wall.Russia: The Trump administration cast its move to lift sanctions on the business empire of the Russian oligarch Oleg V. Deripaska as tough on him and on Russia. But a confidential document shows that the deal frees him from hundreds of millions of dollars in debt.Northern Ireland: The police arrested four men on Sunday over a car bombing in Londonderry the night before that drew condemnation from across the political spectrum. It caused no casualties or major damage.Carlos Ghosn: For the second time in a week, a Japanese court has rejected a bail request by the ousted Nissan chairman, who has spent more than two months in a Tokyo jail on charges of financial misconduct.Kamala Harris: The California Democrat who became the second black woman to serve in the U.S. Senate declared her candidacy for president, joining an increasingly crowded and diverse field. (Here’s our candidate tracker.)Meng Hongwei: Nearly four months after the Interpol president was detained in China on corruption charges, his wife, Grace Meng, applied for asylum in France. “I cannot go back to China; such strange things happen there, and fundamental rights are not respected,” Ms. Meng told a French newspaper.China’s economy: Official numbers show 6.6 percent growth in 2018, the slowest for the country since 1990.

172,"A woman and a homeless man who fabricated a heartwarming story of compassion that drew more than $400,000 in donations on GoFundMe pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges on Wednesday.Johnny Bobbitt, 36, pleaded guilty in federal court in Camden, N.J., to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, while Katelyn McClure, 28, pleaded guilty to a count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Sentencing for Ms. McClure is scheduled for June 19; she faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.Mr. Bobbitt faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. His sentencing date has not been set.The two also face state charges in New Jersey, as does Mark D’Amico, who was Ms. McClure’s boyfriend when the crimes were committed.In 2017, the authorities say, the three wove an irresistible yarn. Posting to GoFundMe, a crowdfunding site, Ms. McClure and Mr. D’Amico said that she had run out of gas while driving home in the Philadelphia area, and that Mr. Bobbitt, a homeless veteran, had spent his last $20 to buy gasoline for her. The couple said they wanted to raise $10,000 to thank him and get him off the streets.GoFundMe allows anyone to suggest a cause worthy of donations, whether it’s classroom supplies, life-or-death medical care or a border wall. With thousands of causes competing for attention, users often rely on emotional appeals to stand out.This time, it worked. Buoyed by social media and coverage from the international news media, 14,347 people donated $402,706 to the campaign within three weeks.From there, the story became much less inspiring.Federal prosecutors say Ms. McClure and Mr. D’Amico rapidly spent most of the money on the likes of gambling, vacations, a luxury car, clothing and expensive handbags, much of which was later seized. The authorities said the couple set up a bank account for Mr. Bobbitt in December 2017 and deposited just $25,000; the couple later justified that as a way to keep him from spending it all at once.Mr. Bobbitt sued the couple in August, saying that he had ultimately received just $75,000, including the value of a camper he temporarily lived in, and that they had spent the rest. GoFundMe announced in September that it would help cover the costs to make sure Mr. Bobbitt got all of the money he was due.But the lucrative narrative would soon fall apart as well. The federal authorities read more than 60,000 text messages sent by Ms. McClure and Mr. D’Amico, including one Ms. McClure sent to a friend an hour after the GoFundMe campaign began.“OK, so wait, the gas part is completely made up but the guy isn’t,” Ms. McClure said in the text message. “I had to make something up so people will feel bad.”After GoFundMe fees, they had netted $367,108. In March, Ms. McClure sent a text message to Mr. D’Amico saying they had less than $10,000 of the donated money left, the authorities said.GoFundMe said in November that it would refund all donations for Mr. Bobbitt, calling the misbehavior on the platform “extremely rare” and “unacceptable.”Ms. McClure’s lawyer, James Gerrow, told reporters on Wednesday that her intentions were genuine.“In my view, this was benign as she just wanted to help get him off the streets,” the lawyer said, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer.Mark Davis, Mr. D’Amico’s lawyer, told The Associated Press that Mr. D’Amico had not been charged by the federal authorities and denied any wrongdoing."

174,"As is tradition, President Trump hosted the champions of college football, the Clemson Tigers, for a celebration of their athletic achievement at the White House on Monday.The food he offered them was far less traditional.Piles of burgers and fish sandwiches from McDonald’s, Wendy’s and Burger King, still in their boxes and wrappers, were served on trays in the candlelit dining room. Tubs of dipping sauces were stacked in silver gravy boats. On another table, heat lamps kept French fries and Domino’s pizzas warm. Salads were available, too.It was an opulent setting for fast-food fare. Visiting players are typically offered a meal from the White House kitchen, but Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, said the government shutdown necessitated a new menu.“Because the Democrats refuse to negotiate on border security, much of the residence staff at the White House is furloughed — so the president is personally paying for the event to be catered with some of everyone’s favorite fast foods,” she said.The substitution didn’t seem to bother Mr. Trump, and perhaps even delighted him.“I like it all,” he told reporters before the players arrived. “It’s all good stuff. Great American food.”Mr. Trump has long professed a love for fast food. He values its efficiency and consistency, and as a self-professed “germaphobe,” has said uniform health standards make him more confident in its cleanliness. He used to eat it several times per week.He’s far from alone in loving fast food. About one-third of American adults eat fast food on any given day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Still, the sight of the fast-food cartons inside the stately White House dining room struck some observers on social media as incongruous — or lacking in hospitality for a celebration. (No players looked particularly dissatisfied as cameras rolled.)It also promoted cuisine that nutritionists warn is high in calories, fat and sodium, and that increases the risk of cardiovascular and other diseases.Such events, ostensibly a tribute to championship teams, are unavoidably political. Mr. Trump abruptly disinvited the N.F.L. champion Philadelphia Eagles last year after most of the players and coaches said they would boycott the visit. The Golden State Warriors declined to visit after winning the N.B.A. championship last year.With reporters gathered before the players arrived, on a day he stayed inside the White House, Mr. Trump was eager to drive the discussion back to the weekslong government shutdown. After showing off the food spread, he pivoted to making his case for Republican unity and the need for the border wall.“It should have happened 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, and it’s going to happen now, it’s going to happen now,” he said.Without missing a beat, he continued: “Thank you very much, everybody. Enjoy your food.”"
175,"WASHINGTON — President Trump this week will turn his attention from a fight with congressional Democrats to an even more formidable negotiating challenge, one with potentially higher stakes: China.Trade talks with Beijing begin on Wednesday in Washington, kicking off a monthlong sprint of negotiations between the two nations that could prove more difficult than Mr. Trump’s unsuccessful attempt to secure money from Congress for a border wall.The negotiations come at a critical moment for Mr. Trump’s economic agenda and the global economy, which is beginning to slow in part because of the president’s trade policies.This week, a Chinese delegation led by Liu He, the vice premier, will meet with an American delegation led by Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. A White House official said on Monday that Mr. Liu will meet personally with Mr. Trump on Thursday.If the two sides cannot reach a trade agreement by March 2, the United States has said it plans to escalate the trade war and raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports. China has indicated it will similarly retaliate, making the talks beginning this week critical to resolving the standoff.Mr. Mnuchin said that there has been “significant movement” in the talks but cautioned that the two countries are still working through “very complicated issues.”The Treasury secretary added that securing intellectual property protection for American companies, ending regulations that require joint ventures with Chinese firms, and including measures to enforce the agreement would be crucial to completing a deal.“We expect when we get a deal, that deal will be enforced,” Mr. Mnuchin said, adding that he believed China understands that.Trump administration officials have pointed to recent signs of economic weakness in China, caused in part by tariffs imposed by the United States, as a reason Beijing should urgently seek a deal with the United States. The 35-day government shutdown, however, has drained some of the president’s political capital, potentially weakening Mr. Trump’s leverage during the homestretch of the talks. On Monday, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, with $3 billion of that lost permanently.“The length and political dynamics of the shutdown have highlighted the unpredictability and intransigence of the Trump administration on economic issues, which could paradoxically end up working to the U.S. advantage,” said Eswar Prasad, the former head of the International Monetary Fund’s China division. “Of course, the damaging economic effects of the shutdown and Trump’s desire to score a cleaner win at least on trade could also make U.S. negotiators somewhat more flexible and willing to strike a deal.”The administration continues to insist it has the upper hand, with Mr. Trump reiterating in a tweet last week that he is ready to raise tariffs and urging China to “stop playing around.”But the Chinese may be emboldened by the fact that the president’s reputation as a deal-maker suffered in the wake of failing to secure a win on the border wall.“The Chinese may see the president’s retreat as a sign of weakness and have them harden their resolve not to make major concessions,” said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Pressure on the United States is also increasing from the corporate sector, as big American manufacturers with exposure to China start taking a financial hit. Caterpillar on Monday said its profit for 2019 would be lower than expected as sales of heavy machinery to China slow and costs for materials rise, in part because of tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum. Nvidia, a big chip maker, cut its fourth-quarter revenue estimates, in part because of weak demand for its gaming chips in China.“Deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly in China, impacted consumer demand,” Nvidia said in a news release. Shares of both companies fell, dragging down equity markets in the United States.Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, dismissed the suggestion that the United States has been pushing China too hard to make changes, and that it risked blowback if its economy sours.“What’s at stake here I think is the possibility of spreading prosperity, frankly, in both countries,” Mr. Kudlow said at a White House briefing.Markets have been fixated on the status of the talks, with any inkling of optimism sending global stocks higher. Advisers to Mr. Trump, fearful that he could strike a quick deal to give stocks a lift, have cautioned him against focusing too much on daily market swings.The prospect of an unresolved trade war between the world’s two largest economies has dampened business confidence. A survey released on Monday by the National Association for Business Economics found that 36 percent of manufacturers in the United States have raised prices because of Mr. Trump’s trade policies and 27 percent have delayed investments. Business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have urged the administration to take a less confrontational approach to China.With the deadline quickly approaching, Trump administration officials have been downplaying expectations about a potential deal being reached soon. Wilbur Ross, the Commerce secretary, said last week that the United States and China were “miles and miles” apart and Mr. Kudlow has suggested that details of a deal were not set in stone ahead of the discussions this week.Congressional aides who have been briefed by the administration on the status of the talks said China has agreed to make large purchases of American products to reduce the trade deficit, which is one of Mr. Trump’s key goals. China’s commitment to addressing other concerns, such as forced technology transfer, protections for American intellectual property and reducing its subsidies of state-owned-enterprises, remains uncertain.The Trump administration has also made little progress when it comes to devising a way to ensure that China lives up to whatever commitments it makes in a final agreement. There is widespread concern among trade experts that China could be slow-walking the negotiations and that it will offer repackaged promises that it has failed to deliver on in the past. To prevent that, officials have been considering “snap-back” tariffs that could be quickly imposed, or “carousel” tariffs that would hit different swaths of Chinese goods if Beijing fails to follow through.Christopher Adams, who until last year was the senior coordinator for China affairs at the Treasury Department, said it is not hard to imagine Mr. Trump settling for a smaller preliminary deal and extending the March deadline to continue talks on bigger issues. Mr. Adams suggested the administration could also conclude that it must rely on its own tools, such as export controls and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the body that can investigate and block foreign transactions on national security concerns, if China proves unwilling to undertake meaningful reforms. That would likely mean that the tariffs Mr. Trump has imposed will stay in place for a while.“I think the ball is in China’s court,” Mr. Adams said. “It really comes down to whether Liu He brings something from President Xi and whether that something gets us close.”"
176,"It’s funny that we’re still talking about the physical features of what President Trump wants or will settle for on our country’s southern border — about whether it will be concrete or steel, solid or slatted, a fancied-up fence or, in Nancy Pelosi’s hilariously acerbic dig, a “beaded curtain.” Because it’s not really a wall that Trump is after, if indeed it ever was. It’s a victory for victory’s sake. It’s a show of his might. It’s proof of his potency. Of course he discussed it in a much different manner on Tuesday night, when, for the first time during his presidency, he formally addressed Americans from the Oval Office in prime time. He spoke of a “crisis of the heart” on the border. He spoke of a “crisis of the soul.” He mentioned drugs, crime, Americans who have lost their lives because of undocumented immigrants and Americans who have lost their jobs to them. It was an epic threat that he painted — and a grossly exaggerated one. Whatever it takes to deliver on a promise that he should never have made.Whatever it takes to salvage his pride.The longer his stalemate with Democrats in Congress grinds on, the clearer that becomes. Seldom has a president’s ego been this tender, and seldom has it required so much shoring up. There’s not enough concrete in creation for that job. Network executives had little choice but to grant him access to the airwaves. He had never made such a request before, so it’s not like this particular grandstanding is habitual.[Go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with Frank Bruni’s candid reflections on politics, culture, higher education and more every week. Sign up for his newsletter.]And had the networks refused him, they would have handed him a cudgel in the culture wars that he would have used the same way that he governs — shamelessly, putting his ludicrous claims of martyrdom above any national interest. Better for the networks to go along, with a plan in place to check his assertions rigorously and call out his lies immediately. Even this deep into a presidency of such incompetence and amorality, he deserves a hearing; that’s how the rest of us demonstrate the very respect for traditions and norms that he refuses to show. But he doesn’t deserve an unfiltered one. That’s the road to autocracy.Trump isn’t selling something that the country really needs, and that’s why he and his allies have to lard the pitch with lies. According to The Washington Post Fact Checker, there are more bogus claims and hallucinated menaces when he talks about immigration and the border than when he talks about anything else.He insists that would-be terrorists see a porous southern border as a welcome mat, but that’s bunk: Most try to get into the United States by plane and are apprehended at airports. He wildly inflates the amount of crime committed by undocumented immigrants and just as wildly overstates the effect a border wall might have on the country’s opioid crisis. He did this again on Tuesday night, even though he wasn’t speaking off the cuff, in a revved-up style, at one of his rallies. He read prepared remarks, and still there was fiction aplenty in them.Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, who were given time immediately following Trump to present a rebuttal, clearly expected and were ready for that. In ticking off reasons that an expensive and expansive border wall wasn’t needed, Pelosi kept saying, “the fact is,” “the fact is.” It was a mantra meant to humiliate Trump, which is a sport that she is developing an ever greater taste for.When it comes to the border and the wall, Trump’s willful estrangement from reality is so profound that network executives and newspaper editors spent part of Tuesday in strategy sessions about how to respond to his inevitable barrage of falsehoods. Should there be a crawl of words on the bottom of the television screen to correct him in real time? Could fact checkers work speedily enough to post rebuttals online within minutes of his misrepresentations, before they took root? This is where we find ourselves. Other presidents have been untrustworthy, and others have had to be called out on it. But not like this. This is surreal.It’s a function of, more than anything, his ego, his vanity, to which the television networks, furloughed federal workers — all Americans — are hostage. He’s not remarkable among presidents in having a high opinion of himself and in desperately wanting others to share it. A robust measure of arrogance and some degree of neediness are what make the grind of the campaign trail and the glare of the media bearable. And all presidents want to rack up triumphs that make them look and feel large. But none in my lifetime has spun so many falsehoods in the service of that. None has been so naked in his hunger for that heft.To live with his resounding defeat by that “nasty woman” in the popular vote, Trump had to invent the specter of millions of illegally cast ballots. He never did produce any evidence of that. To not feel eclipsed by President Barack Obama, he claimed there was a media conspiracy to undercount his inauguration crowd. But photographs don’t lie. Not the way a president does.The day after his inauguration, in a visit to the C.I.A. headquarters, against a backdrop of stars that symbolized men and women who had been killed on the job for America, he used his remarks to tally his appearances on the cover of Time magazine. “I think we have the all-time record,” he said, but “we” as usual meant “I.” There’s no occasion unsuitable for bragging, no mission more vital than the exaltation of Trump. When, over the recent Christmas holiday, he at last paid a visit to a combat zone and spoke to American troops in Iraq, he seemed less intent on thanking them for their service than in having them thank him. He dwelled on a pay increase that they had received and claimed — erroneously — that they had gone without one for 10 years, until he came along.“We got you a big one,” he said. “I got you a big one. I got you a big one.” I. Big. That’s the Trump credo in two words. And that, at this point, is the point of the wall. I. Big. “It’s like a manhood thing for him,” Pelosi reportedly told House Democrats in a closed meeting last month. “As if manhood could ever be associated with him.”But bigness eluded Trump on Tuesday night. He came across as cramped, frustrated and forced to plead when he’d much rather command. He’s bunched up and boxed in. And the rest of us are yoked to this crazy, self-affirming monument that’s a barrier only to reason and responsible government."
177,"Good Tuesday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today._____________________• House Republican leaders removed Representative Steve King of Iowa from powerful committee posts on Monday, after Mitch McConnell suggested he find “another line of work” and Mitt Romney said he should resign. The punishment came after Mr. King, who has a long history of racist remarks, made comments to The Times last week questioning why white supremacy was considered offensive.• Several times last year, President Trump said privately that he wanted to withdraw from NATO, senior officials told The Times. A former under secretary of defense said an American pullout from NATO would be “the wildest success that Vladimir Putin could dream of.”• Mr. Trump rejected a proposal from the Republican senator Lindsey Graham to temporarily reopen the government in an effort to jump-start talks with Democrats on funding a border wall.• In the heart of Trump country, some furloughed federal workers are still backing the president’s demand for a wall, keeping Republican senators in line as the shutdown stretches on.• Private donors put up $107 million for Mr. Trump’s inauguration two years ago. It is now clear how the money was used.• Trade policies and tariffs designed to help the farm and steel industries have done anything but. Farmers now have to deal with higher costs and loss of access to some markets, while steel prices in the United States have fallen back to pre-tariff levels.• Trying to calm Democrats’ fears, William P. Barr, Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, promised he would let the special counsel finish his investigation. But Mr. Barr is still under pressure to renounce his hostility toward whistle-blowers.• Ivanka Trump, the president’s eldest daughter, will assist Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, in choosing the next president of the World Bank.• Senator Bernie Sanders, hoping to contain the damage from reports of sexism and harassment in his 2016 campaign, plans to meet with former staff members who want assurances that things will change if he runs again.• A key question for the Democrats’ potential presidential field is which candidate will be the best antidote to Trumpism. Liberals may want to apply policy litmus tests; moderates may just want a winner.• Raj Shah, a top White House spokesman, has left to lead the press wing of a Florida-based lobbying firm._____________________Today’s On Politics briefing was compiled by Isabella Grullón Paz in New York.Were you forwarded this newsletter?

178,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. Prime Minister Theresa May promises Parliament the chance to delay Brexit, the U.S.-North Korea summit meeting begins and Michael Cohen prepares to dish dirt in Congress. Here’s the latest: Britain’s prime minister said on Tuesday that Parliament should have a chance to delay the country’s exit from the E.U. if lawmakers reject her withdrawal plan. She was bowing to demands by pro-European rebels in her Conservative government that she reduce the risk of a chaotic “no deal” departure on March 29. Next steps: Mrs. May plans to bring a revised deal to Parliament by March 12. If lawmakers reject it, they will then be able to vote on whether to delay an exit or opt for a “no deal” departure, which many oppose. A postponement would require the consent of all 27 other E.U. governments and would probably not extend beyond early July. Go deeper: Ever wonder what happens in talks between British and E.U. officials over revising the deal? According to a confidential document obtained by The Times: “nothing.” President Trump is in Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, to meet with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, for the second time in eight months. The two leaders, who in 2017 exchanged fiery threats, will have dinner together tonight and formal meetings tomorrow. Here’s our live briefing. Mr. Trump might have a lot else on his mind. Michael Cohen, his former personal lawyer and fixer, will testify today before lawmakers that Mr. Trump is a “con man” and a “cheat” who knew an adviser was communicating with WikiLeaks about the release of Democratic emails that were hacked by Russia. Read Mr. Cohen’s opening statement. What North Korea wants: Pyongyang has brought a long list of demands, including an elimination of sanctions, a formal end to the Korean War and, possibly, the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea. What the U.S. wants: Mr. Trump has lowered expectations to an extent that even some of his aides see a significant retreat at a critical moment. On denuclearization, he said he didn’t want to “rush anybody.” He may ultimately be willing to settle for limits on the size and reach of the North’s arsenal. Go deeper: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has his work cut out for him as the translator of Mr. Trump’s foreign policy decisions. Here’s an in-depth profile of Mr. Pompeo, a former C.I.A. director.Pakistan’s military said it had shot down two Indian aircraft that had entered Pakistani airspace and captured one of the pilots, in an escalation of hostilities just a day after Indian fighter jets crossed the disputed Kashmir region to launch an airstrike within Pakistan.The claim was not confirmed by the Indian government.Earlier developments: Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan promised on Tuesday to retaliate for the incursion hours earlier by Indian jets, which crossed the de facto border between the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled areas of Kashmir to strike Pakistan for the first time since 1971. Analysts warn that the crisis between the two nuclear-armed countries could erupt into something more serious unless both sides show restraint.To the consternation of many at home, Russia appears to reprising Cold War threats to rain nuclear annihilation on the U.S. if attacked. In a prime-time TV broadcast, Dmitri Kiselyev, the Kremlin’s top propagandist, detailed how Russia would wipe out targets including two U.S. military bases that closed many years ago. He also laid out a plan to station Russian nuclear submarines off the coast of the U.S. if it were to put nuclear missiles in Poland.And to mark Defenders of the Fatherland Day on Saturday, a choir at a St. Petersburg cathedral performed a song about a nuclear attack on the U.S.Context: The assertiveness seems to be related to President Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which banned the placement of such weapons in Europe. President Vladimir Putin of Russia promised in his state-of-the-nation address this month to answer with the deployment of new nuclear weaponry. Another angle: A Cold War atmosphere also prevailed at the U.N. Security Council, where the U.S. and Russia squared off over Venezuela.  Border wall dispute: With more than a dozen Republicans joining Democrats, the House voted to block Mr. Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to secure funding for a border wall. The measure is one supporter short of possible passage in the Senate. Britain: Under new rules, all adults will be considered potential organ donors by 2020 unless they opt out. Nigeria: In an election marred by pockets of violence, Muhammadu Buhari won a second term as president, defeating a corruption-stained competitor. Climate: Britons this week experienced the highest temperatures ever recorded in the country in winter. Kew Gardens, London, reached 21.2 degrees Celsius (70.16 Fahrenheit), the hottest February day since records began in 1910. Ireland: The head of an 800-year-old mummified Crusader was stolen from a historic Dublin church, and a crypt was damaged. The church, St. Michan’s, is working with the police to recover the head “so we can let him rest in peace,” its vicar said.Germany: Daniel Barenboim, one of the world’s leading conductors, has been accused by current and former members of the Berlin State Opera of bullying and humiliation, adding to a larger debate about the highhanded conduct that can be typical of maestros. He contends that there is a cynical campaign to oust him. Sex education: English schools, particularly those that receive government funds, will significantly broaden sex education to cover topics including gay relationships and transgender people. Harvest season: In northern Germany at this time of year, kale is king. (Just don’t forget the schmaltz and bacon.)Fashion: At Paris Fashion Week, our chief fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, wrote about young designers generating buzz, including Marine Serre, who imagined a post-climate-change apocalyptic wardrobe for her show.Tips for a more fulfilling life.Recipe of the day: Make chicken piccata, and rejoice over its butter-rich pan sauce.Choosing a perfume or cologne is tough, but we have experts to help you find a fragrance that you’ll love.Why we yawn remains a mystery, but one theory is that it cools off our brains.This week, Vice President Mike Pence accused Uruguay of being a “bystander” in Venezuela’s crisis, calling on its center-left government to do more to end President Nicolás Maduro’s devastating reign.A reader, Annelise Gasser of Quebec, asked how a small South American nation had acquired such diplomatic significance.Uruguay, which has clean democratic credentials and decent relations with Mr. Maduro, maintains credibility with both Maduro supporters and opponents that makes it a natural intermediary.Uruguay’s soft approach stems from a live-and-let-live attitude, developed over two centuries of coexistence with much bigger neighbors. The country has long led the region in progressive politics, including legalizing marijuana and gay marriage.While hard-liners in Miami threaten military intervention to oust Mr. Maduro, on the laid-back streets of Montevideo, Uruguay’s capital, residents resolve problems over a slow barbecue and the ever-present thermos of caffeine-rich mate (pronounced MAH-tay).Anatoly Kurmanaev, our Caracas-based reporter, wrote today’s Back Story.

179,"WASHINGTON — Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, said on Monday that cyberthreats against the United States were a national security crisis that she described as her top priority — not the situation for which President Trump last month declared a national emergency.“On top of my list of threats, that many of you can guess, the word ‘cyber’ is circled, highlighted and underlined,” Ms. Nielsen said in a speech outlining her department’s focus in the coming year. “The cyberdomain is a target, a weapon and a threat vector all at the same time.”Mr. Trump has called the increasing flow of immigrants to the southern border one of the most urgent national security issues threatening the United States. Last week, issuing his first veto against legislation that would have blocked him from diverting Defense Department funds to build a border wall, the president described a recent spike in migrants crossing the border as an “invasion.”The Department of Homeland Security oversees customs officers and immigration agents who are on the front lines of the Trump administration’s campaign to close the border to illegal immigration.Ms. Nielsen did dedicate a portion of her speech on Monday to what she called a “humanitarian and security catastrophe” of Central American families traveling to the border. She also noted that the projected number of migrants who may be apprehended at the southern border this month was expected to rise to 100,000, up from 76,000 in February.But mentions of digital threats were dispersed throughout her approximately 35-minute address to an auditorium of various Department of Homeland Security officials.Among global jihadists and transnational criminals, Ms. Nielsen listed “cyberthugs and hackers and resurgent nation-state rivals” as an emerging threat to the United States. She asked two cybersecurity officials who helped safeguard the 2018 elections to stand for a round of applause.Ms. Nielsen also assailed President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the Kremlin “for a concerted effort to undermine our elections and our democratic process using cyberenabled means.” And she said the average American citizen or company was “no match” for virtual threats from Russia, China, North Korea and Iran.“I am more worried about the ability of bad guys to hijack our networks than their ability to hijack our flights,” Ms. Nielsen said. “I am concerned about them holding our infrastructure hostage, stealing our money and secrets, exploiting children online and even hacking our democracy.”John Cohen, a former acting under secretary for intelligence during the Obama administration, said law enforcement could no longer look at the threats in the digital world and the physical world as separate issues. Extremist groups now circulate videos on the internet to inspire terrorist attacks, and drug traffickers are using the dark web — something Ms. Nielsen also highlighted in her speech.Mr. Cohen said he remained unclear on how Ms. Nielsen proposed combating cybersecurity threats.“There is an incredible amount of talent at D.H.S.,” said Mr. Cohen, also a senior adviser at the agency during the George W. Bush administration. “My concern is that talent and those capabilities are being underutilized, because in the eyes of many at the White House, the sole purpose for D.H.S. is to conduct its immigrant and border security activities.”Ms. Nielsen said the department was focused on increasing collaboration with the private sector, citing a summit meeting held in New York last year for industry and government officials. She said she expected the cooperation between various homeland security agencies to improve when the department consolidates at a former mental hospital next month.She praised the department’s work in defending the integrity of the 2018 midterm elections and said she was confident in her department’s ability to secure the 2020 presidential vote. Ms. Nielsen also said homeland security would continue to pursue prosecutions against foreign entities that hack the American digital infrastructure.“What worries me, though, is not what these threat actors have done,” Ms. Nielsen said, “but what they have the capability to do.”"
180,"This week, students took on some challenging topics via our writing prompts, including the debate over the border wall, sexual abuse allegations against R. Kelly, and the relationship between the news media and the president.As always, we were impressed with their thoughtfulness, humility and sharp analyses. But what really impressed us was how many students took the time to read and reply to each other’s comments with both disagreement and approval. Most readers offered substantial and civil rebuttals, responses we know are not always easy to give to issues as complicated and emotional as these.Below, we’ve rounded up the best of the comments on two of these topics, along with some more lighthearted teenage musings about dream travel destinations.We’re so happy to welcome new classes from Downers Grove, Ill.; Sarah E. Goode STEM Academy in Chicago; and Tallahassee, Fla. this week — and we want also to give a special shout out to the students at the Julia R. Masterman School in Philadelphia, who wrote excellent comments across all our prompts this week.Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted.__________The government shutdown and debate over a border wall have dominated headlines for the past few weeks. Following President Trump’s prime-time address to the nation on Jan. 8, we asked students what they thought about the standoff between Mr. Trump and Congress and how they hoped it would be resolved.The majority of students took issue with the impasse, but a few defended Mr. Trump’s steadfastness. Others suggested ways the deadlock could be resolved and how the $5.7 billion Mr. Trump wants for the border wall could be better spent. We highlight some of the best-argued and most interesting ideas in our roundup below.Weighing the costs and benefits of a government shutdownIn the midst of the government shutdown, there is a looming humanitarian crisis. However, it is not a scourge of illegal immigrants entering the US and committing unspeakable atrocities, but the roughly 800,000 federal employees who are not reviving paychecks as a consequence of government shutdown. Each day it stretches on, their situation grows more perilous as they are forced to draw from financial savings that should be utilized for retirement or sending their children to college. It is absolutely abhorrent that almost one million people are having their livelihoods put on hold because the president does not want to negotiate.The wall is perhaps the most ridiculous and controversial border control proposition created in the last fifteen years. In its full form, it would cost American taxpayers upwards of 50 billion dollars, and it has no guarantees of effectiveness. There is no denying that the US-Mexico border has an issue with illegal immigrants, but this is no way of solving the issue, a multifaceted, extremely complex problem that has continually defied resolution. A simple wall will not remedy the conundrum faced by both US and Mexican authorities. In summary, the cost for the border wall, in both monetary and humanitarian terms, is far too high to justify its creation. Instead, it would be exponentially more useful to explore alternate, less belligerent methods of border control that can be more universally agreed upon and implemented.— Jake Hession, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, N.C.Robert Frost once wrote, “Good fences makes good neighbors,” so do good walls … The United States government does not need the added work of taking care of all of these illegal immigrants, who sneaked here to flea danger in their country. Not only is it fair to the U.S. government, but it is also unfair to the many people trying to enter the country legally, who have been waiting for years only to have to wait longer because of these illegal immigrants. Many people are making the argument that government workers are not being paid for their work, however, these workers do get backpay as compensation for the money they lost during that time. This one bit of information makes that argument almost completely irrelevant.— Jonah A., Masterman SchoolIn all honesty, I am a supporter of the border wall. However, the recent actions and behavior Mr. Trump has displayed in order to fund the wall is absolutely not justified. A leader is supposed to unify the hoi polloi, not divide us even further, but Mr. Trump has failed to do this. Instead of offering himself to the United States, Mr. Trump has decided to offer the United States for his own desires. This is wrong, and it’s not okay. 800,000 Americans are struggling to survive without a paycheck because of one man’s selfishness. Some of these citizens also have families to feed, many with young children.— G Jap, Masterman School, Philadelphia, Penn.I agree with the president in this matter. I understand that a lot of people are not being paid for their work, but sometimes that just has to happen for the greater good. The border will decrease a lot of illegal immigration, which should be our priority … The government shutdown provided a lot of the fund to build/reinforce the border already, and I’m not saying it’s a good thing, but all of the funds are essential to a safe border. The Democrats have a false sense of security, thinking that we are already protected well enough from illegal immigration. But that is false. Hundreds or even thousands of people cross the border every passing day, and they are not doing anything to stop it … The border needs its funds in order to keep doing its job— David W. the great, the great land of earthGovernment spending and the wallDonald Trump’s prime-time address did not sway my opinion at all. I still believe the wall is unnecessary money to take from America that could be used to help the people in Flint, Michigan or a year’s worth of housing for every homeless person in the US. There are much more urgent and important matters that the president has sidelined to focus on his wall.— Angela Xhori, Julia R. Masterman, PhiladelphiaI believe that yes our border needs protection just not keeping everyone out with a huge wall. What I feel would be more warranted would be background and weapon checks on those coming into the USA to ensure the safety of the country.— Reza Chity-Guevara, Masterman, Philadelphia, Penn.I believe that the wall is a terrible idea. With the money the government would be spending on the wall, 1.4 million people could get health care, double funding for mental health, and double funding for environmental causes. This wall won’t fix anything, it will just prove America avoids their problems and builds barriers. New problems would arise with the wall. For example, people could destroy parts of the wall or dig under it. This is basically throwing money out of the window.— Molly Flaxman, Masterman School, PhiladelphiaWhy isn’t 5 billion dollars being spent in the cities that suffer from a drug epidemic. Why not 5 billion dollars to the homeless, orphanages, hospitals, schools, medicine, and more. Spend the money on what you really need to help this country. What does the wall benefit. Not schools, not research centers, not even care centers … That money can be used to make places for those immigrants who have crucial reasons to be leaving their own home … Spend money on the violence of our cities. Young teens killing each other … spend money on educating the young people who will become our caretakers in the future. If you really want to make america better that’s how you make “america great again”. Not with a wall.— Jenesis Moreno, Masterman, Philadelphia, Penn.Democrats and Republicans need to work togetherI think putting a wall on the border is not going to solve all the problems. I also think as a country, we should put our differences aside and work together. America has a greater destiny and purpose and should be an example for future generations. If we act as we do now, the future leaders will act worse seeing our behavior and political thinking. Even though political views have split the country tremendously over the past 3 years, our main goal is to keep this country the best and running. Now the Republicans and Democrats are wasting every precious second and because of this, many families are suffering and the national parks are slowly getting destroyed.— Eleena John, Masterman, Philly, Penn.Trump is not willing to negotiate, but neither is Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer. They are saying that they do not want the wall under any circumstance. All three of them are resisting each other and the U.S. citizens are paying for it (or not getting payed. Whatever floats your boat). I hope this will end by the Republicans giving in, and the loads of money will be spent on different issues like global warming, while still not letting all the illegal immigrants in.— Arjun Ahya, Masterman School, Philadelphia, Penn.__________Last week, the Times Travel section published its annual “52 Places to Go” piece and announced the travel writer who would travel to and write about all 52 spots. In this Student Opinion question, we asked students which of these destinations they’d most like to visit and whether they would want the job of the 52 Places Traveler.Of the “52 Places to Go in 2019,” students were most excited about visiting the Setouchi Islands in Japan. Other top spots included: Puerto Rico; the Islands of Tahiti; the Ontario Ice Caves; and Panama. They also recommended several places not on the list, including Ghent, Belgium; the Galápagos Islands; Pittsburgh; and the Great Wall of China. Below, they tell us why.Where students want to visit and whyEvery single place in the list provided looked absolutely breathtaking and incredible, and while there were so many choices, I found myself stopping to take a closer look at Aberdeen, in Scotland. While it may not have been as beautiful or exotic as some of the other destinations on the list, I have always found myself to be fascinated with all things Scottish. I love how the Scottish accent flows, and I have always been amazed by the landscapes and “lochs” in Scotland. What made this location appear even more impressive to me was the old fashion trains, which combine two things I love: old fashioned vehicles and overnight train rides!— Lily Chancey, Philadelphia, MastermanIf I could travel to one of the places on the list, I would prefer to go to the Setouchi Islands in Japan. Before I even went through the list, I already had a passion to go to Japan for a trip. I wanted to see Japan’s beautiful nature and try some of their traditional foods. Setouchi Triennale 2019, a major art fair interests me considering it will be held at Teshima and Honjima which are less frequented to create a balance between the nature and the art. There are so many different places to go, some focusing on the natural beauty of Japan like cycling on trails with citrus trees and olive groves. I would love to ride a sea plane with Setouchi Sea Planes to take scenic flights to small and larger islands. The food that I could try on the trip also inticesme considering I could try authentic Japanese food. Japan seems like an ideal place for me to travel and relax to have a fun time in a calm place.— Janey L., Julia R. Masterman, PhiladephiaIn my lifetime, I have visited five of the seven continents. Travelling has always lead me blindly into the most thrilling and unique experiences. I will take any chance I get to pack my bag and experience a new lifestyle, and I am constantly searching for ways to broaden my cultural horizon. There was one destination included in the article that sounded very rare and intriguing: Isla Palenque, Panama. When reading the description, the part that caught my attention was “the resort grows some of its own food, has furniture made from fallen trees and maintains a no-plastics policy, including subbing papaya shoots for straws.” It would be a totally new experience for me to “live off the land”, and get away from all of the sounds overpopulation.— Haven Habrat, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, N.C.My biggest dream is to travel. Having never left the country, I rely on the internet and experiences from friends to tell me about the world outside of the US. Last year I got to know two foreign exchange students that had come to the US for a year and it only fueled my passion for travel. It amazes me how different cultures are and I want to learn about them all.The Tatra Mountains in Slovakia caught my attention. I live in a port city, right by a beach community so it’s always fairly warm. It would be interesting to go to a place that has snow and it’s sweltering hot for 75% of the year. Also there are many outdoor activities that I have never tried before (due to lack of snow) like snowboarding, skiing, snow tubing, etc.— Paige Phillips, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, N.C.I am your average student, stressed from the amount of homework and the constant pressure I’m always under. I will live in my little bubble for most of the year forgetting that there is an entire world out there to explore. After reading the fifty two recommended places I found The Islands of Tahiti to be one of the places I want to explore. I have always wanted to live on the water and be able to experience something that I could not find anywhere. What made it stand out was “Tahiti’s clear, warm waters offer views of more than 1,000 species of marine life.” This would be something you would only receive once in a lifetime and living on the water while seeing more than a thousand species of marine life is something extraordinary.— Talia Porzio, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, N.C.Traveling is one of the best ways to learn. You are exposed to different cultures, as well as encounter the history embedded to the place. One of the proven best ways to learn is to experience what is being taught. Personally, I would love to visit the Setouchi islands in Japan, Thailand, or Danang in Vietnam. My mom was born in Vietnam but was raised in America, a result of being forced to flee during the war. It would be so nice to go and revisit some of the few memories she has as well as enrich my knowledge in the culture.— Hope A, Masterman, PhillyOn being the 52 Places TravelerHaving a job as the 52 place traveler sounds phenomenal because you would get to take a break and visit places that your heart desires. In addition, all you have to do is write about your experiences. Everything is taken care of, and it would just be a extremely long vacation. Although this job sounds great, there are also downfalls. You may have to be away from your family and friends, and that can always make you feel lonely. Though there are downfalls, this job still sounds great. Sometimes you have to sacrifice things in life, so that you can get another.— Sophia, MastermanIt might be fun to go 52 different places, but if you even spend 3 days there, plus a day for flying there, that’s four days. Multiplied by 52 is 208 days - almost 2/3 of the year. I don’t think I would want to spend that much time away from home because there are a lot of aspects of my home that I really enjoy. In conclusion, I probably wouldn’t want to travel somewhere for more than 1.5 months. And only up to 1.5 months if it’s really fun.— Samuel, MastermanI would absolutely love to have a job that travels 52 places, that is like a dream job! You have the opportunity to experience the world and do things others dream to do. The only challenging thing about this job might be leaving your family for long periods of time, however what you gain from traveling the world is absolutely worth it.— Elodie Poussard, MassachusettsI would be absolutely ecstatic about being the 52 Places traveler. That opportunity to connect with people different from you, and learn something new is once in a lifetime. It would be so fun to meet people, visit historic places, eat new foods, and really learn about a new culture. I think the challenging part would be a language barrier, but that would never stop me from enjoying myself. I’m sure I can communicate well enough with hand jesters and google translate.— Bailey Dyer, Florida High School, Tallahassee, Fla.__________In our most popular Picture Prompt of the week, “Tight Rope,” we asked students to study the image above and interpret it in light of current events.They came up with a variety of nuanced explanations, but all seemed immediately to grasp the theme of the Frank Bruni column that inspired our prompt: the relationship between President Trump and the news media. Of the many wonderful comments we got, we chose those that were grounded in the illustration’s visual evidence and drew clear connections to specific events or issues — especially because, having just judged our own Student Editorial Cartoon Contest, we know it is this kind of thinking that results in sophisticated winning work like this.Here is what students came up with:Walking a fine lineI believe that this picture is commenting on the difficult job of our press. In America, the press has to try so hard to stay neutral, not supporting one side over the other… I know that newspapers and magazines have to walk a fine line (or tightrope) when it comes to publishing. It is either exposing the truth or risking large scale retaliation from the readers and people in power.— Sam Doyle, Philly PhillyI think that this image is trying to represent how on edge the news feels today. President Trump has repeatedly said that today’s new is the enemy of the people, and whenever he doesn’t like something on the news he calls it fake news. It shows how careful the reporters have to be. In the image they have to be careful to stay on balance and not fall, but in real life they have to make sure they say the right things so they don’t get President Trump mad. It must feel like walking on eggshells around him … Reporters today have to balance on a tightrope to get to talk to Trump without him calling them fake news or the enemy of the people, and that’s not how things are supposed to be in a Democratic country.— Ami S, Masterman, PhiladelphiaI assume the guy with the tanned face and blonde hair is President Trump so I feel like the picture is showing the dangers of news outlets reporting on President Trump. It’s almost like a “tight rope” that you are crossing when it comes to him and the controversy your news outlet can start. I feel like the people on the other side of the tightrope are news reporters that are passed all the controversy with Trump and some of them may even support him. This may be the reason why he is depicted talking to them, when in other situations he is ignoring the reporters that confront him. This picture shows the other news reporters on the rope who may be in the controversy and their news outlet may be undergoing some type of drama with Trump and have to record him from a distance.— Abdoul Diallo, Julia R. Masterman, PhiladelphiaI believe that this picture prompt represents how difficult it is for reporters and journalist just to talk to President Trump. A reporter’s job is to get information from a person, but when the person is not cooperative then this cold be a rather hard job. We all know that Trump is not easy to interview because he cuts people off and sometimes turns questions around. I can recall he even kicked a journalist out of a news conference for asking a question about a topic Trump was very strict on (Immigration). So when a reporter is trying to ask the President something its like they are walking on a tightrope because you never know how he could possibly lash out.— Jack Dunphy, PhiladelphiaSeeking the truthI think that this image is saying how maybe Donald Trump is keeping the truth away from us. He is making reporters and other people who are trying to figure out what s going on work very hard to get it. I feel this picture saying that he is hiding what he is doing and only a few people who are determined will continue to try to get to it. My opinion on what I think is this messages is why not tell them what is happening you are the president but it is still our lives, your people should know what is going on.— Sierra McKinley, Philadelphia, Penn.In this illustration, Donald Trump is on one side while reporter are trying to get to him on a tightrope. I think the tightrope represents how hard reporters try to figure out what is happening in the Trump presidency. There are so many secrets and things that we don’t know especially in the Trump presidency because of all of the things that have happened during his term and all of the lies he has told. We need to know the truth, and it’s these reporter’s jobs to tell us what’s going on.— Maia Keenan, Masterman, PhiladelphiaWe think this image depicts reporters trying to ask questions and will risk everything to know the truth and reality. The reporter holding the microphone is asking risky questions, especially because all of the other reporters could fall if he asks something that Donald Trump finds offensive. Finally, everyone in the image can only move forward because if they go back everyone falls but Trump is isolated.— Hall MS EL Masters, Corte Madera, Calif.The media circusWhen I look at this picture it reminds me of the media image in America, and how it is so focused on Donald Trump. Since the presidential election all that has been in the news is Donald Trump, has been the on the headline of the news so many times that I can’t even keep track anymore. We have been so focused on what he is doing that we are missing out on all the other stuff that is happening in America like all the mass shooting that are constantly happing in America or the mass population homeless people that we have on our streets. They say that he is digging this country into a deeper hole but what they don’t say is that the media is there with him helping him dig this ever-growing hole.— Niara Hughes, Masterman, Philadelphia, Penn.… The image shows how Donald Trump is trying to get attention, even if people are risking their lives at the same time (for example, the government shutdown). He thinks his wall is more important than the people of America.— Maya Kowal, Masterman School, Philadelphia, Penn."

182,"WASHINGTON — President Trump warned on Wednesday that he reserved the option of declaring a national emergency to build his border wall without congressional approval.The president, speaking a day after his address to the nation that even some supporters conceded was unlikely to increase public support, headed to a luncheon meeting on Capitol Hill where he faced the urgent task of persuading wavering Senate Republicans that he could still come to an accord with Democrats on border security and end the partial shutdown of the federal government.Asked whether he was still considering declaring a national emergency, an extraordinary measure rarely used by presidents absent an urgent security threat, Mr. Trump said: “I think we might work a deal, and if we don’t, I may go that route. I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want.”[Read about whether Mr. Trump can use his emergency powers to build a wall.]Mr. Trump was scheduled to meet later Wednesday afternoon with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders at the White House in an effort to break the deadlock. So far, Democrats have held firm to the position that the president must agree to reopen the government before they will engage on the larger issue of border security legislation and his proposed wall.The president insisted that he maintained “tremendous” Republican support, even as nearly a half-dozen Republican senators have said directly or strongly suggested that they wanted to reopen the government, then have the debate about the wall.“I think we have tremendous Republican support,” Mr. Trump said. “The Senate has been incredible. Mitch McConnell has been incredible,” he said, referring to the Senate majority leader.The president, who has refused to sign any bill to fund the government that does not include $5.7 billion for the wall, also said some Democrats were moving to his point of view, although he did not offer any names.“The fact is that there is tremendous support,” he said.“If I did something that was foolish, like gave up on border security, the first ones that would hit me would be my senators — they’d be angry at me,” he said. “The second ones would be the House. And the third ones would be frankly my base and a lot of Republicans out there and a lot of Democrats that want to see border security.”Mr. Trump is scheduled to travel to southern Texas on Wednesday to dramatize his call for a wall. The Democratic members of Congress in that area of Texas, and several of the Republicans there, have said a wall along the entire Texas border is not necessary.“This is not a fight I wanted,” Mr. Trump said. “I didn’t want this fight.”"
183,"WASHINGTON — Standing before a diverse new class of House Democrats, in the shadow of their new female speaker, President Trump showed on Tuesday how he planned to govern in a divided Washington.The answer, judging by his words, is no differently than he did before.Mr. Trump briefly acknowledged Nancy Pelosi as “Madam Speaker,” but dispensed with even perfunctory congratulations. He all but ignored the midterm elections that swept the Republican Party out of power in the House. And he vowed that the United States “will never be a socialist country,” likening the progressive Democrats in the chamber to the discredited leader of Venezuela.The president did issue a call for bipartisan cooperation, and he invoked the heroism of World War II to celebrate a shared history. But on the issues that have rived Washington during Mr. Trump’s turbulent presidency, he did not give an inch.Whether it was the border wall, which he insisted would be built; abortion, where he tried to fan conservative anger over comments made by Virginia’s governor; or the investigations of his presidential campaign’s ties to Russia, which he dismissed as “ridiculous” and “partisan,” Mr. Trump chose to appeal to his political base rather than trying to build bridges to Democrats.“If there is going to be peace and legislation,” he declared, setting out the terms of his engagement with Congress, “there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn’t work that way!”Save for the majesty of the setting, the president’s adherence to his script, and a single unscripted moment when Mr. Trump tipped his hat to the scores of Democratic women elected to Congress last November, parts of this State of the Union speech could have been drawn from one of his “Make America Great Again” rallies.Mr. Trump warned of a new wave of invading caravans from Central America, spoke of grisly crimes committed by illegal immigrants and accused what he said were wealthy politicians who oppose his immigration policies — presumably including Ms. Pelosi — of favoring open borders while “living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.”“No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and political class than illegal immigration,” he said.In front of him, however, the divide was between the mostly male Republicans, who applauded his red-meat lines, and the Democrats, many of them women, who were clad in white to signify the women’s suffrage movement.Mr. Trump delighted in his role as the dismantler of Democratic legacies: He boasted of eliminating a “very unpopular” provision of Obamacare, withdrawing the United States from the “disastrous Iran nuclear deal” and renegotiating the “catastrophe known as Nafta.”As for how the Republicans and Democrats might work together, Mr. Trump revived his proposal for infrastructure legislation, calling it “not an option” but a “necessity.” But he offered no details and breezed through the proposal, which is less popular among Republicans, in barely three lines, half as much time as he gave his campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs.Even Mr. Trump’s conciliatory phrases carried a partisan sting. He said, for example, “the agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda,” using a shortened form of Democratic that some Republicans favor as a mild slur against the opposing party.For a president whose party lost 40 seats in the House three months ago, and who just lost a battle with Ms. Pelosi over the 35-day government shutdown, Mr. Trump behaved like the insurgent who rode into Washington two years ago with a congressional majority and a mandate to upend the establishment.He claimed credit for a long list of economic and national security achievements, some of which were almost comically exaggerated. “If I had not been elected president of the United States,” he said, “we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea.”In addressing Congress on Tuesday, Mr. Trump found himself in an identical position to his three immediate predecessors, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton — facing a hostile Congress after a devastating midterm defeat.How each confronted the moment offers a window into their presidencies; together, they stand as a stark contrast to the current occupant of the Oval Office.In 1995, Mr. Clinton responded to the Republican Revolution of the previous November by pivoting to the center and giving credence to the small-government agenda of Newt Gingrich and his fellow warriors. He admitted to missteps in his first two years in office, which had allowed his Republican opponents to caricature him as a tax-and-spend liberal.Mr. Clinton sketched a vision of a leaner, more efficient government, with fewer regulations and an overhauled welfare system. The conservative commentator William Kristol marveled that it was the “most conservative State of the Union by a Democratic president in history.”Twelve years later, Mr. Bush opened his State of the Union address with a warm tribute to Ms. Pelosi, who assumed the speaker’s gavel for the first time after Democrats swept to power in the House in 2006. He spoke of the pride her late father, Thomas D’Alesandro Jr., a congressman from Maryland, would have felt in seeing his “only daughter, Nancy, presiding tonight.”It was a grace note for Mr. Bush, who was fighting to salvage his legacy after midterm elections that served as a referendum on the Iraq war and his bungled handling of Hurricane Katrina. Mr. Trump, by contrast, appeared to rush his opening remarks to deny Ms. Pelosi the chance to introduce him.Mr. Obama’s speech in 2011 came days after former Representative Gabrielle Giffords was nearly killed in a mass shooting in Tucson — a tragedy that muted the normally partisan tone. Mr. Obama seized on the fleeting comity to declare, “Each of us is part of something greater — something more consequential than party or political preference.”Like Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton, he appealed to Republicans to find common ground — in his case behind a national project to make the United States more competitive in a rapidly changing global economy.“This is our generation’s Sputnik moment,” Mr. Obama said, urging Americans to “out-innovate, out-educate and out-build the rest of the world.”Mr. Trump referred to outspending and out-innovating major competitors, too, but he put it in the context of building nuclear weapons, after explaining why he pulled the United States out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.For presidents, State of the Union speeches rarely grease the wheels of bipartisanship. Mr. Clinton clashed repeatedly with Republicans after their congressional takeover, outmaneuvering Mr. Gingrich after he precipitated a government shutdown, though he made a historic deal on welfare overhaul that set the stage for his re-election in 1996.Mr. Bush stuck to his troop surge in Iraq, reaping unexpected gains. But with the exception of a deal with the Democrats late in his term on the fiscal crisis, his legislative agenda was over by the time he spoke in 2007.Mr. Obama’s call for bipartisanship went nowhere in the Republican Senate, where the leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, vowed to make Mr. Obama a one-term president. He failed to strike a grand bargain on fiscal policy with Speaker John A. Boehner, with both sides blaming the other for bad faith in the failed negotiation.For Mr. Trump, the portents for cooperation seem even less promising. He offered no tangible compromise on the border wall, he faces a newly energized Democratic Party and he is heading into a presidential election year.“We must choose between greatness and gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction,” Mr. Trump said.The president implored his audience to choose “greatness,” but he gave them no road map for pursuing it."
184,"To the Editor:Re “President Offers Deal on ‘Dreamers’ to Secure a Wall” (front page, Jan. 20) and “Senate Will Hold Competing Votes to End Shutdown” (front page, Jan. 23):President Trump and congressional Democrats appear to be locked in a political game of chicken, with federal government workers, government contractors and the public trapped in the middle. Mr. Trump’s offer of temporary protections for the Dreamers in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall was quickly rejected by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Two measures ending the shutdown that will be before the Senate on Thursday are not expected to pass.The current situation is untenable. The burden on federal workers is onerous and unfair. Creative solutions are needed to end this impasse. I offer two.First, a proven mediator, such as former Senator George Mitchell, could be appointed in an attempt to bring the parties to an agreement. Second, a bipartisan blue ribbon commission — composed of experts from government, business and academia — could be created to offer recommendations on how best to address our border issues, including people and drugs coming into our country.Time is of the essence. A deal must be struck soon to avoid irreparable harm to the federal government.Todd J. SchwartzWall, N.J. To the Editor:The Democrats should seize on this chance to end the shutdown. There’s no downside for them. It is not a question of bargaining anymore but of the suffering of the country. But even so, it’s a good deal. The Dreamers will get something they would otherwise have not gotten. And President Trump has learned his lesson.His approval ratings have gone down. His base is unhappy. There will be no more Trump shutdowns. And Democrats will avoid the risk of a shift in blame to them for their intransigence. And, the clincher: Ann Coulter doesn’t like it.Howard RachlinNew YorkTo the Editor:How about this? Democrats put forward a bill in the House for border security of $12 billion. This would be for more border patrol officers, upgraded equipment, improved facilities, etc., but not a wall.This would allow Democrats to show that they are tough on border security by more than doubling President Trump’s proposed funding. The bill must focus purely on border security — no other Democratic wish list items or conditions.Would Republican members of Congress and the president bite? Perhaps they’d see it as face-saving. Conversely, to reject it would be seen as obstructionist, risking voter wrath at the next election.Jim SpanierHoustonTo the Editor:Set a date for all federal employees to picket in front of President Trump’s hotels. Nothing gets his attention like money.Barbara LloydStratford, Conn.To the Editor:For all of his manifold and well-documented deficiencies, President Trump is not nearly as naïve as Charlie Brown. If Mr. Trump buys into Nancy Pelosi’s assurances that border security, including a wall or other physical barrier, can be discussed once the government is reopened, he is no smarter than Charlie thinking that this time Lucy will not snatch the football away just as he is about to kick it.David MacNeilChatham, N.J. To the Editor:There was fencing around a construction site here in Queens that my wife and I passed this morning, and on it was a sign that read: National Rent A Fence. Seeing it, my wife laughed and said, “Maybe Trump should try that.”James J. RushBayside, Queens"

187,"Welcome to Crossing the Border, a limited-run weekly newsletter from The New York Times. Like what you see? Send this to a friend. If someone forwarded it to you, sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox.By Manny Fernandez in Donna, Tex.It’s springtime on the border, and that means the winter season is winding down — the months when tens of thousands of retirees from Minnesota, South Dakota, Illinois and other parts of the Midwest adopt South Texas as their home away from home.Retirees in swimsuits ride their bicycles to the pool, bright noodles tucked under their arms like jousting lances. They line the streets for golf-cart parades. They venture into Mexico, shopping for cheap medicine, getting pedicures, undergoing low-cost dental work and sipping goblet-sized margaritas.They are known as Winter Texans, and they concentrate mainly in the Rio Grande Valley, the temperate region deep in South Texas that is also the place where the largest number of migrants has been crossing lately from Central America — President Trump has declared a national emergency along the border and stationed Army troops to help control the escalating influx. One of their base camps was a quarter-mile from where seniors at the Victoria Palms resort in Donna deploy by the dozens to occupy five pickleball courts.The annual invasion of Midwesterners — and a number of Canadians — has decreased in recent years, but they remain an economic and cultural force. An estimated 106,000 Winter Texans spent about $528 million in the valley in the 2017-18 winter season, according to a survey by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Tex-Mex restaurants fly welcome banners for them. There are Winter Texan newspapers, age-qualified RV parks, expos, cruises, theater productions and bumper stickers — one pickup truck in the border city of McAllen had two: “Iowa Winter Texan” and “I’m retired. Go around.”“It gets me out of the snowbanks,” said Dean Miller, 58, a resident of Detroit Lakes, Minn., who spends the winter living and working at the Winter Ranch resort in Alamo. “You’ll go to some event down here and you’ll find your neighbor from back home.”The majority of Winter Texans are white and in their early 70s. Many of them voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, and their very presence this winter quietly subverted the president’s assertion that the border is in crisis. They have been coming to the region for years — in some cases, their parents were Winter Texans, too — and the political dynamics and national-emergency rhetoric has no effect on how, or where, they spend their retirement.“We don’t see what you see on TV,” said Terry Goss, the general manager of Victoria Palms, one of the largest Winter Texan communities, with up to 2,500 retirees.What do Winter Texans see, exactly?A slice of border life that looks nothing like what many Americans think of as border life. There was Nathan’s fourth annual Sock Hop at Ranchero Village in Weslaco one Friday. There were fish frys and riverboat tours, line dancing and karaoke sessions, bluegrass acoustic jams and nondenominational church services. At the Winter Ranch resort in Alamo one Monday afternoon, the Winter Ranch Players packed the house with three one-act plays, “The Ethel and Albert Comedies.” At Victoria Palms, Mr. Goss spoke standing next to a poster listing all the sold-out shows at the resort’s ballroom, one of them a Rolling Stones tribute band concert. Victoria Palms is so popular with Canadians that a Victoria Palms reunion is scheduled most summers near Toronto.Margaret Hitzemann, 63, who normally lives in Onamia, Minn., spent the past two months in a townhouse in Port Aransas, near Corpus Christi. One rainy afternoon, she and her husband visited the Mexican tourist town of Nuevo Progreso. They bought crispy chapulines — crickets, a fried delicacy — and went into a pharmacy to buy some cheap medicine.“We don’t take a lot of meds, so we were thinking, ‘Oh, let’s go down and get some cheap Tylenol and Advil and that kind of thing,’” Ms. Hitzemann said. “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, this isn’t any cheaper than Walmart.’ So we ended up not buying any medications.”In a region with a large Latino population and tolerant attitudes toward immigration — many people have family members on both sides of the border — culture clash with the Northerners is inevitable. The study released by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley included unedited messages from Winter Texans to local officials, and some of the sharpest comments read: “Be more American, less Mexican. This is not Mexico!” and “Have channel 5 respect Mr. Trump” and “Keep the grass cut, the trash picked up and speak English.”Already, the exodus back north has started. The end of the season for many comes on Thursday, with the annual Winter Texan appreciation day in Nuevo Progreso.For some, the season never ends. There are Converted Texans, former Winter Texans who settle in the valley for good. Kristi Collier, a McAllen native who runs a media and hospitality company that caters to Winter Texans called Welcome Home, Rio Grande Valley, hosts an annual Converted Texan Fiesta in April. (She leads a swearing-in ceremony.)Among the ranks of the converted are Ken and Lois Lane, originally from Anchorage, who started spending winters at Victoria Palms in 2005. They now live there permanently in a double-wide mobile home.“I think the cost of living here is very reasonable, compared to many other places,” said Mr. Lane, 73, a retired power dispatcher for an electrical company.He and his wife visited Nuevo Progreso and hosted their son and his family from Iowa over spring break. The couple is in a unique category: sort of reverse Winter Texans.“The motor home we kept and in the summer when it gets real hot, we go up north,” Mr. Lane said.Manny is one of a team of New York Times journalists currently reporting from the border.

Farmers’ reliance on undocumented workers had made the region a focal point in the debate over the Trump administration’s border policies, leading to tensions between state politicians of both parties and the federal agents enforcing the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration.Christina Goldbaum, an immigration reporter in The New York Times’s Metro department, explored Mr. McMahon’s story, and those of migrants who work at farms like his, in an article this week.

189,"WASHINGTON — As congressional leaders urged their colleagues to support a bipartisan border deal, President Trump said on Wednesday that he did not want to see the government shut down at midnight Friday, indicating that he was leaning toward signing the compromise legislation.“I don’t want to see a shutdown. A shutdown would be a terrible thing,” Mr. Trump said, later hinting that he had “options that most people don’t understand” to build his border wall without congressional approval.The remarks, which were made to reporters in the Oval Office as Mr. Trump met with the president of Colombia, inched him toward embracing a bipartisan border deal that fell far short of his demands for wall funding. But without a shutdown as leverage, he appeared to have little choice but to sign it if it clears Congress.On Capitol Hill, 17 negotiators rushed to turn the border compromise into voluminous legislation, while both Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, encouraged their troops to support it. The 1,159-page bill and a full report from negotiators were filed Wednesday minutes before midnight; the Senate is expected to vote on the measure on Thursday, followed by the House.Both leaders acknowledged that the legislation would not satisfy every member: The border security agreement deprives Mr. Trump and his Republican base of a victory on the wall, but it gives more money for border fencing and immigration detention than the left wing of the Democratic Party wanted.At least one of the negotiators did not sign off on the spending package: Representative Tom Graves, Republican of Georgia, who said on Twitter that he felt that he did not have enough time to review the details. He did not rule out voting for it.But with the effect of the last government shutdown — the longest in the nation’s history — still fresh, few were in the mood to risk another funding lapse.“As with all compromises, I say to people, ‘Support the bill for what is in it,’” Ms. Pelosi told reporters on Wednesday. “Don’t judge it for what is not in it. We have other days to pass other legislation.”Speaking on the Senate floor, Mr. McConnell said the outcome reflected “the way it goes in divided government” and warned against letting “unrelated cynical partisan plays get in the way of finishing this important process.”The compromise measure, assembled by senior members of both parties on Monday night, includes just $1.375 billion for new fencing along the border with Mexico, far short of the $5.7 billion Mr. Trump sought for a steel or concrete wall — and less than was included in the deal he rejected in December, which prompted the shutdown.But Mr. Trump got cover from a few allies in the conservative news media and the Senate, with some lawmakers making a point of selling the benefits of the agreement to the president.Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and one of the senior members who helped put together the compromise measure, said on Twitter that he spoke to Mr. Trump after signing off on the agreement.“He was in good spirits,” Mr. Shelby tweeted. “It’s a down payment on his border wall. This is only the beginning of a multi-year effort.”White House officials are still looking at how to allocate additional money for the president’s signature campaign promise, and have considered pulling from Army Corps of Engineers projects in California and Puerto Rico. But officials cautioned that nothing had been settled on.As of late Wednesday afternoon, lawmakers and aides were working to resolve lingering issues in the spending package, which includes funding for the Department of Homeland Security and six unfinished spending bills.Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas and one of the negotiators, said there were late discussions about where new fencing could be built in the Rio Grande Valley, to address local and environmental concerns, something White House officials pushed back against. Ultimately, the new barriers cannot be built in five areas, including the National Butterfly Center in Mission, Tex.A number of extensions, including a provision that would provide back pay to federal contractors deprived of payments during the last shutdown, will not be included in the package because bicameral leadership negotiations did not result in an agreement, according to a senior Democratic aide. A Republican Senate aide said party negotiators believed that back pay could be handled by the Office of Management and Budget without Congress’s involvement.The unfinished items also include an extension of the Violence Against Women Act, which is set to expire Friday.Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that the White House had not seen the legislative text of the deal, and when aides do, “we’ll be looking for land mines.”Most Democrats indicated they would support the legislation, even before the text was finished, in part because it would stave off another government shutdown and included Democratic priorities in the other six bills.Some of the priorities include a $1 billion increase for census funding, a $1.3 billion increase for housing programs and $500 million in funding for medical support, food and clothing for migrants in detention and alternatives to detention.Federal employees will also receive a 1.9 percent increase in pay, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, told reporters, noting that he and other members would most likely pursue a higher number in the future, along with other unaddressed immigration priorities.Other liberal lawmakers expressed concerns about the funding levels for the number of beds for detained immigrants and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which some had campaigned to abolish.“I’m trying to maintain an open mind, but I need details,” said Representative Veronica Escobar, a freshman Democrat whose district includes most of El Paso.“The barriers are going to be an issue,” she added, noting that she would prefer no funding for the Department of Homeland Security until it is audited.At least one legislator, Representative Juan Vargas, Democrat of California, said he would vote against the bill, criticizing the inclusion of new steel-post fencing.“I think most people just want to get this thing over with,” he said. “I’m not one of those people.”For some Democrats, the biggest issue is detention slots under the control of the Trump administration. The agreement authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to fund about 40,000 beds for detainees, many of them in centers run by for-profit companies and ICE near the border in Texas, Arizona and California.House Democratic aides described the language as a “glide path” from the current level of 49,000 detention beds to Obama-era levels of 35,000 or fewer.But a summary of the provisions drafted by Senate Republican staff members placed the average number of beds funded under the deal at a much higher number — 45,274, including 2,500 for families. And that could rise to as many as 58,500 beds, Republican aides asserted in internal communications, because federal cabinet departments have latitude in how they use funds.Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington and a leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said she was likely to vote no on the measure because of what she believed was a “lack of accountability around the detention system.”“We’ve reduced that number over the next nine months, but the average daily population that we’re appropriating is still too high,” she said. “Unless we have a guarantee from the administration that they’re actually going to listen to what Congress does and our appropriated amounts, we still have a president using every tool at his disposal.”But the lawmakers who said they were inclined to vote against the measure were not actively seeking support for their position.Under the complex funding formula in the agreement, the Department of Homeland Security would also have “reprogramming authority” to transfer as much as $750 million from other programs to detention slots.Democrats have argued that with a new House majority, they can provide harsher oversight than their Republican predecessors and push back on that maneuvering within the department and other federal agencies.“We’re intent on making sure that this process reflects the congressional intent of where they should be on barriers, on beds, on all these issues that matter to us,” said Representative Pete Aguilar, Democrat of California and one of the negotiators."
190,"WASHINGTON — The House voted on Tuesday to overturn President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency on the Mexican border, with just 13 Republicans joining Democrats to try to block his effort to divert funding to a border wall without congressional approval.House Republican leaders kept defections low after feverishly working to assuage concerns among rank-and-file members about protecting congressional powers and about the precedent that Mr. Trump could be setting for Democratic presidents to use for their own purposes.“Is your oath of office to Donald Trump or is it to the Constitution of the United States?” Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked her Republican colleagues in a speech on the floor ahead of the vote. “You cannot let him undermine your pledge to the Constitution.”The resolution of disapproval, which passed 245 to 182, must now be taken up by the Senate, where three Republicans have already declared their support, only one short of the number needed for Congress to ratify a stinging rebuke of Mr. Trump’s efforts.It remains highly unlikely that opponents will muster the votes to overturn a promised veto of the resolution. But final passage of a measure to assert Congress’s constitutional authority over spending is sure to bolster numerous lawsuits that maintain that Mr. Trump’s declaration is an unconstitutional end run around Congress’s lawful power of the purse.Many of the 13 Republicans who defected in the House were adamant in their arguments. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, a veteran lawmaker who once helped manage Republican efforts to remove Bill Clinton from the White House, made it clear he supported the border wall.But, he said, “insufficient action — however frustrating it may be — is still the prerogative of the legislative branch. It is imperative that no administration, Republican or Democratic, circumvent the will of Congress.”In the Senate, where lawmakers are required to vote on the resolution in the coming weeks, those concerns persisted. Even Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader and an open supporter of the declaration, declined to offer his opinion on the legal merits.“We’re in the process of weighing that,” Mr. McConnell said when asked at a news conference on Tuesday. “I haven’t reached a total conclusion.”“You can’t blame the president for trying to use whatever tool he thinks he has to address it,” he added.[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]But ahead of the Senate vote, lawmakers have not said what their next steps would be if the resolution to stop the emergency declaration fails.Three Republican senators — Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — have said that they will support the resolution, and several others have expressed extreme unease. Vice President Mike Pence and a Justice Department lawyer joined Republican senators on Tuesday for a lunch on Capitol Hill to outline what they maintained was the president’s statutory authority for the declaration and need for additional money.Mr. Pence faced some frustration from senators about Mr. Trump’s decision to make the declaration and the legal grounds for doing so, particularly from Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, according to three people familiar with the exchange who asked for anonymity to describe a private meeting.When Mr. Paul argued that Mr. Pence, a former representative, would have opposed Mr. Trump’s use of an emergency declaration and compared it to President Barack Obama’s use of an executive order to establish protections for young undocumented immigrants under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Mr. Pence objected, according to one person. He argued that there was a difference between the two uses of executive power, according to two people.A spokesman for Mr. Paul said that the senator had raised concerns, along with other senators, about the declaration in an exchange, but did not raise the comparison to DACA.Mr. McConnell acknowledged that there had been “a fulsome discussion” during the meeting, and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a close ally of the president, said he hoped that as a result of the discussion, “we will prevail.”But some senators emerged from the lunch still reluctant to say how they would vote.“Any action by the administration must comply with federal law, so I am reviewing and assessing the specific legal authorities and justifications put forth by the administration,” said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. “I am very worried about the slippery slope that could occur.”Some Republican lawmakers and aides said they were unconcerned because they were confident that they could prevent the two-thirds majority needed in both chambers to override a presidential veto, possibly the first delivered by Mr. Trump.“There will be nowhere near the votes to override a veto,” Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the Republican whip, said Tuesday morning at a news conference. “Ultimately, we’re going to stand with the president in making sure we can secure this border.”The resolution of disapproval, under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, serves as the easiest mechanism for Congress to end Mr. Trump’s declaration. House Democrats are still weighing the possibility of joining one of the lawsuits that have been filed to challenge the merits of the declaration.Democrats, who overwhelmingly endorsed the resolution of disapproval, framed the vote as an ultimatum on whether lawmakers would buck party loyalty in order to protect Congress’s constitutionally granted powers. Ms. Pelosi, in a floor speech on Tuesday, listed a number of instances in which House Republicans had objected to Mr. Obama’s use of executive power, vowing that “we are not going to give any president, Democratic or Republican, a blank check to shred the Constitution of the United States.”Representative Joaquin Castro called the vote on the one-page resolution “the most important vote, probably in a generation, on the separation of powers.”Mr. Castro, Democrat of Texas and the author of the resolution, warned Republicans that if the president’s declaration went unchallenged, the issue would resurface.“If Congress lets this stand, if the courts let it stand, how am I to tell a future president that gun deaths that number in the tens of thousands every year in this country, or opioid deaths that number in the thousands in this country, are not an emergency?” Mr. Castro said in a brief interview. “Or climate change is not a national emergency?”“If this becomes a short circuit to get other things done,” he added, “then how is a president not expected to use that tool in the future?”The debate over the merits of Mr. Trump’s national emergency declaration has led some lawmakers to suggest that Congress should re-evaluate how much power it has shifted to the executive branch and the scope of the National Emergencies Act.“The larger issue is Congress has delegated its authority to the White House in hundreds of instances,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. “I think we need to have a bigger conversation about the separation of powers and whether we want to continue to delegate all this authority to the next president.”Overruling concerns from other Republicans, Mr. Trump this month outlined his intent to use $3.6 billion from military construction projects to build his promised wall along the southwestern border. In the lunch with Mr. Pence and the Justice Department lawyer, Republican senators secured a promise that they would be notified about details of which military construction projects would be affected before they voted on the resolution, according to two people familiar with the discussion.Mr. Pence also assured senators that any money diverted from projects would most likely be replaced in the next year’s funding allocation, according to one person familiar with the discussion. While Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, later told reporters that he was confident that effort would be successful, Democratic appropriators would most likely object.House Democrats also pressed the Defense Department on Tuesday to release those details to Congress.“We fear that reprogramming funding intended for military construction projects and counterdrug activities will come at the expense of troop readiness and departmentwide efforts to address the military’s aging infrastructure,” wrote Representatives John Garamendi, Democrat of California, and Doug Lamborn, Republican of Colorado, both members of the House Armed Services Committee.Members of the House Appropriations Committee will hold a hearing on Wednesday to examine the effect of the declaration on military construction and readiness, and members of the House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on Thursday in part to examine Mr. Trump’s use of powers under the National Emergencies Act.“The Congress of the United States needs to have a spine, and not lay at the feet of the president,” said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader. “That’s not what the people elected us to do.”"
191,"President Trump wants $5.7 billion to build a wall at the southern border of the United States. Nancy Pelosi thinks a wall is “immoral.” The fight over these slats or barriers or bricks shut down the government for more than a month and may do so again if Mr. Trump isn’t satisfied with the way negotiations unfold over the next three weeks.But let’s be clear: This is a disagreement about symbolism, not policy. Liberals object less to aggressive border security than to the wall’s xenophobic imagery, while the administration openly revels in its political incorrectness. And when this particular episode is over, we’ll still have been fighting about the wrong thing. It’s true that immigrants will keep trying to cross into the United States and that global migration will almost certainly increase in the coming years as climate change makes parts of the planet uninhabitable. But technology and globalization are complicating the idea of what a border is and where it stands.Not long from now, it won’t make sense to think of the border as a line, a wall or even any kind of imposing vertical structure. Tearing down, or refusing to fund, border walls won’t get anyone very far in the broader pursuit of global justice. The borders of the future won’t be as easy to spot, build or demolish as the wall that Mr. Trump is proposing. That’s because they aren’t just going up around countries — they’re going up around us. And they’re taking away our freedom.In “The Jungle,” a play about a refugee camp in Calais, France, a Kurdish smuggler named Ali explains that his profession is not responsible for the large numbers of migrants making the dangerous journeys to Europe by sea. “Once, I was the only way a man could ever dream of arriving on your shore,” the smuggler says. But today, migrants can plan out the journeys using their phones. “It is not about this border. It’s the border in here,” Ali says, pointing to his head — “and that is gone, now.”President Trump is obsessed with his border wall because technology has freed us from the walls in our heads.For people with means and passports, it’s easy to plot exotic itineraries in a flash and book flights with just a glance at a screen. Social feeds are an endless stream of old faces in new places: a carefree colleague feeding elephants in Thailand; a smug college classmate on a “babymoon” in Tahiti; that awful ex hanging off a cliff in Switzerland; a friend’s parents enjoying retirement in New Zealand.Likewise, a young person in Sana, Yemen, or Guatemala City might see a sister in Toronto, a neighbor in Phoenix, an aunt in London or a teacher in Berlin, and think that he, too, could start anew. Foreign places are real. Another country is possible.If you zoom out enough in Google Earth, you’ll see the lines between nations begin to disappear. Eventually, you’ll be left staring at a unified blue planet. You might even experience a hint of what astronauts have called the “overview effect”: the sense that we are all on “Spaceship Earth,” together. “From space I saw Earth — indescribably beautiful with the scars of national boundaries gone,” recalled Muhammed Faris, a Syrian astronaut, after his 1987 mission to space. In 2012, Mr. Faris fled war-torn Syria for Turkey.One’s freedom of movement used to be largely determined by one’s citizenship, national origin and finances. That’s still the case — but increasingly, people are being categorized not just by the color of their passports or their ability to pay for tickets but also by where they’ve been and what they’ve said in the past.This is what is happening on that front already:A 2017 executive order barred people from seven countries, including five with Muslim majorities, from entering the country. An older rule put in place during the Obama administration compelled anyone who’d even just visited seven blacklisted nations to obtain additional clearance before traveling to the United States. Even as the Trump administration’s policy has met with legal challenges, it means that the barrier to entering the United States, for many, begins with their data and passport stamps, and is thousands of miles away from this country. The Trump administration would also like to make it harder for immigrants who’ve received public assistance to obtain citizenship or permanent residence by redefining what it means to be a “public charge.” If the administration succeeds, it will have moved the border into immigrants’ living rooms, schools  and hospital beds.The walls of the future go beyond one administration’s policies, though. They are growing up all around us, being built by global technology companies that allow for constant surveillance, data harvesting and the alarming collection of biometric information. In 2017, the United States announced it would be storing the social media profiles of immigrants in their permanent file, ostensibly to prevent Twitter-happy terrorists from slipping in. For years, Customs and Border Protection agents have asked travelers about their social media, too.The Electronic Frontier Foundation has said these practices can “chill and deter the free speech and association of immigrants to the United States, as well as the U.S. persons who communicate with them.” In other words, it’s no longer enough to have been born in the right place, at the right time, to the right parents. The trail of bread crumbs you leave could limit your movements.It’s possible to get a glimpse of where a digital border might lead from China. Look at its continuing experiment with social-credit scoring, where a slip of the tongue or an unpaid debt could one day jeopardize someone’s ability to board a train or apply for a job. When your keystrokes and text messages become embedded in your legal identity, you create a wall around yourself without meaning to.The Berkeley political theorist Wendy Brown diagnoses the tendency to throw up walls as a classic symptom of a nation-state’s looming impotence in the face of globalization — the flashy sports car of what she calls a “waning sovereignty.” In a recent interview for The Nation, Professor Brown told me that walls fulfill a desire for greater sovereign control in times when the concept of “bounded territory itself is in crisis.” They are signifiers of a “loss of a national ‘we’ and national control — all the things we’ve seen erupt in a huge way.” Walls are a response to deep existential anxiety, and even if the walls come down, or fail to be built in brick and stone, the world will guarantee us little in the way of freedom, fairness or equality. It makes more sense to think of modern borders as overlapping and concentric circles that change size, shape and texture depending on who — or what — is trying to pass through.It’s far too easy to imagine a situation where our freedom of movement still depends entirely on what has happened to us in the past and what kind of information we’re willing to give up in return. Consider the expedited screening process of the Global Entry Program for traveling to the United States. It’s a shortcut — reserved for people who can get it — that doesn’t do away with borders. It just makes them easier to cross, and therefore less visible.That serves the modern nation-state very well. Because in the end, what are borders supposed to protect us from? The answer used to be other states, empires or sovereigns. But today, relatively few land borders exist to physically fend off a neighboring power, and countries even cooperate to police the borders they share. Modern borders exist to control something else: the movement of people. They control us.Those are the walls we should be fighting over."
192,"This editorial was updated.With his declaration of a national emergency at the southern border, President Trump takes executive overreach to dizzying new heights. The damage to American democracy threatens to linger long after his administration is no more than a dank memory.Cornered into accepting a budget deal that lacked the $5.7 billion in border-wall funding he demanded, the president could not handle being labeled a loser by conservative commentators like Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity. His solution: Sign the bill while simultaneously declaring a national emergency that, at least in his mind, would allow him to shift funds and order the military to start building his wall.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, announced the move on Thursday afternoon. “President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action — including a national emergency — to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border,” she said. To repeat: The influx of migrant families at the southern border does not constitute a national security crisis, much less a bona fide emergency. There is, at this point, a worsening humanitarian crisis, actively fueled by the draconian policies of the administration. But the suffering on display requires thoughtful policy adjustments, not a steel monstrosity.Not that this is the end of this battle. Mr. Trump’s emergency declaration is destined to wind up in the courts, where it could get bogged down indefinitely. This fit of presidential pique is about more than a wall. It constitutes a reordering of the power dynamic between the branches of government. Mr. Trump aims to usurp one of Congress’s most basic responsibilities, the power of the purse.Confronted with this power grab, every lawmaker should be bellowing in alarm. Until recently, the threat of an “imperial presidency” was of grave constitutional concern to Republicans, who spent much of President Barack Obama’s tenure accusing him of misusing executive authority on, among other matters, immigration, health care and the environment.To their credit, a few Republican lawmakers have been warning against an emergency declaration for weeks. “I believe the president does have the legal authority — if you read the statute. I also think it would be a poor use of that authority,” Representative David Schweikert, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told Politico in January.Senator Marco Rubio was more emphatic. “If today the national emergency is border security, tomorrow the national emergency might be climate change.”The reaction of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to Mr. Trump’s intentions will do nothing to calm Republican jitters. “Just think of what a president with different values can present to the American people,” she observed. The poison cherry atop this sundae is that Mr. Trump is subverting American democracy for a cause opposed by a majority of the public. Polls show that most Americans do not want a wall at the southern border. And most definitely do not approve of Mr. Trump’s faking a national emergency to make an end run around Congress. Two recent polls showed that two-thirds of Americans opposed it.Not that any of this seems of interest to the president. “I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want,” he insisted to reporters last month, sounding more like a huffy kindergartner than a world leader.This administration is forever coming up with creative new ways to disturb and dismay the nation. Mr. Trump’s eagerness to undermine the Constitution to serve his short-term political gain remains among the most outrageous."
193,"Twenty-two days into the longest government shutdown ever, President Trump continued to press his case for a border wall. His tweet on Saturday was crammed with statistics that were either exaggerated or omitted important context. Immigrant prison populationMr. Trump’s figure for the percentage of unauthorized immigrants in federal prisons is exaggerated.Out of the Bureau of Prisons’ total inmate population of 183,058 in the first quarter of the 2018 fiscal year, 21 percent were immigrants, both legal and undocumented, according to a government report. At least 13 percent of the total population, or 23,826 inmates, were in the country unlawfully. The immigration status of another 11,698 inmates was under investigation, while 2,608 inmates were lawful immigrants or had received relief from deportation.The most common crimes committed by these immigrants were drug-related offenses (46 percent) and immigration offenses (29 percent). It’s worth noting, too, that about half of the arrests made by the federal government are for immigration-related offenses, perhaps explaining the high proportion of immigrants in federal prisons. The report acknowledges that it does not include data from state and local prisons, which house 90 percent of all inmates in the United States.Border arrestsMr. Trump did not give a time frame for his 240 percent figure, nor did he specify what the number referred to, which may give the misleading impression that border crossings overall have increased threefold. The figure instead refers to a surge in families attempting to cross at the southwest border. The number of family units apprehended at the border more than tripled from 8,120 in December 2017 to 27,518 in December 2018, overwhelming immigration officials and creating a new humanitarian crisis.Overall, illegal border crossings have been declining for nearly two decades, and in the 2017 fiscal year, border crossing apprehensions were at their lowest point since 1971. In the 2018 fiscal year, however, annual apprehensions did increase by 30 percent from the previous fiscal year.Immigrant criminals in TexasMr. Trump’s figures are accurate, but they need context. The Texas Department of Public Safety did report that the 186,000 unauthorized immigrants booked into local jails from 2011 to 2018 faced 292,000 charges.The caveats: These offenses did not necessarily occur during that eight-year time frame. More than half of these charges were uncategorized. And the charges Mr. Trump singled out did not always result in convictions (238 for homicide, 13,559 for assault, 1,689 for sexual assault and 1,280 for weapons).For comparison, data from the Texas Department of Public Safety shows that some 7.5 million arrests were made from 2010 to 2017 (data for 2018 was not yet available), including 6,161 for murder, 177,000 for aggravated assault, 14,000 for rape and nearly 89,000 for weapons charges. A 2018 study from the libertarian Cato Institute found that in Texas, conviction and arrest rates for illegal immigrants were lower than those for native-born Americans for most crimes."
194,"Good morning. Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead.1. The partial government shutdown is entering its third week.Negotiations between Vice President Mike Pence and congressional aides from both parties yielded little progress on Saturday. The two sides are scheduled to meet again this afternoon, but there is little reason to believe that President Trump’s demand for more than $5 billion for a wall at the southern border will be met anytime soon.The president’s fixation on a border wall, a favorite talking point since his campaign, has left him in a political box of his own making, our reporters write in a news analysis.If the partial shutdown continues a week longer, it will officially be the longest in U.S. history. Here’s a look at what is and isn’t affected by the shutdown.The government will remain partly shuttered until at least Tuesday, because both chambers of Congress are adjourned until then.Have you been keeping up with the headlines? Test your knowledge with our news quiz. And here’s the front page of our Sunday paper, the Sunday Review from Opinion, and our crossword puzzles.____2. The shutdown has lasted a full pay cycle for the 800,000 federal employees who are not working or working without pay. Here’s what the shutdown would look like if it happened in other industries.The workers affected range from people earning $100,000 a year to those making a quarter of that. Many are frustrated with the impasse. “They have to realize that this affects everyday people,” said a corrections officer at a federal prison in Florida.Native American tribes are also being hit hard by the shutdown. Their treaties with the U.S. government guarantee funding for services like health care and education, and the work is often done by tribal employees whose salaries rely on federal money, or by federal workers, some of whom are tribal citizens. Above, a patient at the Sault Tribe Health and Human Services in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.___3. The stalemate over the border wall is an early test of the new political dynamic in Washington, where Democrats have just taken control of the House for the first time in eight years.While Democrats capitulated on an immigration issue just a few days into a shutdown early last year, they are looking at a more favorable Senate map in 2020, and do not seem to think there’s as much political risk in standing firm against President Trump.Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, above, was elected speaker of the House on Thursday, making her second in line to the presidency after Vice President Mike Pence. We followed her rise from the well-mannered daughter of a Baltimore mayor to the highest-ranking woman in American political history.___4. The 2020 primary competition is underway, with Senator Elizabeth Warren now in the race and several other women likely to be contenders. Despite the so-called Year of the Woman and the midterm gains that followed, there’s a lingering worry among some Democrats about the risks of nominating a woman to take on President Trump. Above, Ms. Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, in Iowa.The Democratic primary is expected to draw an unusually large number of candidates. Our political correspondents look at who is likely to run and how timing changes everything.One potential candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, is now dealing with accusations that women working on his 2016 presidential campaign were sexually harassed and paid less than men.____5. Investors received good news on Friday: The Labor Department reported one of the strongest months of job gains in a decade, with employers adding 312,000 jobs in December. And wages, which for months only inched up, have begun to increase more quickly.Stocks rose after the Labor Department announcement, and picked up even more after Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, acknowledged the market’s concerns about rising interest rates and said the Fed would remain flexible in the face of market turbulence and signs that the global economy is slowing.____6. His family says he is a Marine Corps veteran who was in Moscow to attend a wedding. The Russian authorities have accused him of being a spy.Whatever the truth, Paul Whelan, 48, above, an American arrested in Russia last month, has become the latest pawn between Russia and the U.S. as rising tensions recall the Cold War years.Mr. Whelan also has British, Canadian and Irish citizenship, officials said Friday. Former American officials said Russia might have miscalculated by picking a fight not just with the U.S., but with a larger part of the international community.____7. For the first time in 16 years, Apple reduced its revenue expectations, citing poor iPhone sales in China. It was the clearest confirmation yet that the Chinese economy is in serious trouble. “Apple is a bellwether,” said a chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.Elsewhere in the business world, Tesla reported a record quarter on Wednesday and announced it was cutting prices of all models by $2,000. Investors responded with a sell-off.And driverless cars in Arizona are under literal attack by residents who, for a variety of reasons, don’t want the vehicles roaming around their neighborhoods.____8. China opened a “new chapter” in space exploration on Thursday, landing a vehicle on the far side of the moon for the first time in history, the country’s space agency announced. Above, an image taken by the rover, called Chang’e-4 after the moon goddess in Chinese mythology.Earlier in the week, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft made its flyby of the most distant object ever visited: a small, icy world nicknamed Ultima Thule. The team will have to wait 20 months for all of the spacecraft’s data and images to return to Earth, but here’s what we know — and have seen — so far.____9. When someone commits a crime, the police in New York City can have a victim or witness scroll through hundreds of mug shots matching the perpetrator’s description, in hopes the culprit is among them.But these open-ended photo searches can increase the likelihood of ensnaring an innocent person, and many other large police departments say they don’t rely on the technique.St. Clair Steward, above, was jailed for more than two months after a victim picked him from his mug shot, the 31st that he was shown. His case was dismissed after a DNA sample from the crime scene did not match his.____10.

195,"SAN ANTONIO — Donald J. Trump got Brenda Hernandez’s hopes up in 2016 when he indicated that he had a heart for young undocumented immigrants like her, who were brought into the country by their parents. But her hopes were dashed when Mr. Trump became president and ordered an end to the federal program known as DACA that shields her from deportation.After the president’s latest announcement on Saturday — that he was proposing to end the standoff over the partial government shutdown by, among other things, temporarily extending that shield — Ms. Hernandez just shrugged.“I don’t trust Trump — I don’t believe him,” she said as she hoisted her 3-year-old son onto a swivel chair at the D & H Beauty Salon in San Antonio. The blue-collar shop, with rows of wooden chairs in the waiting area, is a favorite among immigrants in the city. But in the hours after Mr. Trump’s White House address, his latest offer of an immigration deal was finding little support.[Read: In Trump’s Immigration Announcement, A Compromise Snubbed All Around]In exchange for $5.7 billion to erect a barrier along the border with Mexico, Mr. Trump said he would agree to extend protection for three years for the roughly 800,000 immigrants who benefit from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which covers people brought into the country illegally as children. The president held out the hope of similar relief for 300,000 immigrants living in the United States with temporary protected status, known as T.P.S., after fleeing earthquakes and other disasters in their own countries.“I am here today to break the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward to end the government shutdown and solve the crisis along the southern border,” Mr. Trump said, calling his offer “a common-sense compromise both parties can embrace.”But many of the clients waiting their turn for a $6 haircut or shave at the D & H salon, in a strip mall in the northern part of the city, greeted Mr. Trump’s announcement with skepticism, if not downright indifference. Most expressed deep reservations about a border wall, deeming it a waste of money.Eliseo Castillo, 60, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, said an extension of DACA’s protections from deportation, and its offer of work permits, could benefit his 26-year-old son. He said his son had relied on the program for years to get a driver’s license and a job and to live without the fear that even a minor misstep, like driving with a broken taillight, could land him in deportation proceedings.But Mr. Castillo, a construction contractor who relies on a steady flow of workers from Latin America, said he wondered what would happen to his business if a reinforced border wall halted the flow of workers. He said he is already having trouble hiring enough laborers.“The fact is, there is not an American who wants to mix cement, do carpentry and heavy work,” said Mr. Castillo, who employs 18 people to lay down foundations for houses in San Antonio’s expansive subdivisions.Mr. Castillo, who wears cowboy boots and bluejeans and keeps his silver hair in a braid, has called Texas home since the 1980s. But he harbors no illusions about legalizing his status, at least as long as Mr. Trump holds the highest office in the land.Waiting his turn for a haircut in paint-splattered trousers that gave away how he earns his living, Jose Ramos, 63, a naturalized American born in Mexico, said he had no faith that Mr. Trump, whose “favorite sport is blaming immigrants for everything, which is not right,” would ever keep his word.“This isn’t a deal,” Mr. Ramos said. “Trump is just offering to give back what he already took away.”Democrats in Washington have criticized the president for offering to extend DACA and T.P.S. protections, when it was he who had ordered those protections revoked. Some have called the offer a nonstarter because it did not include any long-term solutions, like a path to permanent legal status or citizenship for DACA recipients, who are known as Dreamers.But many people in San Antonio never had much faith that such solutions were even possible with Mr. Trump as president.Indeed, some in the city wonder how much the president knows about the border.Speaking with reporters on Saturday, Mr. Trump cited the city as a place that had benefited from building a border barrier. “You look at San Antonio, you look at so many different places, they go from one of the most unsafe cities in the country to one of the safest cities, immediately, immediately,” he said.But San Antonio is 150 miles from the border, and has no wall.Alicia Alaniz, 47, the stylist working at station 7 in the salon, rolled her eyes and said that the only thing she could agree with in Mr. Trump’s statement was the notion that the immigration system was “broken.”“We need immigration reform — it would benefit the country and everyone who lives here,” said Ms. Alaniz, a legal permanent resident who emigrated from Mexico. People just want to work the right way, and support this country that has brought them many blessings.”President Obama introduced DACA in June 2012 as a temporary reprieve for young unauthorized immigrants, at a time when Congress was in a stalemate over immigration policy. To qualify for DACA protection, immigrants must have lived in the United States for much of their lives and meet certain other requirements, like passing a background check and completing high school.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed to eliminate any program that Mr. Obama had created by executive action, including DACA, a stance that generated deep anxiety among the Dreamers.But in December 2016, shortly after winning election, Mr. Trump softened his position.“We’re going to work something out that’s going to make people happy and proud,” he told Time magazine. “They got brought here at a very young age, they’ve worked here, they’ve gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they’re in never-never land because they don’t know what’s going to happen.”Once in office, however, Mr. Trump appointed one of the fiercest opponents of the DACA program, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, as his attorney general. Mr. Sessions rescinded DACA in September 2017, but the action was challenged in court and has yet to take full effect, while the courts decide the program’s fate.Without work permits provided under the program, young immigrants would face cascading, and possibly dire, consequences: They would lose their jobs, driver’s licenses and the chance to attend college at in-state tuition rates.Friday was the last day the Supreme Court could accept an appeal and schedule any arguments on the DACA litigation in its current session, and the court let the day pass without addressing the Trump administration’s bid to kill the program. That ensures that DACA will survive at least until the court’s next session, which begins in October.When the administration made its bid to end the program, “I worried about what I would do; I was so sad,” said Ms. Hernandez, who works these days for a casual dining chain known as Zoe’s Kitchen. But with the issue tied up in the courts, she said she has simply had to get on with her life. “Now, I don’t even think about it,” she said.Her DACA permit expires in a year."
196,"Update: Steve King was removed from his committee assignments over the comments made in this article. Years before President Trump forced a government shutdown over a border wall, triggering a momentous test of wills in Washington, Representative Steve King of Iowa took to the House floor to show off a model of a 12-foot border wall he had designed.And long before Mr. Trump demonized immigrants — accusing Mexico of exporting criminals and calling for an end to birthright citizenship — Mr. King turned those views into talking points, with his use of misleading data about victims of undocumented immigrants and demeaning remarks about Latinos.Immigration is Mr. Trump’s go-to issue, his surest connection to his most faithful supporters, and his prime-time address on Tuesday night underscored his willingness to use fear and misleading statements  to appeal to voters — just as he did with warnings about a migrant caravan before the midterm elections.The Republican Party hadn’t always intended to go this route: Officials tried for years to come up with broad-based immigration reform that would appeal to growing numbers of Latino voters. But Mr. Trump’s preoccupation with the wall and anti-immigrant politics reflects how he has embraced the once-fringe views of Mr. King, who has used racist language in the past, promotes neo-Nazis on Twitter and was recently denounced by one Republican leader as a white supremacist.With the federal government in a third week of paralysis over a border wall, Mr. Trump’s positions are a reminder of how Mr. King’s ideology and his language maligning undocumented residents helped shape the Republican message in 2016 and 2018 and define Mr. Trump’s agenda and prospects for re-election. Mr. King may have been ostracized by some Republicans over his racist remarks and extremist ties, but as much of the nation debates immigration, his views now carry substantial influence on the right.Early in Mr. Trump’s term, the president invited Mr. King — who was long snubbed by establishment Republicans like the former House speaker John A. Boehner — to the Oval Office. There, the president boasted of having raised more money for the congressman’s campaigns than anyone else, including during a 2014 Iowa visit, Mr. King recalled in an interview with The Times.“Yes, Mr. President,” Mr. King replied. “But I market-tested your immigration policy for 14 years, and that ought to be worth something.”Mr. King, a 69-year-old former bulldozer operator with a combative manner, who has been elected nine times, helped write the book on white identity politics that are ascendant in Mr. Trump’s Republican Party. That provides both a template for Mr. Trump and a warning.Mr. King’s full-throated embrace of nativism has long found a supportive constituency in the rural Midwest, the region that was a key to Mr. Trump’s 2016 victory and represents his most likely path to re-election.But at the same time, Mr. King’s margin of victory in 2018 shrank to its narrowest in 16 years. He made national headlines for endorsing a Toronto mayoral candidate with neo-Nazi ties and for meeting with a far-right Austrian party accused of trivializing the Holocaust. On Twitter, he follows an Australian anti-Semitic activist, who proposed hanging a portrait of Hitler “in every classroom.” And in October, the chairman of the Republican House elections committee, Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, condemned Mr. King, saying, “We must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms.” Mr. King lost corporate agriculture donors like Purina, Land O’Lakes and Smithfield. He dropped from an 18-point lead over his Democratic opponent in his internal polls to barely squeaking out a three-point win on Election Day. On Wednesday, Mr. King drew a formidable challenger for his Fourth District seat in the 2020 Republican primary: Randy Feenstra, an assistant majority leader in the State Senate, who said Mr. King had left Iowa “without a seat at the table” because of “sideshows” and “distractions.’’Mr. King, in the interview, said he was not a racist. He pointed to his Twitter timeline showing him greeting Iowans of all races and religions in his Washington office. (The same office once displayed a Confederate flag on his desk.)At the same time, he said, he supports immigrants who enter the country legally and fully assimilate because what matters more than race is “the culture of America” based on values brought to the United States by whites from Europe.“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” Mr. King said. “Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?”After this article was published Thursday, Mr. King issued a public statement calling himself a “nationalist” and defending his support of “western civilization’s values,” and said he was not an advocate for “white nationalism and white supremacy.” “I want to make one thing abundantly clear: I reject those labels and the evil ideology they define,” he wrote.Mr. King’s influence over national politics derives from his representation of the reddest district in the first presidential nominating state. Nearly all the 2016 Republican presidential contenders sought his blessing at a forum he hosted in Des Moines in January 2015, Mr. Trump included.“Donald Trump came to Iowa as a real nonideological candidate,” Mr. King recalled. Mr. Trump’s first hire in Iowa, Chuck Laudner, was a former chief of staff to Mr. King. Mr. Trump’s first Iowa rally directly followed a visit to the Mexican border.The previous year, Mr. Trump had visited to endorse Mr. King’s re-election. As the congressman warned of scenarios like Islamic State terrorists or even Africans with ebola illegally entering the country, Mr. Trump listened and nodded. When he stepped to the microphone, he echoed Mr. King.“Well, border security is a very big issue,” he said. “People are just flooding across.”Tom Tancredo, a former Colorado congressman who once held the most conservative views in official Washington on immigration, calling for a moratorium on even legal immigrants, said he “handed the baton to Steve King” when he left the House in 2008.David Johnson, a former Republican state senator from Mr. King’s district, said he heard in the president’s rhetoric a direct echo of Mr. King. “They belong to the same subset of white nationalists who are afraid of how the country is changing,” he said.Mr. King was born in Storm Lake, Iowa, and attended high school in nearby Denison, then a nearly all-white rural farming region, where his father managed a state police radio station.After founding an earth-moving company, Mr. King ran successfully for the State Senate in 1996. His most notable legacy from six years in the Legislature was a law making English the official state language. It was a time when packinghouses and other agricultural employers had dropped wages, and Latino migrants increasingly were taking jobs that no longer attracted native-born Iowans.Elected to Congress in 2002, Mr. King attracted the attention of hate-watch groups like the Anti-Defamation League as he spoke increasingly about preserving “Western culture” or “Western civilization.” The groups consider those buzzwords that signal support to white nationalists, along with an obsession with birthrates and abortion rates among different ethnic groups.“He uses the concepts of either ‘culture’ or ‘civilization’ to obfuscate that he’s talking about whiteness and race,” said Lawrence Rosenthal, chairman of the Berkeley Center for Right-Wing Studies.In 2011, Mr. King objected to the Affordable Care Act’s mandate to cover contraception. “That’s not constructive to our culture and our civilization,” he said in a speech in the House. “If we let our birthrate get down below the replacement rate, we’re a dying civilization.”Mr. King seems further emboldened during the Trump presidency.In an interview in August with a far-right web publication in Austria, Mr. King displayed a deep familiarity with racist tracts and ideas embraced by white supremacists.He spoke of “the Great Replacement,” a conspiracy theory on the far right that claims shadowy elites are working behind the scenes to reduce white populations to minorities in their own countries.“Great replacement, yes,” Mr. King said in the interview. “These people walking into Europe by ethnic migration, 80 percent are young men.”The accusation that a “great replacement” of whites is underway — which conspiracy theorists often link to prominent Jews like George Soros — animated the torch-carrying white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017, who chanted, “You will not replace us” and “Jews will not replace us.”Mr. Trump’s refusal to condemn the marchers, and his insistence that there were “very fine people on both sides,” was cheered by neo-Nazi websites.In Mr. King’s interview with the Austrian website, he repeated his yearslong critique of multiculturalism.“What does this diversity bring that we don’t already have? Mexican food. Chinese food,” he said. “Those things, well, that’s fine, but what does it bring that we don’t have that is worth the price?”In recent years, Mr. King has forged alliances with far-right European leaders, including Marine Le Pen of France and Geert Wilders of the Netherlands, one of the most anti-Muslim politicians in Europe, who calls for closing mosques.Ahead of Dutch elections in March 2017, Mr. King endorsed Mr. Wilders in a tweet, saying, “We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.”Amid an ensuing controversy, he claimed the tweet wasn’t about race. Virulent white supremacists, however, heard otherwise.“Steve King is basically an open white nationalist at this point,” wrote Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer.Mr. Anglin and others celebrated that Mr. Trump’s election had made once-fringe beliefs about ethnonationalism acceptable to mainstream politicians.As Republicans have morphed from the party of George W. Bush, who sought legal status for 12 million undocumented immigrants, to the party of Mr. Trump and Mr. King, some party leaders fear for the future in a nation where Hispanic voters are a rapidly growing electorate.“Great damage has been done,” said Carlos Curbelo, a moderate Republican who lost a South Florida congressional seat in the midterms. “For anyone who cares about having a small-government, free-enterprise party in America that can aspire to win national elections, it’s a real concern.”Mr. Curbelo, who tried to forge compromise on immigration in the House last year, said Mr. Trump told him privately, including on Air Force One, that he wanted a deal with Democrats.But the president is paralyzed by the far right, Mr. Curbelo said. “He’s terrified of losing his base and the so-called conservative media.”Last week, as the new Congress was sworn in, Mr. King sat on his side of a chamber sharply delineated by demographics. The Democratic majority included record numbers of African-Americans and women, including the first Native American and the first Muslim women. Mr. King’s side was mostly people who look like him.“You could look over there and think the Democratic Party is no country for white men,” he said."

198,"LAS VEGAS — Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke said Sunday that his personal use and ownership of firearms taught him the responsibility of having guns and can help bridge politically fraught discussions about gun control in the U.S.The former Texas congressman told The Associated Press in an interview Sunday in Las Vegas that he inherited guns belonging to his great uncle, who had taught him how to shoot and handle a firearm responsibly. He says he and his wife, Amy, who grew up on a New Mexico ranch and used guns, made sure their children also knew how to safely handle guns.""Not only are they proficient, they also understand the responsibility that comes with using or owning a firearm,"" he said.O'Rourke, speaking at a coffee shop 5 miles (8 kilometers) away from the site of a 2017 mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip, said he'd like to use his personal experience and the traditions of gun ownership in his home state of Texas to ""lead the country on sensible gun safety policy"" that reduces violence.""It is not a politically easy thing to talk about, but I think if we talk about it from experience, out of pride and responsible gun ownership and ensuring that weapons of war are kept on the battlefield and they're not used in our schools and concerts and communities, we'll save a lot more lives and will do nothing to infringe upon any American's Second Amendment rights,"" he said.He has called for universal background checks, a federal assault weapons ban, the closing of loopholes that allow someone to purchase a gun before their background check is completed and a ban on bump stocks, the device used by the Las Vegas shooter to mimic a fully automatic weapon.The El Paso native is on a two-day swing through Nevada, an early Western caucus state with a significant Latino population. At packed gatherings in living rooms, a coffee shop and a Mexican restaurant, O'Rourke praised the role immigrants play in his hometown and in America and occasionally switched to Spanish as he addressed bilingual members of the audience. Before speaking inside the coffee shop, he climbed on top of his rental van and spoke to dozens waiting outside who couldn't fit in the building.As he spoke to an AP reporter, he was repeatedly stopped by people who wished him well and asked to take a picture, which he always obliged. One man brought him a copy of a newspaper with O'Rourke's picture on it and introduced the candidate to his dog.O'Rourke, who has called for legalizing marijuana, said he has not yet visited one of Nevada's legal marijuana dispensaries to see what legalization looks like in practice, but he would like to do so.The three-term congressman also said he doesn't have enough experience with the debate over decriminalizing sex work to give an intelligent answer on whether prostitution should be legalized — as it is in Nevada — but that he'd like to talk to those involved about it, including the sex workers.O'Rourke has been striking a more centrist message than some of the candidates in the field.The Republican National Committee said in a statement Sunday that his policies, like an embrace of the ""Green New Deal"" climate change plan and a past call to tear down the U.S.-Mexico border wall, show he ""is on a collision course with everyday Americans who will reject his extremist views that offer no substance or solution.""As he's conducted a marathon tour of early voting and swing states in recent days, O'Rourke has told voters he wants to bring people together and highlighted his plans to visit areas where voters strongly supported President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.O'Rourke said he thinks he understands the reasoning behind the Democratic National Committee's move to bar Fox News from hosting any Democratic presidential debates, saying it would avoid rewarding a network that has ""functionally been a partner to President Trump and his administration, stoking paranoia and fear and anxiety, trafficking in some of the bitterness and meanness and smallness that defines so much of this administration and frankly our national politics.""But O'Rourke said it makes sense to speak to Americans where they are, on whatever news they watch. He said he feels there are some responsible journalists at the network, has appeared on the network and would do so again.___"
199,"WASHINGTON — Democrats, transitioning into the House majority, have quietly sent dozens of letters in recent weeks seeking documents and testimony from President Trump’s businesses, his campaign and his administration, setting the table for investigations that could reach the center of his presidency.Clear targets have emerged in the process, and some others appear to have fallen away, at least for now. Family separation and detention policies at the border have jumped to the forefront. So has the acting attorney general’s oversight of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. But Democrats, after slamming House Republicans for their inadequate inquiry, do not plan to reopen a full-scale Russian interference investigation. They have also chosen to hold off on an immediate request for Mr. Trump’s tax returns.For eager liberals coming off two years of Republican oversight paralysis, the next few weeks may feel something like a game of hurry up and wait. Arranging witnesses and wrangling sensitive government documents take time, and most House committees have yet to be populated with lawmakers, not to mention much of the legion of lawyers who will do a lot of the work of investigations. The Intelligence Committee did not technically have a chairman until last week.“Those people who are expecting some kind of Hollywood movie here are going to be disappointed because it is going be very orderly,” said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut and a senior member of the Intelligence Committee.Here is what Democrats will focus on first.The impasse over Mr. Trump’s proposed border wall and the death late last month of an 8-year-old boy from Guatemala in United States custody have catapulted the administration’s divisive policies at the border to the top of House Democrats’ agenda. Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the Judiciary Committee chairman, and a handful of other chairmen plan to examine immigration policies.Their interest and detailed questions could prove problematic for Mr. Trump’s efforts to make a case for his border wall, shining a light on gaps in the current policy and trying to highlight the human toll on migrants.“We are calling on D.H.S. to preserve any and all evidence related to these horrible incidents,” the chairmen wrote. “We as a country can and must do better.”Mr. Nadler has already invited Matthew G. Whitaker, the acting attorney general, to be the committee’s first public hearing witness, and indicated on Wednesday that he would subpoena Mr. Whitaker if necessary to compel an appearance before the end of the month. Democrats are intent on pressing Mr. Whitaker on his involvement in the ousting of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, his role in the oversight of the special counsel investigation and other policy matters, including the administration’s decision not to defend the Affordable Care Act in a lawsuit brought by Republican state attorneys general.Mr. Nadler has indicated that he intends to wait for Mr. Mueller to conclude his work before seriously considering an impeachment inquiry — a prospect weighing heavily on Democrats that could swamp other oversight efforts. But he said in December that the committee would begin investigating facts presented by federal prosecutors that strongly point to Mr. Trump’s involvement in hush-money payments just before the 2016 election to two women who claim to have had affairs with him, a violation of campaign finance law. They will also look at what Democrats view as “improper” communications between the president and federal law enforcement.After seething over Republican use of the House Intelligence Committee to turn an investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election into an attempt to discredit the president’s investigators, Democrats plan to quickly flip the lens back on to Mr. Trump and his campaign itself. But the panel’s leaders have cautioned that their approach will be narrower than once predicted.“We are conscious of the fact that the Senate continues to do their work, Mueller continues to do his work, and at this point in the game, I would not expect the committee to announce an omnibus investigation,” Mr. Himes said. “The time has passed for that.”Instead, Democrats will initially pursue at least two questions — one discreet, the other potentially very complicated — that Republicans in control of the committee would not touch. The panel’s new chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said it was initiating a request for phone records of the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., to clarify whom he called while arranging a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan between members of the Trump campaign and a Russian lawyer. Phone records already in the hands of congressional investigators show a call was placed to a blocked number, and Donald Trump Jr. told investigators that he did not remember who he had called. Democrats believe the blocked number may have belonged to his father, and could prove that the president had prior knowledge of the Russian offer to share dirt on his opponent, Hillary Clinton.The committee would also like to request financial records related to Mr. Trump’s dealings with Russia and other foreign powers. Intelligence Committee Democrats appear to be circling around two well-known but still mysterious transactions: Mr. Trump’s sale of a Palm Beach, Fla., mansion to a Russian oligarch in 2008 and loans to the Trump Organization from Deutsche Bank.In the real estate case, Mr. Trump bought a Palm Beach estate for $41 million in 2004 and, only four years later, amid a national housing crisis, sold it to the Russian billionaire, Dmitry Rybolovlev, for $95 million. Democrats say the deal stinks of potential money laundering. Loans from Deutsche Bank — hundreds of millions of dollars extended by a bank later accused in an unrelated case of laundering Russian money during a time when few other major banks would lend to Mr. Trump’s businesses — also raise concerns that Russia could have financial leverage over the president.Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee, under Representative Maxine Waters of California, have also been asking questions about the Deutsche loans since early 2017, and plan to press their investigation ahead with the full powers of the majority.Democrats are prepared to subpoena the records if necessary. Mr. Schiff said staff had already begun informal conversations with institutions, potential witnesses and their lawyers about records requests, but because the panel has not technically been appointed yet, formal requests must wait — most likely until the end of January.Mr. Schiff declined to name specific witnesses except Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer who has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the Trump Organization’s dealings with Russia and to buying the silence of two women who say they had affairs with Mr. Trump.Democrats tried more than a dozen times over the past two years to obtain Mr. Trump’s tax returns. But now that they finally have the opportunity to do so — thanks to an obscure 1920s tax code provision — the relevant Democratic committee chairman appears to be in no rush.In an effort to parry Republican accusations of overreach, the House Ways and Means chairman, Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, has decided instead to try to first build a public case for why the returns ought to become public before he lodges a formal request. He plans to convene a hearing this month focused on presidential tax returns in conjunction with sweeping anticorruption legislation that includes language requiring all presidents and candidates to make their returns public.Ultimately, Mr. Neal and Democrats do not need new laws. Sometime after the hearings — probably in February — Mr. Neal plans to invoke Section 6103 in the tax code, which allows chairmen of the House and Senate tax writing committees to request from the Treasury Department tax returns or related information on any tax filer. In theory, committee investigators could then privately study the returns for any compromising or illegal financial dealings. The committee would have to vote to make any of the information public.Whether the administration will put up a fight remains unclear. Mr. Trump has said publicly that he does not care if Democrats pursue the documents; Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has said he will defer to legal counsel. There is, however, scant precedent for this particular case: Mr. Trump is the first president or major presidential candidate in decades to refuse to release his returns.Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee, had a stern and straightforward message when he sent off 51 oversight letters to cabinet secretaries and Trump Organization lawyers shortly before Christmas: Consider this “a basic first step” and not a voluntary one.As he stands up the House’s marquee investigative committee, Mr. Cummings has deliberately chosen to begin with targets that Republicans once agreed should be studied, but failed to follow up on. They include records related to the administration’s response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which devastated American territories in the Caribbean; Ivanka Trump’s use of a private email account for government business; the use of government jets for personal travel; misconduct by the former Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt; and the Flint, Mich., water crisis.Laying the groundwork to look for potential violations of the Constitution’s emoluments clause, which bans payments from foreign governments to federal officeholders, he wrote to the Trump Organization requesting documents related to the company’s procedures for identifying foreign payments. In each, Mr. Cummings said he expected the documents by Friday.  Subpoenas could follow if they are not produced. But much of the committee’s investigative work is likely to remain private in the coming weeks. Other targets appear to be imminent. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, said she and Mr. Cummings agreed they would study what she called the Trump administration’s attempts to manipulate the 2020 census for political gain.“Our whole democracy is based on representation,” Ms. Maloney said, “and if there is a conscious effort to undercount representation, that is an attack fundamentally on our democracy.” "
200,"To the Editor:Re “Asking for Unity, Trump Renews Bid for Border Wall” (front page, Feb. 6):President Trump delivered a speech that was more showmanship than a serious discussion of the state of the nation and of his proposals to solve the problems that confront us. News outlets almost universally analyzed the speech from a political perspective. Commentators pondered the effect on the president’s base, women and other demographic groups. Much time was spent analyzing what drew applause and from whom.The current president and his recent predecessors have turned the State of the Union into a campaign rally featuring a laundry list of hot-button issues, repeating well-worn talking points. They introduce too many guests chosen to illustrate these talking points and to draw mandatory applause. They fail to use it for serious consideration of issues and for making realistic legislative proposals. And the length of these speeches taxes attention spans.If the presidents do not change the tenor of these speeches to make them more inspiring and meaningful, we should consider Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s suggestion that the State of the Union report be delivered in writing.William F. WerwaissNew YorkTo the Editor:President Trump’s call for $500 million to fight childhood cancer was greeted with deservedly loud applause. Does it not occur to anyone that he wants more than 10 times that amount for his wall? Here’s a deal we can all live with: $5.7 billion to fight childhood cancer, and $500 million for the wall. That way Mr. Trump can say he got money for the wall, and we can get our priorities straight in this country.John M. ImperialeHarvey Cedars, N.J.To the Editor:I cannot be the only person who found President Trump’s State of the Union address simply rehashed rhetoric. How many times do we have to hear his horror story version of what goes on at our southern border? Not surprisingly, the president’s speech lacked any mention of voting rights, sensible gun control or climate change. Perhaps an hour and 22 minutes wasn’t enough time.Stacey Abrams, however, in giving the Democratic response, addressed those missed issues and a lot more, and did it in under 15 minutes. As a bonus, she was passionate, wholly engaged and inspiring.Ms. Abrams, who lost a contentious battle for governor of Georgia and is not a member of Congress, was well chosen to give the Democratic response. She did an extraordinary job. Her belief in an America shaped by all of us together was in sharp contrast to the president’s self-glory-filled rhetoric. Patricia WellerEmmitsburg, Md.To the Editor:Speaker Nancy Pelosi showed her disrespectful attitude for all Americans to see Tuesday night. Could you imagine what the media would have done if a Republican had sat up there behind President Barack Obama making scowl faces and looking at papers all night? Wayne TaralsonSioux Falls, S.D.To the Editor:Re “Where’s the Unity, Mr. Trump?” (editorial, Feb. 6):The lofty goals put forth in President Trump’s State of the Union speech, even surrounded by anodyne patriotic themes and military reminiscences, will be going nowhere fast in terms of legislation and action under a president who has no idea how to work with Congress, especially a divided one.We must continue to express our disapproval of this administration but also need to forge ahead ourselves to achieve change. As your editorial said, “the wisest course for citizens interested in a stronger union is to focus on building it themselves.”Speak up! Speak out! And vote! D.I.Y., America!Nancy SellarNew York"

202,"President Trump delivered an address to the nation on Tuesday night from the Oval Office to make a broad-based public push for border wall funding.After his speech, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leaders, delivered a response from Capitol Hill.[Read our live analysis and fact checks of the remarks here.]The following are transcripts of both Mr. Trump’s speech and the Democratic rebuttal, as prepared by The New York Times.__________PRESIDENT TRUMP: My fellow Americans, tonight I’m speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.Every day, Customs and Border Protection agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country. We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country. America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation, but all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration.It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans. Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl. Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone. Ninety percent of which floods across from our southern border. More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we don’t act right now.This is a humanitarian crisis. A crisis of the heart, and a crisis of the soul. Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system.This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border. This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end. My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers. It’s a tremendous problem.Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the Department of Homeland Security. These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe. In fact, safer than ever before.The proposal from homeland security includes cutting edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband and many other things. We have requested more agents, immigration judges to process the sharp rise of unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy.Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support. Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home.Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier. At the request of Democrats it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It’s also what our professionals at the border want and need. This is just common sense.The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year. Vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress. The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.Senator Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other Democrats. They changed their mind only after I was elected president.Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis and they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation.The federal government remains shut down for one reason, and one reason only, because Democrats will not fund border security. My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation, but the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government.This situation could be solved in a 45 minute meeting. I have invited congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done. Hopefully we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes? They don’t build walls because they hate the people on the outside but because they love the people on the inside. The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized.America’s heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien, just came across the border. The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country. Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders.In California, an air force veteran was raped, murdered, and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history. In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor. In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl.Over the last several years I have met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration. I have held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief stricken fathers. So sad, so terrible. I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, and the sadness gripping their souls. How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask, imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken. To every member of Congress: pass a bill that ends this crisis. To every citizen, call Congress, and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border.This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve. When I took the oath of office, I swore to protect our country and that is what I will always do so help me god.Thank you and good night.__________SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI: Good evening.I appreciate the opportunity to speak directly to the American people tonight about how we can end this shutdown and meet the needs of the American people. Sadly much of what we heard from President Trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice. The president has chosen fear. We want to start with the facts.The fact is on the very first day of this Congress, House Democrats passed Senate Republican legislation to reopen government and fund smart, effective border security solutions. But the president is rejecting these bipartisan bills which would reopen government over his obsession with forcing American taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective wall, a wall he always promised Mexico would pay for.The fact is, President Trump has chosen to hold hostage critical services for the health, safety, and well-being of the American people, and withhold the paychecks of 800,000 innocent workers across the nation, many of them veterans.He promised to keep the government shutdown for months or years, no matter whom it hurts. That’s just plain wrong. The fact is, we all agree we need to secure our borders while honoring our values. We can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry. We can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation. We can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border. We can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings.The fact is, the women and children at the border are not a security threat. They are a humanitarian challenge, a challenge that President Trump’s own cruel and counterproductive policies have only deepened. And the fact is, President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage and stop manufacturing a crisis, and must reopen the government.Thank you. Leader Schumer.SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: Thank you, Speaker Pelosi.My fellow Americans, we address you tonight for one reason only. The president of the United States, having failed to get Mexico to pay for his ineffective, unnecessary border wall, and unable to convince the Congress or the American people to foot the bill, has shut down the government.American democracy doesn’t work that way. We don’t govern by temper tantrum. No president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down. Hurting millions of Americans who are treated as leverage.Tonight, and throughout this debate and throughout his presidency, president trump has appealed to fear, not facts. Division, not unity. Make no mistake, Democrats and the president both want stronger border security. However, we sharply disagree with the president about the most effective way to do it.So, how do we untangle this mess? Well, there’s an obvious solution. Separate the shutdown from arguments over border security. There is bipartisan legislation supported by Democrats and Republicans to reopen government while allowing debate over border security to continue.There is no excuse for hurting millions of Americans over a policy difference. Federal workers are about to miss a paycheck. Some families can’t get a mortgage to buy a new home. Farmers and small businesses won’t get loans they desperately need.Most presidents have used Oval Office addresses for noble purposes. This president just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration.My fellow Americans, there is no challenge so great that our nation cannot rise to meet it. We can reopen the government and continue to work through disagreements over policy. We can secure our border without an ineffective, expensive wall. And we can welcome legal immigrants and refugees without compromising safety and security.The symbol of America should be the Statue of Liberty, not a 30 foot wall. So our suggestion is a simple one. Mr. President, reopen the government, and we can work to resolve our differences over border security. But end this shutdown now.Thank you."

Their attackers often threaten to expose their immigration status — or worse — if they report an assault.President Trump has used the violence to make his case for a border wall. The Times spoke with eight women from Central America who were sexually assaulted between 2013 and 2016 about their experiences.Yesterday: Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said he would support a resolution to block Mr. Trump’s attempt to use emergency powers to fund a border wall. Mr. Paul became the fourth Republican senator to back the measure, appearing to give it the necessary support to pass.

But instead of finding new care in their communities, many patients go to different homes far from their families.Some facilities were forced to close after failing to meet health and safety standards, but far more have collapsed for financial reasons, including health care policies that encourage people to choose independent and assisted living or to stay in their own homes with help from caregivers.Quotable: “How often have you heard somebody say, ‘If I go to a nursing home, just shoot me?’” said Stephen Monroe, a researcher who tracks aging in America. “In the rural areas, you don’t have options.”The challenges faced by the country’s armed forces were evident after one of its aging aircraft was shot down by Pakistan last week.

He died on Feb. 19.Though many designers have created dramatic shows — most notably Alexander McQueen, John Galliano and Thom Browne — none reached the extremes of Mr. Lagerfeld. He once imported (and then returned) a Swedish iceberg, had a rocket launch and created a sandy beach with real surf — all within the glass-roofed confines of the Grand Palais in Paris.Though I was never as big a fan of these fantasy moments as many of my peers (I believed the money could be better spent elsewhere, like on a charitable foundation), they were the markers of a time that is coming to a close, symbols of a vision that bridged the couture and Instagram eras.Get ready for the farewell hurrah. Given that Mr. Lagerfeld never did anything by half measures, it is bound to be a doozy."
204,"RENO, Nev. — A detective says a Salvadoran immigrant charged with four Nevada murders told police he robbed and killed his elderly victims during a 10-day rampage in January because he needed money to buy methamphetamine.The detective told the grand jury, which indicted Wilber Ernesto Martinez-Guzman in Reno last week, the 20-year-old who is living in the U.S. illegally broke into tears and repeatedly called himself an ""idiot"" before confessing to the murders during an interrogation hours after his arrest in Carson City on Jan. 19.According to the grand jury transcript obtained by The Associated Press, Washoe County Sheriff's Detective Stefanie Brady testified March 13 that Martinez-Guzman initially denied any wrongdoing and was smiling and giggling during some of the questioning.But after she confronted him with several contradictions in his story during a nearly three-hour interrogation, he said through a Spanish interpreter he had ""done something that's unforgiveable.""She says he told her he shot the victims ""because of the drugs.""""He said he needed the money for the meth and it was the meth,"" Brady testified, according to the 268-page transcript filed late Tuesday in Washoe District Court.The grand jury indicted Martinez-Guzman last week on four counts of murder with the use of a deadly weapon, three counts of burglary while in possession of a firearm and one count each of burglary, burglary while gaining possession of a firearm and possession of a stolen firearm.A not guilty plea was entered on his behalf during an arraignment Tuesday. His trial isn't scheduled to begin until April 2020.His public defense attorney, John Arrascada, said in an email to AP he didn't receive the grand jury transcript until Wednesday, was reviewing it and had no immediate comment.Federal officials have said Martinez-Guzman is in the U.S. illegally but they don't know how or when he crossed the border.The case has drawn the attention of President Donald Trump, who says it shows the need for a border wall.District Attorneys Chris Hicks of Washoe County and Mark Jackson of Douglas County announced last week they are seeking the death penalty but that Martinez-Guzman's immigration status had nothing to do with that decision.The four slaying victims include Gerald David, 81, and his 80-year-old wife, Sharon David, a prominent Reno Rodeo Association couple who had employed Martinez-Guzman as a landscaper last summer at their house where they were found dead Jan. 16.Police say they were shot with a .22-caliber handgun that Martinez-Guzman stole from them earlier.Court documents allege that Martinez-Guzman's DNA was found on the same gun that was also used to kill Connie Koontz and Sophia Renken in their homes in Gardnerville south of Carson City.Detective Brady told the grand jury that Martinez-Guzman was ""engaging"" and made ""lots of eye contact"" during the early stages of the interrogation at the Carson City sheriff's office.""He smiled, kind of giggled through some of the questions. But he was very engaged in the conversation,"" she said.After she read him his Miranda rights, ""he actually acknowledged that he was fine not having an attorney because he hadn't done anything wrong,"" she said.He indicated he had buried ""a bunch of stuff"" that he found by a river in Carson City. But when she confronted him about several contradictions, his answers became slower, his body posture was more slumped and he started touching his face uncontrollably.When she asked him about some fishing poles that had been stolen from the Davids, ""there was a really long pause. And at that point, he had dropped his head and began to cry with long deep breaths.""""He talked about how he was an idiot. He repeated that several times,"" Brady testified. ""He talked about how he had done something that's unforgiveable.""""He said ... something about if he tells me what he did, it's not going to bring back the people that he shot,"" she said, and then shortly after that blamed the killings on his need for money to buy drugs.She said he initially denied he killed Renken, but ultimately acknowledged he shot her too."
205,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has stepped back from declaring a national emergency to pay for a border wall, under pressure from congressional Republicans, his own lawyers and advisers, who say using it as a way out of the government shutdown does not justify the precedent it would set and the legal questions it could raise.“If today the national emergency is border security, tomorrow the national emergency might be climate change,” Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, one of the idea’s critics, said this week. Another Republican, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, told an interviewer that declaring a national emergency should be reserved for “the most extreme circumstances.”Mr. Trump, who according to aides has grown increasingly frustrated over the refusal of Democrats to bend and sees the shutdown as a road with no off-ramp in sight, hinted on Friday that the warnings were having an effect.“What we’re not looking to do right now is national emergency,” he told reporters gathered in the Cabinet Room as the shutdown approached its fourth week. Minutes later he contradicted himself, saying that he would declare a state of emergency if he had to.As Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, have proved immune to Mr. Trump’s threats, the idea of using the president’s constitutional powers to declare an emergency has received close scrutiny in the White House because it would enable Mr. Trump to obtain the $5.7 billion he has sought for construction of a wall without the approval of Congress.Instead, Mr. Trump would use his authority to transfer funds to the wall that were appropriated by Congress for other purposes. Toward that end, the Army Corps of Engineers has been directed to study whether it can divert about $13.9 billion in emergency aide set aside for Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California. And with the money secured, the president could drop his opposition to the appropriations bills whose passage would end the shutdown.That would allow Mr. Trump to say he had never backed down from his fight with congressional Democrats or abandoned his pledge to build the wall even if the construction became tied up in legal challenges.Former White House aides, who noted that Mr. Trump did not focus on the wall during the first two years of his presidency, said the optics of fighting for the wall were more important to the president than erecting it.But opposition has come from many Republican quarters. Some conservatives see it as an unacceptable extension of executive power. Kellyanne Conway, a White House aide, has said it would essentially give Congress a pass. Representative Mike Simpson, Republican of Idaho and a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said it was not clear to him that an emergency declaration would even lead to the prompt reopening of the government.He called it “a bad escape hatch” that was going to anger many House members.Mr. Trump’s reluctance is also frustrating allies ginning him up to take action. “If it’s a crisis, treat it like a crisis,” Stephen K. Bannon, the former chief White House strategist, said in an interview. “His best option now is to declare a national security emergency and get on with it.”On Thursday, Mr. Trump traveled to the border in Texas to dramatize his support for a wall but used a photo-op along the banks of the Rio Grande on Thursday only to repeat his familiar arguments for building it. He sidestepped the issue when Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, asked him in an interview that night to detail what a national emergency would look like.“There’s some compromise needed,” Mr. Trump said.But Mr. Trump, who allies said was eager to spend time at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and resented the advice of aides to deliver an Oval Office address and travel to Texas on Thursday, is left with few good options.As he searches for a way to end the political stalemate with Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Trump is finding himself boxed in, in a familiar position when it comes to immigration issues. Former aides say that is because he conflates legal and policy issues with public relations campaigns and does not anticipate an endgame.In March, Mr. Trump was facing pressure to meet a deadline on a decision about what to do with immigrants who were part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allowed young adults brought to the United States illegally as children to avoid deportation and become eligible for a work permit.Racked by anxiety as he quizzed aides for advice, Mr. Trump turned to an adviser and asked, “How do I get out of this?”In the end, Mr. Trump was saved, at least temporarily, by a federal appeals court ruling last year that he could not immediately end the program. Mr. Trump moved on.In the opening weeks of his presidency, Mr. Trump issued an executive order banning citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States. That ban was almost immediately halted in court. A second, rewritten version, however, was upheld by the Supreme Court and was seen as at least a partial victory for the administration.But Mr. Trump vented, privately and publicly, that the version that passed legal muster was “watered down” and “P.C.,” and made him look “weak.”How Mr. Trump found himself in his most recent predicament can be traced back to September, when White House aides and conservative lawmakers urged the president to engage in a fight for wall funding. But he was told to postpone the fight until after the election, to avoid forcing vulnerable Republicans in swing districts to take a politically perilous stance on the wall.When he looked like he might compromise and support a bill that provided far less money for the wall than he asked for, conservatives like Ann Coulter excoriated him, describing him as “gutless,” and he backed down. Soon he was telling Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi during a televised Oval Office meeting last month that he would proudly “own the shutdown,” thrilling conservatives.Buoyed by the praise, and encouraged by the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump decided to keep digging in.But that encouragement for what played well in a viral television moment never led to a coherent strategy for a prolonged stalemate, according to a half-dozen people in the White House or working with the administration on a way to end the shutdown.Mr. Trump’s allies insist that he is winning the political battle.“Democrats are boxed in,” said Greg Mueller, a conservative strategist. “Every time the president and G.O.P. go to the Democrats with a fix, they say no, which positions them as obstructionists ignoring the problem, and opening themselves up for major troubles in 2020.”Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who had tried and failed to find an alternative to reopen the government earlier in the week, emerged from a meeting with Mr. Trump on Friday declaring that it was clear Democrats “don’t want to make a deal and will never support border wall/barriers.”And he encouraged the exact action many of his colleagues were warning against. “Mr. President, declare a national emergency now,” he said. “Build a wall now.”Mr. Trump’s aides said they expected the stalemate over the wall funding to be resolved by the time he delivers the State of the Union address on Jan. 29. But the White House also has drafts based on the shutdown being over — or well into its sixth week."
206,"A man was charged with murder on Wednesday after he fatally shot a California police officer who pulled him over under the suspicion of drunken driving, the authorities said.The man, identified by the authorities as Gustavo Perez Arriaga, was arrested Friday after a manhunt that fueled tensions over illegal immigration when President Trump tweeted about it. The police say Mr. Perez Arriaga entered the United States illegally.On Wednesday, Mr. Perez Arriaga’s lawyer argued that he was mentally incompetent and unable to stand trial, delaying the criminal proceedings, said John Goold, a spokesman for the Stanislaus County district attorney.Mr. Perez Arriaga, who is in his 30s, is accused of shooting and killing Ronil Singh, a 33-year-old officer with the Newman Police Department, early on Dec. 26. The police said the shooting occurred after Officer Singh pulled Mr. Perez Arriaga’s vehicle over because he suspected that he was driving under the influence.The gunman fled in his pickup truck, according to a statement from the sheriff’s department. Mr. Perez Arriaga was arrested two days later.Sheriff Adam Christianson of Stanislaus County said at a news conference on Friday that the authorities believed Mr. Perez Arriaga was trying to escape to Mexico when he was arrested that day at a home in Lamont, Calif., about 10 miles outside Bakersfield.The sheriff said Mr. Perez Arriaga had crossed the border from Mexico illegally “some time ago,” worked as a farm laborer and bragged on social media about being active in a street gang.The sheriff said that Mr. Perez Arriaga had previously been arrested twice on suspicion of drunken driving.In the criminal complaint, Mr. Perez Arriaga was also identified by three other names. Mr. Goold said that prosecutors were not certain of his real name, but on Wednesday at the County Court in Modesto, he identified himself to the judge as Paulo Virgen Mendoza.Stephen Foley, the defendant’s lawyer, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday evening.According to the criminal complaint, prosecutors requested that the murder charge be considered under “special circumstances,” meaning the maximum punishment could be the death penalty or life in prison without parole. Those special circumstances include killing a police officer or committing murder in an attempt to avoid a lawful arrest.Mr. Trump tweeted about the case during the police’s manhunt — and the federal government shutdown prompted by his demands for a border wall with Mexico.Officer Singh was an immigrant from Fiji, officials said, and had worked for the Newman Police Department since 2011. He was married and had a 5‐month‐old son.After spending Christmas morning with his family, he went on duty that night. His funeral was on Wednesday.At least seven people have been charged with being accessories to the crime. The police say they helped Mr. Perez Arriaga elude the authorities. All have pleaded not guilty, according to local news reports."
207,"Before reading the article:It is a new year and a new Congress — with a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives — begins this week.

Will the House and Senate be able to pass much new legislation or will Congress be largely gridlocked? If you were a new member of the Congress, what issues or legislation would be your priority? Please tell us why."
208,"Congress is on the verge of formally repudiating a president’s national emergency declaration, a historic first. Last month, after losing a funding battle with Congress over his desire for a border wall, President Trump made his declaration, insisting that a “national security crisis on our southern border” precipitated his action. The Senate has mustered enough support to pass a joint resolution, introduced and approved in the House last month, calling for the immediate termination of a national emergency that represented an unprecedented end run around Congress’s power of the purse.Mr. Trump has threatened to veto the resolution if it passes. Nonetheless, such a rejection from Congress would be healthy for the nation’s constitutional order. Among other things, it’d demonstrate that the separation of powers still matters and that some Republican lawmakers — after two years of looking the other way — are willing to stand up to a president with no respect for constitutional boundaries.At the same time, the need for this legislative reprimand lays bare flaws in the National Emergencies Act, which Congress passed in 1976 to restrain executive power. Before the law, a president could declare a national emergency and unlock formidable powers under an array of statutes, giving him authority, according to a legislative analysis, “to seize property and commodities, organize and control the means of production, call to active duty 2.5 million reservists, assign military forces abroad, seize and control all means of transportation and communication, restrict travel, and institute martial law, and, in many other ways, manage every aspect of the lives of all American citizens.” The National Emergencies Act ended that regime, established limits on the duration of national emergencies and put an end to four longstanding emergencies — one of them dating to the start of the Korean War that the government had used as late as 1972 to justify actions in Vietnam.Senator Charles McC. Mathias, a Republican from Maryland who was a chief sponsor of the legislation, called President Gerald Ford’s signing of the bill “a historic act of relinquishing powers of the presidency” and envisioned it would be a tool for “restoring constitutional democracy.”But in the more than 40 years that the National Emergencies Act has been in effect, it’s been subject to few checks and balances. That Congress has never invoked its own authority under the act to rebuke a president until now is a sign of the statute’s weaknesses.The resolution now before Congress serves mainly to nullify Mr. Trump’s border emergency declaration. But further reforms are called for to protect the nation from future excesses.For one thing, the National Emergencies Act doesn’t define what an emergency is — a loophole that Mr. Trump took advantage of by declaring that there’s a crisis at the border, contrary to all evidence. Congress could set clearer parameters, allowing a president to declare emergencies only when threats to the national interest are imminent and based on observable facts.The current law also lets the president extend emergencies for years on end, simply by notifying Congress. Lawmakers would be wise to vest in Congress, rather than the president, the ability to extend an emergency. And even then, the time period for an emergency ought to be capped — no more semi-permanent emergencies of the sort that are still lingering on the books from as far back as the late 1970s. If a crisis becomes a nonemergency still requiring legislative action, Congress can address it the best way it knows how — by passing a bill.The current standoff also shows that the law must be clarified to explain that being denied congressional funds toward achieving a policy goal is not, in fact, grounds for declaring an emergency. Last week, the House Judiciary Committee took a good step in this direction, holding a hearing on the status of the 1976 law and what can be done to fix it. There was bipartisan consensus that Congress needs to further limit the president’s discretion to declare emergencies.Strengthening the National Emergencies Act would erect a wall against any president, not just Mr. Trump, who insists on creating emergencies where none exist."
209,"Crises are a time-tested means of subverting democracy.From Getúlio Vargas and other better-known dictators in the 1930s to Indira Gandhi and Ferdinand Marcos in the 1970s and on to Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan more recently, autocratic-minded leaders have long used national emergencies — some real, some fabricated — to claim extraordinary powers. One of our greatest concerns about Donald Trump’s presidency has always been that he would exploit (or invent) a crisis in order to justify an abuse of power. Recent events have given this concern new immediacy.Authoritarian leaders often chafe under the constraints of constitutional rule. Democratic politics is, after all, grinding work. Family businesses and army units may be ruled by fiat, but democracies require negotiation and concessions. Setbacks are inevitable; victories always partial. A president’s most cherished policy initiatives may be savaged in the media, derailed by Congress or struck down by the courts.President Bill Clinton, who was elected on a promise of health care reform, devoted the first two years of his administration to a universal health insurance bill only to see it die in Congress. President George W. Bush claimed a mandate to reform Social Security after his 2004 re-election, but the initiative went nowhere. All presidents suffer such defeats. In a democracy, presidents must have patience and thick skin. They must be able to compromise. And crucially, they must be able to lose.Autocratic-minded leaders, by contrast, find democratic politics intolerably frustrating. Most lack the skills or the temperament for the give-and-take of everyday politics. They are allergic to criticism and compromise. They have little patience for the intricacies of the legislative process. To cite one example, an aide to former President Alberto Fujimori of Peru noted that Mr. Fujimori “couldn’t stand the idea of inviting the president of the Senate to the presidential palace every time he wanted Congress to approve a law.” For would-be authoritarians, the checks and balances inherent in presidential democracy feel like a straitjacket. The media criticism, legislative oversight and adverse court rulings leave them feeling besieged.Crises offer these would-be authoritarians an escape from constitutional shackles. National emergencies — especially wars or major terrorist attacks — do three things for such leaders. First, they build public support. Security crises typically produce a rally-round-the-flag effect in which presidential approval soars. Citizens are more likely to tolerate — and even support — authoritarian power grabs when they fear for their safety. Second, security crises silence opponents, since criticism can be viewed as disloyal or unpatriotic. Finally, security crises loosen normal constitutional constraints. Fearful of putting national security at risk, judges and legislative leaders generally defer to the executive.National emergencies can threaten the constitutional balance even under democratically minded presidents like Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt. But they can be fatal under would-be autocrats, for they provide a seemingly legitimate (and often popular) justification for concentrating power and eviscerating rights. Hitler’s authoritarian response to the 1933 Reichstag fire is the most prominent example, but there are many others. In Peru, a Maoist insurgency and economic crisis enabled Mr. Fujimori to dissolve the Constitution and Congress in 1992; in Russia, a series of deadly apartment bombings in 1999 — allegedly by Chechen terrorists — triggered a surge of public support for Mr. Putin, who was then the prime minister, which allowed him to crack down on critics and consolidate his power; and in Turkey, a series of terrorist attacks in 2015, along with a failed 2016 coup attempt, allowed Mr. Erdogan to tighten his grip via a two-year state of emergency.Crises present such great opportunities for concentrating power that would-be autocrats often manufacture them. In 1937, President Vargas of Brazil, resisting term limits that would force him to leave office the next year, used the “discovery” of a communist plot (the so-called Cohen Plan, later revealed to be a fabrication) to dissolve the Constitution and establish a dictatorship.Similarly, President Marcos of the Philippines did not want to step aside when his second term expired in 1973. But he needed a reason to subvert constitutional checks. An opportunity arrived in  1972, when a series of explosions rocked Manila. Following an apparent assassination attempt on his defense secretary, Marcos, blaming communist terrorists, declared martial law and established a dictatorship. This crisis, too, was largely fabricated: The bombings are believed to have been carried out by government forces and the assassination attempt was staged. The “communist menace” that Marcos used to justify martial law amounted to several dozen insurgents.Although President Trump operates in a different political environment, his behavior, particularly since the November midterm elections, betrays similar autocratic instincts. The president manifestly lacks the patience or negotiating skills needed to deal with divided government. His response to Democratic control of the House of Representatives has been a refusal to compromise and, more dangerously, a refusal to lose. Unlike Presidents Clinton and Bush, who conceded defeat when it became clear that their initiatives lacked legislative support, Mr. Trump has refused to accept the failure of his border wall project. Unable to obtain the necessary votes in Congress, the president recklessly forced a government shutdown. When that didn’t get him his wall, he moved to circumvent Congress altogether by inventing — if not yet declaring — a national emergency. In his Oval Office speech on Tuesday, he used the word “crisis” six times in eight minutes. That is how autocrats respond to legislative opposition. Following in the tradition of Vargas and Marcos, Mr. Trump fabricated a security threat to make the case for bypassing Congress.The president’s border wall stunt may well fail. Mr. Trump is politically weak. Outside of his core group of supporters, few Americans believe that the southern border poses a national security threat, and there is a chance — though it is far from certain — that any effort by Mr. Trump to circumvent Congress would be blocked by the courts. On Friday, Mr. Trump seemed to acknowledge the weakness of his position when he announced that “what we’re not looking to do right now is national emergency,” although he continued to hold the threat over Congress.But no matter the outcome, these developments should set off alarm bells. Our president is behaving like an autocrat. His willingness to fabricate a national crisis and subvert constitutional checks and balances to avoid legislative defeat places him closer to Ferdinand Marcos than to Ronald Reagan. American presidents wield vast authority during crises. During our country’s last major security crisis, the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Mr. Bush’s approval rating soared to 90 percent — the highest ever recorded by Gallup. In the wake of the attacks, constitutional checks and balances receded: Neither Congress nor the courts were likely to intervene to check the president’s actions. For several months, the president had what was effectively a blank check.Mr. Trump lacks the self-restraint of Lincoln, F.D.R., or even George W. Bush. Indeed, he seems incapable of exercising executive power responsibly. Mr. Trump’s first encounter with divided government has produced what is proving to be the longest government shutdown ever. And any reckless use of emergency powers would set a dangerous precedent for overriding the legislative branch. Unlike other national emergency declarations, this one would openly defy the will of Congress.This raises a terrifying question: How would a president who is willing to fabricate a national emergency over a simple legislative impasse behave during a real security crisis?"

211,"WASHINGTON — The reopening of the federal government signals the start of three weeks of intense negotiations over border security in an ideologically divided Congress that threaten to leave Republican and Democratic leaders right where they began: at risk of a government shutdown.The stopgap spending bill President Trump signed into law on Friday night gives leaders in both chambers until Feb. 15 to devise a bipartisan resolution to their impasse over the president’s demand for $5.7 billion for a border wall. But whatever they come up with is likely to face obstacles from resurgent liberals in the House and a more conservative Senate.And Mr. Trump is a wild card. The president will have the final word on any deal, and he has already vowed to shut down the government again, or invoke his emergency powers to build a wall, if Congress does not offer a solution he likes.Nodding to the tight deadline, he acknowledged the difficulties ahead. “Will not be easy to make a deal, both parties very dug in,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday. “The case for National Security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the Border & through dialogue. We will build the Wall!”Meanwhile, the clock is ticking.“I think everybody’s relieved that the government’s getting back open,” said Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma. “But I think everyone’s still a little tenuous because we’ve got a sword of Damocles hanging over us three weeks from now to see if we can get things worked out.”The shutdown, the longest on record, left 800,000 federal employees without pay for 35 days — and left lawmakers in both parties feeling scarred and jittery. Tensions were running especially high on Friday: Air traffic controllers called in sick, flights were delayed across the Northeast, work slowdowns at the I.R.S. threatened to postpone tax refunds and the F.B.I. director, furious that his agents were working without pay, lashed out.This coming week, negotiators from the House and the Senate, led by the top Democrats and Republicans on the Appropriations Committees, will begin meeting to hash out a plan to secure the southwestern border. The appropriators have a history of working in a bipartisan way, and there are some areas of agreement.Democrats and Republicans — including Mr. Trump — have both called for border security packages that would include money for new technologies to detect drugs and weapons, more personnel at the border, more immigration judges, infrastructure improvement at ports of entry and humanitarian assistance for migrants.Mr. Trump, for his part, has softened his messaging, conceding in a speech in the Rose Garden on Friday that “we do not need 2,000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea — we never did.” That semantic evolution could provide a face-saving way forward for both the president and Democrats, who have previously supported bills that include money for border fencing, though not a wall.And Democrats have moved closer to Mr. Trump’s $5.7 billion price tag. Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 House Democrat, told reporters this past week that lawmakers in his party were prepared to spend that much on a border security package that would include what he called a “smart wall,” featuring drones, sensors and more Border Patrol agents.“This has become a shutdown over semantics,” said Steve Israel, a Democratic former congressman from New York, who ran the party’s campaign committee. “This has become Donald Trump’s shutdown over the definition of a wall, and Democrats have succeeded at redefining border security from bricks and mortar to investments in modern technology.”But the path ahead remains complicated. Mr. Trump is desperate to fulfill his 2016 campaign pledge for a “big, beautiful wall” along the southern border — a huge sticking point for Democrats, who see the president in a weakened position now that he has caved to their core demand of reopening the government first and negotiating border security later.Progressives especially are feeling emboldened and do not like the idea that Mr. Trump is once again tying the debate over border security to a threat to shut down the government.“I think it’s offensive, even to some of the centrists and moderates, that he links his program on immigration with the functioning of government,” said Representative Ro Khanna of California, a leader of the House Progressive Caucus. “The vast majority, not just the progressives, will say not a dime goes for the border wall. And that’s especially true because we just won this fight.”Even so, Mr. Trump may have already put forth the broad outlines of a deal, with his proposal to pair money for a barrier with protections for some undocumented immigrants. The Senate rejected that plan this past week. Still, if the protections were expansive enough, and included a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers, some centrist Democrats might be persuaded to sign on.But expanding the border security discussion to include changes to immigration law could open a Pandora’s box, giving conservative Republicans a window to pursue more far-reaching restrictions on legal immigration. One such Republican, Senator Marsha Blackburn, a freshman from Tennessee, said on Friday that she intended to continue pushing not only for a “border barrier,” but also for an end to the program that protects Dreamers and an end to family-based migration — a position that is anathema to Democrats.Much will depend on Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who solidified her position as a powerful leader of her caucus during the shutdown fight. On Friday, Ms. Pelosi ducked questions about whether she could accept any money for a physical barrier, insisting instead that Democrats want a border plan rooted in “evidence-based knowledge about how we best secure our border.”Ms. Pelosi has previously said that a wall would be “immoral” — an utterance that may have backed her into a corner, said Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican who retired from the House last year.“I hope she can walk that back, because if she meant what she said that walls are immoral, how can she allow a bill to come to the floor that might include some additional money for barriers?” Mr. Dent said. As to Mr. Trump, Mr. Dent said, “the question is: Can the president be a reliable negotiator?”For Democrats, that is the proverbial $64,000 question. Mr. Trump is extremely sensitive to criticism from the right, and is known to change his stance in response to commentary from conservative pundits. Already, one of them — Ann Coulter — has ridiculed the president as a “wimp” on Twitter over his decision to reopen the government without wall funding.During the shutdown Mr. Trump sent Vice President Mike Pence and the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to the Capitol to negotiate with Democrats. But it quickly became clear that Mr. Pence and Mr. Mulvaney were not speaking for Mr. Trump.“I ask myself: Is this going to be a Trump negotiation, negotiated in good faith, or is he going to say one thing through his advisers and another when he hears from Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter?” asked Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, who as chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee will be leading the talks.“I’m an appropriator; I’m used to making deals,” Ms. Lowey said, though she added, “I don’t know how this negotiation is going to go.”Some of the more pragmatic voices in Congress insist the two sides are not that far apart. Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, noted that last year Congress approved, and Mr. Trump signed into law, a bipartisan bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security that included $1.375 billion for new fencing along the border. Mr. Portman said Mr. Trump’s budget proposal for the 2019 fiscal year included money for just 234 miles of new fencing — hardly an enormous wall from one end of the country to the other.“Both the president and his Democratic critics have mischaracterized what the proposal is,” Mr. Portman said, adding that he sees reasons for optimism. He has been heartened by comments from Ms. Pelosi and House Democrats about the importance of border security and by remarks from moderate Democrats in the Senate who have said they are open to more fencing.And he said nobody — or at least nobody on Capitol Hill — was in the mood for another shutdown: “We’re sort of at the end of the rope now, right?”"
212,"WASHINGTON — Congressional efforts to reach a border security deal ahead of another government shutdown broke down on Sunday over Democratic demands to limit the detention of undocumented immigrants, as President Trump moved more troops to the border and prepared to rally supporters in Texas on Monday.The 17 House and Senate negotiators had hoped to finalize a border security agreement on Monday, but hours before that deadline, communications had stopped, lawmakers and aides said.Meantime, the Trump administration was moving on its own to fortify the southwestern border with thousands of active-duty military troops. The number of deployed troops on the Mexican border was set to exceed the high of 5,900 reached around the November elections, as about 3,700 active-duty troops were being sent to assist with the Department of Homeland Security’s border patrol efforts.Senior officers are voicing greater worries that the deployed troops are not conducting the training needed for their regular missions, while other military units must now pick up the routine duties on behalf of their deployed colleagues.But efforts to reach a broader, bipartisan deal on border security bogged down, days before much of the government is set to run out of funds at midnight Friday, with memories of the 35-day partial government shutdown — the nation’s longest in history — still fresh.“I’ll say 50-50 we get a deal,” Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the Republican chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said on “Fox News Sunday.” “The specter of a shutdown is always out there.”The impasse appears to center on Democratic demands for a limit on the number of unauthorized immigrants already in the country who could be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, according to aides familiar with the talks. Democrats say a cap of 16,500 beds in ICE detention centers would force the Trump administration to focus on detaining undocumented immigrants with criminal records instead of using indiscriminate sweeps that drag in otherwise law-abiding residents.“For far too long, the Trump administration has been tearing communities apart with its cruel immigration policies,” Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, Democrat of California and one of the negotiators, said on Sunday. “A cap on ICE detention beds will force the Trump administration to prioritize deportation for criminals and people who pose real security threats, not law-abiding immigrants who are contributing to our country.”Republicans demanded an exception to the cap for criminals, according to an aide familiar with the negotiations. Democrats declined, saying their 16,500-bed cap left more than enough room for real criminals.But just days after he used his State of the Union address to take an uncompromising line on a border wall, Mr. Trump was being challenged on a new front in the immigration wars. The president took to Twitter on Sunday afternoon to say Democratic negotiators “are behaving, all of a sudden, irrationally.”“They don’t even want to take muderers into custody! What’s going on?” he said, a charge that Democrats called categorically false.The looming deadline is exposing fissures in both parties. The more liberal members of the Democratic caucus, many of whom ran on abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement altogether, have been lobbying their colleagues on the committee to resist any increases in ICE funding.Democratic negotiators held a conference call on Sunday morning to discuss options, according to a Democratic aide, but did not settle on a final decision on how to move forward. Another short-term spending bill could prevent a lapse in funding on Friday, though lawmakers have expressed reluctance at punting again on a final agreement.Still, Mr. Shelby and Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana and a member of the negotiating committee, said on Sunday that they had not given up.Other sticking points remain, including how much money to allocate for barriers at the border. Lawmakers were eyeing between $1.3 billion and $2 billion, far less than the $5.7 billion that the president demanded for his signature campaign promise — and shut down the government over in December. Mr. Trump, who has vacillated between publicly condemning the talks as a “waste of time” and privately showing flexibility, blamed Democratic leadership for the breakdown.“I don’t think the Dems on the Border Committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal,” he wrote on Twitter. “They are offering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall & now, out of the blue, want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention!”Pentagon and administration officials spent the weekend preparing for another partial government shutdown — and for the possibility that the president will fulfill his threat to declare a national emergency and fund the wall without Congress. Lawmakers from both parties have expressed extreme discomfort with the prospect of a national emergency declaration, and there is almost universal aversion to another shutdown.One proposal circulating among some White House officials in an attempt to fend off legal challenges to an emergency declaration is to claim that the wall would be built to protect the more than 6,000 active-duty and National Guard troops now operating near the southwestern border or deploying there soon.“The Wall will get built one way or the other!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday afternoon.During the last lapse in funding, hundreds of thousands of workers were either furloughed or worked without pay, and it cost the United States economy $11 billion. Another shutdown would hit some agencies at an even worse time. The Internal Revenue Service, for instance, is just entering tax season.Lawmakers held out the possibility that Mr. Trump could find some face-saving way to fortify border security and build some structures without resorting to a precedent-setting emergency declaration. Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, said the president had asked him to “comb through the law” and “go find money in any place we could” to fully fund a wall.“There’s pots of money where presidents, all presidents, have access to without a national emergency,” Mr. Mulvaney said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”Senior Republican aides said Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, and his leadership team were frustrated with the Democrats because they believed they had persuaded Mr. Trump to agree to a package for border security improvements that consisted mostly of repairs and extensions to existing barriers. Their major concern now, people close to the process said, is that Stephen Miller, the president’s hard-line adviser on immigration, would convince him that accepting a compromise on detention beds would be a humiliation that would cost him with his base.In what one Defense Department official described as a surreal scramble, Pentagon officials met on Friday and over the weekend to identify which Army Corps of Engineers construction projects would be tapped for money to help build Mr. Trump’s wall if the president declared a national emergency.Officials scoured the language of multiple draft declarations that Mr. Trump might invoke if a deal is not reached or he rejects what lawmakers agree upon. Mr. Trump’s top national security aides are scheduled to meet on Monday to discuss the matter. Mr. Trump is then to convene a full cabinet meeting on Tuesday, officials said.If Mr. Trump declares a national emergency to build the wall, Democrats are expected to sue to block construction and halt any shifting of funds. House Democrats are preparing legislation that would limit the president’s ability to unilaterally commandeer wall funding.Mr. Trump is set to hold a rally in El Paso on Monday night, using the border city as evidence for his exaggerated claim that a wall would reduce crime.[Read about the message El Paso is sending to Mr. Trump before the rally: Don’t speak for us.]Prominent Democrats from the area, including Beto O’Rourke, a possible Democratic presidential candidate and former representative for most of the city, and his freshman successor, Representative Veronica Escobar, have denounced Mr. Trump’s claims that El Paso became a safe city only after a physical barrier was built there. Ms. Escobar called the president a liar.Ms. Escobar was one of a group of lawmakers, including Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, who visited the area before Mr. Trump’s rally.“It’s frustrating to know that he is still unwilling to acknowledge the truth about immigrants, the truth about the border,” said Ms. Escobar, speaking earlier this week after growing visibly angry as the president made similar claims during his State of the Union address. “He has failed to set out any kind of real plan and real solution.”"
213,"LONDON — In Parliament, lawmakers are mired in gridlock over Britain’s departure from the European Union, with no clear path forward. In Washington, President Trump stormed out of a meeting with congressional leaders who oppose his border wall, hardening a standoff that has shut down much of the government for longer than ever before.Two governments paralyzed. Two populist projects stalled. Two venerable democracies in crisis.Rarely have British and American politics seemed quite so synchronized as they do in the chilly dawn of 2019, three years after the victories of Brexit and Donald J. Trump upended the two nations’ political establishments. The countries seem subject to a single ideological weather system — one that pits pro-globalization elites against a left-behind hinterland.The similarities abound: Brexiteers love to compare their cause to America’s war for independence. At a recent right-wing rally, one man marched with a scale model of the Liberty Bell. Mr. Trump has exuberantly backed Brexit, while his friend, the Brexit godfather Nigel Farage, appears on Fox News, invoking Europe’s migrant crisis as a reason to back Mr. Trump’s wall.“It’s stunning how parallel this is,” said Stephen K. Bannon, who was an architect of Mr. Trump’s immigration policy as his former chief strategist, and is an ally of Mr. Farage. “If you’re going to challenge the system, the system is going to fight back.”Mr. Bannon likened what he said was the growing possibility that Mr. Trump will declare a state of national emergency to build his wall over the objections of Congress to the once inconceivable but now real possibility that Britain will withdraw from the European Union in March without reaching a deal with Brussels — a so-called hard Brexit.“Trump is getting ready for his own no-deal, hard-out,” Mr. Bannon said, even as Republicans and Mr. Trump’s aides and family are urging him not to take such a step.The trans-Atlantic dysfunction has far-reaching ramifications, given the role the United States and Britain, pillars of the NATO alliance, play in counterterrorism operations, intelligence sharing, sanctions enforcement, and dealing with conflict zones like Syria.With both countries also turning away from multilateral trade agreements, China has the opportunity to step in and play an even bigger role in the global economy. And Russia has seen an opening to expand its influence in Europe, where rising nationalism has threatened to fracture the European Union.Mr. Trump and the Brexiteers have ridden a nationalist tide in their countries as well, using a potent anti-immigration message to appeal to mostly white voters who yearn for a more homogeneous society that no longer exists.In Britain, immigration has provided an electric current to conservative politics since at least 1968, when the lawmaker Enoch Powell delivered a seminal speech calling for immigrants to be repatriated. Quoting a Greek prophecy of “the river Tiber foaming with much blood,” Mr. Powell’s speech is credited with propelling the Conservative Party to victory in the general election of 1970, though it also turned Mr. Powell into a political pariah.Opposition to immigration spiked over the last two decades as Britain was hit with a series of terrorist attacks by Islamist militants and watched as migrants from Syria, Libya and other war-torn countries flooded across Europe.In the United States, where the right was once preoccupied by social issues like abortion and same-sex marriage, immigration surged as an issue because of the changes wrought by globalization. Manufacturing jobs moved overseas, where labor was cheaper, while immigrants took both unskilled and high-tech jobs previously held by Americans.By 2008, the financial crisis had wiped out millions of jobs, keeping people out of work for years and deepening the sense of grievance among many Trump supporters that immigrants were working for less and robbing them of their livelihoods.Local politicians in California and elsewhere shot to stardom by introducing anti-immigrant ordinances. The Tea Party movement emerged, with core issues similar to those of Mr. Farage’s pro-Brexit U.K. Independence Party.“The culture war has been replaced by a border war,” said Michael Lind, a visiting professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas. The residents of rural postindustrial areas came to view globalism sourly, he said, as an urgent problem.“The people in those areas just said: ‘O.K., we’re not giving them any more time, the people in London and D.C., your time is up. We’re not going to wait a few more years for a recovery,’” said Mr. Lind, the author of “Land of Promise: An Economic History of the United States.” “They decided: ‘There’s a limited pie. This pie is not growing.’”The urge to solve these problems by walling off the country from its neighbors is not a new one in either Britain or the United States. It partly reflects geography: Both are separated from much of the world by water, allowing them to experiment with isolationism.“Brexit and the border wall are driven by the same impulse,” said Robert Kagan, a foreign policy theorist at the Brookings Institution. “Both reflect the island nation approach to the world, ‘Wouldn’t it be great if we could just cut ourselves off from everybody else?’”“Britain, to some extent, is returning to one version of its roots, and America is returning to one version of its roots,” said Mr. Kagan, whose most recent book is “The Jungle Grows Back: America and Our Imperiled World.”Britain has sometimes acted as a political early-warning system for its former colony. Margaret Thatcher took power less than two years before her conservative ally Ronald Reagan; the British voted to leave the European Union five months before Mr. Trump’s victory. The reverse was true in the 1990s, when Bill Clinton’s election anticipated that of Tony Blair.If the two countries are both vulnerable to gridlock, that is partly for historic reasons. As two of the world’s oldest democracies, they spring from the same, centuries-old model: the electoral system known as first-past-the post or winner-take-all. Democracies that developed later, like Sweden and Finland, introduced proportional representation, which allows for smaller parties to enter Parliament.Winner-take-all, by contrast, tends to increase polarization between two large parties, and exaggerate geographical divides, setting up stark conflict between sections of society.And if Britain traditionally had a “strong, stable, efficient central state” that wielded control over policymaking, this has been changing, as Parliament reasserts its power to block the government’s agenda — much as a House of Representatives controlled by the Democrats is thwarting Mr. Trump.“In my lifetime, Britain has never been in a more fragile state,” said Matthew Goodwin, an author of “National Populism: The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy.” “British politics is in an almost nonstop state of crisis. There are very high levels of polarization.”“Both countries have seen the mainstream center really be squeezed,” Mr. Goodwin added. “That moderate, pluralistic marketplace of ideas — that’s really been challenged. Both countries have seen the rise of populist entrepreneurs.”The most successful of these populist entrepreneurs is Mr. Trump, though he is adapting only fitfully to the realities of divided government in Washington. Mr. Bannon cast the standoff over the wall as a case of the establishment striking back against Mr. Trump’s insurgent victory in 2016.“I call it the nullification project,” he said. “They’re not going to let you run on those populist themes and then implement them. If you’re going to be a disrupter, you’re going to have to take it from them.”Mr. Kagan argued that the paralysis in Washington and London was not a case of populists versus elites, but merely democracies showing their periodic inability to settle deeply rooted divisions in society. And some argue that is not necessarily a bad thing.“The process of consensus has broken down, but neither side is capable of imposing its will on the other side,” Mr. Lind said. “The purpose of having veto points is to build an eventual consensus. It’s not to paralyze things forever.”In Washington, Mr. Trump may break the impasse by declaring his emergency — a risky assertion of executive power that would be challenged in the courts but would enable the government to reopen. Either way, the fate of the United States will not hang in the balance.In London, where the political and economic consequences of a chaotic departure from Europe are far more profound, “it is much more difficult to compromise,” Mr. Lind said. “The side that loses is really, really going to lose.”"
214,"WASHINGTON — The Senate will vote Wednesday on whether to cut off American military assistance for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, preparing again to rebuke President Trump for his continued defense of the kingdom after the killing of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.The Yemen vote sets up something of a one-two punch for senators hoping to defy the president. The second punch may land Thursday, when the Senate has the chance to give final passage to a resolution overturning the president’s declaration of a national emergency to secure funding for his border wall.Passage of the measures would prompt the first vetoes of Mr. Trump’s presidency.“The resolution we will vote on in the Senate tomorrow to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen is enormously important and historic,” Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, said Tuesday in a statement. “This war is both a humanitarian and a strategic disaster, and Congress has the opportunity to end it.”Supporters of the Yemen resolution have faced a long and grueling road to get the legislation onto the president’s desk. The Senate — led by the resolution’s authors, Mr. Sanders, Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, and Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut — first passed the measure 56 to 41 in December, but Paul D. Ryan, the speaker at the time, refused to take up the resolution.His successor, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, did take it up, and the House easily passed it last month. But House Democrats inadvertently derailed the process by supporting a surprise procedural motion offered by Republicans to declare the chamber’s opposition to anti-Semitism. By attaching an unrelated amendment to the Yemen resolution, the House ended its “privileged” status, which would have forced the Senate to quickly take it up and send it to Mr. Trump.Wednesday’s measure is essentially a do-over and will have to again clear the House. While it is expected to pass, it may not enjoy the same level of Republican support that it received in December, aides said.The resolution gives the Senate another opportunity to condemn a nearly four-year conflict in Yemen that has killed thousands of civilians and inflicted a devastating famine. It also underscores the simmering anger among senators even in the president’s party at his administration’s tepid response to the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a Virginia-based columnist for The Washington Post.After first playing down his own intelligence officials’ reports that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was responsible for the killing, Mr. Trump then blew past a legally mandated deadline that required the White House to report to Congress whether it believed the prince was personally responsible for Mr. Khashoggi’s death.The White House sent two aides from the State and Treasury Departments last week to a closed-door briefing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to try to defuse the senators’ rising anger. But senators on the committee, hungry for either a justification for why the White House defied the congressional mandate or information about the crown prince’s role in the killing, left unimpressed.“It was a complete waste of time,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told reporters afterward.Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said it was time for the Senate to act, adding that the chamber “will have to decide whether it’s going to impose its own sanctions.”But the Foreign Relations Committee, now overseen by Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, a Trump loyalist, has yet to mark up bipartisan legislation. The measure, introduced last month by Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the ranking member of the committee, and Mr. Graham, would prohibit certain arms sales to Saudi Arabia and impose sanctions on individuals supporting the Houthis in Yemen.“Seeing as the Trump administration has no intention of insisting on full accountability for Mr. Khashoggi’s murderers, it is time for Congress to step in and impose real consequences to fundamentally re-examine our relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and with the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen,” Mr. Menendez said in a statement.Mr. Risch has pledged that the panel “will not let” the killing go. But he has also suggested that both the sanctions act and the Yemen vote would be ineffective.“Saudi Arabia has engaged in acts that just are simply not acceptable. Unfortunately, as I said, we hear a lot of descriptions about the problem, but we don’t hear any answers,” he said at a hearing considering the nomination of the ambassador to Saudi Arabia. “There have been some modest suggestions that have been made, none of which would resolve the problem.”"
215,"Three decades ago, Donald J. Trump waged a public battle with the talk show host Merv Griffin to take control of what would become Mr. Trump’s third Atlantic City casino. Executives at Mr. Trump’s company warned that the casino would siphon revenue from the others. Analysts predicted the associated debt would crush him.The naysayers would be proved right, but throughout the turmoil Mr. Trump fixated on just one outcome: declaring himself a winner and Mr. Griffin a loser.As president, Mr. Trump has displayed a similar fixation in his standoff with Congress over leveraging a government shutdown to gain funding for a wall on the Mexican border. As he did during decades in business, Mr. Trump has insulted adversaries, undermined his aides, repeatedly changed course, extolled his primacy as a negotiator and induced chaos.“He hasn’t changed at all,” said Jack O’Donnell, who ran a casino for Mr. Trump in the 1980s and wrote a book about it. “And it’s only people who have been around him through the years who realize that.”Mr. Trump briefly seemed to follow a more conventional approach for a president seeking consensus: encouraging his party leaders in Congress to negotiate a deal. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, shepherded a compromise in December that would have kept the government open and put off negotiations over a wall and other border security measures.Mr. Trump was expected to sign off on the deal, but then came the suggestion from conservative critics that he had caved in to Democrats — that he was a loser. It was a perception Mr. Trump could not bear, and he quickly reversed course.He also reverted to lifelong patterns in business. People who worked with him during those years say they see multiple parallels between Mr. Trump the businessman and Mr. Trump the steward of the country’s longest government shutdown.His lack of public empathy for unpaid federal workers echoes his treatment of some construction workers, contractors and lawyers whom he refused to pay for their work on his real estate projects. The plight of the farmers and small-business owners wilting without the financial support pledged by his administration harks back to the multiple lenders and investors who financed Mr. Trump’s business ventures only to come up shortchanged.And his ever-changing positions (I’ll own the shutdown; you own the shutdown; the wall could be steel; it must be concrete; then again, it could be steel) have left heads in both parties spinning. Even after his televised proposal on Saturday to break the deadlock, Mr. Trump has no progress to show.“I think he was always a terrible negotiator,” said Tony Schwartz, co-author with Mr. Trump of “The Art of the Deal.”That book, published in 1987, was intended to be an autobiography of Mr. Trump, who was 41 at the time. Mr. Schwartz said that he created the idea of Mr. Trump as a great deal maker as a literary device to give the book a unifying theme. He said he came to regret the contribution as he watched Mr. Trump seize on the label to sell himself as something he was not — a solver of complicated problems.Rather, Mr. Schwartz said, Mr. Trump’s “virtue” in negotiating was his relentlessness and lack of concern for anything but claiming victory.“If you don’t care what the collateral damage you create is, then you have a potential advantage,” he said. “He used a hammer, deceit, relentlessness and an absence of conscience as a formula for getting what he wanted.”In a brief telephone interview on Sunday, Mr. Trump was not specific in defending his tactics, but he described himself as successful in his chosen fields of real estate, entertainment and finally politics. “I ran for office once and I won,” Mr. Trump said.The president’s supporters say he gets an unfair rap as a poor negotiator, saying that his style and unusual approach — and unwillingness to accept defeat even in the worst situations — have often had positive results. And in a Washington that doesn’t like outsiders, he has clearly forced his adversaries out of their comfort zones.“President Trump’s success in business has translated into success as president,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said. “He’s ignited a booming economy with rising wages and historically low unemployment, negotiated better trade deals, persuaded our allies to contribute their fair share to NATO, and secured the release of American hostages around the world.”Representative Peter King, Republican of Long Island, said that even as Mr. Trump’s personal popularity had taken a hit during the shutdown, public support for his stated ambition — the border wall — had grown.“Having the bad hand that he dealt himself at the beginning, I think he’s making the best of it, better than anybody else could,” Mr. King said. “Only he would have the stamina, the determination to just keep going.”One example of that stamina — seen by others as evidence of unreliability — recounted in Mr. O’Donnell’s book, “Trumped! The Inside Story of the Real Donald Trump — His Cunning Rise and Spectacular Fall,” written with James Rutherford, involved the construction of an exclusive lounge at the top of a casino.Mr. Trump liked very high ceilings, according to the account. He screamed and cursed when he was told some ceilings had to be low to allow for pipes. He begrudgingly acquiesced. But he had forgotten by the time he next visited the construction site. He cursed again. Was reminded again. To the bewilderment of his executives, that cycle repeated itself several times.Finally, toward the end of construction, Mr. Trump reamed an executive with vulgarities, leapt up and punched a hole in one of the low ceilings. “After that day,” Mr. O’Donnell wrote, “Donald never set foot inside it again if he could help it.”In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has similarly laced into his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney.Mr. Mulvaney pursued a rather standard tactic in ending the impasse over border security and a wall: He tried to find middle ground between the $1.3 billion to which Democrats had once agreed, and the president’s demand for $5.7 billion. But upon learning of Mr. Mulvaney’s efforts, Mr. Trump snarled in front of a crowded room that Mr. Mulvaney had messed “it all up” (using a vulgarity, according to two White House officials familiar with the remark.)“We are getting crushed!” Mr. Trump told Mr. Mulvaney, after watching television coverage of the shutdown.During his years in business, Mr. Trump earned a reputation as someone whose word meant very little. When a commitment he made no longer made sense, he walked away, often blaming the other party with a fantastical line of reasoning.To win financing from Deutsche Bank to build a Trump Hotel in Chicago, for example, Mr. Trump personally guaranteed $40 million of the debt. When he could not make his payments during the 2008 financial crisis, Deutsche Bank executives were open to granting him more time to repay the loan, a person briefed on negotiations later recalled.But before a compromise could be reached, Mr. Trump flipped the script. He filed a lawsuit and argued that the bank had helped cause the worldwide financial meltdown that essentially rendered Mr. Trump unable to make his debt payments. At the time, Deutsche Bank called the lawsuit “classic Trump.”The bank eventually settled with Mr. Trump, saving him from having to pay the $40 million. Mr. Trump expressed his gratitude to the lawyer who fought on his behalf by not fully paying his bill. “He left me with some costs,” said the lawyer, Steven Schlesinger.From the time he built his first Manhattan apartment building, Mr. Trump left a string of unpaid tabs for the people who worked for him.The undocumented Polish workers who did the demolition work for that first building, Trump Tower, eventually won a $1.375 million settlement. Since then, scores of lawyers, contractors, engineers and waiters have sued Mr. Trump for unpaid bills or pay. Typically, he responds by asserting that their work did not meet his standard.That might sound familiar to furloughed federal workers. Mr. Trump recently retweeted an article, attributed to an anonymous senior official in his administration, arguing that 80 percent of federal workers do “nothing of external value” and that “furloughed employees should find other work, never return and not be paid.”Mr. Trump has claimed, without evidence, that “maybe most” federal workers going without pay are “the biggest fan” of his use of the shutdown to fund a border wall. In ordering thousands back to work without pay, he has put the pain for the shutdown on them.Mr. Trump has also embraced his business practice of giving the most latitude and trust to family members, no matter their prior experience.He put his first wife, Ivana, a model, in charge of an Atlantic City casino and the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. He put his younger brother, Robert, who had some background in corporate finance, in senior positions at the casinos. Not long after three of his children graduated from college, he vested authority in them over golf courses, hotels and licensing deals.In the White House, Mr. Trump has increasingly leaned on his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, for guidance on dealing with Congress amid the current stalemate. Mr. Kushner, who like Mr. Trump is the son of a wealthy real estate developer, has not always impressed old hands on Capitol Hill.He began some early conversations by saying that Democrats would need to yield because his father-in-law would not budge, a statement that lawmakers found naïve, according to Democrats familiar with the remarks.With Democrats now in charge of the House of Representatives, Mr. Trump also has a new set of adversaries, and other old habits from his years in business have re-emerged.Through his Twitter feed, he has verbally pummeled Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, and tried to drive a wedge between Mr. Schumer and his fellow Democrat, Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Barbara Res, who said she enjoyed much about working for Mr. Trump as a construction executive in the 1980s and 1990s, sees in Ms. Pelosi a new challenge to Mr. Trump’s lifelong tactics. One blind spot she observed was that Mr. Trump “believes he’s better than anyone who ever lived” and saw even the most capable of women as easy to run over.“But there was never a woman with power that he ran up against, until Pelosi,” she said. “And he doesn’t know what to do with it. He’s totally in a corner.”In the interview, Mr. Trump described Ms. Res, Mr. O’Donnell and Mr. Schwartz as disgruntled workers whom he had shunted aside, who had experience with him for relatively brief periods and who were simply using his name for attention.During his years in business, Mr. Trump rarely displayed an interest in details or expert opinions that might have informed whether his plans would actually work. That pattern has also emerged in the shutdown dispute.Thirty years ago, his claimed defeat of Mr. Griffin turned out to be a Pyrrhic victory.Within months of completing construction on his third casino, the Trump Taj Mahal, he could not pay interest to the bondholders who had financed the project. Having overpaid and overleveraged himself on other deals, banks forced him to turnover or sell almost everything.His wealthy father helped bail him out. But Mr. Trump blamed everyone else. He fired nearly all his top executives and stopped paying contractors who had built the casino.In describing the border wall, Mr. Trump has expressed unending confidence in its efficacy. Others, including Representative Will Hurd, a Republican whose Texas district includes part of the border with Mexico, have described it as a tall speed bump, nearly useless without technology to spot illegal crossings immediately and dispatch border agents to quickly respond.Mr. O’Donnell, the casino manager, said long-term consequences never concerned Mr. Trump. He was always willing to pay too much in order to get a deal signed so he could declare victory, he said.“He just wants to get the deal,” Mr. O’Donnell said."

He had been born in Las Vegas, yes, but he lived there for just one year with his undocumented mother before moving with her back to Mexico. He never learned English.These days, Mr. Posada, 19, sees things differently. He makes the short trip between his two lives several times a week, crossing from Mexicali, where he still lives, over a broad walkway to the California border town of Calexico, where he sees his future.I walked home with him one day last week, beginning in Calexico’s overcast downtown plaza, within sight of the border fence. Music blasted loudly in Spanish from a nearby stereo store. As he pushed past the turnstile to cross into Mexico, Mr. Posada gazed quietly at the farm workers on their way back to Mexico from American field jobs, their faces worn and muddy.In Mexicali, his tone turned a bit caustic. He averted his gaze from indigent seniors splayed out on the ground asking for money. He pointed at the irony of a church situated next door to a brothel.“This is what you’ll find here,” he said. “Poverty, drugs and prostitution.”If his feelings toward his American citizenship had been fraught in the past, adulthood clarified a few things. He began to wonder what it meant that he was technically American, what opportunities might be open. He started working toward an American high school equivalency diploma, though he admits his lack of English proficiency remains a significant obstacle.“My mom told me a short time ago, ‘Look, I couldn’t give you nice things like other people have. But I gave you American citizenship, which is what so many people are fighting for,’” he said.He recognizes that now. “But I feel Mexican, I’m not going to lie to you,” he said.When he turned 18, seeking a foothold to life in the United States, Mr. Posada got a job at one of the nearby farms that supply a large portion of Americans’ winter vegetables. It was backbreaking work. He would awaken at 1 a.m. and cross the border with other migrant farmworkers and begin picking by 3. He saw the physical toll the work had taken on Mexican men who had done it for decades.That was not the future he wanted, he thought. “It’s a job that kills you.”Now, he has a job registering low-income residents of Calexico for government-funded wireless plans on cellphones once colloquially known as “Obama phones.” Because nearly everyone in Calexico speaks Spanish, Mr. Posada can do the job without language getting in the way.But it’s a competitive business in a poor area like Calexico, and not necessarily lucrative for people like Mr. Posada, who works on commission. On the day that we met up, he had signed up two customers, making $20 for a day’s work.We crossed back into Mexicali to meet with a friend of his at the Plaza la Cachanilla, a mall with clothing stores, piercing stands and anime shops. His friend, Ivan, is also Mexican and speaks good English. He agreed to help Mr. Posada draw up a study plan to work on the diploma coursework. They’d work together, he offered.“How’s that? He’s Mexican, but he can speak English,” Mr. Posada said, smiling toward his friend. “Hopefully he can help me.”As I waited for a taxi to head back across the border, I shouted to him, “See you soon!”He asked me to say it again. Then one more time after that. He repeated the words to himself a few times under his breath, then grinned. “See you soon!” he yelled back.— JOSE A.

Or feedback about this newsletter? Email us at: crossingtheborder@nytimes.com.Mark Napier is the sheriff of Pima County, Ariz., which includes Tucson and 125 miles of border. Since taking office in 2017, Mr. Napier, a Republican, has drawn headlines for criticizing President Trump’s focus on a border wall. He appeared on an episode of The Daily podcast last month to talk about the border wall.He recently spoke with Manny Fernandez, the Houston bureau chief of The New York Times, to offer a view from the front lines of the drug war. The following is an edited and condensed version of that conversation.Q: What’s the current state of drug trafficking in your county?A: The nature of the drug war has fundamentally changed in the last 10 years. It used to be primarily large quantities of marijuana coming in between the ports of entry. And that was the major threat. And that drug trade seemed to be very, very violent and not as well organized or as sophisticated as the current drug trade. Now what we’re seeing are unimaginably large quantities of hard drugs. And it is true, that primarily we see it coming through the ports of entry. Because that’s a current vulnerability. The drug cartels will always exploit whatever the current vulnerability is.We just in the last couple of weeks interdicted 14 pounds of heroin — you go back five or six years ago, that was unimaginable — and multiple pounds of methamphetamine and 10,000 fentanyl pills. Now think of that: 10,000. Each one of those is a potential overdose.What was a typical load of heroin a few years ago?Years ago, we’re talking in ounces. If you interdicted in our area several ounces of heroin, or methamphetamine for that matter, that was a big deal. That was a pretty good collar. Now we’re talking about pounds.What does the fall of El Chapo, the Mexican drug lord, mean to a local sheriff on the ground on the border? (Read more here about the conviction of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the crime lord known as El Chapo. And read here about how drug money still lubricates the U.S.-Mexico border.)We have to understand that the drug cartels are the ultimate entrepreneurial organizations. When you take down an alleged kingpin like El Chapo, there is succession planning there. I mean, they’re a business. While that does help, and maybe creates a little void in the organizational function for awhile, there’s so much money involved, that that will be filled very rapidly, and they’ll be back in business.One thing that’s missing from the discourse about how we discuss this problem — which is unfortunate — is dealing with the demand side of the equation. The fundamental fact is this: As long as we have this appetite for illegal drugs in this country, there will be somebody somewhere finding a way to satisfy that, and they will become incredibly creative about how to do it.So our demand will create more El Chapos?It’s encouraging that we can bring significant elements of the drug cartels to justice. That’s an encouraging sign. But I don’t know that it’s going to be a long-term fix or something that will significantly ameliorate the problems we have in our communities. That vacuum will be filled by another version of the same character.Late last week, the American Civil Liberties Union and two other groups sued the Trump administration over a recent policy requiring people who are seeking asylum to wait in Mexico.Here are four ways to go deeper into the conversation.• Facing prolonged waits in dangerous conditions in parts of Northern Mexico, many migrants who arrived in Tijuana as part of a recent caravan from Central America appear to have given up, Mexican officials said last week. Many are either returning home, or accepting jobs in Mexico.

217,"You could always slight the very rich by calling them moneybags, robber barons, fat cats or plutocrats. Billionaire was a neutral word, grounded in math: Such a person could spend $10 million a year, for 100 years, before the pile was gone.Then came Howard Schultz, a billionaire times two, insisting that people not use the B-word in describing him. Better to refer to the 540 Americans in his sensitive class as “people of means.” For this he was roundly mocked, and rightly so.The pushback to the pusher of our favorite South American drug is a fair start. But there is much more to clean up. For we live in a time when language has been weaponized for high crimes and petty cruelties, while neutralized when it should state the obvious. Democracy may die in darkness, as the slogan of a rival newspaper has it, but it also slips away under cover of euphemism.You can date it to Republican repackaging of the estate tax as a “death tax,” or tax cuts for the rich morphing into “tax relief” for the overly burdened. And were French fries really “freedom fries” during a spasm of faux-patriotism?Maybe the food marketers started us down this road when “natural” was slapped onto any label — turpentine, for example, which also happens to be gluten-free. Or Big Pharma, using “wellness” to describe treatment by drugs with names from a dance party: Lyrica, Celebrex, and then the Cialis gets passed around.All of that can be excused as framing to get an advantage. The Democrats are doing it now with the Green New Deal and “Medicare for all” — both of which sound pleasantly pie-in-the-sky and historically resonant until you look at the details, which their sponsors didn’t bother to do.The most egregious of political language fraud, as George Orwell noted in his seminal essay on the subject, is used for “the defense of the indefensible.” To that end, the Trump administration has been a fount of criminal circumlocution.We all know about “alternative facts” and “truth isn’t truth” and “fake news” — used by the administration to describe reality. But less attention has been paid to this government’s description of cages for young children separated from their parents. The Trump administration has invented “tender age” shelters to defend the indefensible. It sounds so caring.And Trump is downgrading “national emergency” from something that comes with a siren for a soundtrack to just another term for cheap political expediency. It used to be a big deal for a reputable news organization to flat out call the president a liar. Now, liar must be the most-used descriptor linked to this president. It’s also the right word. But “liar” has lost its sting, because Trump clearly doesn’t care about telling the truth. As a journalist, I’d get in more trouble if I said the president is fat — my bad, I mean plus-sized.The word “socialist” is back in play. This term also used to sting, evoking Cold War authoritarians and empty store shelves. That was true then. What’s true now is that socialist “has lost its meaning,” especially among millennials, as Peter Buttigieg, the young presidential aspirant and mayor of South Bend, Ind., said.If used to describe help for the elderly, subsidized college or affordable health care, socialist is a net plus. If it implies total government control without choice, it’s a loser. We’ve only just begun the modern reframing of this power word.At the White House, “executive time” is the bogus term for the majority of the president’s day spent watching Fox News hosts praise him, tweeting insults or playing virtual golf in the new room-sized simulator just installed in the house where Lincoln slept. Kramer did more work in the “Seinfeld” episode where he pretended to have a job.The border “wall” is a “complexifier,” to use the odd word that multibillionaire Jeff Bezos introduced, but also central to Trumpian Newspeak. The wall doesn’t exist, not in the form Trump has described it — “a great, great wall” made of “hardened concrete.” And yet, it’ll soon be finished. How so?In a masterstroke of up-is-down, Trump’s rally in El Paso this week switched the “Build the Wall” slogan of his cult to “Finish the Wall.” As my colleagues at Upshot showed, Trump keeps weaseling out of his wall promise by changing the wording — a fence, a barrier, some German shepherds.The language is crucial here, because it’s the central lie of his presidency. Like Schultz, Trump wants to use his own verbal wallpaper to cover the truth. "
218,"WASHINGTON — Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Congress rejected President Donald Trump's proposed cuts to diplomacy and foreign aid budgets as dangerous to national security on Wednesday, setting the stage for a budget battle with the White House.Representative Eliot Engel, Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Trump's proposal was ""dead"" as soon as it arrived in Congress, during the second of two House of Representatives hearings where Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took questions from lawmakers for some seven hours.""This budget ... signals to the world that the Trump foreign policy is one of disengagement,"" Engel said.The senior Republican on the House subcommittee that oversees State Department spending, Hal Rogers, described the budget plan at an earlier hearing as ""woefully inadequate"" to cover the administration's foreign policy and security goals.The proposal slashes the State Department and aid budget by about $11 billion to $40 billion, he said.""Given what the world looks like right now, this approach seems detached from reality,"" Rogers said, citing the need for U.S. leadership in a world with millions of displaced people, more countries facing instability and rising tensions.Democratic Representative Nita Lowey, who chairs the full Appropriations Committee, also rejected the ""draconian"" cuts. ""I am astonished that three years into his administration, the president still does not appreciate the merits of sustained investments in diplomacy and development,"" she said.In written remarks before the hearings, Pompeo said the budget sought to double funds for countering China's increased aggression, and strengthen systems to target Russia's growing threats to the United States and Western world.""China is proactively applying its power and exerting its influence in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond,"" Pompeo said, adding: ""This budget prioritizes countering Russian malign influence in Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia, and further strengthens the Department's own systems against malign actors.""Pompeo said resources would also fund work to reach a deal with North Korea on curbing its nuclear program and push back against Iran's role in Iraq, Yemen and Syria.He said the budget also requested new authority to support a democratic transition in Venezuela, including transferring up to $500 million to foreign assistance accounts.'EMBARRASSING AND DANGEROUS'Trump's proposal calls for spending more U.S. taxpayer money on the military and a U.S.-Mexico border wall, while overhauling social safety-net programs in a budget plan likely to die in Congress but live on in his 2020 re-election campaign.Democratic Representative Lois Frankel called Trump's budget proposal ""embarrassing and dangerous.""Pompeo came under repeated questioning to explain the administration's policy toward Saudi Arabia, from lawmakers concerned about the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident, as well as the imprisonment and abuse of women's rights activists.He insisted repeatedly that human rights were a top Trump administration priority, and said efforts were under way ""across the government"" to investigate what happened and hold accountable anyone responsible, even the highest Saudi officials. Several Democrats sharply criticized an expanded anti-abortion policy Pompeo outlined on Tuesday, which cuts funding to groups that support abortion rights. ""Your budget and action is devastating to the health of women around the world,"" Frankel said.""Your administration is abortion obsessed,"" she said.Republicans said they backed the policy and several praised Pompeo for his stance.Pompeo was reluctant to detail the administration's plan and timeline for releasing an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan developed by White House advisers Jason Greenblatt and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law.He said the proposed plan sought to tackle areas of a Middle East conflict that previous U.S. administrations failed to resolve. ""Our vision will demonstrate our commitment that we want Palestinians to have a better life as well,"" Pompeo said, adding he hoped the Palestinians would view the United States as a ""fair arbiter.""Pompeo was pressed by Democrat Barbara Lee about proposed cuts in funding to African countries. She said Trump sought cuts of 56 percent to Ghana, 33 percent to Ethiopia, 14 percent to Mozambique, 44 percent to South Sudan, and 71 percent to South Africa, mostly in global health funding. ""This is after a well-documented track record of controversial statements from the president identifying certain countries as 's-hole' countries, and quite frankly, attitudes toward the continent in general,"" said Lee. Pompeo pushed back at the criticism, saying the gist of the question was ""in my judgment fundamentally unsound.""

219,"WASHINGTON — At first, he vowed to “take the mantle” for closing part of the federal government. Then he blamed Democrats, saying they “now own the shutdown.” By Friday, President Trump was back to owning it again. “I’m very proud of doing what I’m doing,” he declared.Two weeks into the showdown over a border wall, Mr. Trump is now crafting his own narrative of the confrontation that has come to consume his presidency. Rather than a failure of negotiation, the shutdown has become a test of political virility, one in which he insists he is receiving surreptitious support from unlikely quarters.Not only are national security hawks cheering him on to defend a porous southern border, but so too are former presidents who he says have secretly confessed to him that they should have done what he is doing. Not only do federal employees accept being furloughed or forced to work without wages, they have assured him that they would give up paychecks so that he can stand strong.Never mind how implausible such assertions might seem. The details do not matter to Mr. Trump as much as dominating the debate. After an oddly quiescent holiday season in which he complained via Twitter about being left at home alone — “poor me” — he has taken the public stage this week clearly intent on framing the conflict on his own terms.[President Trump warned that he was considering declaring a national emergency to build the border wall.]People close to the president described him as emboldened since members of Congress returned to Washington after the break, giving him not only a clear target to swing at but helping him focus on a fight that he is convinced is a political winner. One aide said Mr. Trump believes he has gained the upper hand in the public battle.Although surveys at first showed more Americans blaming him for the shutdown than Democrats, later polling showed the fault more evenly split. And the voters he cares most about, his core conservative supporters, are more enthusiastic than the public at large. He has told people that “my people” love the fight, and that he believes he is winning.In the past three days, Mr. Trump has appeared in public three times to get his version of the story out while Democrats celebrated their takeover of the House. At a lengthy cabinet meeting on Wednesday, an appearance with border patrol union leaders on Thursday and a news conference with Republican congressional leaders in the Rose Garden on Friday, he engaged in quintessentially Trumpian stream of conscious discussions that ranged widely and unpredictably.At one point, he argued that the Soviet Union was right to invade Afghanistan in 1979 to stop terrorists, a revisionist version that provoked a strong reaction in Kabul and earned a sharp rebuke from the often supportive editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, which said, “We cannot recall a more absurd misstatement of history by an American President.”At another point, Mr. Trump mocked India for doing no more in Afghanistan than building a library, which generated headlines in New Delhi about the “jab” at its prime minister, not to mention more head scratching because, according to Indian news media, the country has not built a library in Afghanistan in many years.He repeatedly claimed that the new trade agreement he has negotiated with Mexico and Canada means that Mexico really is paying for the wall, even though the pact has yet to be approved by Congress and has no direct connection to border security. He has made misleading claims about how many terrorists might be coming across the border.Mr. Trump’s version of events differed even from the other people in the room at Friday’s meeting at the White House. When Democratic congressional leaders emerged after two hours, they described a “contentious” session with no meaningful progress as the president threatened to keep the government closed for “months or even years.” When Mr. Trump emerged shortly afterward, he described a “very, very productive meeting” and predicted the standoff could be “fixed very quickly.”Two people briefed on the meeting said that White House officials viewed the conversation as the first civil discussion that had taken place between the two sides, and it left some of Mr. Trump’s aides hopeful. Indeed, Mr. Trump made a point of publicly saying nothing but relatively positive things about the Democrats on Friday.Optimistic that a deal really is within reach, the president said he would have Vice President Mike Pence; Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary; and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, meet with Democrats over the weekend.But there were questions about his own side of the aisle. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, unlike other congressional Republican leaders, was not present for the Rose Garden news conference. “He’s running the Senate,” Mr. Trump explained, even though the Senate had adjourned hours earlier and Mr. McConnell’s spokesman said the senator did not know about the news conference.The president nonetheless was feeling energized by support he said he had received for the fight — including the very federal employees who are not being paid as a result of the partial shutdown.“A lot of people that you think are upset — and certainly they’re not thrilled — but they say, ‘Sir, do the right thing, we need border security,’” Mr. Trump said. “And these are people that won’t be getting paid.”As for his predecessors, he said, “This should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me, and they all know it. Some of them have told me that we should have done it.”By all public accounts, Mr. Trump had not spoken with his living predecessors since his inauguration until former President George Bush died last month. Mr. Trump called Mr. Bush’s son, former President George W. Bush, to offer condolences, but the subject of the wall did not come up, according to Mr. Bush’s office. A few days later, at the elder Mr. Bush’s funeral, Mr. Trump encountered his predecessors for the first time since taking office, but he sat quietly without talking with them during the service.The younger Mr. Bush built miles of wall and fencing along the Mexico line while he was president, but said it could not cover the entire border and insisted that enforcement should be coupled with an overhaul of immigration law to permit many people in the country illegally to stay. Former President Barack Obama has repeatedly criticized Mr. Trump’s proposed wall, and former President Jimmy Carter has said technological improvements would be more effective at protecting the border.The White House did not say afterward which presidents Mr. Trump was referring to, but a senior administration official said he was probably referring to public comments his predecessors have made about the need for border security, not necessarily for a wall specifically.As he careened this week from subject to subject and assertion to assertion, an energized Mr. Trump seemed to be enjoying himself. He went on for more than an hour and a half on Wednesday and another hour on Friday.“Should we keep this going or not, folks?” he asked reporters at one point before noticing that it was a cold January day in the Rose Garden.“Should we keep this going a little bit longer?” he asked again. “Let me know when you get tired.”One thing Mr. Trump was not was tired."

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox.The story surrounding Robert Kraft’s sex solicitation trial just keeps getting more salacious. Late last week, The Miami Herald reported that Li Yang — the owner of the massage parlor where Kraft, the billionaire owner of the New England Patriots, is accused of paying for sexual acts — had partied with President Trump and even helped Chinese donors gain access to the president.Stephen Colbert couldn’t pass up the opportunity to make a few lowbrow puns based on the reported crimes. (Actually, more than a few: By the end of the segment, he boasted of telling nine straight massage parlor jokes. )Along the way, he also emphasized how threatening the revelations about Yang’s activities could be for Trump.Late-night comics made fun of Trump last week for seeming to refer to Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, as “Tim Apple” during an event in the Oval Office. But few expected to still be talking about the flub nearly a week later.Trump, however, has not let the news die. He falsely claimed to donors on Friday that he had, in fact, used Cook’s last name, Axios reported. And on Monday he felt the need to defend himself again, with a different story. This time, he said on Twitter that he “quickly referred to Tim + Apple as Tim/Apple as an easy way to save time & words.”Jimmy Kimmel responded with sarcasm, then disbelief.Conan O’Brien and his sidekick, Andy Richter, riffed on the news in their own characteristically offbeat way.Jimmy Kimmel recapped Part 1 of the season finale of “The Bachelor,” which has been taking some unexpected turns.The Los Angeles Galaxy are about to unveil a statue of David Beckham, and James Corden organized an elaborate prank to help ruin the moment.John Turturro, who stars with Julianne Moore in the new film “Gloria Bell,” will sit down with Colbert on Tuesday.At South by Southwest, the reaction to Jordan Peele’s new movie, “Us,” was electric.Plus, Ideas for What to Watch Tonight:The 50 Best Movies on Netflix Right NowThe 25 Best Films of the 21st CenturyThe Best Movies on Amazon Prime Video Right Now"
223,"One night a year, during the State of the Union address, President Trump sets aside his affinity for combat to offer up 90 minutes of stand-up comity to a national audience.“The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda,” Mr. Trump said, opening his speech on a conventionally presidential note on Tuesday. “It is the agenda of the American people.” A couple of hours earlier, during a private lunch with network anchors that did not stay private long, Mr. Trump called Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, “nasty,” described former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as “dumb,” ripped into Senator John McCain, and derided Senator Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas.”The speech itself, embedded with patriotic language and delivered in a reassuring tone, veered between two moods — combative and conciliatory — reflecting a president at a crossroads ahead of an uncertain 2019.Here are four takeaways.For more than a month, Mr. Trump has threatened to invoke a state of emergency along the southern border with Mexico, in an attempt to circumvent Congress, which has refused to give him $5.7 billion for a border wall.But it was not until this week that Senate Republicans — many of whom vehemently oppose the idea on the grounds that it tramples legislative prerogative — made it clear that diverting funding from other projects for a wall, in the name of a national emergency, was a nonstarter.For the moment, Mr. Trump heeded their wishes. The emergency declaration was not among his demands for increased border security.It was, to a significant degree, an act of political self-protection.At the weekly Republican Senate lunch held in the Capitol a few hours before Mr. Trump’s speech, Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority whip, was asked about the likelihood of the president invoking emergency powers. Mr. Thune replied by saying he believed that the president would avoid a confrontation with his own party because too many Republicans opposed it — and it would take only four Republican defections to pass a measure opposing the move.Mr. Trump would do the right thing, he predicted, because “all you have to do is count to four,” Mr. Thune quipped, according to a person in attendance.Mr. Trump began the night by optimistically playing up “a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it.”And he expressed support for a variety of popular initiatives that enjoy widespread popularity among Democrats, including new funding to eradicate AIDS, a campaign to reduce childhood cancers and yet another commitment to try to fix the country’s “crumbling infrastructure.”Then, about 15 minutes into the address, Mr. Trump hit on an issue foremost in his consciousness — the looming threat of congressional investigations into his conduct.First, he offered what amounted to a plea for the new Democratic majority in the House to avoid “ridiculous partisan investigations” and cautioned his enemies not to seek “revenge” against him.Then came the bluntest of threats to the woman sitting behind him, Speaker Nancy Pelosi: “If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn’t work that way!” he said.“We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad,” he said.Already facing a divided Congress, Mr. Trump has been rebuked by members of his own party in recent days over his decision to pull troops from Syria and his demands for a border wall.In response, he invoked two issues that have been used to rally divided conservatives for decades — the fights against abortion and socialism.“There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days,” he said, referring to efforts by Democrats in New York and Virginia to loosen restrictions on abortion rights.In recent days, Republicans on Capitol Hill have been circulating talking points urging them to highlight plans by Democrats, including the freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, to increase taxes on the wealthy.“Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” Mr. Trump said. “America was founded on liberty and independence — and not government coercion, domination and control.”Mr. Trump dedicated several minutes to listing his economic accomplishments on behalf of women as he faced row upon row of seats occupied by Democratic women wearing white, in a visual demonstration of their unprecedented power in a House run by one of their own.“No one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year,” said Mr. Trump, who seemed genuinely surprised by the thunderous applause it evoked from women on both sides of the aisle.“You weren’t supposed to do that,” said the president, who went on to praise the record-breaking election of 117 women to Congress in 2018.That, too, garnered a hearty ovation. He has a long way to go, however.Recent polls show that large majorities of women disapprove of his performance.With 10 days left for Congress to pass a border security package and avert another government shutdown, Mr. Trump devoted a significant portion of his speech to making the case for his signature campaign proposal: a wall at the southern border.“This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall,” he said, adding, “Simply put, WALLS WORK and WALLS SAVE LIVES.”But as Mr. Trump raised the time frame to keep the government fully funded, the Democrats tensed and Republicans continued to applaud. Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, buried her head in her hands. As he detailed a litany of familiar talking points about caravans marching toward the United States, there was a disgruntled round of groans, punctuated by a couple boos as they looked around at each other, shaking their heads.[Trump wants a border wall. Here’s what’s in place already.]Representative Veronica Escobar, Democrat of Texas, whose district includes most of El Paso, was visibly angry after Mr. Trump referenced her district and the decrease in crime. She appeared to mouth that it was safe before the wall and after the wall. “Oh my God, oh my God,” she mouthed to her colleagues, her arms crossed as other representatives looked over in her direction.There were also some unhappy murmurs when he described the increase in troops at the southern border and scoffs at his description of the “savage MS-13 gang.”The audience for Mr. Trump’s State of the Union address looked like a striking sea of white, with Democratic women — many dressed in white in a nod to the women’s suffragist movement — sitting together. Midway through the president’s speech, they did something completely unexpected: They stood up and cheered.“No one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year,” Mr. Trump said, prompting the women to roar their approval. After all, many of them had new jobs, in the House, which they took from men.“You weren’t supposed to do that,” the president said, smiling.“All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the work force than ever before,” Mr. Trump went on, adding, “Don’t sit yet. You’re going to like this.”And then he delivered his biggest applause line: “Exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before.”It was a striking moment for a president who has been routinely accused of misogyny, who paid hush money to a pornographic film actress and a Playboy model and who spoke in vulgar terms as he admitted on videotape that he had sexually assaulted women.Stacey Abrams, the former minority leader of the Georgia legislature, narrowly lost her bid to be the first African-American female governor in the South, but it was the way she lost — amid charges of voter suppression and vote rigging — that really rankled.In choosing Ms. Abrams to give the Democratic response, her party’s leaders were tapping a crusader for voting rights, and that is what she delivered.“While I acknowledged the results of the 2018 election here in Georgia, I did not and we cannot accept efforts to undermine our right to vote,” Ms. Abrams said. “This is the next battle for our democracy, one where all eligible citizens can have their say about the vision we want for our country. We must reject the cynicism that says allowing every eligible vote to be cast and counted is a ‘power grab.’ Americans understand that these are the values our brave men and women in uniform and our veterans risk their lives to defend.”She also tackled race, even as a Democratic governor, Ralph Northam of Virginia, fights for his political survival after photos of a man in black face and another in a Ku Klux Klan robe emerged in his medical school yearbook.“We fought Jim Crow with the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, yet we continue to confront racism from our past and in our present,” she said, “which is why we must hold everyone from the very highest offices to our own families accountable for racist words and deeds — and call racism what it is: wrong.”Mr. Trump plans to sit down with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, this month in Vietnam, a country chosen as a neutral location for their second nuclear summit meeting, but one that also has plenty of symbolic significance.Mr. Trump hopes the meeting will jump-start a diplomatic effort that has stalled since their first encounter, last June in Singapore. While North Korea since then has refrained from overtly provocative actions like testing nuclear warheads or ballistic missiles, it has yet to agree to actually give up any piece of its atomic arsenal.“Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong-un is a good one,” Mr. Trump said. “Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27th and 28th in Vietnam.”After spending the first portion of his speech patting himself on the back for what he views as his administration’s accomplishments, including low unemployment, Mr. Trump issued a stern warning to the Democrats now in charge of the House.“An economic miracle is taking place in the United States — and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations,” he said. “If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn’t work that way!”Speaker Nancy Pelosi smirked behind him. Representative Adam Schiff of California, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, smiled. He has already begin examining whether money laundering could have motivated Mr. Trump’s coziness with Russian oligarchs.This year’s State of the Union address was the second longest in recorded history, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The project’s data dates to 1964. Tonight’s address surpassed Mr. Trump’s first State of the Union speech by about two minutes, but falls short of former President Bill Clinton’s 2000 address by about six minutes.President Trump delivered a message of bipartisan unity on Tuesday night in his first address to Congress in the new era of divided government, but any hope of enduring harmony was dispelled long before he arrived at the Capitol.Mr. Trump, who has warred with Democrats for weeks over his plan to build a wall along the nation’s southwestern border, hoped to use the nationally televised speech to present himself as a leader who can work across party lines even as he continued to press lawmakers to give him money for the barrier.“Together, we can break decades of political stalemate,” Mr. Trump told lawmakers from the rostrum of the House of Representatives. “We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future. The decision is ours to make.”Mr. Trump signaled that he would not back off his hard-line immigration policies that have polarized the country. “No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration,” he was to add, according to excerpts released by the White House. “Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.”Read more from Peter Baker.Speaker Nancy Pelosi was spared any discomfort that might have come with the ritual introduction of the president of the United States. The president jumped the gun.Before she could utter the traditional, “Ladies and gentlemen, I give to you the president of the United States,” Mr. Trump had already started speaking.While Mr. Trump forgot to have Ms. Pelosi introduce him, another Republican president — George W. Bush — made a big deal of Ms. Pelosi’s introduction of him in 2007, the year she first became speaker.“Tonight, I have a high privilege and distinct honor of my own — as the first president to begin the State of the Union message with these words: Madam Speaker,” Mr. Bush said then.[Fact Check: What President Trump Got Right and Wrong in His Speech]"

Here’s the latest: Prime Minister Theresa May returned to Parliament with an alternative blueprint for Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U.Infuriating some lawmakers, it looked a lot like her initial plan, which was voted down last week in the most resounding parliamentary defeat in British history.Why it matters: The face off could become another epic political showdown that leaves the Brexit process where it has been for months — stuck in limbo with no obvious path forward.Go deeper: The speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercrow, has emerged as the surprise star of Brexit after he broke with precedent to wrest some control over the decision-making process.President Trump, faced with increasing backlash over the longest shutdown in U.S. history, made an offer over the weekend: temporary protections for roughly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants, known as “Dreamers,” in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for his border wall.Democrats called it “hostage taking” and refused to negotiate until the government reopens.Some of the 800,000 furloughed federal employees are turning to pawnshops and brokers for short-term loans.Go deeper: People who have done business with Mr. Trump over the years say his uncompromising fixation on a southern border wall is consistent with the negotiating tactics he used for decades in the private sector, focused foremost on claiming victory.In other U.S. news: In a rare public statement, the office of the special counsel running the Russia investigation disputed a BuzzFeed News report that claimed Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, had told prosecutors the president directed him to lie in Congress. The Chinese economy grew by 6.6 percent in 2018, according to official numbers released on Monday — the slowest pace of growth since 1990.But many economists, citing detailed data, see more slowing than government figures show.Retail figures slowed markedly in the second half of the year, weighed down by a steep tumble in car and smartphone sales. Activity at factories has slowed as the trade war with the U.S. begins to bite. And the real estate market has stagnated.Why it matters: For years, China’s economy has been a major driver for growth around the world and a slowdown there is one of the many reasons the global economy is decelerating.What’s next? The Chinese government is already trying to help the economy reverse course. It has green lighted big-ticket projects, like new subway lines in many cities, to move forward, and pumped more money into the financial system. China’s leaders have also pledged to cut taxes to shore up sagging business sentiment.Go deeper: After decades of functioning as the world’s cheap factory, China must now embrace high-value manufacturing to maintain growth, writes our New New World columnist, Li Yuan.A just-published study warns that the ice sheet covering the massive island, which lies mainly above the Arctic Circle, is melting at such an accelerated rate that it may become “a major contributor to sea level rise” around the world within two decades.The study’s authors found that ice loss in 2012 was nearly four times the rate in 2003, adding to research showing that the melting is speeding up as the warming increases. Another study has found Greenland’s ice loss had reached its fastest rate in at least 350 years.Why it matters: The study is the latest in a series of papers published this month suggesting that scientific estimates of the effects of a warming planet have been, if anything, too conservative. Researchers say they collectively underline the need for a sharp reduction in emissions.Warning to Beijing: More than 100 prominent scholars and former diplomats, including two former U.S. ambassadors, signed an open letter cautioning that the detention of two Canadians threatens the flow of ideas with China essential for policy work and research aimed at narrowing international rifts. The letter calls for the immediate release of the Canadians, who were detained last month after Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei, was arrested in Canada.Crackdown on young communists: Chinese activists say the authorities have been forcing them to watch taped confessions from fellow student activists who say they spread false information and violated the law. It’s the government’s latest effort to quell a resilient pro-labor movement fed by the ideas of Mao, Marx and Lenin, which are required subjects at China’s universities.Genetically edited babies: He Jiankui, the Chinese scientist who said in November that he had used the Crispr gene-editing technique to alter human embryos, “seriously violated” state regulations, according to an initial government report. The findings indicate that he and his collaborators are likely to face criminal charges.Carlos Ghosn: The former chairman of Nissan, who has been charged with financial misconduct, offered a higher bail amount and pledged to hire private security guards in a bid to be freed from jail.

225,"The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau chief. Sign up to get it by email.___Parliament approved a bill this week to allow medical evacuation for asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus over the opposition of Prime Minister Scott Morrison, throwing Australia into another visceral debate over immigration.In the coming months, with an election approaching, we can expect to hear all kinds of intense and moralistic rhetoric.Mr. Morrison and his supporters are already arguing that opening the door even a little to settlement in Australia will encourage a flood of migrants and deaths at sea. Labor, the Greens and others on the left are maintaining that immigration is a net positive for Australia and that cruelty must be restrained.This is all part of a broader conversation across the West about migration and national identity; the White House announced just today that President Trump will declare a state of emergency to build a border wall.And it’s a conversation that matters. These disputes, however they end up, will shape many countries, and the world, for decades.But for me, there’s a certain familiarity to the discussion, not just in Washington but also in Canberra.I’ve written about immigration for nearly 20 years, from various countries, from the neighborhoods and towns where immigrants cluster to the halls of power where decisions are made.Along the way, there are a few things I’ve learned to look out for.The Hero Vs. Villain TrapIn heated moments like this one, immigrants and the nuances of their lives and motivations tend to be reduced to the most simplistic of archetypes.Either they are criminals (the worst of the worst, rapists, murders, pedophiles) or they are blameless hard-working heroes (say, doctors or professional basketball players from Australia in the N.B.A.).The reality — and this should be obvious, but often gets overlooked — is that most migrants are in the messy middle with the rest of us. They’re good and bad, they’re parents and workers, and they’re mostly just trying to make life a little bit better for themselves and their loved ones.This idea that they are somehow different and more extreme reflects little more than the political need for narrative and division. Beware of the packaging of simplicity.“It’s a Fact-Free Zone”When I was reporting a series of stories back in 2012 — the first to show that the era of mass Mexican migration was over — an expert I talked to warned that policymakers would ignore my findings.Immigration, he said, is an issue driven by emotion. “It’s a fact-free zone,” he said. And he was right.No matter how many cold hard facts get put into the public domain in the next few months — and I hope there are a lot of them — don’t expect the politicians to adjust their arguments. They’re appealing less to the head than the heart.And look out for what’s missing too.You probably won’t hear anyone, for example, pointing out that the decision to migrate is typically a long-term bet, calculated and paid for over several years, which rarely responds to immediate policy changes in predictable ways.There are both push (from a country) and pull (to a country) factors and, according to sociologists and demographers, it is often impossible to make sweeping cause-and-effect conclusions based on one element alone.Every immigrant has a story all their own. People move and flee for reasons that often have very little to do with what policymakers do to deter or assist them.Interaction WinsDuring a long road trip from the Mexican to the Canadian border, for a project exploring immigration in Middle America, I met dozens of Americans with all kinds of views about immigration.But there are two people, both older white women, who I still think about.One was in Farmers Branch, Texas, an area that had tried, but failed, to push out immigrants who might not be documented with a series of strict residential rental rules and policing. She told me through her locked screen door that she wanted tougher enforcement; she was afraid.Another was in Wichita, in Kansas, in an area that had gone from a declining white, working-class community to one that was reviving but more mixed in terms of ethnicity and origin.The woman’s name was Francene Sharp. You can read her full story here, but what stuck with me was her reaction to a break in at her home by some local Mexican teenagers.She had cause to be angry. But because she’d spent years getting to know many of her other immigrant neighbors — including a friend who she called for help right after the break in — her response and her views were tempered and calm.What she had (that the woman in Texas did not) was real-life interaction, enough of it to prevent her from making sweeping judgments about people or policy.She relied on her own deep experience and a remarkable openness to combat the “fact-free zone” and the “hero/villain trap.”Border policy was on her radar; she was no supporter of “open borders.” But she was far more interested in why those teenagers who broke in were not at home studying. Integration and community mattered more to her than border walls.Which brings me to what I’ll be looking for in this year’s Australian (and American) immigration debate.Will there be people pushing the conversation beyond border enforcement and detention?Who, if anyone, will be asking: How can immigration be studied, discussed and shaped in conjunction with immigrants to ensure that Australia (the country that often calls itself “the world’s most successful multicultural nation”) lives up to that promise?Now for a few stories of the week (plus a few surprising recommendations from Paul Krugman).As always, you can share your thoughts in our NYT Australia Facebook group.

226,"WASHINGTON — As he prepared to finally emerge from the White House on Monday morning, after days of complaining that he had been cooped up there waiting for Democrats to negotiate with him to end a 24-day government shutdown, President Trump momentarily seemed to forget where he was headed.“Getting ready to address the Farm Convention today in Nashville, Tennessee,” the president said in a Twitter message. “See you in a little while.”Farmers in Tennessee would have to wait: Mr. Trump was actually scheduled to visit an agricultural conference in Louisiana on Monday. And when he did, he was on the ground for little more than two hours before flying back to the White House.Mr. Trump has made it a repeated point of pride that he has been confined to the capital in recent weeks while waiting for his Democratic adversaries to give in and agree to spending $5.8 billion on his border wall, but he has actually been stuck in what his allies say is an uncomfortable limbo. It has made him wax wistfully about being unable to visit Mar-a-Lago, his gilded bunker by the sea where if members disagree with him on anything — from the firmness of the house meatloaf recipe to his isolationist approach to foreign allies — they tend to keep those opinions to themselves.So, unable to resume his weekend routine of soliciting friendly advice from club members on the patio or spending sunny mornings at his nearby golf club, Mr. Trump has tried to make the snowy confines of Washington feel more like his Palm Beach cocoon.The results are mixed.Since the shutdown began Dec. 22, Mr. Trump has left the White House fewer than 10 times. He has shared his shut-in routine with America: When not at work in the Oval Office, he has frittered away the hours by watching the multiple flat-screen TVs installed in the White House residence, gazing out of secured windows, tweeting at his enemies and phoning his friends.“Wish I could share with everyone the beauty and majesty of being in the White House and looking outside at the snow filled lawns and Rose Garden,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Sunday as the chaos of an embittered capital was all but silenced by snow. Melania Trump, the first lady, then shared a photo of the wintry wonderland to give Americans a visual.But the flurry of tweets Mr. Trump sent shortly afterward attacking assorted perceived foes, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, his first announced Democratic opponent in 2020, and the billionaire Jeff Bezos, seemed to show that not even the most dedicated of homebody presidents is immune from a bout of cabin fever.“I think it was harmful to him psychologically that he didn’t make it down here over the holidays,” Laurence Leamer, a longtime Palm Beach resident who has known Mr. Trump since the 1990s and has written a book on Mar-a-Lago, wrote in an email. “Despite his impulsive exterior, he’s a man of routine, and that’s what Mar-a-Lago is all about.”Both Mr. Trump and White House officials have said that he will remain in Washington for as long as the shutdown persists, though allies expect him to give in and make an appearance in Palm Beach over the long Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend.In a statement, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, said the president was at work whether he was at the White House, one of his “personal properties” or riding on Air Force One.“The president is always working,” Ms. Sanders said. “During the time leading up to the shutdown and since, he has been almost entirely at the White House working to find solutions to deal with the humanitarian and national security crisis at our southern border.”Democrats, Ms. Sanders added, “have spent their time at beach resorts, watching Broadway shows and attending cocktail receptions with lobbyists.”Ms. Sanders was referring to a trip organized by the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which flew three dozen or so House members to San Juan for two days of receptions and meetings on the damage to the island from Hurricane Maria as well as a performance of “Hamilton” with its creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda. Although Republicans said Speaker Nancy Pelosi was one of those attending, a spokesman said she, like the president, stayed in Washington for the weekend.A person familiar with the president’s thinking who spoke on the condition of anonymity described Mr. Trump as both a “workaholic” and a “homebody.” The president, that person said, has been sensitive to the criticism that he is vacationing when he visits his assorted properties on the weekends, when in fact that has been his preferred mode of weekending for decades.Stuck in Washington over the weekend, Mr. Trump called into the Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro’s TV show to remind Americans that he was still in work mode.In a lengthy phone call with Ms. Pirro on Saturday evening, the president angrily defended his demand for $5 billion in border wall funding and attacked news reports that the F.B.I. has conducted an investigation into whether he has worked on behalf of Russia.And the president stated once again that he relished the idea of stewing at home alone.“I like the symbol of me being here and them being at some play in a nice location having a good time,” Mr. Trump said, joining in the bashing of the Puerto Rico trip.The last time Mr. Trump visited Puerto Rico, he was panned for throwing paper towels into a crowd.“I haven’t actually left the White House in months,” Mr. Trump said to Ms. Pirro before acknowledging that he had in fact left. “I’ve been here virtually every night, I guess every night other than one day I flew to Iraq and then to Germany to see our troops.”Mr. Trump has long enjoyed puttering around his homes, said Timothy O’Brien, the author of the 2005 book “TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald.” The president does not enjoy extensive travel, or sleeping or eating under a roof that is not his own, and he has long imported friends and associates to visit him for dinner.“Before he was president,” Mr. O’Brien wrote in an email, “he favored the familiar because it allowed an antisocial teetotaler to mingle selectively with other people — on his own terms and under his control — before retreating back inside to do what he enjoys spending most of his time doing: sitting in front of a TV with a cheeseburger watching sports.”Mr. Leamer, the author, said that Mr. Trump is “as isolated as any public figure could conceivably be,” and added that Mr. Trump’s gregarious exterior masked the habits of a loner.""He has walled himself off from the rest of the world,” Mr. Leamer said. “He loves to go out and receive the accolades of his adoring supporters, but as soon as the applause dies out, he’s back into his own private world.”At the conference in New Orleans on Monday, Mr. Trump received a standing ovation — the same reception he gets whenever supporters spot him at Mar-a-Lago. He praised the New Orleans Saints and bragged that an ally had placed about 100 phone calls to make sure that he would actually turn up.Then he returned to Washington for another at-home event — welcoming members of the Clemson University football team to the White House to celebrate their national championship last year.The president greeted reporters in the White House dining room, where he proudly displayed a table piled high with burgers from McDonald’s, Wendy’s, and Burger King. Another table in back was covered with Domino’s pizza and fries.Ms. Sanders had an explanation for the menu, putting it in political terms. “Because the Democrats refuse to negotiate on border security, much of the residence staff at the White House is furloughed — so the president is personally paying for the event to be catered with some of everyone’s favorite fast foods.”Mr. Trump himself called it “great American food.” But maybe it was really something else — comfort food for a president who feels stuck at home."

228,"WASHINGTON — The Defense Department’s inspector general said on Wednesday that it was investigating complaints that the acting defense secretary, Patrick M. Shanahan, had been promoting his former employer, Boeing, and disparaging its military contractor competitors.The investigation will examine complaints filed last week by a watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Dwrena K. Allen, a spokeswoman for the inspector general’s office, said that investigators had informed Mr. Shanahan of the inquiry.[Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty, conflict and consequence.]Mr. Shanahan told lawmakers last week that he supported an investigation.The investigation complicates what is already an uphill battle for Mr. Shanahan’s effort to become the next permanent defense secretary. As recently as last week, Defense Department officials believed that President Trump was about to formally nominate Mr. Shanahan for the job left vacant by Jim Mattis, who resigned in December.But as Mr. Shanahan’s troubles mount, the White House does not appear to have a ready and able alternative to him.Jim Talent, the former senator of Missouri, is one name which White House officials have discussed, according to former and current administration officials. Also under consideration is Robert L. Wilkie, the Veterans Affairs secretary. But Mr. Wilkie is viewed as doing a good job in a troubled department and Mr. Trump is loath to remove him from his post, the officials said.The deadly crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8 jet in Ethiopia, along with growing complaints that his cozy relationship with his former employers at the detriment of other military contractors, puts Mr. Shanahan’s fate in limbo.Mr. Shanahan served as the Pentagon’s deputy secretary under Mr. Mattis, a job that required Senate confirmation. Before that, he spent 30 years in commercial aviation and business at Boeing. He had hoped to bring his reputation as a corporate problem solver — including helping introduce the 787 Dreamliner — to the Defense Department.Several Defense Department officials predicted this week that it was unclear whether Mr. Shanahan could win Senate confirmation for the Pentagon’s top job, given his longstanding ties with Boeing and the fallout from the crash of the Ethiopian Airlines plane.The transportation secretary, Elaine L. Chao, called on Tuesday for her agency’s internal watchdog to investigate the process by which the Federal Aviation Administration in 2017 approved designs for the 737 Max. Lawmakers in Congress also are pushing for a review, while Canada is looking into its approval of the plane’s American certification.The specific allegations that the Defense Department’s inspector general is examining revolve around complaints, first reported in Politico, that Mr. Shanahan disparaged competitors of Boeing during meetings at the Pentagon with senior national security officials and lawmakers, two United States officials said.Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts and a member of the Armed Services Committee that would consider Mr. Shanahan’s confirmation if he is nominated, said she alerted the Pentagon’s internal watchdog after hearing that he “may have advocated on behalf of his former employer, Boeing, while serving as the acting defense secretary.”“The American people should be able to trust that government officials are working for them — not for big defense contractors,” Ms. Warren, who is running for president, said in a statement.While Mr. Mattis resigned in protest of Mr. Trump’s policies — including the surprise announcement that American troops would withdraw from Syria — Mr. Shanahan has held the line for the president.As the deputy defense secretary, Mr. Shanahan made clear that “we are not the Department of No,” as he told officials after the administration announced plans to create a new stand-alone Space Force at the Pentagon. It has since been moved to the oversight of the Air Force.Since becoming acting defense secretary, Mr. Shanahan has raised the ire of some lawmakers. Last month, Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said he did not believe Mr. Shanahan shared the “humility” of Mr. Mattis but did not elaborate. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, also clashed with Mr. Shanahan last month over the planned troop withdrawal from Syria.Last week, Mr. Shanahan appeared in front of Mr. Inhofe’s committee to sell the Pentagon’s proposed $750 billion budget for the 2020 fiscal year, which is geared toward combating threats from Russia and China and modernizing a military that has long focused on counterinsurgency conflicts.Instead, senators accosted him on a range of issues, including Mr. Trump’s move to take billions of dollars from the Defense Department for a border wall, and the Pentagon’s decision to push for weaker standards on chemicals in drinking water."
229,"WASHINGTON — A top White House official said Sunday that President Donald Trump ""is not a white supremacist"" and attempts to tie him to the alleged New Zealand mosque shooter are ""absurd.""Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, described the New Zealand shooter as a ""disturbed individual"" and ""evil person"" and said it was unfair to cast the 28-year-old Australian ""as a supporter of Donald Trump any more than it is to look at his, sort of his eco-terrorist passages in that manifesto and align him with Nancy Pelosi or Ms. Ocasio-Cortez.""Pelosi, a California Democrat, is the House speaker. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is a freshman and major proponent of a plan, named the Green New Deal, for tackling climate change.""This was a disturbed individual, an evil person, and to try and tie him to an American politician from either party probably ignores some of the deeper, difficulties that this sort of activity exposes,"" Mulvaney said.Still, Mulvaney's defense of Trump failed to quiet calls, chiefly from Democrats, for the president to issue a forceful denunciation of white nationalism. They argue that Trump's rhetoric, including harsh comments about immigrants and Muslims, encourages individuals like the New Zealand shooter.Brenton Harrison Tarrant, the man accused of the deadly shootings at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, left behind a lengthy document stating he was a white nationalist who hates immigrants and was set off by attacks in Europe that were perpetrated by Muslims.""Were/are you a supporter of Donald Trump?"" was one of the questions he posed to himself in the document. His answer: ""As a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose? Sure. As a policy maker and leader? Dear god no.""The attacks left 50 people dead and 34 others wounded, a dozen of them critically.Mulvaney said Trump is a defender of religious minorities worldwide, and that his actions speak louder than his words.""Look at what we've done while we've been here,"" he said. ""I don't think anybody could say that the president is anti-Muslim."" Mulvaney added that it frustrates him personally that ""every time something goes wrong around the world now, not just in our country, somehow the president of the United States must be responsible. And that's just, that's absurd and it doesn't help contribute to the dialogue that's necessary to fix these problems.""Before Mulvaney appeared on the Sunday talk shows, Trump tweeted in defense of Fox News weekend host Jeanine Pirro, whose program did not air in its regular Saturday time slot. Fox offered no explanation, but Pirro's absence from the lineup followed anti-Muslim comments she directed last week toward Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., one of three Muslims in Congress, who wears a head covering known as a hijab. Trump tweeted ""Bring back @JudgeJeanine Pirro.""Mulvaney also addressed a threat by North Korea to reconsider its halt to nuclear and ballistic missile tests, saying such a move would be a ""truly disappointing turn of events."" The threat followed the collapse of nuclear disarmament talks last month between Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.The chief of staff also expressed confidence that Trump's veto of a measure blocking his declaration of a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border -- in order to build a border wall -- will be upheld when the House votes later this month to override the president.""It doesn't have a chance,"" Mulvaney said of the vote set for March 26.Asked last week whether he saw white nationalism as a rising global threat, Trump said ""I don't really.""He went on to characterize the movement as made up of a ""small group of people that have very, very serious problems"" and said ""I guess, if you look at what happened in New Zealand, perhaps that's a case. I don't know enough about it yet.""Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., disagreed, saying white nationalism is on the rise ""and the president should call it out, but sadly he's not doing that.""As a candidate, Trump proposed banning all Muslims from entering the United States. As president, he drew criticism for attempting to institute the travel ban and for being slow to condemn white supremacy and related violence. After a violent 2017 clash between white nationalists and anti-racist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one demonstrator dead, Trump said there were ""very fine people on both sides"" of the confrontation.Trump also did not immediately reject support from David Duke, a former KKK Grand Wizard, during his presidential campaign.Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who is also Muslim, said Trump should call the Justice Department for data on the rise of white supremacy in the U.S. She urged Trump to use his bully pulpit to denounce the movement.""He, from the Oval Office, from that power position, can be able to send a signal very loud and clear,"" she said.Mulvaney appeared on ""Fox News Sunday"" and CBS' ""Face the Nation."" Kaine and Tlaib spoke on CNN's ""State of the Union.""___"
230,"WASHINGTON — William P. Barr, President Trump’s nominee for attorney general, assured senators at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday that he would permit the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to complete the Russia investigation and said he was determined to resist any pressure from Mr. Trump to use law enforcement for political purposes.Mr. Barr, whose confirmation seems virtually assured, pointed to his age and background — he served as attorney general from 1991 to 1993 — as buffers to potential intrusions on the Justice Department’s traditional independence. He suggested he had no further political aspirations that might cloud his judgment, the way that future ambitions might give pause to a younger nominee, as well as the experience to fight political interference.“I am in a position in life where I can provide the leadership necessary to protect the independence and reputation of the department,” Mr. Barr, 68, told the Senate Judiciary Committee, adding that he would not hesitate to resign if Mr. Trump pushed him to act improperly.“I will not be bullied into doing anything I think is wrong — by anybody, whether it be editorial boards or Congress or the president,” Mr. Barr said. “I’m going to do what I think is right.”He also pledged that he would refuse any order from Mr. Trump either to fire Mr. Mueller without good cause in violation of regulations or to rescind those rules first.“It is in the best interest of everyone — the president, Congress and, most importantly, the American people — that this matter be resolved by allowing the special counsel to complete his work,” Mr. Barr said.Mr. Barr’s first stint as attorney general came under President George Bush, who was known for his prudent and measured approach. If confirmed, Mr. Barr would serve under a president hardly known for self-restraint. Mr. Trump repeatedly excoriated Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general, for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, which Mr. Trump has called a “witch hunt,” and pushed him to open criminal investigations into political adversaries like Hillary Clinton.[President Trump says he alone can do it. His attorney general nominee usually agrees.]Over hours of testimony, Mr. Barr displayed a grasp of policy and demonstrated his experience as a Washington hand and member of the Republican legal establishment. He is expected to be confirmed, both because Republicans control the Senate and because Democrats are deeply suspicious of Matthew G. Whitaker, the acting attorney general whom Mr. Trump installed after ousting Mr. Sessions in November.“Mr. Barr is qualified by any reasonable standard,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the committee’s chairman, said after the hearing, adding that he saw no reason to doubt Mr. Barr would be confirmed. “And if he’s not qualified, I don’t know who they are ever going to pick.”During his testimony, Mr. Barr described being asked whether he was interested in joining Mr. Trump’s defense team in June 2017 by a friend of the president’s. Although Mr. Barr agreed to meet with Mr. Trump — and told him, he said, that Mr. Mueller was both a personal friend and “a straight shooter who should be dealt with as such” — he declined to join his legal team.“My wife and I were sort of looking forward to a bit of respite, and I didn’t want to stick my head into that meat grinder,” Mr. Barr said.Asked by Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, why as a “rational person” he would want the job after seeing Mr. Trump’s “unrelenting criticism” of Mr. Sessions, Mr. Barr portrayed himself as an institutionalist.“Because I love the department and all its components, including the F.B.I.,” Mr. Barr said. “I think they are critical institutions that are essential to preserving the rule of law, which is the heartbeat of this country.”Mr. Barr’s testimony also touched on many other issues.Regarding Mr. Trump’s demand for funding for a border wall, which has prompted the longest government shutdown in American history, Mr. Barr expressed qualified support for expanding barriers along the border with Mexico where they could be part of “common sense” immigration enforcement. But he sidestepped questions about whether Mr. Trump could lawfully redirect military funds to build a wall without congressional authorization, as the president has threatened to invoke emergency powers to do.Asked by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, about remarks he made in 2005 defending the George W. Bush administration’s “enhanced interrogation techniques” program and the idea that it was lawful to use “pain, discomfort and other things to make people talk” so long as it does not cross the line to torture, Mr. Barr said he would obey and uphold a 2015 law restricting American interrogators to using only those techniques listed in the Army Field Manual.Under questioning about whether he had sought to push out the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, who is widely expected to leave if Mr. Barr is confirmed, the nominee said he had not — and, indeed, had asked Mr. Rosenstein to stay on longer for a transition period.And he assured senators from both parties that his views on the criminal justice system had evolved from the early 1990s, when he advocated stiffer sentences for drug offenders, and that he would fully carry out substantial sentencing and prison law changes passed last month.But the hearing repeatedly returned to Russia’s attempts to manipulate the American election process and the open investigation by Mr. Mueller into Moscow’s campaign of subversion — and possible links to Mr. Trump and his associates.Early in the hearing, Mr. Graham brought up the F.B.I.’s newly revealed counterintelligence investigation into whether the president was working with the Russians, asking incredulously whether Mr. Barr had “heard of such a thing in all the time you have been associated with the department.”When Mr. Barr answered that he had not, Mr. Graham sought and obtained Mr. Barr’s assurance that he would look into who opened the investigation into the president at the F.B.I. or the Justice Department and to tell the committee whether it was appropriate.Later, Mr. Barr also defended as “entirely proper” his decision to write an unsolicited, lengthy memo to the Trump administration legal team in June arguing that laws against obstruction of justice cannot criminalize a president’s use of his constitutional powers — like when Mr. Trump fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director.Insisting he had not been not trying to “ingratiate” himself with the Trump administration by writing the memo, Mr. Barr played it down as based on mere speculation about the basis for Mr. Mueller’s obstruction inquiry. He said that he believed that other potential actions by a president, like witness tampering, would be a legitimate basis for an obstruction investigation.In any case, Mr. Barr repeatedly said he would let Mr. Mueller, whom he described as a friend of his for decades, finish his work and dismissed Mr. Trump’s attacks on the inquiry.“I don’t believe Mr. Mueller would be involved in a witch hunt,” Mr. Barr said. But in another moment, he called Mr. Trump’s use of that term “understandable” and refused to criticize the president’s attacks on Mr. Mueller and the Justice Department.Mr. Barr also appeared to emphasize a softer vision of presidential power than the unusually expansive view he has largely advanced throughout his career — for example, previously portraying the president instead of the attorney general as the nation’s top law-enforcement official, who wields unfettered power to “start or stop a law enforcement proceeding.”His philosophy on executive authority has raised the question of whether his permissive theories would unleash Mr. Trump. But in several ways on Tuesday, Mr. Barr appeared to walk back or qualify some of his earlier writings, putting greater emphasis on the Justice Department’s independence and legal limits on the presidency.For example, Mr. Barr said that if a president directed the department to close an investigation to protect himself or his family, that would violate the Constitution. And asked by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, whether a president could pardon someone in exchange for a promise not to incriminate him, Mr. Barr said, “That would be a crime.”He also pledged to seek the advice of ethics lawyers in the Justice Department about whether he should recuse himself from overseeing the Russia inquiry, while stopping short of committing to accepting their recommendation. Late last year, Justice Department ethics officials recommended to Mr. Whitaker that he recuse himself from overseeing that investigation, but Mr. Whitaker declined to do so.Separately, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, announced in a letter on Tuesday that Mr. Whitaker had agreed to testify publicly before his committee on Feb. 8, regardless of the status of the border wall impasse or “whether or not the Senate has confirmed a new attorney general.” The hearing promises to be a blockbuster session, and should turn on many of the same questions Mr. Barr faced, including about Mr. Mueller.The fate of Mr. Mueller’s findings — an expected report — was a recurring topic. Mr. Barr said that Mr. Mueller’s report to the attorney general would be “confidential,” but that the attorney general would then produce his own report to Congress based on that material. He said that he intended to be as transparent as possible given grand jury secrecy rules, but that he would not let the White House edit or change it, as the president’s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani had suggested might occur.“That will not happen,” Mr. Barr said."

232,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. U.S. and China officials kick off trade negotiations in Beijing, Chinese authorities target Uighur intellectuals and the Golden Globes are about to get underway. Here’s the latest:Midlevel U.S. trade officials are starting two days of negotiations with their counterparts in Beijing today. The talks could pave the way to meetings in Washington in a few weeks between a delegation of senior Chinese officials; Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator; and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary.China, which appears hobbled by the trade war, has offered a mix of concessions. The U.S. might be losing its leverage, as companies cut revenue forecasts and with future interest rate hikes on the horizon that could weaken the economy.Timing: Both sides are trying to defuse trade tensions ahead of a March 2 deadline, when U.S. tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods will increase to 25 percent from 10 percent.For years, educated Uighurs functioned as a bridge between the minority Muslim and Turkic communities of far western China and the wealthier Han Chinese, working with them to better the lot of the minority group and preserve Uighur culture.But more than 100 Uighur scholars, including university professors, computer programmers, poets and writers, have been swept up in the Chinese government’s crackdown in Xinjiang, which has ensnared almost a million people in indoctrination camps.Why it matters: The detention of the most accomplished Uighurs underscores the Communist Party’s attempt to erase the community’s unique identity — and also removes a force that worked to integrate Uighur society into modern China.President Tsai Ing-wen called on domestic and international support for the island’s independence, a rebuke to Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, who days earlier said unification with China was inevitable.Why it matters: The unusually firm comments helped Ms. Tsai position herself as a defender of democracy and inspired a groundswell of support ahead of next year’s elections. It also may reinforce support from the U.S.Context: The U.S. broke ties with Taiwan in 1979, when it had been under martial law for decades, to establish full relations with Beijing. Since Taiwan embraced democracy in the 1990s, many in Washington have seen it as a like-minded partner and a bulwark against China’s influence.Negotiations over the weekend appeared to offer little hope of an immediate agreement between Democrats and President Trump over his demands for a border wall. Democratic leaders have repeatedly said they will not agree to any funding for the wall, which Speaker Nancy Pelosi called an “immorality.” And the White House is also digging in, insisting on $5.7 billion in wall funding, even as some Republicans have started calling for an end to the shutdown.Analysis: The idea of the border wall, which Mr. Trump’s advisers said they initially created to remind Mr. Trump to talk tough on immigration during his campaign, has boxed in the president. He’s now struggling to find a way to please both his core supporters and conservative skeptics who see the wall as ineffective.In Opinion: Our columnist David Leonhardt builds a detailed argument that Mr. Trump is demonstrably unfit for office and “must go,” but that a rushed impeachment could actually help him remain in office.Week ahead: The British Parliament will resume debating Brexit terms and the U.S. Fed may release some clues on whether it will continue to raise interest rates.Syria: Two Americans were caught fighting for ISIS, according to the Syrian Democratic Forces. The arrests came on the same day President Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, said a retreat from Syria was conditional on the defeat of the terrorist group, reversing Mr. Trump’s surprise announcement last month of withdrawing thousands of American troops from the country.$3 million: That’s the record-breaking price a restaurant owner who calls himself the King of Tuna paid for an endangered 612-pound bluefin tuna at an auction in Tokyo’s new fish market.Pakistan: For centuries, dancers in Lahore were famed and respected, employed by the courts to perform for royal audiences. But the rise of religious conservatism in recent decades has pushed the art form, called nautch, underground, forcing some dancers to turn to prostitution.Malaysia: Sultan Muhammad V, two years into a five-year term, became the country’s first monarch to abdicate, after reportedly marrying a 25-year-old former Russian beauty queen while on medical leave from his largely ceremonial position.Populism: The global movement appears to be entering a new phase. The migration and terrorism crises that fueled its rise have eased, leaving populist leaders a stripped-down message of opposition to pluralism, multiculturalism and international cooperation.Hungary: Protesters took to the streets again this weekend, marching against the country’s new so-called slave law, which compels workers to put in overtime without full or immediate compensation.Yellow Vests: Protests in France, the first of the year, turned violent as a government ministry building was attacked and skirmishes broke out between demonstrators and the police.Schism: The spiritual leader of Eastern Orthodox Christians worldwide recognized the independence of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine in a four-hour ceremony in Istanbul, formalizing a split with the Russian church to which it had been tied for more than four centuries.Golden Globes: Here’s a look at the movies that might take home the top prizes at this year’s award ceremony, which kicks off imminently.Want to tidy up?

234,"Good morning. The U.S. government shutdown dragged on, Ukrainian Orthodox Christians left the Russian church, and the White House backtracked on a Syria withdrawal.

Democratic leaders have repeatedly said they would not agree to any funding for the wall. The White House is also digging in, insisting on $5.7 billion in wall funding, even as some Republicans have started to call for an end to the shutdown.

Both the patriarch and the new autonomous Ukrainian church say this is no schism but a sensible realignment. Political and religious leaders in Russia are outraged.Looking ahead: Today is Christmas in the Orthodox Church, and while a celebration of independence will be held at a cathedral in Kiev, a part of the Ukrainian church still loyal to Russia has claimed the split is against the rules. The number of parishes under Russian control now shrinks by a third, and there are fears of rising factionalism and violent clashes over church property. Populism on the right appears to be entering a new phase. The migration and terrorism crises that fueled its rise have eased, leaving populist leaders a stripped-down message of opposition to pluralism, multiculturalism and international cooperation. So they are manufacturing a sense of emergency, our correspondent writes. In France: Protests by the Yellow Vests, the first of the year, turned violent as a government ministry building was attacked and skirmishes broke out between demonstrators and the police.Italy: Matteo Salvini, the country’s hard-line interior minister, has brought his far-right politics into the mainstream by appealing to people with a soft aura of authenticity and an expert use of social media, documenting his everyday life of pasta and wine and Nutella while lashing at opponents. Hungary: The country’s populist government faced more protests this weekend over the new so-called slave law, which compels workers to put in overtime without full or immediate compensation.For centuries, women have been expected to stick to bad marriages in many conservative pockets of West Africa, where babies are sometimes given up for marriage in the womb. Now, lawyers, women’s associations, local officials and academics say they are seeing, across both Muslim and Christian areas, a quiet revolution. Details: In Niger, women face some of the worst inequality in the world. But they are daring for the first time to demand love, respect, financial stability, a healthy sex life — and, barring that, a divorce. Child marriage is also being fought, and attitudes are shifting. Our journalist followed a woman named Zalika Amadou as she petitioned for divorce at a sidewalk Islamic court. Quote: “These young women don’t want to suffer any more,” an Islamic judge said. “There is a solution to their problems, and they know they can find it here.” Ms. Amadou’s mother gave voice to the old way of thinking: “It’s the end of the world when a husband and wife don’t stay together.”Syria: President Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, rolled back Mr. Trump’s decision to rapidly withdraw from Syria, laying out conditions that could leave American forces there for months or even years. Ireland: Legalized abortion services started being offered in the country last week, after a referendum last year that repealed some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe. Golden Globes: “Bohemian Rhapsody” won best drama and its star, Rami Malek, won best actor. Alfonso Cuarón won best director for “Roma,” which also won best foreign film. Here are the winners, and a look at fashion from the red carpet. Germany: Personal information on nearly 1,000 lawmakers and other prominent Germans, including rappers, journalists and internet personalities, was hacked and publicized by unknown perpetrators who appeared to spare politicians on the far right. Russia: An explosion at an apartment complex that killed 39 people last week has illustrated the hardships that ordinary Russians are asked to endure by the government, particularly in the country’s hinterlands and industrial backwaters.Belgium: A ban on the Muslim and Jewish ways of ritually slaughtering animals went into effect in the new year, angering religious groups and winning praise from animal rights activists as well as many on the right.A debate over Arabic: Three million people use Arabic on a daily basis in France, but public schools have barely taught it, so mosques and private associations stepped in to address the educational gap. In September, the government announced a plan to shoulder the teaching, and that has set off a political debate on all sides. Want to tidy up?

235,"WASHINGTON — President Trump declared on Monday morning that he expects a “very tremendous summit” later this week with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, suggesting again that his eventual goal is to convince Mr. Kim to abandon his nuclear weapons.Mr. Trump’s comments, at a breakfast meeting with the nation’s governors, followed a morning tweet in which he predicted that “with complete Denuclearization, North Korea will rapidly become an Economic Powerhouse.” Mr. Trump departed without further comment on Air Force One hours later for the flight to Hanoi, Vietnam, the site of the summit meeting on Wednesday and Thursday.The president’s optimistic assessment came amid indications that the administration may be preparing to deliver something that Mr. Kim desperately wants: a joint political statement declaring an end to the Korean War.President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has also called for an end-of-war declaration, which could put pressure on the United States to withdraw the nearly 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea — a move that the administration says it opposes. But it is uncertain how much progress toward denuclearization Mr. Trump is prepared to demand from Mr. Kim in exchange for a declaration of peace that would stop short of replacing the 1953 armistice.Ned Price, a former spokesman for the National Security Council for President Barack Obama, on Monday warned of what he called a “Pollyannaish approach” by Mr. Trump that could lead the United States to give Mr. Kim too much in exchange for little real progress in abandoning his nuclear weapons.“The chance for a diplomatic resolution to North Korea’s nuclear ambitions is too critical an opportunity to allow Trump to squander,” Mr. Price wrote in an email message Monday morning. “We must be comfortable holding the Trump administration’s feet to the fire.”Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said it was Mr. Trump’s strong tactics that pushed Mr. Kim into negotiations in the first place. But in his own series of tweets on Monday morning, Mr. Graham described the upcoming talks in Hanoi as “our last, best chance to end the nuclear conflict with North Korea on peaceful terms.”At a White House reception on Sunday evening, Mr. Trump told the governors that he had told Mr. Kim that North Korea could be “one of the great financial and economic countries anywhere in the world,” but only if the North gives up its nuclear weapons. Mr. Trump said it was unclear whether the North Korean leader would agree.“We have a special feeling, and I think it’s going to lead to something very good, and maybe not,” Mr. Trump said Sunday. “I think ultimately it will, but maybe not.”Even as the president prepared to travel abroad, a series of Monday morning tweets suggested that he remains focused on other topics closer to home. Before meeting with the governors, Mr. Trump tweeted about oil prices, movie director Spike Lee, the nation’s economy and border security.His tweet about Mr. Lee was a response to the director’s call, during Sunday’s Academy Awards broadcast, for mobilization against the president in the 2020 election.At the governors’ breakfast, Mr. Trump repeated his belief in the need for a wall across the southwest border to stop illegal immigrants and drugs from coming into the United States. And he complained about migrants flowing into the country from Central American countries.Mr. Trump said he has told leaders in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to stop caravans of people from traveling through Mexico toward the border with the United States.“They’re not sending their best,” he said, adding that the Central American countries are sending “rough hombres.” Immigration advocates have said that most of the people in caravans are families fleeing gang violence and severe poverty.Mr. Trump’s foreign trip will keep him out of the United States for a week, but he is likely to be dogged by domestic issues while overseas.On Tuesday, Congress is expected to vote on a resolution blocking Mr. Trump from declaring a national emergency so that he can fund construction of his border wall. If the resolution passes, that vote could lead to Mr. Trump’s first-ever veto.The next day, on Wednesday, Michael D. Cohen, the president’s one-time personal lawyer and fixer, is scheduled to begin public testimony in front of a congressional committee. Among the topics he is expected to discuss is his effort to help Mr. Trump block news stories that alleged his affairs with two women."
236,"OAKLAND, Calif. — Senator Kamala Harris of California officially kicked off her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination on Sunday at an outdoor rally where she warned that the nation and the world were at “an inflection point” in history and called on all Americans to “speak truth about what’s happening” in the Trump era.Before a crowd that her advisers estimated at more than 20,000 people, Ms. Harris threaded together a biography from her years in the Bay Area with her work as a prosecutor and a senator, and set those details against a broader populist vision about “running to be president of the people, by the people and for all people.”[Follow the Democratic presidential field with our new candidate tracker]Ms. Harris, 54, who became the second black woman to serve in the United States Senate when she took office in 2017, has joined an increasingly crowded field of Democratic candidates that lacks a front-runner. The pack is the most diverse in history, with Ms. Harris among four women currently serving in the Senate or House who are now running for the Democratic nomination.In her remarks and at other recent events, she stressed unity and fighting for people, and her support for policies that are currently popular among Democrats, like “Medicare for all” and combating climate change. But she also laid out a vision of America and cast the 2020 election as a historic one.“We are at an inflection point in the history of our world,” she said at the rally in downtown Oakland. “We are at an inflection point in the history of our nation. We are here because the American dream and our American democracy are under attack and on the line like never before. And we are here at this moment in time because we must answer a fundamental question: Who are we? Who are we as Americans?”“When we have leaders who bully and attack a free press and undermine our democratic institutions, that’s not our America,” she said. “When white supremacists march and murder in Charlottesville or massacre innocent worshipers in a Pittsburgh synagogue, that’s not our America. When we have children in cages crying for their mothers and fathers, don’t you dare call that border security, that’s a human rights abuse!”Ms. Harris spoke of an America where “we welcome refugees” and denounced President Trump’s border wall plan as a “medieval vanity project.”Ms. Harris also pledged: “If I have the honor of being your president I will tell you this: I am not perfect. Lord knows, I am not perfect. But I will always speak with decency and moral clarity and treat all people with dignity and respect. I will lead with integrity. And I will tell the truth.”Among those at the rally were Lyndsey Schlax, 38, a school administrator, who attended with her husband and two sons.“I’ve been a big fan of Kamala for a long time,” said Ms. Schlax, who wore a “Phenomenal Woman” T-shirt that she said was produced by a relative of Ms. Harris’s. “I like how she’s not afraid to be strong.”Violet Sinnarkar, 20, from San Jose, who is currently a junior at the University of California-Berkeley, said many people she knew on campus were not fans of Harris. “They think she’s a cop,” Ms. Sinnarkar said about Ms. Harris’s years as district attorney of San Francisco and some past remarks praising law enforcement.But Ms. Sinnarkar said she came with an open mind: “I’m here to hear what she has to say.”While Ms. Harris’s work as a prosecutor has drawn some criticism, she sought to frame her record as focused on helping regular people.“In my whole life, I’ve only had one client: the people. And fighting for the people meant fighting on behalf of survivors of sexual assault. A fight not just against predators, but a fight against silence and stigma,” she said."
237,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s confrontations with potential Democratic challengers in 2020 have mostly been limited to sniping on Twitter. But on Monday night in El Paso, he will engage in his most direct conflict with a possible rival — former Representative Beto O’Rourke, a native of the city that shares a border with Mexico.Mr. Trump’s rally in El Paso is his most significant since the midterm elections that delivered the House of Representatives to Democrats. It will provide the president with a backdrop that he will use to again argue for a border wall to stop what he said is a surge of crime and drugs being brought into the country by migrants seeking illegal entry.Mr. O’Rourke has been among those who have strongly rebutted the president’s case that El Paso serves as an example of where building a wall has indeed provided a solution to crime.“If immigrants are good for the country, the border is secure and walls end lives instead of saving them, then why does the president try to scare us about immigrants and the border and take our land to build a wall we don’t need?” Mr. O’Rourke said on Twitter.Mr. O’Rourke has also used Twitter to make his own case, fact by fact, that Mr. Trump’s argument is flawed and inaccurate.Mr. Trump is scheduled to begin speaking at a Make America Great Again rally at the El Paso County Coliseum at 7 p.m. Mountain time (9 Eastern). Mr. O’Rourke and his supporters will meet up at Bowie High School at 5 p.m., then march to Chalio Acosta Sports Center, about a half-mile away. He will also begin speaking at 7 p.m.During his State of the Union address last week, Mr. Trump falsely cited El Paso as an example of a city where building a wall worked to deter crime.“The border city of El Paso, Tex., used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the entire country, and was considered one of our nation’s most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country,” he said.[Read about what President Trump plans to discuss at his El Paso rally.]But before the border barriers were completed in El Paso, in 2008, the city had the second-lowest violent crime rate among more than 20 similarly sized American cities. In 2010, after the fence construction, it retained its ranking. Also, El Paso was never one of the most dangerous cities in the United States.Mr. Trump relishes political combat and this is the first time in the 2020 election cycle that he will be on a dueling, if separate, stage with a Democrat who may try to unseat him. Mr. O’Rourke told Oprah Winfrey that he would make a decision about running for president by the end of February.It seems a near certainty that Mr. Trump will try to counter the protest in El Paso and its unofficial leader, Mr. O’Rourke. How frontally he criticizes the former congressman, and whether he tries to brand him with a derogatory nickname will be measures of how seriously he takes Mr. O’Rourke’s potential candidacy.Mr. O’Rourke is the near opposite of the president in tone. During his losing senate campaign last year, he offered himself as a candidate who could bridge divides and wanted to go beyond convenient party labels. That modulated approach is seen as part of his larger appeal. He was able to attract donations nationwide and build a following even as he lost his race.Now he will face a different test in an opponent whose first instinct is to fight.Cable news outlets are expected to cover the rallies, and the president almost always takes priority over the words of someone who does not even hold elective office. This time may be different. At a minimum, prepare for a split-screen approach that will offer the freshest soundings of what promises to be a long and bitter presidential campaign."
238,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration, setting the stage to move forward with one of its most consequential climate-policy rollbacks, announced Thursday that it had decided to scrap negotiations with California over the president’s plan to undo Obama-era fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks.The move makes a protracted legal battle almost certain. At the heart of the talks was California’s longstanding right to opt out of national auto emissions rules and set its own tailpipe standards. State officials have vowed to sue to protect that authority if the administration tries to impose weaker federal standards on California and the dozen states that follow its lead.Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general, said Thursday the state was “prepared to defend our national Clean Car standards even if the Trump administration intends to go AWOL.”Under rules established by President Barack Obama’s administration to cut planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, national fuel economy standards would nearly double by 2025. The Trump administration said in August that it intended to freeze that measure after 2021, when new cars must average around 30 miles a gallon. It also said it would challenge the right of California and the states that follow its lead to set their own rules.There appears to have been very little movement in the negotiations since they began almost a year ago, and both sides on Thursday accused the other of negotiating in bad faith.“Despite the administration’s best efforts to reach a common-sense solution, it is time to acknowledge that CARB has failed to put forward a productive alternative,” a White House statement said, referring to the California Air Resources Board, the state’s clean air regulator. “Accordingly, the administration is moving forward to finalize a rule later this year with the goal of promoting safer, cleaner and more affordable vehicles.”Stanley Young, a spokesman for the air resources board, said meetings between the sides had been held but “were always at a superficial level, with no effort to engage in a conversation.”Mandy Gunasekara, who served as principal deputy assistant administrator in the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Air and Radiation before leaving this month to start a private consulting business, and who was involved in the talks, said that California had put forward only one counterproposal: a plan to delay implementation of the fuel economy rules by one year. Trump officials saw that as a nonstarter.“Looking at it now, it seems they were more interested in stalling the progress of the conversation than actually working to make a deal,” Ms. Gunasekara said.The decision to abandon talks does not necessarily mean that a final proposal from the administration is imminent. The E.P.A. had planned to complete the rollback proposal by the end of March, but the partial government shutdown early this year set that target back to May or June, agency officials said.Automakers, who fear that competing rules will bring chaos to the domestic auto industry, called for continued talks.“We continue to believe there is a middle-ground solution that supports the goals of the administration, state of California, as well as automakers,” said John Bozzella, chief executive of Global Automakers, which represents automakers and parts suppliers with operations in the United States.“We always knew achieving one national program would be challenging,” said Gloria Bergquist, a vice president at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents the country’s biggest automakers. But a compromise “is worth striving for,” she said. “We encourage everyone to keep focusing on how we get there.”The announcement comes amid fast-deteriorating relations between Washington and California.In recent weeks the Trump administration has said it was terminating a $929 million federal grant for the state’s struggling high-speed rail project, and the Transportation Department said it was exploring legal options to claw back $2.5 billion that had already been spent. President Trump has also threatened to cut off federal funding for wildfire relief after devastating blazes that killed 89 people.Mr. Trump also lashed out on Twitter when 16 states sued over his decision to declare a national emergency in order to obtain funding for a border wall, writing that California, “the state that has wasted billions of dollars on their out of control Fast Train, with no hope of completion, seems in charge!”"
239,"For all of President Trump’s political eccentricity, the man delivers a fairly conventional State of the Union address. As he did last year, Mr. Trump showed up with a standard list of broad policy aims — many of them ambitious, some enjoying bipartisan support and few likely to go anywhere in this hyperpolarized climate. His vows to tackle the cost of prescription drugs, protect American jobs and fix America’s crumbling infrastructure could have been lifted straight from his 2018 State of the Union note cards. His call to fight childhood cancer was new, but the money he proposed for it — $500 million over 10 years — is hardly adequate to the task.The president issued a paean to “unity” that could just as easily have come from a predecessor who might have meant it. Not that Mr. Trump avoided hot topics. He brought up abortion and Syria and a “tremendous onslaught” of migrants on the southern border. But the thematic heart of his address, as released and hyped in advance by the White House, sounded like the anodyne output of a random speech generator: “Together, we can break decades of political stalemate, we can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future.”Mr. Trump’s soothing message, in short, was wholly at odds with the acrid reality of how he has governed. In that way, the entire spectacle — reflected in the vibrating hostility between the two sides trapped together in the House chamber — evinced the true state of the union: fractured, fractious, painfully dysfunctional.The State of the Union address is one of those moments that allows Mr. Trump to play the role of president, with pomp, standing ovations and, sweeter still, a captive audience of his opponents. Even Mr. Trump grasps that, for this one night, he is called upon to rise above partisanship and address the entire nation rather than merely his rump political base. Beyond the general theme, he nonetheless failed this challenge.The president, facing several investigations and a Democratic House determined to hold him to account, called for an end to “ridiculous partisan investigations.” “If there is going to be peace and legislation,” the president said, “there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn’t work that way!”In the lead-up to his big night, the president’s tweets and remarks were designed to incite. He assailed Democratic leaders and repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency if lawmakers didn’t provide billions for his border wall. In a preview session with network anchors, he called Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, a “nasty son of a bitch.”Democrats responded with a set of guests intended to score political points. There were Dreamers and undocumented immigrants (some of whom formerly worked for Mr. Trump or a Trump resort), family members of victims of mass shootings, transgender service members, a #MeToo activist and a bevy of federal workers who went without pay during the shutdown.Democratic women showed up by the dozens dressed all in white, a nod to the suffragists of the early 20th century, in a display of sisterly solidarity with all women. Again and again in the speech, the president tried — for an evening at least — to change the tone he has set since the day he announced his candidacy with an attack on Mexican immigrants.  “We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer,” Mr. Trump said early in his address. “But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution — and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise and the common good.”If Mr. Trump’s words ring hollow, his actions still matter enormously. Given how bitterly divided the government is, how wounded and uneasy the nation is, it’s impossible not to cling to a hope that he might yet rise to the office and do something for his fellow Americans. But, rather than wait for that to happen, the wisest course for citizens interested in a stronger union is to focus on building it themselves.

240,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court took no action on Tuesday on the Trump administration’s plans to shut down a program that shields some 700,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation.The court’s inaction almost certainly means it will not hear the administration’s challenge in its current term, which ends in June. The justices’ next private conference to consider petitions seeking review is scheduled for Feb. 15.Even were they to agree to hear the case then, it would not be argued until after the next term starts in October under the court’s usual procedures. A decision would probably not arrive until well into 2020.The move left the program in place and denied negotiating leverage to President Trump, who has said he wanted to use a Supreme Court victory in the case in negotiations with Democrats over immigration issues.Mr. Trump tried to end the program in 2017, calling it an unconstitutional use of executive power by his predecessor and reviving the threat of deportation for immigrants who had been brought to the United States illegally as young children.But federal judges have ordered the administration to maintain major pieces of the program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, while legal challenges move forward.In November, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, ruled against the administration. It acknowledged that presidents have broad powers to alter the policies of earlier administrations but said that the legal rationale offered by the Trump administration did not withstand scrutiny. The court also questioned “the cruelty and wastefulness of deporting productive young people to countries with which they have no ties.”Mr. Trump has criticized that ruling and has said he would be vindicated in the Supreme Court. He also predicted that a Supreme Court victory in the case, United States Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California, No. 18-587, would strengthen his hand in negotiations with Democratic lawmakers over immigration issues.“I think it’s going to be overturned in the United States Supreme Court, and I think it’s going to be overwhelmingly overturned,” Mr. Trump said at a cabinet meeting this month, adding, “So if we win that case — and I say this for all to hear — we’ll be easily able to make a deal on DACA and the wall as a combination.”Mr. Trump has taken inconsistent positions on the program. Even as he tried to end it, he called upon Congress to give legal status and an eventual path to citizenship to the young immigrants, who are sometimes called “Dreamers.” More recently, he offered to extend the program in exchange for concessions on a border wall.The administration has argued that the program, instituted by the Obama administration, was an unconstitutional exercise of executive authority, relying on a ruling from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, concerning a related program. The Supreme Court deadlocked, 4 to 4, in an appeal of that ruling.But the Ninth Circuit said the two programs differed in important ways, undermining the administration’s legal analysis. The appeals court affirmed a nationwide injunction ordering the administration to retain major elements of the program while the case moved forward. Such nationwide injunctions, which have been used by courts to block executive actions in both the Obama and the Trump administrations, have been the subject of much commentary and criticism.Also on Tuesday, the administration told the court that it would ask it to hear an appeal of a trial judge’s ruling barring the addition of a question on citizenship to the next census. The administration’s filing said it would ask the justices to bypass the appeals court and put the case on a very fast track, culminating in arguments in April or May.That was necessary, the solicitor general, Noel J. Francisco, wrote, because “the government must finalize the census questionnaire by the end of June 2019 to enable it to be printed on time.”“It is exceedingly unlikely that there is sufficient time for review in both the court of appeals and in this court by that deadline,” Mr. Francisco wrote."

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox.President Trump declared on Friday that he would use emergency powers to fund the construction of a border wall, sidestepping Congress. The announcement met with immediate blowback: Sixteen states are suing, and on late-night TV on Monday, various hosts attacked the president for it.Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers pointed out that Trump had said on Friday that he “didn’t need to do this,” but was declaring the emergency in order to build the wall “much faster” — a statement that seemed to contradict the very definition of an emergency.Meyers pointed out that building a wall along a nearly 2,000-mile border didn’t seem like an emergency solution.Both Meyers and Jimmy Fallon had some fun with the news that a woman had delivered a baby during a JetBlue flight.Jimmy Fallon persuaded Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry to drop a few wacky phrases into his interviews during the NBA’s All-Star weekend. He really pulled it off. (He also pulled off a mind-boggling alley-oop in the All-Star Game itself.

243,"After terrorists brought down the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, Terence Opiola, then an agent with the United States Customs Service, worked amid the debris for months, recovering body parts and other evidence to help identify victims.In 2015, like many who had been at the site, he was told he had leukemia linked to his work there. Two years later, his illness forced him to retire at the age of 49 and he applied for benefits through the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, created to help sick Sept. 11 emergency workers, civilian survivors and their families. Recently he learned that he and others might get only a small fraction of what was promised when the federal government set up the fund.As a father of three school-age children, he said, that news has devastated him. “The anxiety is through the roof,” he said.On Feb. 15, the fund announced it planned to slash payments to survivors and their families by 50 percent to 70 percent because it is running out of money as the number of people sickened or killed because of their exposure to toxic dust from the towers’ collapse rises rapidly. Doctors say they have seen a surge in illnesses in recent years not only among firefighters and emergency medical technicians, but also among students, teachers, journalists, government workers and others who were exposed.Congress added $4.6 billion to the fund in 2015 and extended its life by five years after extensive lobbying. Fund officials said they have paid almost $5 billion in claims to 21,000 survivors or their families from the $7.3 billion account. Over the past two years, 20,000 more people have applied for benefits, Rupa Bhattacharyya, the fund’s administrator, said in a message on its website on Feb. 15. The figure is expected to rise.If Congress does not provide more money, thousands of these sick firefighters, emergency medical technicians, police officers and civilian volunteers will be without the help the country promised them. Charlotte Berwind, whose husband, Charles Flickinger, died of a Sept. 11-linked cancer in 2017, said she won’t be able to stay in their home without the full benefit from the fund. Ms. Berwind, 65, said that she felt that most Americans had long ago moved on from the attacks and that they didn’t understand that people were still getting sick and dying. “We are yesterday’s news,” she said. “They’ve forgotten. It’s over for them.”All those years ago, the horrifying attacks brought the nation together in common cause. Now America forgets these people, but finds the money for a $1.5 trillion tax cut for the wealthy. The country turns its back on these citizens, even as President Trump demands a border wall that could cost up to $70 billion. Fortunately, a bipartisan group of congressional members, most but not all from New York, have again taken up the cause of everyday Americans who served, lived and worked at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. On Monday the group introduced a bill to replenish the fund and extend its life permanently. Aiding their efforts is the comedian Jon Stewart, who has lent his fame to this cause for years. The bill’s sponsors are waiting for a Congressional Budget Office analysis before determining how much money the fund needs. For years, much of the focus has been on emergency medical workers, which is understandable. But Congress can do more to help the other Americans who are sick or may become sick from attack-related diseases. It might consider requiring the federally run World Trade Center Health Program to monitor the health of civilians who were exposed to toxins at the site before they become sick, for instance. Doctors say that doing so would help save lives, and give officials and researchers a better sense of how many people are sick or may become sick. And a must for Congress is to close an egregious loophole in the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits Program run by the Department of Justice that has excluded a small group of emergency medical workers who worked on private ambulance crews from receiving the help they need and to which they should be entitled. That has left people like Marvin Bethea, who worked for St. Vincent’s Medical Center on Sept. 11 and has for years struggled with illnesses linked to the toxic cloud, without access to the benefit. Though Mr. Bethea worked for a private ambulance crew, he was dispatched to the World Trade Center by the New York Fire Department and required by law to respond. “We did our duty that day, and they called us heroes,” he said. The survivors of the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil have been forced to beg Washington for help. That they have to ask at all is a slap in the face and a sign of national priorities run far astray."
244,"WASHINGTON — A pair of measures to reopen the government — one with President Trump’s border wall, the other without it — failed in the Senate on Thursday, sending lawmakers from both parties into frenzied efforts to forge a compromise that could end the nearly six-week partial shutdown.In back-to-back votes, the Senate first blocked Mr. Trump’s proposal to add $5.7 billion for his border wall to legislation to resume funding for the government, then turned back a Democratic measure that omitted the wall. Neither side was able to garner the 60 votes needed to advance its bill.But the results undercut the president by revealing that his proposal drew less support in the Republican-controlled Senate than did the Democrats’ plan, which attracted a half-dozen Republicans willing to break with Mr. Trump. And with the shutdown reaching a grim milestone on Friday as 800,000 federal workers miss a second consecutive paycheck, pressure is mounting in both parties to find a solution.In a lunch meeting before the votes, Republican senators vented their concern to Vice President Mike Pence about the prolonged shutdown, according to two people familiar with the discussion, which grew tense at times. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, who has previously counseled against allowing government funding to lapse, was among those arguing that it should never have occurred, they said.Almost as soon as the roll calls were finished in the packed Senate chamber, a round of telephone calls and conversations began among Mr. Trump, Republican and Democratic congressional leaders and other senators who have been quietly searching for weeks for a bipartisan compromise to end the gridlock.“Don’t give up hope, because now is the time that we all must come together to address these issues,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, one of the six Republicans who voted for the Democratic measure. “But you can’t do it when the government is shut down.”Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, announced on the Senate floor that he had spoken with the president, who had said he would be open to a three-week stopgap measure to reopen the government and provide time for a broader border security deal, as long as it included some of his priorities.“It gets us back in the ballgame,” Mr. Graham said, as a group of 16 senators — eight from each party — rose in turn to endorse the idea of the three-week spending measure.But hanging over those talks was continued uncertainty about the president’s bottom line for a deal. Mr. Trump spoke positively of talks between Mr. McConnell and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, but he said was not dropping his demand for wall funding.“One of the ideas suggested is they open, they pay some sort of prorated down payment on the wall, which you need,” the president told reporters at the White House. “If they come to a reasonable agreement,” he said of Mr. McConnell and Mr. Schumer, “I would support it, yes.”He again mentioned “other alternatives” that he could turn to if he did not secure wall funding from Congress, presumably an emergency declaration that could allow him to shift funds from the military or Army Corps of Engineers.But Democrats were unlikely to agree to that. “Senator Schumer and Senate Democrats have made clear to Leader McConnell and Republicans that they will not support funding for the wall, prorated or otherwise,” said Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer. Others emphasized that they shared the president’s goal of adding security measures at the border, as long as he would first agree to end the shutdown, and House Democrats were circulating proposals for a “smart wall,” with drones, sensors and some additional fencing, but no edifice from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico.“What we have put on the table is our reputation as legislators, that given three weeks, we’ll come up with a successful conclusion on the border security issue,” said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland.Urgency is rising in both parties to reopen the government, even if that means making concessions their leaders might not have considered a few weeks ago. House Democrats, prodded on by rank-and-file lawmakers from conservative districts who are eager to promote their own border security ideas, are poised as early as Friday to outline more than $5 billion in measures they support, a far larger sum than they initially entertained.“We’re not that far apart,” said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, imploring members of his own party and Democrats to “stop talking past each other.”Recent polls have found that the ordeal is taking a heavy toll on Mr. Trump’s approval rating, including among his core supporters. It has also created a damaging narrative for his administration, fueling a perception that the president — who often promotes his concern for the country’s “forgotten men and women” — and his team are unconcerned with the plight of working Americans who are suffering during the breach in government operations.In separate appearances over the past 48 hours, the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross; the president’s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow; and Lara Trump, his daughter-in-law, all made comments seen by some as callous toward federal workers who have now gone more than a month without pay.“I don’t really quite understand why” those employees are lining up at food banks, Mr. Ross said on CNBC. He suggested they could go to a bank to get a loan to cover lost wages.Democrats jumped on the comments.“Is this the ‘let them eat cake’ kind of attitude,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said of Mr. Ross’ confusion, “or call your father for money?” The second remark was a version of one she made to Mr. Trump in the Situation Room this month, when she tartly noted that the people affected by the shutdown did not have the luxury of being able to depend financially on a parent.The Democratic funding bill included $14 billion in disaster aid, but otherwise it was similar to one the Senate approved unanimously in December, only to see Mr. Trump reject it and the House cancel a planned vote on it. Republican views in the Senate have shifted sharply since then to reflect the president’s.Mr. Trump’s proposal paired $5.7 billion in wall funding with temporary legal protections for some immigrants and measures to make it more difficult to claim asylum in the United States. Only one Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, crossed party lines to vote for the measure. Two Republican senators, Mike Lee of Utah and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, voted against it, considering it too lenient to immigrants.Mr. Trump’s plan was loosely modeled after an idea that was the centerpiece of quiet bipartisan talks to strike a compromise over the past several weeks to end the shutdown. Among the ideas discussed was legislation that would pair money for border security with permanent legal status for Dreamers, the immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children who stand to lose their deportation protections and work permits after Mr. Trump rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, created by President Barack Obama in 2012.While it included some of those components, the measure that failed on Thursday was dismissed as a nonstarter by Democratic leaders because it substantially narrowed DACA eligibility, and extended it for only three years, while making major changes to asylum law that would make it harder for migrants fleeing violence and persecution, including children from Central America, to find refuge in the United States. It would also extend three-year reprieves for those living in the United States under Temporary Protected Status — granted in times of conflict or natural disaster — who stand to be removed after Mr. Trump ended their protections.Senator Doug Jones, Democrat of Alabama, said he had considered supporting the president’s proposal after he described it in a televised address from the White House, but found the asylum provisions “unacceptable.”“When I saw what the president had added to the plan he announced just five days ago, particularly as it pertains to the limitations and additional hardships placed on families and children who are legitimately seeking refuge in this country from violence in their own countries, and doing so through the legal asylum process, I could not vote for it despite my consistent support for stronger border security,” Mr. Jones said in a statement.House leaders had kept their chamber in session through the afternoon to leave room for the possibility that the Democratic measure would prevail in the Senate, and they could call a vote on it later Thursday and send it to the White House. But that never happened, and rank-and-file Democrats, many of whom had marched across the Capitol to the Senate chamber to witness the votes for themselves, spent the afternoon instead highlighting the stories of people devastated by the shutdown.The House took separate action earlier Thursday to pass legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 28, with all but five Republicans voting “no.” One freshman Democrat, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, also voted against it because it would reopen Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which she wants closed."

That’s according to congressional and Defense Department officials with knowledge of the matter, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the possibility. Officials are debating whether they could make such a move without a declaration of a national emergency.

The escalating temperatures are already killing off marine ecosystems, raising sea levels and making hurricanes more destructive.The background: Historically, understanding ocean temperatures has been difficult. A 2014 U.N. report presented five estimates, all showing less ocean warming than the levels projected by computer climate models. The new analysis incorporates more recent data, and its results are more in line with the models.For decades, the centerpiece of evolutionary theory has been that creatures with the most advantageous traits have the best chance of multiplying.

246,"The 90-minute drive from Tucson to Rancho de la Osa, a recently reopened dude ranch on the border with Mexico, is a lonely one. Turning onto Highway 286, your car may be the only southbound vehicle for 44 miles while the occasional U.S. Border Patrol van trolls north. The road runs directly to the border fence, here made up of eerie metal posts spaced less than a foot apart, at the town of Sasabe. Minutes before reaching it, a right turn onto a dirt road delivers you to the historic adobe ranch, painted a warm terra cotta, with a porch lined with turquoise Adirondack chairs.“You got the right place, and we got the right horse,” said a cowboy in the driveway, when I pulled in last winter, fully living up to wrangler stereotype with a handlebar mustache and weathered 10-gallon hat.Once, the border fence was such a strong deterrent to visitors that it helped drive the 1920s dude ranch out of business. But, if anything, President Trump’s campaign for a border wall has helped revive interest in a region that already has a barrier at the border.“Like Trump or hate Trump, now the border is an attraction,” said Russell True, who with partners, bought Rancho de la Osa at auction complete with its vintage western furnishings and period art in late 2016. They don’t publicize the ranch’s proximity to the border fence and had hoped the border would be a neutral feature of the ranch. Instead, Mr. True said it has piqued the interest of guests. “The first thing they want to do is see the wall,” he said. “We could not have planned for the political shift and that it would become interesting.”Originally opened in the 1920s, Rancho de la Osa drew many celebrated guests, including Joan Crawford, Cesar Romero and John Wayne, for whom three of the 18 bedrooms are named (double room rates from $235 a person, all inclusive). The cowboy actor of the silent film era, Tom Mix, made one of his many films here. Authors checked in too, including the western novelist Zane Grey and Margaret Mitchell. Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson led the political A-list along with William Clayton, who drafted the Marshall Plan to aid European countries after World War II in a two-bedroom house on the property.More current events also helped drive the ranch out of business, according to Mr. True, who also co-owns White Stallion Ranch near Tucson. In 2010, Jan Brewer then the governor of Arizona, decried beheadings in the desert she said were linked to illegal immigration and drug trafficking, allegations that were never corroborated and that she later called an error on her part. “We just had an absolute, possibly even slightly irrational need to save it,” Mr. True told me as we sat in the main lodge, where the adobe walls are washed in orange, red and yellow hues and an antique leather sofa is embossed with an image of a saddle. “Somebody else would have bought it, but nobody else was going to run it as a dude ranch.”As a dude ranch, the 590-acre Rancho de la Osa, restored and reopened in 2017, offers more than vintage charm. Beyond the central compound, which includes an outdoor swimming pool and a bar in a building dating back to 1720, lies some of the lushest areas of the Sonoran Desert, at about a 3,500-foot elevation, and the distinctive Baboquivari Peak, which is considered sacred to the indigenous Tohono O’odham people.Horseback riding is the main activity here but the new owners have expanded activities to include fat-tire electric mountain biking, off-road vehicle tours, clay-pigeon shooting and bird-watching trips to the neighboring Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, a 117,500-acre preserve with grasslands that resemble the savannas of Africa.In addition to exploring the desert, morning and afternoon rides introduce guests to the ranch’s veteran wranglers Ross and Lynne Knox. The couple’s stories, including his close brushes with death running pack-mule trains in the Grand Canyon, conjured a western past that doesn’t seem so distant here in some of the more desolate parts of the southern border.“If you’re not living on the edge,” he said with a chuckle about his daring cowboy lifestyle, “then you’re taking up too much space.”Of course, the degree to which the desert is deserted is up for debate, and on my first ride I spotted the well-patrolled fence -— mostly out of sight from the ranch dwellings — that undulates east with the hills as far as the eye can see.It abruptly stops at the nearby territory of the Tohono O’odham people who have prevented the fence, erected in 2007, from crossing tribal land. When the Knoxes drove me and four fellow guests in an off-road cart to see it, we took turns walking around to the Mexican side of the border and posing for photos. A few foot paths snaked into the hills on the American side staked with spiky ocotillo cactus.Still, it was easy to forget about politics in a place where a juvenile great horned owl, flying low at dusk, roosted in a tree just 10 feet from my patio seat, and where cozy rooms with original fireplaces came stocked with mesquite wood. Mr. Knox, a celebrated cowboy poet, recited some of his work after dinner, concluding “when the memories come calling, you still can’t help but pray/Lord, please make me a cowboy again for a day.”"
247,"Most federal workers, even those with rent owed and bills due, would gladly forgo their paycheck as a measure of support for his $5.6 billion border wall, President Trump said on Friday.He also noted that Mexico would actually be paying for the wall through a new trade agreement, which at the very least raised the question of why the government had to be shut down over a funding dispute involving American tax dollars if the funding was coming from another country. And then there was a Plan C: He said he could use “emergency powers” to build the wall. The wall was needed for many reasons, Mr. Trump said. Stopping drug and human trafficking, and a nonspecific reference to a torrent of terrorists and coyotes easily flowing in over the southern border. “They drive right in, and they make a left,” he said.But there also was sunshine amid the gloom. Mr. Trump spoke of a stunningly positive jobs report and a stock market that soared, at least for a day. Lower gas prices? One person to thank.The purpose of the president’s hastily arranged, hourlong news conference in the Rose Garden was to give his side of the negotiations over a partial government shutdown that stretches into its third week on Saturday. And, for the record, Mr. Trump is not calling the partial closing of the government “a shutdown.”“I don’t call it a shutdown,” he said. “I call it doing what you have to do for the benefit and for the safety of our country.”The news conference was freewheeling, and the president seemed in high spirits, even with the government shuttered in many places. “Should we keep this going or not?” he said.Here are some takeaways and fact-checks. Mr. Trump has called for a concrete wall on the border with Mexico, though he denied it, telling reporters, “I said I was going to build a wall. I never said I’m going to build a concrete.” (Just four days ago, Mr. Trump tweeted that “an all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED.”)Now, he said, steel might be the preferred material, suggesting that would also help a resurgent steel industry in the United States, and could be preferable for its see-through and more aesthetic qualities. “All of the border things that we’ll be building will be done right here in the good old USA by steel companies that were practically out of business when I came into office as president. And now, they’re thriving.” Later, he said, “the steel industry was almost dead.”""Dead"" is an exaggeration. Steel production has been in decline, as has the number of employees in the industry. But the metals industry still employed over 360,000 workers and produced 80 million tons of raw steel in the year before Mr. Trump took office.At any rate, Mr. Trump continued, “we’ve already built a lot of the wall” and “renovated a tremendous amount of wall.” (The Trump administration has replaced some existing barriers with new barriers, and will begin constructing 14 miles of new wall in February. But to date, construction on his border wall has not started.)In his first meeting about a shutdown with Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office last month, the president forcefully said that he alone would own the shutdown. On Friday, he was selling shares in it. “You can call it the Schumer or the Pelosi or the Trump shutdown,” he said. “Doesn’t make any difference to me. It’s just words.”Could he reach a compromise with Democrats to end the shutdown by coupling wall funding with a pathway to citizenship for the young immigrants known as Dreamers? Mr. Trump responded that Democrats lost interest as soon as the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld an injunction against his administration’s termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. (A deal on the program and to avoid an earlier government shutdown in early 2018 faltered last January, after Mr. Trump made vulgar remarks on immigration. The court ruled on the case in November.)That was such a bad decision from the court, Mr. Trump asserted, that even his predecessor, “when he signed the DACA, with the executive order, made a statement to the effect, this isn’t going to work.” (President Barack Obama did not sign an executive order to implement the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. He announced it as a Department of Homeland Security policy in a speech in 2012. He did not say it would not work, but called it a “temporary stopgap.”)For federal workers who may need a safety net or financial assistance as they go without pay, Mr. Trump said “the safety net is going to be having a strong border,” especially because government employees support his wall. (A recent poll of more than 1,400 by Government Executive suggests the opposite: most oppose the shutdown and the wall.) The president said that the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada will yield billions of dollars for this country. “That is paying for the wall,” he said. “Many, many times over. In fact, what we save on the U.S.M.C.A., the new trade deal we have with Mexico and Canada, what we save on that just with Mexico will pay for the wall many times over, just in a period of a year, two years and three years. So I view that as absolutely Mexico is paying for the wall.” (Congress has yet to ratify the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and it does not compel Mexico to pay for the wall. Whatever federal revenue it generates would come from American taxpayers, not Mexico.)And, Mr. Trump said, why shouldn’t Mexico pay for the wall through trade, given that “we are losing close to $100 billion a year on trade with Mexico.” (The United States had a $69 billion trade deficit with Mexico in 2017.)Mr. Trump also took another shot at the North American Free Trade Agreement that the new trade deal seeks to replace, arguing that “we lost millions of jobs” through Nafta. (The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute estimated that the United States lost 850,000 jobs because of Nafta. The Times was unable to find any credible estimate that supported Mr. Trump’s “millions” figure.)Asked about ongoing trade talks with Beijing, Mr. Trump reported that “China is paying us tremendous tariffs.” (The United States does not send China a bill for the cost of tariffs, which are often passed on to American importers or consumers.)China, by the way, “is the biggest beneficiary of Apple,” so Mr. Trump is not concerned that the company reduced its revenue forecast this week, sending stocks tumbling. Nonetheless, Mr. Trump said Apple is “investing $350 billion because of what we did with taxes and the incentives that we created in the United States.” (Apple was already on track to spend $275 billion in the United States over the next five years. After a $38 billion tax payment, the company’s investment would be roughly $37 billion.)After suggesting that terrorists were pouring into the country over wall-less portions of the border, Mr. Trump turned to Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, for specifics. She said there were 3,000 such terrorists “that we know about,” but said she could not divulge other information because it was classified.(The 3,000 figure referred to “special interest aliens” stopped at the border, a term that applies to people from any country that has exported or produced one terrorist, according to the libertarian Cato Institute. Besides this ambiguous figure, Mr. Trump has yet to provide evidence for his claim. The State Department said in a September report there is “no credible evidence” that terrorist groups had sent operatives to enter the United States through Mexico. The report warned of the vulnerability, but said it was more likely terrorist groups would seek other means of entry.)Mr. Trump said that the government would have to use its powers of eminent domain to take private land to build the wall when owners would not agree to sell. He said that’s how interstates, schools and other public buildings have been constructed.Many in his base disagree, especially in Texas where private property rights are often paramount.Mr. Trump said, mostly in jest, that he had raised the matter of impeachment with Ms. Pelosi, asking her why she did not use the border security issue as grounds. “And Nancy said we’re not looking to impeach you. I said that’s good, Nancy, that’s good.”He added, “You can’t impeach somebody that is doing a great job. That’s the way I view it.”"

249,"WASHINGTON — Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked President Trump on Wednesday to scrap or delay his Jan. 29 State of the Union address amid the partial government shutdown, an extraordinary request that escalated the partisan battle over his border wall even as bipartisan groups of lawmakers pressed him to reopen the government and make room for compromise.In a letter to Mr. Trump that underscored how the shutdown fight has poisoned hopes of bipartisan comity at the start of divided government, Ms. Pelosi cited security concerns as her reason for proposing that the president postpone the annual presidential ritual of addressing a joint session of Congress in a televised speech during prime time — or perhaps submit a written message instead.Security aside, her move would deprive Mr. Trump of one of the brightest spotlights of a president’s year, intensified this year by Democratic control of the House and the drama of the longest government shutdown in the nation’s history.“Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on Jan. 29,” Ms. Pelosi wrote.[Read the full text of the letter here.]The request was a bracing piece of theater, even in a presidency that has bent so many historical norms. Ronald Reagan postponed his 1986 address after the Challenger space shuttle exploded. Franklin D. Roosevelt transmitted a written message in 1944 as his health began to fail. But Mr. Trump had no intention of giving up the spotlight.Several White House officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe the president’s frame of mind, said that he was utterly unbothered by Ms. Pelosi’s missive, which they noted was not an absolute cancellation but a half-measure suggesting a postponement. One of them said it opened up options for Mr. Trump for “creative alternatives” to the staid, tradition-bound speech, and that he could deliver a speech anywhere he chose.Still, while she couched her request in logistical concerns, Ms. Pelosi’s proposal served as a reminder to Mr. Trump that she now has the power to frustrate his agenda and upend his plans. It drew rebukes from Republicans who said Ms. Pelosi was politicizing the State of the Union address; Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, told reporters in the Capitol that the decision was “unbecoming of a speaker.”It came as pressure intensified on the president from two separate groups of centrist Democrats and Republicans, one in the Senate and one in the House, to drop his demand that wall funding be included in any measure to end the shutdown.In a meeting with Mr. Trump in the Situation Room Wednesday morning, seven House Republicans and seven Democrats who are members of the Problem Solvers Caucus told Mr. Trump that they were eager to have a bipartisan discussion with him about border security, among other matters, but that he needed to first sign legislation to get government funding flowing again.“Both sides listened to each other, and believe that there’s a way forward,” said Representative Josh Gottheimer, Democrat of New Jersey, who attended the session. He called it a “productive conversation,” but added, “It’s critical that we reopen the government first, for our safety, our security, our economy.”Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, called the meeting “constructive,” and said, “They listened to one another, and now both have a good understanding of what the other wants.”Another attendee who insisted on anonymity to describe the private discussion said neither side considered it a negotiating session, and Mr. Trump did not embrace the idea of reopening the government before the border barrier issue was settled. The president began the session with an extended talk about what he described as the crisis at the border, while lawmakers told him about the effects of the shutdown on their districts.In the Senate, a group of Republicans and Democrats was also working to persuade the president that no progress was possible as long as the government remained shuttered. It circulated a letter that called on Mr. Trump to drop his demand for wall funding as a condition of ending the shutdown, urging him to agree to sign a three-week stopgap government funding measure to allow time to forge a “broad bipartisan agreement” on border security spending.“We commit to working to advance legislation that can pass the Senate with substantial bipartisan support,” said the letter, which was spearheaded by Senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. “During those three weeks, we will make our best efforts following regular order in the appropriate committees and mark up bipartisan legislation relating to your request.”The letter has support from several other Republican senators, including Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rob Portman of Ohio, as well as centrist Democrats including Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, according to several officials familiar with it who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the effort. But the White House was quietly lobbying against it, and proponents were having a hard time persuading Republicans to sign on.“I’m not sure if it moves the process forward or not,” said Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, who was summoned to a meeting at the White House on Wednesday afternoon to discuss the issue. “I want to find out whether or not there’s a possibility that if we offer support, Republicans and Democrats alike, if we offer support for a three-week continuation, does that help the president, or does that hurt the president, in terms of allowing him some middle ground to find a consensus on getting some work done on the wall.”“If it’s just seen as a weakening of his position,” Mr. Rounds added of Mr. Trump, “then he probably wouldn’t do it.”That is precisely the reason Mr. Trump has ruled out similar plans both publicly and privately, saying he would not reopen the government without first securing funding for the wall.Mr. Coons, in terse remarks as he left the Senate floor on Wednesday, offered a gloomy assessment of the plan’s chances: “This letter is going nowhere unless there is sufficient clarity of support from Republicans.”In the absence of progress, Democrats kept up a drumbeat of pressure on Republicans to break ranks with Mr. Trump and support measures to reopen the government without border wall spending. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, led Democrats in chants of “Open the government!” on the Capitol steps. A group of House Democratic freshmen made their second trek through the Rotunda in two days to the office of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to deliver him a letter calling for action on a bill to end the shutdown.“We’re trying to figure out how to leave it with him in as many places as possible so he can’t keep hiding from us,” said Representative Katie Hill, Democrat of California, who led the group, which at one point wandered onto a mostly empty Senate floor in vain attempts to orchestrate a face-to-face encounter with Mr. McConnell.Neither the White House nor the Secret Service, the lead agency coordinating security for the State of the Union address, had an immediate comment on Ms. Pelosi’s letter suggesting that the shutdown push off the speech.But Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, said in a tweet that her department and the Secret Service were “fully prepared to support and secure the State of the Union.”Ms. Pelosi’s office, appearing to borrow Mr. Trump’s tactic of citing nameless federal employees who he says have sent him messages of support on the shutdown, countered that a furloughed Department of Homeland Security employee had reached out to warn her aides that the department did not have sufficient staffing to manage security needs around the event.With the leadership of all three branches of government gathered in one place, the State of the Union address is one of the highest-stakes events for federal law enforcement each year, requiring weeks of preparation. The Secret Service is among the agencies affected by the shutdown.“Both the U.S. Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security have not been funded for 26 days now — with critical departments hamstrung by furloughs,” Ms. Pelosi wrote.Buttressing her point, another arm of the Department of Homeland Security, the Transportation Security Administration, acknowledged Wednesday that staffing shortages and airport lines were the result of the shutdown, saying in a news release that “many employees are reporting that they are not able to report to work due to financial limitations.” An agency spokesman had previously denounced a CNN report that T.S.A. workers were calling out sick to protest working without pay or seek other employment as “#FakeNews,” a denial Mr. Trump enthusiastically retweeted.Beyond the staffing issues, rescheduling the speech would have other benefits for Democrats, too.With Democrats and Mr. Trump at an impasse over his wall demands, the speech would give Mr. Trump a nationally televised bully pulpit to hammer away at Ms. Pelosi and her party.“What are Democrats afraid of Americans hearing?” Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 Republican, said in a Twitter post, branding Ms. Pelosi #ShutdownNancy. “That 17,000+ criminals were caught last year at the border? 90% of heroin in the US comes across the southern border? Illegal border crossings dropped 90%+ in areas w/ a wall?”The Constitution says the president “shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union.” But what is now a speech to a joint session of Congress in the Capitol has taken different forms over the years, including in writing for much of the 19th century. The House speaker typically arranges the address by invitation, though its date is the subject of mutual agreement with the White House.In her letter, Ms. Pelosi said there was no precedent for holding a State of the Union address during a government shutdown."
250,"WASHINGTON — Chinese bombers. Chinese hypersonic missiles. Chinese cyberattacks. Chinese anti-satellite weapons.To a remarkable degree, the 2020 Pentagon budget proposal is shaped by national security threats that acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan has summarized in three words: ""China, China, China.""The U.S. is still fighting small wars against Islamic extremists, and Russia remains a serious concern, but Shanahan seeks to shift the military's main focus to what he considers the more pressing security problem of a rapidly growing Chinese military.This theme, which Shanahan outlined Thursday in presenting the administration's proposed 2020 defense budget to the Senate Armed Services Committee, is competing for attention with narrower, more immediate problems such as President Donald Trump's effort to use the military to build a border wall.The hearing, for example, spent more time on the wall and prospects for using military funds to build parts of it than on any aspect of foreign policy, including the conflict in Syria or military competition with China, Russia or North Korea.Shanahan is hardly the first defense chief to worry about China. Several predecessors pursued what the Obama administration called a ""pivot"" to the Pacific, with China in mind. But Shanahan sees it as an increasingly urgent problem that exceeds traditional measures of military strength and transcends partisan priorities.""We've been ignoring the problem for too long,"" Shanahan told a senator.""China is aggressively modernizing its military, systematically stealing science and technology, and seeking military advantage through a strategy of military-civil fusion,"" he wrote in prepared testimony to the committee, which is considering a $718 billion Pentagon budget designed in part to counter China's momentum.The $25 billion the Pentagon is proposing to spend on nuclear weapons in 2020, for example, is meant in part to stay ahead of China's nuclear arsenal, which is much smaller than America's but growing. Shanahan said China is developing a nuclear-capable long-range bomber that, if successful, would enable China to join the United States and Russia as the only nations with air-, sea- and land-based nuclear weapons.Shanahan ticked off a list of other Chinese advancements — hypersonic missiles against which the U.S. has limited defenses; space launches and other space efforts that could enable it to fight wars in space; ""systematically stealing"" of U.S. and allied technology, and militarizing land features in the South China Sea.Bonnie S. Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says the U.S. has been lacking effective strategies for competing with China on a broad scale.""It is overdue,"" she said of the Shanahan focus. ""We have been somewhat slow in catching up"" in such areas as denying China its regional ambitions, including efforts to fully control the South China Sea, which is contested by several other countries.Some defense analysts think Shanahan and the Pentagon have inflated the China threat.""I do think it's worth asking what exactly is threatening about China's behavior,"" said Christopher Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. He doesn't discount China as a security issue, including in the South China Sea, but doubts the U.S. military is the institution best suited to deal with such non-military problems as cyber intrusions into American commercial networks.In Preble's view, competition with the Chinese is not mainly military. ""I still don't believe the nature of the threat is quite as grave as we're led to believe"" by the Pentagon, he said. ""They tend to exaggerate the nature of the threat today.""In his previous role as deputy defense secretary, Shanahan and President Donald Trump's first defense secretary, Jim Mattis, crafted a national defense strategy that put China at the top of the list of problems.""As China continues its economic and military ascendance, asserting power through an all-of-nation long-term strategy, it will continue to pursue a military modernization program that seeks Indo-Pacific regional hegemony in the near-term and displacement of the United States to achieve global pre-eminence in the future,"" that strategy document says.That explains in part why the U.S. is spending billions more on space, including means of defending satellites against potential Chinese attack, and on building hypersonic missiles to stay ahead of Chinese and Russian hypersonic weapons development.It also explains some of the thinking behind preparing for an early retirement of the USS Harry Truman aircraft carrier, a strategy that views carriers as a less relevant asset in a future armed conflict involving China.This concern about countering China has permeated the entire U.S. military. Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, head of U.S. Africa Command, said last month that dozens of African heads of state were invited to Beijing last fall to consider billions in Chinese loans and grants, and that China is building thousands of miles of railroads in Africa, mostly linked to Chinese mineral extraction operations.""They're heavily invested and heavily involved"" in Africa, he said.The top U.S. commander in Europe told Congress this week that China also is making inroads in Europe.""China is looking to secure access to strategic geographic locations and economic sectors through financial stakes in ports, airlines, hotels, and utility providers, while providing a source of capital for struggling European economies,"" Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti said."
251,"WASHINGTON — In declaring a national emergency to try to build his long-promised border wall, President Trump invoked extraordinary and seldom-used authorities to bypass Congress’s constitutionally granted power of the purse.Democrats are fuming, and many members of Mr. Trump’s party are uneasy about the precedent that such a declaration will set. Lawmakers seeking to block the president have two paths — one in Congress, the other in the courts.Democrats, who control the House, will drive the opposition. Party leaders did not detail their plans on Thursday, as they reviewed options and awaited the text of the president’s declaration. But outspoken senior lawmakers indicated that they will likely use both paths at once.“He may want to talk to a good lawyer,” said Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee.No, Congress does not have the power to stop the president from declaring a national emergency. But when lawmakers granted the president emergency powers in the first place, they built a check into the law.Under the National Emergencies Act, the House and the Senate can take up what is called a joint resolution of termination to end the emergency status if they believe the president is acting irresponsibly or the threat has dissipated. Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas and the head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said late Thursday that he was ready to introduce such a resolution if Mr. Trump followed through. With a comfortable majority in the chamber, Democrats will most likely pass it or a similarly worded resolution.“I will fully support the enactment of a joint resolution to terminate the president’s emergency declaration, in accordance with the process described in the National Emergencies Act, and intend to pursue all other available legal options,” said Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.To keep a president’s party from bottling such a measure up, the law says that if one chamber passes such a resolution, the other one must bring it up for a vote within 18 days. Though Democrats are in the minority in the Senate, they would need only a handful of Republicans to join them to pass the resolution there and send it to Mr. Trump’s desk. It is easy to imagine a half-dozen or more Republican senators joining Democrats out of concern for the precedent that Mr. Trump’s declaration will set.As with any other bill that comes to the president’s desk, Mr. Trump can veto a joint congressional resolution terminating the national emergency, though supermajorities in both the House and the Senate could ultimately override him.Congress did not originally intend to give the president this recourse when it enacted the law during the post-Watergate reform era that has governed how and when presidents may invoke emergency-power statutes. But the Supreme Court struck down what it calls legislative vetoes in 1983, ruling that for a congressional act to take legal effect, it must be presented to the president for signature or veto. Because it takes two-thirds of both chambers to override a veto, the ruling made it substantially harder for Congress to stop a president’s declaration.This is the crucial question. Half a dozen or so Republicans made their disapproval of an emergency declaration clear on Thursday.“I don’t believe that the National Emergencies Act contemplated a president repurposing billions of dollars outside the normal appropriations process,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. “I also believe it will be challenged in court and is of dubious constitutionality.”Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky and an ally to the president on other issues, said a national emergency declaration of this sort ran counter to the separation of powers outlined in the Constitution. Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, agreed.“My view is that this is better to be resolved through the legislative process,” he said.Still, it is highly unlikely that Democrats can pick up enough Republican supporters in the House or the Senate to override Mr. Trump’s likely veto. The best case for the president’s opponents is that they show deep fissures among Republicans over the wall. They could also try to build bipartisan support for legislation preventing Mr. Trump from drawing money for the wall from funds allocated by Congress for disaster relief.Here Democrats appear to have two choices. The House could either support a lawsuit challenging the emergency declaration brought by a third party or file a suit of its own. There are questions about the House’s legal standing if it were to try to sue on its own, and House leaders and their lawyers will have to decide if it is worth risking filing suit themselves only to be dismissed by a judge for lack of standing. Regardless, a legal challenge is likely to tie up Mr. Trump’s efforts in court for an extended period of time."
252,"WASHINGTON — President Trump appeared poised on Tuesday to end two months of scorched-earth confrontation without the money he demanded for a border wall as Republicans pressured him to accept a bipartisan spending deal rather than close the government again on Friday.Mr. Trump pronounced himself unsatisfied with the agreement brokered by House and Senate negotiators, and he refused to publicly commit to signing it. But he all but ruled out another government shutdown and emphasized that he would find “other methods” to finance a border barrier, leading aides and allies to predict he would grudgingly go along with the deal.“Am I happy at first glance?” the president said, speaking with reporters at the beginning of a cabinet meeting. “I just got to see it. The answer is no, I’m not. I’m not happy.”But he said he was “moving things around” in the budget from “far less important areas” to finance a wall even without explicit congressional approval, and he expressed no desire to repeat the standoff that shuttered many federal agencies for 35 days. “I don’t think you’re going to see a shutdown,” he said.Hours later, after a further briefing, Mr. Trump seemed to signal acceptance of the agreement, saying that it “will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources” and provide plenty of resources for border security even if not for the wall itself. “Regardless of Wall money,” he wrote on Twitter on Tuesday evening, “it is being built as we speak!”The compromise measure, assembled by senior members of both parties on Monday night, includes just $1.375 billion for new fencing along the border with Mexico, far short of the $5.7 billion Mr. Trump sought for a steel or concrete wall — and less even than the deal that he rejected in December, prompting the longest government shutdown in American history.The new measure will be taken up as early as Wednesday by the House, which is controlled by Democrats, followed by the Senate, which is run by Republicans.While some conservatives denounced it as a sellout, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, spoke with Mr. Trump by telephone on Tuesday and urged him to accept the compromise. “I hope he’ll sign it,” Mr. McConnell told reporters afterward. “I think he got a pretty good deal.”Mr. McConnell had initially sought to avoid the confrontation that has consumed the nation’s capital by pressing Mr. Trump to accept the previous measure in December, only to be surprised when the president changed his mind. However unenthusiastically, Mr. McConnell stood by the president for weeks and declined to put spending bills on the Senate floor that Mr. Trump would not sign.On Tuesday, however, Mr. McConnell made clear that he was ready to put the new spending package to a vote even though the president had not endorsed it and, notably, did not rule out overriding a veto if Mr. Trump turned against the compromise as he did two months ago.In an attempt to appease Mr. Trump, Republicans repeatedly referred to the deal as a “big down payment” on his wall and indicated that they were open to him transferring funds within the government to build more barriers. Mr. McConnell said he had no objection to the president using whatever “tools” were available. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee suggested using $800 million in drug interdiction funding to shore up border security in areas used by narcotic traffickers.Republicans also asserted that they scored a victory by fending off Democratic efforts to impose a stricter cap on the number of detention beds for arrested immigrants and by securing any money for a barrier given that Speaker Nancy Pelosi at one point rejected even a single dollar for a wall she deemed immoral.“It’s amazing how shutdown fatigue challenges your flexibility on things,” said Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, adding that he would most likely support the bill if the final text matched the descriptions he had been given.Current and former administration officials said on Tuesday that Mr. Trump seemed to be preparing to sign the bill and then reprogram as much money as he can on his own, although they cautioned that the president is unpredictable and his decision would depend on details still to be examined.Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who joined Mr. Trump on Monday at a rally in El Paso, told attendees at a Senate Republican lunch on Tuesday that his conversations with the president left him with the impression that Mr. Trump was preparing to “pivot” to a “yes” on the deal, according to a person in the room.Even Sean Hannity, the Fox News host who denounced the deal on Monday night as a “garbage compromise” that Republicans would have to answer for, said on Tuesday that he expected Mr. Trump to sign it to keep the government open and get his down payment. “He’s telegraphing what he’s going to do,” Mr. Hannity said on his radio program.Ann Coulter, the conservative commentator whose criticism helped push Mr. Trump into taking a tougher stand in December, agreed but castigated the president for it. “Trump talks a good game on the border wall but it’s increasingly clear he’s afraid to fight for it,” she wrote on Twitter. “Call this his ‘Yellow New Deal.’”Democrats, who had consented in December to give Mr. Trump $1.6 billion for border security, said this week’s agreement showed the folly of Mr. Trump’s brinkmanship. “The president had a better deal back in 2018,” said Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas. “He just ended up in a worse situation.”Mr. Trump told reporters that he was still thinking about declaring a national emergency to bypass Congress and finance wall construction on his own authority, but aides increasingly doubt he will, given opposition by Mr. McConnell and other Republicans.Instead, Mr. Trump seemed to be trying to frame the outcome on his own terms by insisting he would still be able to protect the border. “Right now, we’re building a lot of wall,” he said.In fact, no new walls have been built or financed by Congress based on the prototypes that the Trump administration unveiled in October 2017. Projects to replace or repair about 40 miles of existing barriers have been started or completed since 2017.Construction of the first extension of the current barriers, 14 miles of a levee wall in the Rio Grande Valley, is scheduled to begin this month, but a butterfly center has asked a judge to block construction because the barrier would bisect its property.In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Trump flip-flopped again on taking responsibility for the government shutdown. During the weeks leading up to the impasse, Mr. Trump said he would be “proud to shut down the government for border security” and would not blame Democrats. Then during the shutdown, as 800,000 federal workers were caught in the middle without paychecks, he blamed Democrats after all.On Tuesday, he switched gears again and took responsibility. “I accepted the first one, and I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished because people learned during that shutdown all about the problems coming in from the southern border,” he said. “I accept it. I’ve always accepted it. But this one, I would never accept it if it happens, but I don’t think it’s going to happen. But this would be totally on the Democrats.”As Mr. Trump weighed his options, one person familiar with his thinking described him as frustrated by months of Republicans not doing what he hoped to see done at the border.A few weeks ago, in a meeting with restrictionist immigration group leaders, Mr. Trump faulted former Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a fellow Republican, for repeatedly deferring action on the wall, with promises of doing it down the road. “Now he’s out fishing!” Mr. Trump declared, according to an attendee.The new agreement includes a provision that could give the Trump administration broad discretion to increase the number of slots to shelter detained migrants, a win for Republicans that could ease the sting of Mr. Trump’s failure to secure full funding for his wall.On its face, the agreement authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to fund about 40,000 beds for detainees, many of them in facilities run by for-profit companies and Immigration and Customs Enforcement near the border in Texas, Arizona and California.In background briefings, House Democratic aides described the language as a “glide path” from the current level of 49,000 detention beds back to Obama-era levels of 35,000 or fewer.But a summary of the provisions drafted by Senate Republican staff members placed the average number of beds funded under the deal at a much higher number — 45,274, including 2,500 for families. And that could rise to as many as 58,500 beds, Republican aides asserted in internal communications, because federal cabinet departments have latitude in how they use funds.Under the complex funding formula in the agreement, the Department of Homeland Security would have “reprogramming authority” to transfer as much as $750 million from other programs into detention.“In short, there is more than enough flexibility for ICE to respond to any forthcoming surges in illegal immigrations and apprehensions,” the document said.Two Democratic aides said the Republican memo was accurate in theory, but added that such a drastic expansion in beds was unlikely because it would require taking money from other important programs, such as disaster relief.Democrats on the committee that hashed out the deal, under pressure from immigrant rights groups and their party’s ascendant liberal wing, stalled talks over the weekend by demanding that any deal include a cap of 16,500 beds dedicated to housing detainees apprehended through sweeps of communities away from the border. There are currently 20,000 such slots.Immigrant rights advocates expressed disappointment. “For the last two years, we’ve been in a defensive posture, working to hold the line and prevent the bad, but now House Democrats have the power to start doing good,” said Lorella Praeli of the American Civil Liberties Union, which has sued the Trump administration over its detention policies.On the other side of the ideological divide, Representative Tom Graves, Republican of Georgia and one of the 17 House and Senate lawmakers negotiating a deal, said on Twitter that he had not signed off or seen a final agreement. But “based on the reports, I have concerns,” he said. “Lots of questions too.”Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and one of four lawmakers who worked out the accord, said he was not worried about objections from the right.“In some areas, we probably got more than a lot of people expected, and in some areas we didn’t get as much,” he said. “But that’s the nature of the beast.”"

Here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed (and some links if you’d like to read further).___________________Three votes in Congress this week demonstrated a newfound willingness among some of Mr. Trump’s Republican allies to stand up to him.The first came Wednesday, when the Senate again rebuked Mr. Trump for his defense of Saudi Arabia after the killing of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Senators voted for a second time to end American military assistance for the kingdom’s war in Yemen.On Thursday, a dozen Republicans joined Senate Democrats to overturn President Trump’s national emergency declaration at the southwest border, delivering the second bipartisan rebuke of the week for what lawmakers in both parties deemed executive overreach. That led to the president’s first veto on Friday.And arguably the week’s most consequential vote also happened on Thursday, when House Republicans joined Democrats to demand that the Justice Department publicly release the full findings of Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.Additional Reading• G.O.P.’s Attempt to Avoid Emergency Showdown With Trump Is Scuttled, by Trump• How Every Senator Voted on Ending Trump’s National Emergency• Impeaching Trump Is ‘Not Worth It,’ Nancy Pelosi SaysA poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers released this weekend found Joe Biden atop the field of potential 2020 Democratic candidates, followed closely by Senator Bernie Sanders.But will Beto O’Rourke, whose near-miss Senate run in Texas last year propelled him to Democratic stardom, change the polls?

Jimmy Kimmel questioned whether it made any sense to spend money primarily meant for confronting natural disasters on a wall.Trump often tells horror stories about what happens at the border, and he’s recently made two allegations that caught reporters’ attention: that women are often tied up with duct tape by Mexican smugglers, and that Muslim prayer mats have been found strewn at the border. Kimmel pointed out that these claims have something notable in common — and it’s not just that they’re unsubstantiated.Trump sent a snappish tweet on Thursday arguing that people should “stop playing political games” by using terms other than “wall” to describe the proposed barrier.

255,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)In his first prime-time address from the Oval Office, Mr. Trump sought on Tuesday to cast the situation at the Mexican border as a “humanitarian crisis,” raising the stakes in a dispute that has led to a partial government shutdown.The president’s direct appeal to the American people, and his planned trip to the border on Thursday, are meant to pressure Congress to approve $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall. Yet Mr. Trump privately acknowledged earlier Tuesday that the speech would change little. Democratic leaders then gave their own televised address, criticizing the president for asking taxpayers to pay for a wall he had long said Mexico would fund.Watch: The president’s speech and the Democratic response by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer. (Or read the full transcripts.)Fact check: We verified claims by Mr. Trump and the Democrats.The Daily: On today’s episode, two Times reporters discuss the president’s address.President Trump’s speech on Tuesday painted a bleak picture of life along the border, an area prowled by “vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.”Before the address, The Times sent correspondents to the Mexican side of the border and to the four states on the U.S. side — California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas — and found few who shared the president’s sense of alarm.Another angle: There won’t be paychecks this week for many of the 800,000 government employees caught up in the shutdown. Here’s how the effects are piling up.President Trump’s former campaign manager shared polling data during the 2016 presidential campaign with an associate tied to Russian intelligence, according to a court filing unsealed on Tuesday.It’s the clearest evidence to date that the Trump campaign may have tried to coordinate with Russians. The details: Mr. Manafort’s lawyers apparently made the disclosure by accident while responding to charges that he had lied to prosecutors working for the special counsel. The document also revealed that Mr. Manafort “may have discussed a Ukraine peace plan” with the associate “on more than one occasion.”Another angle: Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who met with Trump campaign officials at Trump Tower in 2016, was charged in New York in a separate case that showed her deep ties to the Kremlin.Beijing has made a number of trade concessions in the hopes that President Trump will end the trade war.Last month, China dropped retaliatory measures on American-made cars and started buying U.S. soybeans again. It has also vowed to end corporate espionage and to allow foreign investors into more industries.But the Trump administration is worried that China won’t follow through on its promises. What’s next: Three days of trade talks ended today in Beijing. The two sides hope to finish a deal before March 2, when higher American tariffs are set to kick in.There are more women over 50 in the U.S. than ever before, according to Census Bureau data.

One exception, per the Espionage Act, is information related to national defense that could be used to harm the U.S. And some things, like nuclear secrets, are separately protected.The Supreme Court has upheld the news media’s right to publish government secrets, citing the First Amendment. The landmark 1971 Pentagon Papers ruling struck down an attempt by the Nixon administration to keep The Times from publishing classified information about the Vietnam War.Still, as our Washington correspondent Charlie Savage notes in our series Understanding The Times, we don’t always exercise that right. Sometimes officials ask us to “consider voluntarily not publishing.”Because “suppressing information is not something The Times takes lightly,” Mr. Savage explains, those decisions are handled by our most senior editorial leadership.“It is extremely rare,” he adds, “for The Times to hold or kill such a story.”"
256,"WASHINGTON — The Senate on Wednesday again rebuked President Trump for his continued defense of Saudi Arabia after the killing of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, voting for a second time to end American military assistance for the kingdom’s war in Yemen and to curtail presidential war powers.The 54-to-46 vote, condemning a nearly four-year conflict in Yemen that has killed thousands of civilians and inflicted a devastating famine, sets the foundation for what could become Mr. Trump’s first presidential veto, with the House expected to overwhelmingly pass the measure, possibly this month. The vote also might be the opening salvo in a week where Senate Republicans have the opportunity to hit back at the president’s aggressive use of executive power. On Thursday, the chamber will vote on a resolution that would overturn Mr. Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to secure funding for his border wall.“The United States Congress is going to reassert its constitutional responsibility over issues of war that have been abdicated for presidents, Democrats and Republicans, for too many years,” said Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, encouraged lawmakers on Wednesday to oppose the Yemen resolution, calling it “inappropriate and counterproductive” and warning them not to conflate their displeasure with the administration’s response to Mr. Khashoggi’s death with the broader issue of the conflict in Yemen. But in a show of defiance, seven Republican senators broke ranks to join the resolution: Mike Lee, of Utah; Susan Collins of Maine; Steve Daines of Montana; Jerry Moran of Kansas; Lisa Murkowski of Alaska; Rand Paul of Kentucky; and Todd Young of Indiana.Still, Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and one of the lead backers of the Yemen resolution, warned that “we shouldn’t overstate the Republican anti-Trump renaissance,” noting that both resolutions under consideration this week had 50-vote thresholds and that Republican defections were relatively limited.Supporters of the Yemen resolution have faced a long and grueling road to get the legislation onto the president’s desk. The Senate — led by the resolution’s authors, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Murphy and Mr. Lee — first passed the measure 56 to 41 in December, but Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker at the time, refused to take up the resolution.His successor, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, did take it up, and the House easily passed it last month. But House Democrats inadvertently derailed the process by supporting a surprise procedural motion offered by Republicans to declare the chamber’s opposition to anti-Semitism. By attaching an unrelated amendment to the Yemen resolution, the House ended its “privileged” status, which would have forced the Senate to quickly take it up and send it to Mr. Trump.The vote on Wednesday was essentially a do-over, and House leadership and the Congressional Progressive Caucus, wary of a repeat derailment, are already urging Democrats to oppose any unrelated amendments that Republicans might add.The resolution is a rare use of the 1973 War Powers Act, which gave Congress the ability to compel the removal of military forces absent a formal declaration of war. Those powers, created after the Vietnam War, have almost never been used, as lawmakers have demurred from intervening in politically delicate matters of war, peace and support for the troops.The conflict in Yemen is proving to be different, and the resolution vote came as Republicans have become increasingly willing to register their unhappiness with Mr. Trump’s foreign policy. The Senate has rebuked the president on his plan to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan, and the House overwhelmingly registered its opposition to his threats to pull the United States from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.But anger over the administration’s dismissive response to the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a Virginia-based columnist for The Washington Post, has been intense and sustained.After first playing down his own intelligence officials’ reports that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was responsible for the killing, Mr. Trump then blew past a legally mandated deadline that required the White House to report to Congress whether it believed the prince was personally responsible for Mr. Khashoggi’s death.In an attempt to defuse rising anger on Capitol Hill, the White House sent two aides from the State and Treasury Departments last week to a closed-door briefing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But senators on the panel were left unsatisfied, with some suggesting it was time for the full Senate to act.“The Senate will have to decide whether it’s going to impose its own sanctions,” said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida.The Foreign Relations Committee, now overseen by Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, a Trump loyalist, however, has yet to report out bipartisan legislation introduced last month that would impose new sanctions on the kingdom. Mr. Risch condemned the passage of the resolution on Wednesday evening, calling it “a terrible message of U.S. division and lack of resolve” and a “bad precedent for using the War Powers Resolution to express political disagreements with a president.”Last month, Saudi Arabia, anxious to turn a new page after the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, appointed Princess Reema bint Bandar bin Sultan as its new ambassador to the United States. She will replace Prince Khalid bin Salman, a son of King Salman and a younger brother of the crown prince, who took the post in 2017."
257,"Like many stories of its kind — migrants fleeing unbearable lives — this one begins at sea, with 60 people jammed like livestock headed to market in a dinghy best suited for six.What makes the journey of these immigrants from the Middle East and Northern Africa different from others is not the dangers they braved before a Spanish rescue crew spotted them last summer in the Mediterranean. Every day, migrants risk everything when they set sail for Europe — drowning, starvation, suffocation and, if they reach land, rejection, detention, even enslavement by traffickers.What makes this story unique is its happy ending, almost as if in a fairy tale.It began on June 30, when Proactiva Open Arms, a search-and-rescue nongovernmental organization in Spain, spotted the dinghy in waters near Libya. Denied a dock by Italy and Malta — most of Europe has cracked down on migrants crossing the Mediterranean — Proactiva Open Arms secured a port of entry in Barcelona.Olmo Calvo, a Madrid-based photographer who has spent more than a decade documenting migrants, was with Proactiva Open Arms when it found the migrants and photographed the rescue, as he has others. From the beginning, Mr. Calvo said, this group was charmed.They were afforded opportunities most migrants rescued at sea never receive, he said, including living quarters and help in seeking asylum. The usual end to migrants’ dreams, Mr. Calvo said, is “they are deported or live irregular lives for many years. What is sure is that they all have a very hard time trying to obtain residency and constructing a life with minimal dignity in Europe.”This group, which included five women and four children, was immediately assured acceptance. They were relocated to an immigrant reception center approximately 70 miles, or a little more than 110 kilometers, away from Barcelona, in a picturesque city called Reus. For six months, the refugees have had language classes in the morning and workshops in the afternoon to help them prepare to work and live independently.At a time when “illegal immigration” has become a political buzz saw — when the United States president is demanding $5.7 billion for a border wall and European states have agreed to reject migrants — Reus has replaced hostility with humanity.In a move that underscored the commitment to the newest residents, city officials were convinced by a social media campaign to invite several of the migrants to join their largest annual celebration, the Festival of the Three Kings, on Jan. 6, or Epiphany.That’s where Edu Bayer, a Barcelona-based freelance photographer, found this story’s extraordinary next chapter.Reus invited an African immigrant to play Balthazar, one of the three kings, or Magi, who took gifts to baby Jesus in the manger, and others to play his assistants. Balthazar, considered by Western church tradition to be the King of Arabia, and a Moor, has traditionally been played in blackface in Spain.“In Spain, it is a big honor to be invited to be a king in the Three Kings Parade,” said Mr. Bayer, who knew he wanted to document this occasion. “Nowadays, it is a multitudinous tradition and deeply rooted throughout Spain. Inviting recently arrived African refugees is a unique case in a major town in Spain.”The festival, as his photos show, was a joyous crush of celebrants. The Africans, Mr. Bayer said, “were ecstatic and told me they wanted to do it again next year.”When Mr. Calvo, a friend, showed him photos from the Open Arms rescue six months earlier, Mr. Bayer was struck by one man: Honoré Becha, a father of four from Cameroon who left for work in 2014, only to be kidnapped, tortured and enslaved for four years before he managed to escape. He was the same man chosen to play Balthazar.Mr. Bayer said he saw Mr. Becha “acting as a leader in a small rubber boat in the middle of the ocean. That vision was crazy, to see how a person’s character makes its way into such opposite situations.”Two weeks after the Three Kings celebration, the Spanish government seized the boat used to rescue the 60 migrants. It grounded the boat for not taking rescued migrants to ports closer to their rescue point, Italy or Malta, though both countries have refused to let the boat dock.Mr. Bayer said he wanted to document a positive immigration story entwined with Spain’s most hallowed holiday.“For me,” he said, “seeing that and remembering the situation in the rescue mission was a revelation of the incredible plot twists that life may have.”Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

258,"Which kind of Super Bowl watcher are you? One who A) cares about the actual game, B) is in it for the snacks, or C) wants to see how the $5.3 million ads stack up? That’s the top asking price for a 30-second commercial during CBS’s broadcast, although some spots are going for the relative steal of $5.1 million. (Oh, and if you’re wondering, I’m a solid C, plus B if spicy wings are available.) This is the first year in a decade that the cost of a Super Bowl ad hasn’t increased — NBC charged $5.25 million in 2018 — mostly owing to waning viewer numbers. You can drop that factoid when the cheese-dip conversation hits a lull, or any of the other business and tech tidbits you’re about to devour in this email. You can have a nachos-and-beer hangover on Monday and still be on top of the news.Which would be more fearsome in a dark alley: Apple or Facebook? We may soon find out as the companies face off over privacy standards. Both announced their fourth-quarter earnings last week, and as expected, Apple’s numbers were a flop (to blame: China’s economic lethargy and a dwindling consumer demand for iPhones). Facebook, on the other hand — or thumb? — reported record profits. It would seem that Facebook won this round — until Apple rained on its parade by shutting down an app that Facebook was using to snoop around in users’ online activity. Apple hasn’t been shy about policing privacy issues before, but this move is downright aggressive, and a convenient distraction from its bad week. One fear you can put to rest, if you have it: higher interest rates on your loans. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, said last Wednesday that “the case for raising rates has weakened somewhat,” signaling that rates may not go up this year after all. This was an about-face from the Fed’s previous indications that it was planning to raise rates twice more in 2019. The markets were cheered by Mr. Powell’s remarks, and American stocks surged to their best January levels in 30 years. But some investors were puzzled by the Fed’s sudden change of heart, and others worried that it revealed the risk of a recession on the horizon.President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela issued a threat to the United States last Wednesday, saying if the Trump administration doesn’t quit trying to oust him and install the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, its officials would get “a Vietnam worse than they can imagine.” He’s widely viewed as an illegitimate dictator who drove his once-prosperous country into an economic catastrophe, but he’s got some heft on his side. Russia, which has provided financial and military backing to Venezuela for years, is also none too pleased about the United States’ oil sanctions against Mr. Maduro’s government. Not by coincidence, the Russian state owns part of Venezuela’s energy sector — a cash cow that it doesn’t want to lose. Now that the government has (temporarily) reopened, Mr. Trump will deliver the postponed State of the Union address on Tuesday. He has said he will emphasize “unity,” and he will surely point to the country’s economic growth and low unemployment numbers. (January’s jobs report was better than expected, even with the shutdown.) He may also reiterate his demand for a border wall, which he said last Thursday he would build regardless of whether he gets congressional support before the Feb. 15 deadline for a new spending bill. If he decides to bypass Congress, the government could close again — which no one wants. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that last month’s shutdown would cost the country’s economy an estimated $3 billion in reduced output in 2019. China and the United States made some progress in trade talks last week, but China still isn’t willing to make all the concessions that United States officials have demanded. So what will it take to settle this trade war before the 90-day truce ends on March 2? Mr. Trump says he wants China to buy more American goods (on top of Beijing’s recent pledge to purchase five million tons of soybeans) and open its markets to American businesses more than it has ever done. He is planning to meet with President Xi Jinping of China sometime in February, ostensibly to sign a deal in person, but details are still forthcoming (as is the deal itself).And around we go again. British lawmakers voted on Tuesday to send the beleaguered Prime Minister Theresa May back to European Union leaders to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s departure from the bloc. The problem is, those European Union leaders are done talking, as they’ve said before and will say again. That gives Mrs. May little time (and even fewer options) to come up with a new plan before the next scheduled vote in Parliament on Feb. 14, followed by the actual Brexit deadline on March 29. As a no-deal scenario appears more likely, more British companies are hoarding products and moving operations elsewhere to protect themselves from a potential economic meltdown. The record-low temperatures that gripped the country last week could cost the economy up to $5 billion in business closings, property damage, flight cancellations, power cuts and even beer deliveries. The entire nation of Tonga had to go without internet access for 11 days after an essential underwater cable was severed. And more companies are covering infertility treatments and egg-freezing costs as part of their employee health care benefits: 44 percent of big employers (those with at least 20,000 workers) offered some sort of in vitro fertilization benefit in 2018, compared with only 37 percent in 2017."
259,"By many measures, America is thriving. The economy is humming, and unemployment is at 4 percent. High-school graduation rates are at an all-time high, and teenage pregnancy rates are at an all-time low. The crime rate is way down, and illegal immigration has been declining for over a decade.And yet: Polls show that three in five Americans think the country is on the wrong track. A majority expect things to get worse in the coming year. The president’s job approval numbers are underwater; Congress’s even more so.As President Trump prepares to deliver his delayed State of the Union address on Tuesday, he might want to ask himself why people are so unsettled.Our dysfunctional political system is surely taking a toll. Witness the recent partial government shutdown over the president’s demand for $5.7 billion in border-wall funding: For 35 days, a quarter of the federal government was derailed and 800,000 workers stripped of their livelihood, at an estimated loss of $3 billion in economic activity. All in service of nothing but a presidential tempest.One certainty: There was not — and is not — a border emergency meriting the infliction of such pain and damage, or the waste of billions on a futile wall. Mr. Trump has said that his big speech on Tuesday will “cover a lot of territory” and emphasize unity. Considering that he pledged the same last year, it’s wise to remain skeptical. But if he is interested in assuring the public that he can see beyond his narrow politicking on immigration to tackle truly urgent problems, here’s a starter list of possibilities:Health care. “We’re going to have insurance for everybody,” Mr. Trump promised. Instead, after laboring to gut the Affordable Care Act, he has so far produced only higher premiums and, according to a recent Gallup survey, seven million more uninsured Americans.Opioids. Mr. Trump was on the right track when, in October 2017, he declared opioid abuse a public health emergency. Yet almost 50,000 Americans died of opioid overdoses in 2017, more than were ever killed by guns or H.I.V. in a single year. Economic inequality. “In many ways this is the greatest economy in the HISTORY of America and the best time EVER to look for a job!” the president tweeted last June. Not for all Americans. Real wages have barely budged for decades; the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour has not risen in nearly 10 years. Though oversimplified, Bernie Sanders’s claim that the top 0.1 percent control almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent is basically correct. Before falling silent on the question, Trump once vowed to eliminate a tax loophole that benefits wealthy hedge fund managers and private equity executives; that might be one proposal on which he could team up with the newly Democratic House.Infrastructure. The president once sought $1.5 trillion in new spending on infrastructure, but Congress allocated only $21.2 billion — or slightly more than 1 percent of Mr. Trump’s pledge. One-quarter of bridges in the United States are structurally deficient or not designed to handle the current traffic, the Department of Transportation estimates. The lead contamination in the water system of Flint, Mich., shocked America, but it was one of many examples of lead-poisoned water around the country. New York’s subways and public housing have fallen into decrepitude. Schools in Baltimore went without heat during last winter.Foreign policy. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump pledged a Middle East peace plan. Where is it? Meanwhile, we are spending roughly $700 billion annually on the military. Our troops have been fighting in Afghanistan for 17 years. Thousands more troops remain in Iraq. The high price of higher ed. Student-loan debt has topped $1.5 trillion and now constitutes the second-largest category of consumer debt, behind only mortgages. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who recently declared the debt load a “crisis in higher education,” has proposed no credible plan to address it.Gun safety. “We’ve seen too much of it, and we’re going to stop it,” Mr. Trump said in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting last February. Yet in 2017, more people were killed by guns than in any other of the past 50 years and at the highest rate since the crack epidemic of the mid-1990s. Climate change. Most scientists — and nations — see it as the mother of all crises. Mr. Trump’s approach thus far: champion fossil fuels and, when the weather gets chilly, tweet a joke about how the nation could use more global warming. Compromise on how to address the climate crisis will be hard to come by. But if the nation’s leaders are going to have a showdown, can’t it at least be over a real problem? "
260,"THE WALL By John LanchesterEarlier this year, The Times reported that President Trump’s pledge to build a border wall had been invented by his advisers as “a memory trick” to keep an unpredictable candidate focused on the issue of immigration. This tells us a lot about Trump, but it also speaks to the power of the wall as a symbol, which is both monumental in its simplicity and elusive enough to sustain any number of meanings, often based — as Ursula K. Le Guin notes in “The Dispossessed” — on which side of it the observer happens to stand.This is the wall that fascinated Jorge Luis Borges, who marveled that the emperor who ordered the construction of the Great Wall of China also burned all of the books in his kingdom; and Pink Floyd, who put it on the cover of an album about a celebrity who dreams of becoming a dictator. John Lanchester’s new novel, also called “The Wall,” arrives at a moment in which the definition of a wall is a matter of national debate, and it actively invites such associations. As the main character says on the first page, as he searches for words to describe the wall of the title, “You look for metaphors.”The narrator is a young man with the Kafkaesque name of Joseph Kavanagh. He has just arrived at the Wall, “a long low concrete monster” that runs for thousands of kilometers around the periphery of an unnamed island nation, closing it off completely from the outside world. All citizens are required to serve there for two years as Defenders, forming the last line of resistance against the threat of an armed invasion. This recalls the Night’s Watch of “Game of Thrones,” except that the country is recognizably Britain, and the enemies on the other side aren’t supernatural White Walkers, but human beings in rowboats and dinghies.As in many dystopian novels, the narrative hints at its back story through the ominous appearance in the text of unexplained proper nouns — the Change, the Breeders, the Others — before revealing that an environmental cataclysm has produced rising sea levels and extreme weather across the globe. Britain, which has been spared the worst, uses the Wall — a literal Brexit — to keep out both water and unwanted immigrants. As Kavanagh makes modest plans for his future, falls in love and finds small forms of consolation, there are shades of Kazuo Ishiguro’s “Never Let Me Go,” but trouble lies ahead, and the second half turns into an ordeal that evokes Cormac McCarthy’s “The Road.”Like most of its literary precursors, “The Wall” opens long after the Change, which allows Lanchester to present his society as a given, without having to worry about the details of the transition — a luxury granted to novelists, if not politicians. The catastrophe evidently happened over a short period of time, creating a historical dividing line as decisive as the Wall itself, and everyone knows whose fault it was: “The world hadn’t always been like this and … the people responsible for it ending up like this were our parents — them and their generation.”This kind of moral clarity has little to do with the real devastation wrought by climate change, which promises to be just gradual enough to allow those who caused it to avoid blame during their lifetimes. Lanchester’s vision of an agonized cultural reckoning seems like its own sort of wishful thinking, and even if we grant his premise, many of his conclusions — like the notion that most people would stop having babies out of sheer guilt — are less than persuasive. Yet if the novel succeeds only intermittently as a parable, it’s gripping as a story, especially when it leaves the Wall. As Lanchester puts distance between himself and his gigantic symbol, the plot grows less constrained, and the last hundred pages are full of tense action and sudden reversals that are mercifully unburdened by any allegorical significance.The result marks a step forward for Lanchester, a formidably intelligent author who has sometimes stumbled over his undeniable gifts. His debut, “The Debt to Pleasure,” was so pleased by its Nabokovian conceit — a murderer’s confession posing as a cookbook — that it settled for a series of variations on the same dark joke. More recently, “Capital” was a credible effort at a big social novel that was so densely reported that its characters barely had room to interact or change.For a certain type of realistic novelist, a shift to speculative fiction — which allows the writer to invent as well as observe — can be liberating. “The Wall” revels in this opportunity, but it occasionally falters under Lanchester’s decision, which echoes “Never Let Me Go,” to keep most of his people slightly colorless, as if to contrast their ordinary inner lives with their horrific situations. In practice, the narrator’s restricted voice prevents us from seeing his world as clearly as we should, and we learn frustratingly little about its most vulnerable actors — the climate refugees on the far side of the Wall.The novel gathers momentum as it goes, and few readers will stop until they reach its final page. Early in the book, Lanchester toys with the idea of “concrete poetry,” in which a poem is typeset to look like its subject, like a house or a Christmas tree. In its closing lines, like the album of the same name, the novel doubles back on itself to take the shape of the Wall — but it lives most vividly in the places where its meticulous structure breaks down. Lanchester constructs a more elegant wall in prose than any politician could in concrete, but the limits that it imposes on itself are still barriers, no matter how artistically designed."
261,"EL PASO, Texas — The Trump administration said Wednesday it will temporarily reassign several hundred border inspectors as beleaguered forces already stationed along the U.S.-Mexico border struggle to keep pace with the growing number of migrant families who are showing up at the border in poor health and turning themselves in to agents to request asylum.Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said the reassignment of 750 border inspectors would mean longer waits at crossings as the busy Easter holiday nears but that it was necessary to address what he called ""an operational crisis."" The reassigned officers will process migrants, provide transportation and perform hospital watches for migrants who require medical attention. It is unknown when they will return to their regular duties.""There will be impacts to traffic at the border,"" McAleenan said at a news conference in El Paso, Texas, which, after years of relative calm, has quickly emerged as the second-busiest corridor for illegal crossings after Texas' Rio Grande Valley. ""There will be a slowdown in the processing of trade. There will be wait times in our pedestrian and passenger vehicle lanes.""McAleenan spoke in front of the metal fencing that separates El Paso from Juarez, Mexico, after a delay that followed the apprehension of several migrants who had crossed a shallow spot on the Rio Grande nearby and turned themselves in.Arrests along the Mexican border jumped to 66,450 in February, up 149 percent from a year earlier, while arrests in the Border Patrol's El Paso sector, which stretches across New Mexico and much of West Texas, were about eight times higher than they were a year ago.March is shaping up to be even busier. McAleenan said the agency was on track to make 100,000 arrests or denials of entry during the month, up about 30 percent from February and about double the same period last year. About 55,000 will have arrived as families, including 40,000 children.The commissioner said the border was at ""a breaking point,"" language that is consistent with the administration's portrayal of a state of crisis. President Donald Trump last month declared a national emergency to obtain military funds for construction of his prized border wall.The political polarization continued to play out Wednesday in El Paso as a small group of protesters erected an inflatable caricature of the president and shouted in Spanish ""you are not alone"" to the migrants being led away.While arrests are still well below highs of the early 2000s, the surge of families and children has tested U.S. authorities.Customs and Border Protection is taking more than 60 migrants to the hospital each day, McAleenan said. In the previous four days, he said infants have had 105-degree fevers, a 2-year-old suffered seizures in the desert and a 40-year-old man suffering organ failure refused surgery.A few hundred yards from where McAleenan spoke, about 600 migrants were held in a football field-sized pen lined with concertina wire under the shade of a bridge that connects El Paso to Juarez. When reporters arrived, migrants lined the fence and some yelled they were hungry. Minutes later, a catering van delivered ham-and-cheese and picadillo sandwiches.The 750 inspectors will be drawn from offices across the entire U.S. border. They will remain inspectors in name but will assist in border patrol, effectively shifting work hours from ports of entry to detention work.Nationwide, Customs and Border Protection has 23,000 officers working at 328 ports of entry, including at airports around the country. But the agency has had the most trouble recruiting officers to work at southern border, where crossings were understaffed before the current surge of migrant families, largely due to low recruitment and high rates of attrition.In Arizona, the ports where most of the country's produce comes through have struggled with low staffing, drawing the ire of trade organizations that say it slows down commerce.In El Paso, drivers can wait for hours to cross back to the U.S.The reassignment of border inspectors follows the Border Patrol's unusual move to close all highway checkpoints in its El Paso sector, which stretches across 268 miles (429 kilometers) in Texas and New Mexico.U.S. officials say the checkpoint closures are a temporary measure to handle the increase in families and unaccompanied children entering the country illegally.The orange traffic cones used to divert traffic off Interstate 10 into the canopy-covered border checkpoint west of Las Cruces, New Mexico, now block the entrance, signaling to drivers that they don't have to stop.The Border Patrol operates 34 permanent checkpoints along the entire Mexican border and another 103 ""tactical"" stops, often cones and signs that appear for brief periods, the Government Accountability Office said in a 2017 report.While checkpoints account for only a sliver of Border Patrol arrests — 2 percent from 2013 to 2016 — they also handled 43 percent of drug busts during that time, according to the report.At a gun range operated by the City of Las Cruces and used by Border Patrol agents, grandmother and Picacho Gun Club volunteer Cindy Pollock said she first noticed the checkpoint closures Thursday.She thought the agents might be off training. When she heard they were reassigned to process migrants, she wasn't surprised.""There's only so many officers and there's nothing they can do,"" said Pollock, who believes the current wave of migrants draws resources away from anti-crime efforts. ""My husband said 'Boy, just think about how many drugs are getting through today.'""___Associated Press writers Elliot Spagat in San Diego and Astrid Galvan in Phoenix contributed to this story."

Here’s the sign-up.)Mr. Stone, a longtime informal adviser to President Trump, was arrested today and charged by Robert Mueller’s office with seven counts, including obstruction of an official proceeding, making false statements and witness tampering.The indictment is the first public move in months by Mr. Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and possible coordination with Trump associates.A self-described dirty trickster who began his career as a campaign aide for Richard Nixon, Mr. Stone has long maintained his innocence.Catch up: Here’s a look at everyone who has been charged in investigations related to the 2016 election.Background: During the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Stone presented himself to Trump campaign officials as a conduit of information from WikiLeaks, which was releasing damaging Democratic emails. Read our report from November.About 800,000 federal workers will miss a second consecutive paycheck today, after two measures aimed at ending the partial government shutdown failed as expected in the Senate.In back-to-back votes, lawmakers first blocked President Trump’s proposal to add $5.7 billion for his border wall to legislation to resume government funding, then defeated a Democratic measure that omitted the barrier. Here’s how every senator voted.What’s next: House Democrats are preparing to outline more than $5 billion in border security measures, a far larger sum than they initially supported. Mr. Trump mentioned “other alternatives” to break the impasse, presumably an emergency declaration that could allow him to shift funds from the military or the Army Corps of Engineers.News analysis: The president prides himself on being a master negotiator, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi “is a different kind of opponent, and one who so far has flummoxed him,” one of our congressional correspondents writes.As the shutdown continues, scientists, engineers and other highly skilled employees are starting to question the appeal of government work.“We didn’t get Ph.D.s just to sit around,” said a chemist at NASA, which has rarely struggled to attract top talent. Most of the space agency’s employees have been furloughed during the nearly six-week shutdown.Yesterday: Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, expressed confusion about why furloughed workers were visiting food banks and said they should take out loans. He’s one of several administration officials who have been criticized as sounding out-of-touch about the shutdown’s toll.

263,"This article is no longer being updated. For the latest news on the government shutdown, click here. The country’s federal courts, which have been open and operating despite the shutdown, could be close to running out of money. Some courts have delayed civil cases, and court-appointed lawyers have not been paid at all. A crippled judiciary system could put enormous pressure on President Trump and Congress to make a deal. The Midwest and Northeast are bracing for a major winter storm this weekend. Employees at the National Weather Service are furloughed during the shutdown, but many forecasters there are considered essential and are working without pay. Veterans in emergency management are worried about longer-term trouble, though. Weather forecasters and emergency responders on the federal, state and local levels have fallen behind on critical preparation, research and analysis that typically takes place this time of the year ahead of the hurricane season.

264,"WASHINGTON — An exuberant President Donald Trump took a victory lap on Capitol Hill Tuesday, emboldened by the end of the special counsel's Russia probe, even as Democrats pressed insistently for Robert Mueller's full report and Justice Department officials said more information could be released in ""weeks, not months.""Trump strode into a high-spirited gathering of Senate Republicans, flanked by party leaders, saying the attorney general's weekend summary of Mueller's report ""could not have been better."" GOP senators applauded his arrival, and he celebrated what he called his ""clean bill of health.""But challenges are ahead for both the Republicans and the Democrats who hope to deny Trump re-election next year. Both parties are readjusting their aims and strategies in the post-probe landscape, pivoting to health care and other issues that are more important for many voters, even with Mueller's full findings still unknown.At House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's own closed-door caucus meeting Tuesday, she urged rank-and-file Democrats to ""be calm"" and focus on the policy promises of health care, jobs and oversight of the administration that helped propel them to the House majority last fall.""Let's just get the goods,"" Pelosi said.Not that the Democrats are forgetting Russia and the 2016 presidential election. Many Democrats dismiss the four-page summary released by Attorney General William Barr as inadequate.""I haven't seen the Mueller report. I've seen the Barr report. And I'm not going to base anything on the Barr report,"" said Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland.""The president is saying he's been completely and totally exonerated by the report,"" Raskin said. ""The one sentence we've seen from the report says this is not an exoneration of the president.""Meanwhile, a Justice Department official said it will take Barr ""weeks, not months"" to finish reviewing Mueller's longer, still-confidential report and make a version available for the public. It's not clear whether that will be Mueller's own words or another synopsis.Trump has said he ""wouldn't mind"" if the full report were released. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he's hesitant to agree to releasing information from Mueller that would ""throw innocent people who've not been charged under the bus."" He is blocking legislation approved unanimously by the House calling for the report's release.In the GOP luncheon, Trump was in a lively mood, senators said. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said the president is ""always high energy. He had a little extra today.""Russia report aside, the president showed an eagerness to move on. He told GOP senators that health care should be their focus heading into the 2020 election.He said he wants them to abandon efforts to simply repeal ""Obamacare"" and instead focus on a replacement for President Barack Obama's signature law.""I was a little surprised he came out of the chute in health care,"" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., after the meeting. ""He wants us to try again.""Even so, the White House was making a new effort to get rid of the Affordable Care Act entirely. In a legal filing late Monday, the administration said it would not defend the act against a court challenge — essentially encouraging the law's demise.Meanwhile, House Democrats, led by Pelosi, unveiled their own sweeping measure to rescue the program on Tuesday.Trump's hour-long talk to Senate Republicans touched on trade, foreign policy and a vote later in the day on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal, which the Senate declined to take up. Trump said the climate-change proposal would be a good campaign issue to fight over with Democrats.Almost no mention was made of the president's national emergency declaration to expand the border wall with Mexico, even though the House was voting on an effort to block it as the senators lunched. Congress had voted to block Trump, and he had vetoed that action. House members voted 248-181 to override Trump's veto, but that was well short of the needed two-thirds majority. Fourteen Republicans joined Democrats in trying to block the president from taking military funds to build his long-promised wall.The president seemed to have heeded advice from allies, including Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who encouraged him to use the political capital he's now gained to accomplish policy goals.Pelosi's advice to Democrats to stick with the strategy that won them control of the House in 2018 was reinforced by Obama himself, who counseled freshman Democrats at a reception Monday night.Obama advised the newly elected lawmakers to focus on constituents' hopes and concerns, while also identifying issues they feel so strongly about that they'd be willing to lose their House seats in fights over them, according to people at the private party.The focus must go beyond Russia and collusion, Democratic leaders said.""House Democrats did not win the election on collusion; we didn't win the election on impeachment; we didn't win the election on obstruction of justice,"" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the Democratic Caucus chairman. ""Our candidates didn't even talk about those issues. What we all collectively talked about was making life better for everyday Americans ... and that's what we're going to continue to do.""At the same time, Democrats will continue their investigations of the Trump-Russia connection, and other aspects of the president's finances and business practices, including his tax returns.""You can't move forward on a four-page memo,"" said Rep. Karen Bass of California. ""It's hard for me to accept that as an objective opinion.""Six House Democratic committee chairmen have written to Barr asking to have Mueller's full report by April 2. If not, they have suggested subpoenas could be issued.___Associated Press writers Eric Tucker, Andrew Taylor, Catherine Lucey, Jill Colvin, Alan Fram, Mike Balsamo and Padmananda Rama contributed to this report.___Follow all of AP's Trump Investigations coverage at https://apnews.com/TrumpInvestigations ."
265,"The Trump Organization said late Tuesday that it was implementing a system to weed out undocumented immigrants who try to get jobs at its properties. The move followed reports in The New York Times last month that the president’s company was employing people at its flagship golf club in New Jersey who are in the country illegally.“We are actively engaged in uniforming this process across our properties and will institute E-verify at any property not currently utilizing this system,’’ Eric Trump, an executive vice president of the company, said in a statement. “As a company we take this obligation very seriously and when faced with a situation in which an employee has presented false and fraudulent documentation, we will take appropriate action.”Thousands of employers have enrolled voluntarily in the government’s E-Verify electronic system, which checks documents provided by new hires against Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security records. A mismatch suggests that the person is unauthorized to work.All federal contractors must use E-Verify, and 22 states require at least some private and public employers to do so. The federal E-Verify database suggested that the Trump Organization did not use heightened employment document verification procedures at several of its properties, meaning that the chances of employing undocumented workers was high.The New York Times reported in December that undocumented immigrants had been employed for years at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., as housekeepers, landscapers and kitchen staff.They were kept on the payroll despite the fact that management was aware that they had used phony documents to secure employment, as is common among undocumented immigrants.Victorina Morales, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala, said that a manager at Bedminster helped her secure a new fake Social Security Number and legal permanent-residency card after telling her that those on file had expired.Since the articles were published, about a dozen workers deemed ineligible to work in the United States because they lacked legal immigration status have been terminated at the Bedminster club, according to people familiar with the matter.Another dozen were fired at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester earlier this month, a development first reported by the Washington Post.“I must say, for me personally, this whole thing is truly heartbreaking,’’ Mr. Trump said in the statement on Tuesday. “Our employees are like family but when presented with fake documents, an employer has little choice.”He said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the Trump Organization, and that it “demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately.’’The Trump Organization said last month that it would immediately terminate those who were not authorized to work in the United States. But for several weeks it failed to respond to questions about what measures it was taking to rectify the situation.President Trump has made border security and protecting jobs for Americans cornerstones of his presidency, from the border wall he has pledged to build — it recently resulted in the partial government shutdown — to the workplace raids and payroll audits that his administration has carried out.Mr. Trump launched his bid for the G.O.P. presidential nomination in June 2015, declaring that the United States had become a “dumping ground for everybody else’s problems.” Mexico was “sending people” to commit crimes and bring drugs. “They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,” he said.In a speech in Arizona shortly after, he deemed illegal immigration “a major, major problem in this country,” vowing to erect a wall along the southwest border.In August 2015, Mr. Trump told The Times that his companies employed only people with legal work papers.When the Trump International Hotel opened for business in Washington, the president boasted that he had used E-Verify to ensure that only those legally entitled to work were hired.“We didn’t have one illegal immigrant on the job,” Mr. Trump said then.About 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States and about eight million of them are in the labor force, according to the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan think tank. It is an open secret that many businesses, especially in the service sector, employ them.To deter illegal hiring, Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducts audits of businesses, having slapped tens of millions of dollars in administrative and criminal penalties on those found to employ undocumented workers since the early 2000s. These inspections have intensified under the Trump administration.From Oct. 1, 2017, through July 20, 2018, ICE opened 6,093 work-site investigations and made 675 criminal and 984 administrative work-site-related arrests, several times more than in the entire 2017 fiscal year from Oct. 1, 2016 to Sept. 30, 2017.Employers who use E-Verify contend that they struggle to attract enough workers to perform menial, physically onerous jobs. The vast majority of businesses simply require applicants to fill out a federal form, the I-9, and present identification and Social Security card, which they assume are genuine."
266,"DUBUQUE, Iowa — At a packed eastern Iowa house party, a staffer for Democrat Beto O'Rourke's presidential campaign tried to clear enough space for the candidate to reach the kitchen, where he would need to climb a stepladder to address the crowd.""I need my lane,"" the staffer bellowed as he moved through the crowd. ""Beto's coming right through here.""Somewhere in the rows of pressed-together faces, a spectator quipped: ""But which lane is it? The liberal lane? Some other lane?""That's a prophetic question for one of the 2020 field's most unconventional candidates. In a primary that has so far been defined by progressive energy, the former Texas congressman with a scant political resume is trying to avoid definition. He left a distinctly moderate record behind in Congress and, in the early days of his presidential campaign, has vowed to work with Republicans and woo voters who backed Donald Trump in 2016. But he's also hit progressive talking points on everything from white privilege to marijuana legalization .The architects of his campaign insist he's not interested in adhering to a particular ideological lane, and O'Rourke himself shuns party labels. But trying to have it both ways could leave Democratic voters with the impression that O'Rourke is a candidate with a split political personality.""I see him as offering Rorschach politics,"" said Norman Solomon, a Bernie Sanders delegate to the 2016 Democratic National Convention from California. ""In the age of Trump, when you want to be something for everybody, you're going to end up being amorphous for a lot of people.""Backers say O'Rourke can and should toggle between liberal and moderate positions depending on the topic.""If there's an issue he might be more centrist on, he's honest about that. He doesn't try to pander to a certain base,"" said Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., who endorsed O'Rourke over another, home-state Democrat in the race, Sen. Kristen Gillibrand.Rice described O'Rourke's work in Congress as progressive on issues like gay rights and the environment but seeking consensus on other topics, such as veteran's issues. She also applauds how he's introduced himself to voters by taking lots of questions: ""He creates the space for a dialogue. He is not just throwing out red meat to people.""As a presidential candidate, O'Rourke has moved more to the center than he did last fall, when he nearly upset incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. O'Rourke had called for impeaching Trump but has since backtracked. He once endorsed Sanders' ""Medicare for All,"" but now backs a more moderate House plan known as ""Medicare for America.""""It's got to be all of us, not just Democrats, not just Republicans,"" O'Rourke repeats while campaigning. ""I'm running for president for every single state in the United States of America and every single person in every single one of those states.""That rhetoric sounds a lot like Barack Obama's pitch to voters in 2008. Solomon, who was a Democratic delegate for Obama that year, said trying to recreate the former president's brand of pragmatic progressivism isn't a winning strategy in 2020, when many Democratic voters are motivated by anger toward Trump. That could also be a challenge for Obama's vice president, Joe Biden, who is nearing a decision on whether to join the campaign as a leading centrist candidate.""We can't just be nice to Republicans,"" said Solomon. ""We know that doesn't work.""O'Rourke has deviated from messages of moderation by expressing openness to adding justices to the Supreme Court and tearing down U.S.-Mexico border walls in places like his hometown, El Paso. He's also equated the criminal justice system to modern day Jim Crow laws because he says it's so much tougher on people of color.And O'Rourke has championed the ""Green New Deal,"" liberal Democrats' sweeping plan to combat climate change, and a federal assault weapons ban, though he concedes that current owners of AR-15 rifles should be allowed to keep using them ""responsibly and safely.""It's all a far cry from when O'Rourke arrived to Congress in 2012. Though he called for the federal legalization of marijuana long before much of the rest of the country began to turn on the issue, O'Rourke pledged to be pro-business and joined the New Democrat Coalition rather than the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He'd also said he would support raising the Social Security eligibility age and basing eligibility on recipient income.O'Rourke refused to back Nancy Pelosi's House minority leader bid in 2016, dismissing her and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York while campaigning against Cruz for misunderstanding Texas. But Pelosi had only kind words for O'Rourke last week, calling him a ""welcome addition"" to the 2020 primary.He also drew criticism from home-state Democrats for failing to endorse Gina Ortiz Jones, who was trying to unseat Republican Rep. Will Hurd in November. Hurd lives outside San Antonio and when a 2017 snowstorm canceled flights to Washington, he and O'Rourke drove from Texas to the nation's capital, livestreaming for hours and developing a friendship that some celebrate as a rarity in such hyperpartisan times.But Democrat MJ Hegar, who nearly defeated Republican Rep. John Carter in a suburban district outside Austin and may challenge him again in 2020, pointed to that bond as an example of how O'Rourke and other members of Congress' ""good ole boys club"" were ""looking out for your bros more than fighting for your values.""Rice counters that the party doesn't have to agree on everything.""The last thing the Democrats need to do is to kill each other,"" the congresswoman said. ""We need to remember that we're all on the same side.""___Associated Press writer Elana Schor in Washington contributed to this report."

268,"Tom Brokaw, the former anchor of “NBC Nightly News,” apologized Sunday evening for comments about Hispanics and assimilation he made earlier in the day on the network’s “Meet the Press.”“I feel terrible a part of my comments on Hispanics offended some members of that proud culture,” Mr. Brokaw tweeted. “I never intended to disparage any segment of our rich, diverse society which defines who we are.”Mr. Brokaw, who retired as anchor in 2004 and currently serves as a special correspondent for NBC, had nonchalantly said that Hispanics should make a greater effort to blend into American culture. His comments, made during a discussion about President Trump’s desired border wall, led to an immediate backlash.“Hispanics should work harder at assimilation,” Mr. Brokaw said. “That’s one of the things I’ve been saying for a long time. They ought not to be just codified in their communities but make sure that all of their kids are learning to speak English, and that they feel comfortable in the communities, and that’s going to take outreach on both sides, frankly.”Yamiche Alcindor, the White House correspondent for “PBS NewsHour” and a former New York Times reporter, was also on the panel and responded to Mr. Brokaw’s comments.“You’re talking about assimilation. I grew up in Miami, where people speak Spanish, but their kids speak English. And the idea that we think Americans can only speak English, as if Spanish and other languages wasn’t always part of America, is, in some ways, troubling,” Ms. Alcindor said.Among those who criticized Mr. Brokaw was Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas. He explained in a Twitter thread that even though there are generations of Hispanics in the United States, they are, in his opinion, never truly considered American.“For a celebrated journalist who spent years chronicling American society you seem stunningly ignorant of the Hispanic community in this country,” Mr. Castro tweeted. “Unfortunate to see xenophobia pass for elevated political commentary.”The National Association of Hispanic Journalists denounced Mr. Brokaw in a statement released on Sunday.“Brokaw’s comments also ignore the fact that most U.S. Hispanics are born in the United States; English is their native language,” the statement read.The organization also criticized him for what it viewed as an insufficient apology.“The ‘sorry some Hispanics were offended’ apology tweeted by Tom Brokaw earlier this evening is not an apology at all,” the group said. “It only further demonstrates Brokaw’s lack of understanding of what forced assimilation does to communities.”In a 2016 national survey of Latinos, Pew found that 41 percent of Hispanic adults between the ages of 18 and 35 use English as their dominant language. The study found that 40 percent of Hispanics in the same age group are also bilingual.Another Pew study found that Americans with Hispanic ancestry are less likely to identify as Hispanic as generations go on. By the third generation, the share that self-identifies as Hispanic falls to 77 percent.“Assimilation is denying one culture for the other,” said Hugo Balta, the president of NAHJ and a senior producer at MSNBC. “Hispanics are no less American for embracing their country of origin or that of their ancestors. Being bicultural and bilingual is a strength in an increasingly multiethnic, multilingual society.”Mr. Brokaw opened his commentary by claiming that people on the “Republican side” do not want their children to marry Hispanics.“A lot of this, we don’t want to talk about. But the fact is, on the Republican side, a lot of people see the rise of an extraordinary, important new constituent in American politics, Hispanics, who will come here and all be Democrats,” he said. “I hear when I push people a little harder, ‘I don’t know whether I want brown grandbabies.’ I mean, that’s also a part of it.”One of former President George H.W. Bush’s grandchildren took offense to the “brown babies” comment.“With all due respect @Tombrokaw I am one of those ‘little brown ones’ and can assure you that my grandparents conveyed to me that they loved and were proud of me before they passed,” tweeted George P. Bush, the Texas land commissioner and a son of former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.Mr. Bush and his two siblings, who are Mexican-American, were once famously referred to as “the little brown ones” by their late grandfather, who claimed to use the term affectionately.As the anchor of “Nightly News,” Mr. Brokaw, 78, was the face of NBC for more than 20 years. Since he stepped down in 2004, he has appeared on the network’s news shows, most often to discuss politics, elections and historical events. Mr. Brokaw has also produced and directed documentaries and special segments.Mr. Brokaw sent out a bizarre string of tweets along with his apology, at one point writing, “My tweet portal is whack.”“Finally, I am sorry I failed to convey my strong belief that diversity, dynamic and inclusive, is what makes America,” he said.In a statement released Monday night, a spokesperson for NBC News said, “Tom’s comments were inaccurate and inappropriate and we’re glad he apologized.”"
269,"WASHINGTON — The government shutdown that ended last month has taken a lasting hit on the Coast Guard, which has grounded aircraft, stopped major ship repairs and will leave parts of an air station in Puerto Rico without emergency generators for the start of hurricane season because of a backlog that will take months to process.Internal documents obtained by The New York Times show that the Coast Guard’s ship maintenance command lost at least 7,456 productive workdays — or 28.5 years’ worth of workdays — as a direct result of the partial shutdown, which furloughed 6,400 civilian employees.“This reality poses significant risk to operational availability of cutters and boats,” the documents concluded.The service also noted a “domino effect” that has caused delays in repairs and maintenance on its roughly 200 aircraft, which, in turn, could keep them from being immediately available.There are “tremendous backlogs of contractor work,” the documents said.[Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty, conflict and consequence.]The delays are expected to significantly limit the number of ships and aircraft available for Coast Guard operations, which generally include drug interdiction as well as search-and-rescue and maritime safety missions. They will also affect the training of the uniformed and civilian Coast Guard force.“You can get the money, but you can never get the time,” said Mark F. Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “It’s going to hurt them for quite a while.”The shutdown ended on Jan. 25. But over 35 days, as President Trump held out for $5.7 billion in congressional funding for a border wall, most federal agencies were unable to pay their employees or contractors. That included the Coast Guard, the only branch of the military that is not part of the Pentagon.As a branch of the Department of Homeland Security, the Coast Guard went without pay until the shutdown ended. According to the documents, the Coast Guard finance center in Virginia processed about $46,000 in mutual assistance loans — funds often reserved for dire personal hardships — and at least one special request for a service member who sought approval for outside employment.During the shutdown, Coast Guard members “continued activities authorized by law that provided for national security and protected life and property,” Chief Warrant Officer Barry Lane, a Coast Guard spokesman in Washington said in a statement to The Times on Friday. “The Coast Guard stopped or curtailed some specific mission activities that did not fall into those categories.”The documents, dated the day before the shutdown ended, outlined a grim forecast for the small service of 55,000 active duty, reserve and civilian employees.Over the last decade, the Coast Guard has struggled to secure steady funding levels from Congress. It did receive a $600 million lift this month after a spending bill funded a replacement for the Polar Star, the Coast Guard’s only heavy icebreaker.But the shutdown hobbled the vessel, which the documents described as one of the Coast Guard’s “highest priority” ships. The spare parts inventory for the 400-foot Polar Star’s three Pratt and Whitney gas turbine engines were “below safety stock levels,” the documents said, and an employee was taken off furlough to work on a maintenance contract issue for the vessel.Other examples of the shutdown’s effects on the Coast Guard included:■ Roughly 600 employees at the Aviation Logistics Center in Elizabeth City, N.C., potentially would have to work overtime for five to seven months to make up for production lost during the impasse.■ The number of aircraft across the Coast Guard deemed “not mission capable” doubled to 10 percent of the aircraft, from 5 percent. Twenty-five aircraft — roughly 12 percent of the Coast Guard fleet — that are under maintenance have had their completion dates pushed back a total of 277 days.In the short term, that has created a weekslong delay of delivering a training helicopter to Mobile, Ala., and a surveillance aircraft to Miami. The surveillance aircraft are often used for maritime patrols and spotting drug runners.■ In Alaska, a dry dock needed for repairs to the 110-foot cutter Liberty was closed as a result of the shutdown. The Liberty patrols some of the world’s most dangerous waters, and was preparing to go to sea from its home port in Auke Bay in mid-January when one of its diesel engines seized.■ An engine replacement in one Legend-class cutter and modifications to the small boat launching equipment in the rest of the fleet were delayed. The Legend cutters were built specifically to support Pentagon operations; the ships already were plagued by cost overruns and delays.■ Crucial maintenance was pushed back for two “buoy tenders” — smaller boats meant to ensure the position of navigational markers on internal waterways and rivers. One was based in Keokuk, Iowa, on the upper Mississippi River, where thousands of tons of cargo pass through annually. The other, in Chattanooga, Tenn., maintains markers in the Tennessee River and seven other rivers, as well as two creeks and one other waterway.■ At Coast Guard Air Station Borniquen in Puerto Rico, where Hurricane Maria tore through in 2017, a project to install emergency generators for base housing “will not be in place before the start of hurricane season,” which begins June 1."
270,"If you had to pick the weirdest moment of the week, would it be:Feel free to add your own. Whatever you say, I’ll probably believe you. It’s as if we’ve fallen down a rabbit hole and landed in a Wonderland totally devoid of wonder.Even if you really, really want Donald Trump to be a total failure hurtling his way back toward civilian life, it’s not comforting to have a president who’s so out to lunch. Just think about that trip to Texas. McAllen, the city Trump chose to demonstrate the terror of wall-free borders, was recently listed by U.S. News & World Report as one of the best places to retire in the nation. But the president, who was making only his second trip to the border since he took office, assured the public he knew how terrible things are because “I have been there numerous times.”And that was just one tiny piece of his week! The big news, of course, was our catapult toward an all-time government shutdown record.Pop quiz: When Trump was invited to comment on the pain of the unpaid government workers, did he say:A) That it’s better than being killed by an illegal immigrant.B) That a lot of them think it’s worth missing their salaries to get a wall.C) That he, too, had to suffer by spending the holidays in the White House.D) All of the above.O.K., I know that was too easy.It does feel as if we’ve fallen down a rabbit hole into an alternate universe that is definitely not Wonderland. Just keep telling yourself that it isn’t going to last forever. Soon the presidential primary races will be underway and concerned citizens will have something to talk about besides the Mad Hatter. It looks as if the Democrats are going to have lots of serious policy discussions. And the fact that this week Beto O’Rourke posted videos of himself having his teeth cleaned is just one hint that there will also be plenty of cheering diversion.Meanwhile, your best options near-term are either to get together with friends and drink heavily, or crawl under your bed and assume a fetal position.If the floor under the bed looks too dusty, you can always hire a government employee to vacuum.Just for the sake of perspective, try to imagine how the nation would have responded if Trump’s week had happened under Barack Obama. Obviously Obama didn’t have a yen for border walls. But he was a big proponent of gun regulation — suppose, just for the sake of comparison, he told Congress he wanted billions of dollars to confiscate all the automatic weapons in the country.Then imagine the opposing party dug in its heels, and Obama announced he was going to veto any spending package that didn’t include his plan. The government shuts down. Then Obama makes a special address to the nation from the Oval Office. “My fellow Americans: Tonight I am speaking to you because there is a growing crisis over guns,” he begins.No fair pointing out that at least he wouldn’t sound like he was gasping for breath every time he read a sentence off the teleprompter.By now, in our parallel universe, the nation — which had heard the gun speech several thousand times before — begins to drift away or debate whether his sniffling was from hay fever or nerves. Nobody’s mind gets changed, but the next day congressional leaders try to sit down and work out a compromise that might, say, invest a lot more money to enforce the existing laws. Obama ignores them and demands, “Do all guns go?” When they say no, he slaps the table, walks out the door, and lets the government just … stop. And maybe whines a little bit about how he had to spend Christmas in Washington.Well, obviously Republicans would be shrieking for Obama’s impeachment. But Trump just goes babbling along. Secure in his conviction that the best way to protect our safety involves stopping the pay for air traffic controllers.When a reporter asked whether he accepted the old Harry Truman line about how “the buck stops here,” our president responded that “the buck stops with everyone.” He won’t even admit where the buck stops! Do you think that’s because he’s just incapable of accepting responsibility or because he doesn’t know who Harry Truman was?On the plus side, in the future you can tell your grandchildren that you were there when the government set records for not being open for business. For now, take a federal worker to lunch."
271,"MEXICO CITY — The Guatemalan government said Monday that it would expel a United Nations-backed anticorruption panel, giving its prosecutors a day to leave the country in the most decisive effort yet by President Jimmy Morales to remove the body that has been investigating him and other top politicians.At a news conference in Guatemala City, Mr. Morales, accompanied by members of his cabinet and several people accused in panel investigations or their relatives, defended his expulsion order.“Cicig has put public security and governability at risk,” he said, using the acronym for the panel. “Cicig has repeatedly violated the human rights of Guatemalans and foreigners in Guatemala through selective and partial justice.”Earlier on Monday, Foreign Minister Sandra Jovel accused the panel of interfering in Guatemala’s internal affairs, and said the government was withdrawing from an agreement with the United Nations that established the panel more than a decade ago.The panel’s international prosecutors had 24 hours to leave the country, Ms. Jovel said at a news conference at the United Nations, after meeting with António Guterres, its secretary general. Mr. Guterres has publicly expressed support for the panel, called the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala.The expulsion of the commission, which works alongside Guatemalan prosecutors to bring corruption cases, was immediately challenged in the country’s Constitutional Court.In the 16 months since Mr. Morales first began trying to block the commission’s work, the court has consistently ruled in its favor. His decision to summarily end the panel’s work sets the stage for a possible constitutional crisis if the court again rules against the government.In a statement, Stephane Dujarric, a spokesman for Mr. Guterres, said that “the secretary general strongly rejects” the decision to end the agreement, and that he “recalls the important contribution of Cicig to the fight against impunity in Guatemala.”Mr. Guterres expects the government of Guatemala to protect the commission’s personnel and fulfill its obligations under the agreement, Mr. Dujarric said.Mr. Morales was not always so hostile to the corruption panel, which played a large role in his election in 2015.He swept into the presidency as an outsider candidate after the panel’s investigations had discredited many of his potential rivals and forced the president, Otto Pérez Molina — accused of leading a customs fraud scheme — to resign.And after he took office, Mr. Morales promised to work closely with the commission, which under the leadership of Ivan Velásquez, a Colombian prosecutor, had become increasingly effective at peeling back layers of corruption across much of Guatemala’s political and business elite.But the panel’s success turned it into the focus of attack. After the panel and the attorney general’s office accused Mr. Morales’s brother and son in a fraud scheme, the government’s relationship with the panel became tense.When it accused Mr. Morales himself — of campaign finance irregularities — the government began an overt effort to block the panel. The government succeeded in keeping Mr. Velásquez out of the country, but he continued to work remotely.Last year Mr. Morales announced that he would not renew Cicig’s two-year mandate when it expires in September, a decision permitted under the agreement with the United Nations.But now, rather than let the mandate simply run out, the government has moved to eject the panel ahead of the presidential election in June. Under Guatemalan law, Mr. Morales is not eligible to run for re-election.There was no immediate comment from the Trump administration, which has cooled the United States’ longstanding support for the commission under intense lobbying from the Morales government.But Representative Norma Torres, a Democrat from California who was born in Guatemala, was quick to condemn the Guatemalan government’s decision.The commission’s “abrupt departure would be a major setback for Guatemala’s fight against corruption,” she said. “Complex cases involving organized crime, drug trafficking, and human smuggling would fall apart. Powerful criminals and corrupt politicians would get away with serious crimes.”American support for Cicig, which includes paying for part of its budget, has been based on the premise that reducing corruption and improving the rule of law would help the broader effort to tackle the poverty and violence that are driving Guatemalans to leave their country in the hope of reaching the United States.Thousands of destitute families from Guatemala and Honduras have gathered at the United States’ southern border in the past few months, many in large caravans that Mr. Trump has called “an invasion,” and used to argue for construction of a border wall."
272,"We need to look at the bright side of Donald Trump’s border wall fixation.Sure, he’s shut down the government and thrown the nation into chaos. But it could be worse. He could be demanding a fiery moat between us and Canada. Or building a 36,000-foot-deep barrier across the Pacific Ocean to drive home his commitment to tariffs.See? There’s always a silver lining.Trump wants a $5.7 billion down payment to build a wall along the Mexican border to protect us from caravans of terrorists and drug dealers. We hadn’t heard a lot about the caravan menace since the midterm elections, but the president brought it back on Wednesday. This was shortly before he walked out of a meeting with Democratic leaders about the government shutdown.The two sides disagreed on who caused the talks to collapse. Obviously, it was something about the you-know-what. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer claimed that when the wall came up, Trump “sort of slammed the table … and said we have nothing to discuss.” Republican leaders tried to pin all the blame on obdurate Democrats.“I said bye-bye,” tweeted the president.O.K., this one is pretty clear. The meeting was brief. After only about 30 minutes, he who says “bye-bye” is the culprit. Even if, as House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy claimed, Trump “brought a little candy for everybody.”Maybe all this wall obsessing makes Trump tired. He certainly seemed low-energy during his Oval Office address. “He makes Jeb Bush look like a combination of Mighty Mouse and Bruce Springsteen,” a friend of mine said after the president finished his nine-minute speech to the American people. For every viewer whose response to the talk was “Wow, we should do something about immigration!” there must have been a hundred whose first reaction was “Why does this man keep sniffing?” Deviated septum? Nasal polyps? Trump’s breathing has actually sounded strange for a long time, but most of us have chosen to ignore it rather than engage in a national conversation about the president’s nose.If you watched the address — and really, you could have, it was only about as long as it takes to microwave popcorn — you saw a 72-year-old guy squinting at the teleprompter and making rather alarming breathing sounds while reading a speech about how we need a wall to protect women who are “sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico.”This is not a man who should wrap his arguments around the idea of protecting women from sexual assault. But also, gee, he sounded like Uncle Fred who you haven’t seen for a while and suddenly he shows up for Thanksgiving with weird colored hair and vacant eyes and he’s talking into his mashed potatoes.Now we know why Trump never made a speech from the Oval Office before. He’s a guy whose great political talent is yelling applause lines to a howling mob of supporters. If they cheer, he goes back again and again. When he first announced he was running for president, he got an enthusiastic response to a speech that called Mexicans drug-dealing rapists. We will always wonder what would have happened if he’d said “Pre-K, all the way!” and gotten a similar reaction. Maybe this week he’d be on TV refusing to fund the government until he got more money for early childhood education.Trump’s political advisers encouraged him to carry on about a wall during the presidential campaign because they wanted him to focus on immigration and understood how difficult it is for him to stay with … a thought. As Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Peter Baker of The Times reported recently, the advisers knew he liked to brag about building stuff, so they decided to “get him to talk about he’s going to build a wall.”Again, think of the bright side. What if they’d wanted his signature issue to be American pre-eminence throughout the globe and got him to peddle a plan to build a huge tower that would reach all the way to heaven? Hasn’t been attempted since Genesis, but if you stacked a million hotels on top of one another — Make America Great! By now Trump would have closed off a quarter of Illinois to make room for the foundation.There’s no way to be cheery about the government shutdown. This is really terrible. Some of those suffering most are smaller government contractors, whose businesses could very well fail while they wait to be paid for work they’ve already done. (Stiffing contractors is possibly the only area of his job in which our president has a lot of pregovernment experience.)But about the wall. People, how do you feel about putting a concrete or whoops-maybe-steel-slats barrier between us and Mexico?A) Great way to avoid the constant danger of caravans.B) Meanspirited waste of money.C) Better than the fiery moat.The beat goes on. Thursday had Trump scheduled for a visit to the Texas-Mexico border — a trip that the president told a lunch with TV newscasters is “not going to change a damn thing.”He sure sounds negative. Do you think he believes he’s already been to the border enough? After all, he already went there in 2018. Next thing you know, they’ll be expecting him to go there every year."

275,"WASHINGTON — A last-ditch gambit to spare Senate Republicans a hostile showdown with President Trump over the Constitution’s separation of powers was torpedoed on Wednesday by the president himself, increasing the likelihood that the Senate will vote on Thursday to overturn the president’s emergency declaration and force the first veto of his term.Hoping to avoid a confrontation with Mr. Trump over his declaration of an emergency to build his coveted border wall, Republicans tried to rally behind legislation to limit the power of presidents to declare emergencies in the future while allowing the current president’s end-run around Congress.But Speaker Nancy Pelosi quickly derided that idea and then Mr. Trump threw cold water on it himself, phoning the Republican author of the new legislation, Senator Mike Lee of Utah, during a Senate luncheon to inform him it was no deal.As a result, Mr. Lee said he would now vote to end the emergency declaration, the fifth Republican “yes” vote — and other Republicans, with no alternative route, are likely to follow.“Unfortunately, it appears the bill does not have an immediate path forward, so I will be voting to terminate the latest emergency declaration,” said Mr. Lee, who had earlier said he did not think the president’s actions were unconstitutional.The outcome left Republicans with a difficult choice. They can back the president in what is widely seen as a surrender of Congress’s core power of controlling federal spending. Or they can join Democrats and break with a president who is popular within the party on his maneuver to build a wall that is also popular with Republicans.To Mr. Trump, the decision is not all that tough.“I think anybody going against border security, drug trafficking, human trafficking, that is a bad vote,” the president told reporters at the White House as he delivered another warning shot to Republicans who would dare to buck him. He also defended the constitutionality of his declaration despite the bipartisan refusal of Congress to fund the wall.“I think it is bad for a Republican senator — I also think it is bad for a Democrat senator — to vote against border security and to vote against the wall,” he said. “I think to vote that way is a very bad thing long into the future.”But Republicans are struggling with the vote. Conservatives such as Mr. Lee and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky — another Republican who says he will vote for the resolution of disapproval — believe that members of Congress have ceded far too much power to the executive branch over the years in an effort to avoid taking politically tough stances themselves. Republicans regularly accused President Barack Obama of executive overreach on issues such as immigration, health care and the environment and now risk being accused of hypocrisy if they stand by while Mr. Trump ignores Congress to do as he wishes.Many Republicans believe that allowing Mr. Trump to redirect money at his own discretion after Congress explicitly forbade it would amount to a final acquiescence to the executive branch that could set a precedent for future Democratic presidents. But they are also in no rush to irritate a president who has shown vast capacity to stir Republican voters or to rile the activist groups that back him.On Wednesday, The Hill newspaper reported that conservative groups such as the Club for Growth were considering backing a primary challenge next year to Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, because of his opposition to Mr. Trump on the emergency declaration and other issues.Looking for a way to not anger Mr. Trump and salvage some congressional pride, Mr. Lee introduced his proposal that would require Congress to approve any emergency declaration or it would terminate after 30 days at most. That would mean approval by Congress would be required rather than the current arrangement in which Congress is given the option of disapproving an emergency declaration and the president can veto it. Under the current legislative arrangement, Congress can block an emergency declaration only if opponents can muster the two-thirds vote to override a veto.“If we don’t want our president acting like a king, we need to start taking back the legislative powers that allow him to do so,” Mr. Lee said.The Lee bill, however, would have no impact on the president’s current emergency declaration. Republicans saw it as a way to both back Mr. Trump and close the door to future use of the declarations by presidents — notably Democratic presidents — to circumvent Congress.But the reception was not good. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, mocked the proposal as “bunk.”“What a fig leaf,” he exclaimed.Ms. Pelosi effectively killed it by declaring that the House would not even consider the plan. “Republican senators are proposing new legislation to allow the president to violate the Constitution just this once in order to give themselves cover,” she wrote in a statement on Wednesday morning. “The House will not take up this legislation to give President Trump a pass.”Even before he spoke to reporters, Mr. Trump took issue on Twitter with Republican senators and their reticence to back him.“Republican Senators are overthinking tomorrow’s vote on National Emergency,” the president said. “It is very simply Border Security/No Crime — Should not be thought of any other way. We have a MAJOR NATIONAL EMERGENCY at our Border and the People of our Country know it very well!”But the president’s stand only increased the likelihood that the Democratic resolution to block his emergency would pass — less than 24 hours after the Senate rebuked him on a separate issue by voting to end military assistance for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen.While it would be a loss for Mr. Trump, it may not be as bad as it could have been.When the president first announced his determination to move forward with the emergency after signing a spending bill to end the government shutdown in February, there was significant dissent among Republican senators and the White House faced a wider revolt.In the interim, through a concerted personal campaign, Mr. Trump has had some success in limiting defections. Proponents of overturning the declaration are likely to be far short of the 67 Senate votes needed to override the promised veto.Still, congressional passage of a resolution of disapproval could help the plaintiffs in a number of lawsuits who are suing to block the declaration as a flagrant violation of the Constitution."
276,"President Trump has declared a national emergency — purely in order to fund his wall. The courts may — or may not — reject his gambit. But the fact that he may actually possess the legal authority to require agencies to waste billions of dollars simply to fulfill a foolish campaign promise he thinks won him the election is itself scandalous. The theatrics surrounding his petulant threat to do so obscure a vital question for our democracy going far beyond this (non)crisis, a question to which Congress should immediately turn: Who decides what constitutes a national emergency?In hundreds of laws, Congress has given the president the power to decide. (The Brennan Center for Justice has compiled an exhaustive list.) But by failing to define crucial terms, legal standards and accountability rules, Congress has handed presidents an all-too-handy tool of tyranny commonly used by autocrats to amass more power, crush dissent and eviscerate democratic institutions. In Mr. Trump’s case, it has handed an unguided missile to an ignorant, impetuous man-child.Congress should have known better. After all, it enacted the National Emergencies Act of 1976, which purported to regulate such declarations, only two years after President Richard Nixon’s abuses of power forced his resignation. The act actually made matters worse in a key respect: It defined a national emergency as “a general declaration of emergency made by the president.” This circular definition, of course, is no constraint at all. Or as Humpty Dumpty says to Alice, “it means just what I choose it to mean — neither more nor less.”In the nature of national emergencies, some definitional leeways are unavoidable. But Congress could readily specify certain conditions that must exist before the president can make such a declaration and thus arrogate to himself extraordinary powers — curtailing liberties, seizing property, spending funds appropriated for other purposes and suspending protective laws — that Congress would not otherwise be likely to grant him in advance, or perhaps ever. (Indeed, Congress has the power to override Mr. Trump's declaration and it should in this case — though it probably won’t.)One can easily specify some of the factors in a national emergency condition that any responsible Congress would insist on before allowing such a declaration to take effect: magnitude (the feared incremental harms of the condition are very large, not just marginal); geographic scope (those harms should be nationwide even if the triggering condition is more localized); extraordinary (the condition should be rare, if not unprecedented); imminence (the anticipated harms should be so close in time that Congress cannot deliberate); and likely effectiveness (the president’s action should promise to substantially solve the problem).Reasonable people may disagree, of course, about precisely how Congress should define and weigh these factors, how they should be applied to the facts on the ground and whether other factors should be considered. President Trump’s wall cannot survive such a rigorous analysis: Even assuming that recent illegal border crossings harm the nation, they are not greater (indeed, they are probably fewer) than in recent decades; Congress has been deliberating (in its fashion) for decades about immigration reform, including border walls; and many Americans believe that the wall would be ineffective and a bad idea. Congress simply disagrees with the president about which border security measures would do the job — an instance of decidedly normal politics.But my larger claim — that Congress’s delegation to presidents of vast, essentially unconstrained power to declare national emergencies has been an irresponsible surrender of its constitutional responsibilities — does not depend on whether my assessment of this particular case is correct. Not since the New Deal has the Supreme Court struck down a statute for this kind of standardless delegation of legislative authority to administrative agencies, but the Roberts court — activist, conservative and suspicious of broad delegations of power to agencies — recently reached out to review a case, Gundy v. United States, that gives it an opportunity to revive the long-dormant and doubtful non-delegation doctrine.Another way to make the National Emergencies Act more compatible with the rule of law is through a procedure that would broaden participation in all future decisions to declare national emergencies. Under one such reform, the president would have to consult with the leaders of both parties in Congress before issuing a declaration. Even if Congress could not override such a declaration, members would have to take a public position on the facts and reasons invoked as justification by the president. If time were of the essence (not so in this case; Congress has legislated about a wall for more than a decade), their responses would have to be expedited. With such a procedure in place, judicial review of the declaration could be narrow, if at all.If national emergency declarations are as important as presidents (with Congress’s acquiescence) claim them to be, then they are important enough to be subjected to such standards and procedures. In the long run, this is more crucial to the vitality of our democracy than whether President Trump ultimately gets his wall.This article has been updated to reflect news developments. "
277,"MONTREAL — Being nice in Canada can sometimes feel like a full-time job.There was that time Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cuddled with two baby pandas.Over the weekend, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland welcomed a Saudi teenager at Toronto airport with a warm embrace after she had fled abusive members of her family and been granted asylum in Canada.Now, Canadian air traffic controllers have helped burnish the country’s image as the do-gooder of the world by sending hundreds of pizzas to their American counterparts, who have been working without pay since a government shutdown began on Dec. 22.And, yes, some were apparently garnished with Canadian bacon.Peter Duffey, president of the Canadian Air Traffic Control Association, said the show of cheesy support began last week when employees at an air traffic control center in Edmonton, Alberta, decided to buy pizzas for their colleagues at an office in Anchorage, Alaska. Soon, dozens of other Canadian traffic control centers joined in.“We wanted to show solidarity with our American colleagues,” he said. “In our society we are polite and friendly people and this gesture is part of that.”“In the United States, people have responded to this simple act of pizza by saying, ‘Damn, you Canadians are so nice. I’m moving to Canada.’ ”By Monday, about 400 pizzas had been delivered to air traffic control towers across the United States, from El Paso, Tex., to Ronkonkoma, Long Island, which on Friday received 32 pies from Gino’s Pizzeria of Ronkonkoma, compliments of air traffic controllers in Gander, Newfoundland, and Moncton, New Brunswick.[Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox? Sign up for our weekly Canada Letter newsletter.]Many Canadians have reacted with shock to what they regard as the seemingly endless drama of the Trump administration, including the special counsel investigation of President Trump and the acrimonious trade negotiations between Canada and the United States.Now the United States government is partly shut down, caught in a political dispute over securing money for a southern-border wall that Mr. Trump wants to help keep migrants out.Canadians have sought to avoid un-Canadian-like behavior such as gloating. But with the pizza deliveries, they appeared to bask in their own relative serenity and yet another feel-good moment reaffirming their humanism.“ ‘Pizza Diplomacy’, eh!” Ankur Chhabra, an economist studying public health in Toronto, wrote on Twitter. “Proud to be in a country that is so full of love and respect for everyone. Our southern neighbors need to imbibe this more often, I guess.”“That’s why the world loves Canada,” an entrepreneur identified as KC wrote on Twitter.“That’s amore,” added The Toronto Star.In the United States, where about 10,000 air traffic controllers have been working without pay, the reaction was also effusive.On ATC Memes, a Facebook page run by a former air traffic controller that helped the pizza gifts gain global attention, there was an outpouring of gratitude for Canada.Among those commenting was Chris Taylor, who saluted the country of bone-chilling weather, socialized medicine and maple syrup.“I know who I’m voting for next election,” he wrote. “Canada!”A Twitter user identified as “Call me Myke” wrote that he was very grateful for “the extremely kind gesture of buying us pizza while our own government isn’t paying us.” He added, “I might have to cheer for a Canadian hockey team.”“O! Canada we don’t deserve you,” added George Capen, a California-based United States Navy veteran.Mr. Duffey noted that air-traffic control was among the most stressful jobs, and that the Canadians, who work closely with Americans to ensure the safety of North American airspace, hoped that the pizza would cheer them up.“In our business you have to be 100 percent right, 100 percent of the time and there is no room for error,” he said. “Now, on top of that, people have to come to work and worry about the added stress of paying their mortgages or putting food on the table.”Canadians, he added, had long shown humanity in times of crisis in the United States, including during the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when citizens of Gander, Newfoundland, housed and fed nearly 6,700 people after American airspace was closed and 38 planes were forced to land in the small Canadian town of 10,000 people.Their willingness to host those who were stranded captured the global imagination, and inspired a Tony Award-winning Broadway musical, “Come from Away.”Pilgrims from the United States have even traveled to Gander to meet “nice people.”Canadian air traffic controllers were not alone in expressing solidarity with their American counterparts through pizza offerings. Controllers at the Irish Aviation Authority base in Shannon did the same, ordering six large pies for workers in Westbury, Long Island, news media in Ireland reported Monday. The Irish Sun said Borrelli’s Italian Restaurant Cafe and Pizzeria delivered the pies Sunday night."
278,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox.Late-night hosts spent plenty of time on Wednesday attacking President Trump’s nationally televised speech the previous night.But they also poked fun at Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, who had delivered the Democrats’ rebuttal from behind a single podium, standing joylessly and speaking in a subdued tone. Stephen Colbert called them “Congressional Democratic leaders and direct-to-DVD Addams Family Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi.”And Trevor Noah slammed their presentation.Colbert also discussed the meeting that took place between Trump, Schumer and Pelosi on Wednesday, when they convened to negotiate an end to the government shutdown. Schumer told reporters immediately after the meeting that it had ended abruptly, with Trump storming out soon after it started because Pelosi said she would not support building a border wall.Kevin Hart dropped by “The Late Show” on Wednesday, and Colbert wasted no time addressing the elephant in the room: Hart’s ouster as the host of this year’s Oscars, over homophobic Twitter posts and jokes he had made.Ellen DeGeneres went to bat for Hart last week, saying she spoke on his behalf with a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and encouraging Hart to consider re-enlisting as host. But Hart put an end to the speculation on Wednesday morning when he appeared on “Good Morning America” and ruled out changing his mind. (Variety reported on Wednesday that the Oscars would go without a host this year for the first time in almost three decades.)When Colbert pressed Hart on the issue, Hart insisted he was “over it” and said he didn’t want to continue addressing the story. “I don’t have anything else left to say,” he said. But he did lament that he would not be able to do the show. “I had some heat,” he said. “I had some real good jokes.” Then he previewed some of the quips, mostly about how uptight the stars in the audience are on Oscars night.Most of the shows had taped too late on Tuesday to analyze Trump’s national address that night. So they got caught up on Wednesday.Jimmy Kimmel invited a T.S.A. agent who’s been working for no pay during the government shutdown onto his show. Then he asked her to help him figure out which of three random pedestrians was high on pot.Gwenyth Paltrow, virtuoso singer.Senator Kamala Harris of California, who is high on the list of Democrats thought to be considering a run for president in 2020, will talk to Stephen Colbert on Thursday.An original producer of the Woodstock festival has announced that he will host a 50th anniversary edition this summer, featuring acts both old and young.Plus, Ideas for What to Watch Tonight:The Best Movies on Amazon Prime Video Right NowThe 100 Best Movies on Netflix Right NowThe 25 Best Films of the 21st Century"
279,"On Thursday, Nancy Pelosi became the first person in 64 years to return to the position of speaker of the House of Representatives, completing the most startling comeback in American politics since Richard Nixon became president.Her return says a great deal about Ms. Pelosi and about our politics, but above all it is a triumph of nerve and ability. Republicans have tried for years to make Ms. Pelosi’s very name a curse. President Trump and members of his party have called her, among many other things, the promoter of a “socialist agenda” and the “unhinged face” of her party, while others have labeled her as both the “San Francisco Democrat” that she is, and a “machine” politician from Baltimore, where her father and an older brother both served as mayor.The strategy seemed to be working. Through most of last year’s midterm campaigns, many Democrats also warily avoided endorsing her, speaking instead of the need to embrace “a new generation of leadership” and replace a “toxic brand.” But when the vote for speaker was over last week, there was Ms. Pelosi with gavel in hand again, having lost only 15 votes from her caucus.How did this happen?Qualifying for Congress today has come to seem more and more like the college admission process, where you pile up incredible achievements that will rarely benefit you on campus. The speakership, by contrast, is a place for pluggers. It’s an odd post, rare in democratic politics, where one can serve simultaneously in opposition and the majority, leading your own party in the House while dealing with a president from the other side.There have been political stars in the office. Henry Clay put in the second longest time there. James G. Blaine, “the plumed knight” of post-Civil War Republicans, held the post for nearly six years. Neither of them made it to the position they coveted, in the White House — though the one former speaker who did become chief executive, James K. Polk, was the most successful one-term president in our history. Say what you will about his agenda — and a lot of people, then and now, had a lot to say — Polk was a model of efficiency and won the Mexican War, nearly doubled the size of the United States, lowered tariffs and instituted an independent Treasury system before refusing to run for re-election and quietly dying three months after leaving office. A very speaker-like performance, when you think of it. Ms. Pelosi, the only woman to be speaker, is also the first person to repeat in the office since Sam Rayburn, who served a record 17 years as speaker over three different stretches in the office, the last of which only ended with his death, in 1961. “Mr. Sam,” a moderate Texas Democrat, twice exchanged the speaker’s gavel with his Republican counterpart, Joe Martin, a moderate Massachusetts conservative. This was back in a more parliamentary era, when no one considered the vagaries of voters in a national election to be a reason to kick out a perfectly able congressional leader.Rayburn helped steer the country through World War II and much of the Cold War, served faithfully under Presidents Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower; became a mentor to Lyndon Johnson; and insisted L.B.J. join the national ticket under John Kennedy. Rayburn also built up one of his successors, the diminutive Carl Albert from Oklahoma, who, after gaining the speakership, twice found himself first in the line of succession to the presidency during the Watergate scandals. On each occasion, Albert did all he could to put others in place before him, believing, as he said on becoming speaker, “I hope we will get together, and work for the country, and not work for the two political parties.”Such a sentiment, not to mention the idea of stepping away from power for the good of the country, seems so alien to our politics today that it might have come from a different age. In light of such service, talk of toxic brands and a new generation of leaders seems misplaced.Rayburn, Albert and Tip O’Neill — who negotiated a key bill with President Ronald Reagan to preserve funding for Social Security — formed the ideal of the modern speakership. They shaped policy, worked with presidents from either party, molded their successors and tried to move the wheel forward. They sought compromise but also tried to bring about what progress had to be made. Above all, they respected the institution they led, the most thoroughly democratic part of our national government.It was a model that worked very well — or at least it did until Newt Gingrich wrecked it, as he wrecked so much that he put his hand to. Mr. Gingrich’s rebellion was aimed at cozy, low-level corruption and complacency, which certainly existed in the old speaker system. But his brand of self-aggrandizing hyperpartisanship proved exactly wrong as a corrective. Unable to conquer or to compromise, he ended up fleeing the Capitol engulfed in investigations and hounded by allegations about his own personal conduct.Ms. Pelosi represents a restoration of that ideal, and she brings formidable talents and a legendary work ethic (back) to the job. In what was described as an “unbelievable marathon” to secure Obamacare, she personally took on the task of winning over 60 wavering Democrats. To win back the speakership this time, she swayed another 60 or so members of her caucus.“For Pelosi, the strategy in every campaign she runs is ‘owning the ground,’” writes her friend Steve Israel, a former congressman, which is “not just a matter of a campaign field operation,” but “extends to message as well.”Ms. Pelosi doesn’t hesitate to associate her own ambitions with the quest for women’s equality — “You know why I do it? I do it because I want women to see you do not get pushed around,” she told CNN’s Dana Bash — and some, including Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, have attributed Ms. Pelosi’s ability to whip a caucus to the mothering skills that come from having five children and eight grandchildren: “She has eyes in the back of her head.”At the same time, she regularly displays what have traditionally — wrongly — been considered male attributes in politics. She keeps her head when all about her are losing theirs and is adept at the deadpan gibe, usually delivered right between the ribs. When President Barack Obama and his chief of staff Rahm Emanuel seemed about to abandon the Affordable Care Act in despair, she mocked their proposed alternative as “incrementalism” and “Kiddie Care,” and told them: “We’ll never have a better majority in your presidency in numbers than we’ve got right now. We can make this work.” She proceeded to get it done, vote by vote, maneuver after maneuver.Republicans have already received a full barrage of what Ms. Pelosi can do. She quietly but directly called Mr. Trump out on his lying and “fearmongering” about immigration, labeled the government’s closing the “Trump shutdown” and mocked his planned border wall as a “beaded curtain” and “a manhood thing for him.”The day after Mr. Trump subjected us to a cabinet meeting that seemed like a lost outtake from Charlie Chaplin’s “Great Dictator,” Ms. Pelosi turned the opening of the new Congress into a jubilant festival, one that celebrated the youth and diversity of her party, complete with a table full of Bibles and a male representative rocking a baby. She took her oath of office surrounded by children — and followed it up by pushing through a series of bills that both parties had previously voted for, challenging Republicans to reopen the government and giving a speech that quoted Reagan.In her second stint as speaker, Ms. Pelosi goes into the job with a majority that is 21 seats smaller than what she enjoyed previously, and without a Democratic White House or a Senate majority to aid her. She has limited herself to four years in the job — part of the price of regaining it — and her remarkable energy notwithstanding, she will be nearing her mid-80s when she finishes it. She must navigate a much nastier Washington culture that is likely to turn even uglier as congressional investigations into the president begin, and the Mueller report is delivered.On the other side is Ms. Pelosi’s restive new Democratic majority, which demands a say in setting the agenda. This is not Mr. Sam’s House of Representatives. The brightest new Democratic star, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, joined a protest in Ms. Pelosi’s office before she even took her seat. When Carl Albert showed up for his first day at the House, he was given a pile of papers to deliver to an office by an older congressman who mistook him for a page. (Albert did as he was told.) Ms. Pelosi would never so disrespect a member, and it may well be that both her new majority and her old-school skills will serve her well. As Ronald Brownstein pointed out in The Atlantic, changing demographics have left her with far fewer conservative Democrats from blue-collar or rural districts — Democrats who hobbled Ms. Pelosi and such previous Democratic speakers as Tom Foley and Tip O’Neill. Her current majority may squabble over economics, but it is unlikely to fight over social issues like immigration, gay rights or abortion.The “San Francisco Democrat” and product of the “Baltimore machine” may be just the person to lead this new coalition. Asked on her first day back as speaker why she would not compromise on the border wall, Ms. Pelosi told the press, seemingly off the cuff: “A wall, in my view is an immorality,” before adding, “It’s the least effective way to protect the border and the most costly.”There was the old Democratic liberalism at its best, idealistic and pragmatic at the same time: The wall is wrong because it’s wrong, plus it won’t work. It’s worth noting that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez cast her first vote in Congress to return Nancy Pelosi to the speakership. Mr. Sam would be proud."
280,"Even in a room dotted with Hollywood luminaries, the arrival of Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper at a table at the National Board of Review awards gala Tuesday night caused a special kind of commotion.Chairs were pushed aside. A group of onlookers formed seemingly out of nowhere, many raising their phones over each other trying to snap a picture. When a server balancing a platter of food approached the fray, a waitress offered her colleague two words: “Good luck.”Generally speaking, the mood at the gala, held at Cipriani 42nd Street, was more casual than other awards season events, due in part to the fact that, as is always the case, the night’s winners had already been announced. (“Green Book” won best picture and actor; “A Star Is Born” took best director and actress.) Also, the event isn’t televised so acceptance speeches, unencumbered by broadcast time limits, were much looser and longer (and at times more rambling) than the Golden Globes on Sunday. Walkoff music played only when speeches were actually finished.The night’s winners took advantage of that freedom to comment on the diversity in the teams behind this year’s movies.Constance Wu, who starred in “Crazy Rich Asians,” which won for best ensemble, seemed to channel the 2002 Oscar acceptance speech by Halle Berry when she said, “This award isn’t just for us but it’s for all underrepresented people to finally be seen.”Michelle Yeoh, another “Crazy Rich Asians” star, was applauded when she spoke of the film as a “landmark, historical moment for our culture.” She added, “You don’t have to treat us special. Just give us equal opportunities, that’s all we ask.”There were also cheers in the audience when the “Orange Is the New Black” star Uzo Aduba presented best supporting actress to Regina King for her turn as the matriarch in the James Baldwin adaptation “If Beale Street Could Talk.” Aduba pointed out that “we rarely see such a multidimensional African-American woman on screen — let alone over 40.”“In a time when we must unite as a single nation,” she added, “when we must remember there are still the same issues facing us as Mr. Baldwin wrote about in ‘If Beale Street Could Talk’ over 40 years ago, these stories have to be told.”As the ceremony was unfolding, President Trump was addressing the nation about his long-promised border wall, and his presence was heavily felt in the room.Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie, who won for breakthrough performance in “Leave No Trace,” said she wanted to acknowledge the goodness in people. “Through the goodness in people, we can make a start toward a better world, a world that won’t come about if we build walls to keep each other out.” The comment was met with applause.Soon after, Barry Jenkins, winner of best adapted screenplay for “If Beale Street Could Talk” and perhaps inspired by a profanity-laden speech Robert De Niro gave at last year’s gala, delivered the night’s most direct and harshly worded rebuke of the president.“There is a film here called ‘Minding the Gap’ that is being celebrated by Bing Liu,” Jenkins said, referring to one of the board of review’s top five documentaries. “His family, they immigrated here and the president does not want them here. Chloé Zhao, who directed ‘The Rider,’ which is a masterpiece — the president does not want her here. There was a film this year called ‘Roma’ made by a man named Alfonso Cuarón. The people in that film, the president does not want here.”And then, using a decidedly stronger word than “forget” and eliciting some of the loudest applause of the night, Jenkins said: “Forget him.”A big cheer came when the directors Betsy West and Julie Cohen began their acceptance speech for best documentary for “RBG” with a “medical update” on the film’s subject, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.“We are told by her family that Justice Ginsburg’s recovery from recent surgery is going very well,” West said.Lady Gaga, walking onstage to accept the award for best actress for “A Star is Born,” asked, “Is Judge Kavanaugh still in office?” She went on to comment on how her own work helped her understand the challenges her character would face as a young woman in the music business, saying, “in my career, I have over and over again tried to subvert the influence of powerful men.”“Every time they told me to go left,” she went on, “I would take a sharp, sharp right.”She also expressed gratitude toward her collaborators, especially Bradley Cooper, whom she called a “modern directorial Houdini.”Later, after being presented with the award for best director by Steven Spielberg, Cooper said that the recognition for his directorial debut gave him the “courage to disregard fear and to continue to pursue truth with love.”"

Ross Douthat thinks the shutdown standoff is obscuring a more complicated debate over immigration policy. And David Leonhardt warns that undocumented immigration is a more politically perilous issue than some Democrats want to admit.Then, the columnists talk women in politics. Are Elizabeth Warren, Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez victims of sexism, or have they found a way to turn gender bias into a political advantage?Finally, Michelle has an offramp from our all-consuming news cycle: Read more fiction!Background Reading:I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they all intersect. I’m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I’m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the “reasonable” elites. I’ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I’m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife.I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use “liberal” as an epithet, but that’s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump’s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I’ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian émigré who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.I’ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago — first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I’ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.My politics are left of center. But I’m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today’s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges — inequality, climate change, the rise of China — and they’ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.Tune in on iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, Stitcher or wherever you listen to podcasts.

282,"Good morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)Remember how we said we’d be trying out some new things in the newsletter? Today, we’re going to let images do most of the talking.This month, the San Francisco Art Institute and U.C. Santa Cruz will host an exhibition featuring archival photographs of Black Panthers by Pirkle Jones and Ruth-Marion Baruch, many of which were first shown 50 years ago at the de Young Museum.Some of them, though, haven’t been exhibited before — and I’m excited to say we have an exclusive preview.The original 1968 exhibition drew more than 100,000 visitors, according to The Times’s obituary for Mr. Jones — it included now-iconic images of young black men and women, clad in leather jackets and berets, solemnly holding guns or waving flags.I was struck by how these pictures contain a kind of quiet normalcy. They show Black Panthers doing the things members of any community might do. Activists read on a lawn, their feet splayed casually. A woman kisses a little girl on the cheek at a rally.Kat Trataris, who manages exhibitions, events and partnerships for the institute, said the latter was among her favorites.“The intimate moments in these photos — that, I think is lacking from the vernacular around the Black Panther movement,” she said. “Not everything is about violence.”Still, Ms. Trataris said images of Black Panthers should continue to spark debate. The party rose in response to police violence and economic inequality that disproportionately affected black people. Those aren’t problems that have been fixed.In the new exhibition — which was largely put together by students, and guest curated by the artist Leila Weefur — work by young, local black artists will be shown alongside the photographs. That’s meant to “augment the conversation that’s been happening over the last 50 years,” Ms. Trataris said.As for Mr. Jones and Ms. Baruch, they were at home in a Bay Area arts scene that has changed over the decades, but hasn’t stopped welcoming misfits.“In the pictures of them, they look like they’re funny people,” Ms. Trataris said. But, she added, “I don’t think just anybody would’ve been allowed in these moments.”Here’s more about the show, “Vanguard Revisited: Poetic Politics & Black Futures.”(A note: We often link to content on sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

283,"This article is part of the David Leonhardt newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday.I’ll confess to being torn about the major television networks’ decision to air President Trump’s speech tonight on the border wall. On the one hand, the networks said no to President Barack Obama when he asked for airtime to give a speech on immigration in 2014. They said it was too political to deserve a free prime-time spot — and Trump’s speech is clearly political, as well. But if they had said no to Trump, the decision would have dominated the political conversation for at least a couple of days. The issue would be a fight between Trump and the media as much as it would be about the government shutdown or immigration policy. And I think fights between Trump and the media tend to benefit Trump. They turn attention away from his own presidential incompetence and misbehavior toward journalists, who aren’t exactly the most popular group of people in the country.Of course, this whole situation means that Trump is effectively rewarded for his scorched-earth style of politics — with a prime-time address. But don’t despair. The speech probably won’t matter, as Jonathan Bernstein of Bloomberg Opinion explains. “We have plenty of evidence on this one: Presidential speeches rarely change minds,” he writes this morning. “Voters most likely to tune in to such a speech are the partisans least likely to change their minds, either about the policy or the president.”I do hope the networks fact-check Trump as soon as the speech is over. It’s likely to be filled with his usual array of false claims.GerrymanderingIn the run-up to the midterms, some wild claims made the rounds about the likely impact of gerrymandering. One much-quoted analysis predicted that Democrats would need to win the popular vote by 11 percentage points to retake the House.These claims — which mostly came from the political left — were wrong. Democrats won the popular vote by 9 points and also won a 36-seat majority in the House. Gerrymandering wasn’t as big of a deal as many had feared.Since the midterms, though, we’ve seen a mirror image version of those wild pre-election claims. The new argument — mostly from the political right — is that the midterms have shown that gerrymandering isn’t a problem at all. “The Gerrymander Excuse Implodes,” a Wall Street Journal editorial declared.This argument is also wrong. Gerrymandering remains a problem. In many states, politicians have drawn oddly shaped congressional (and state-legislature) districts to keep members of their own party in power. The practice is “an insult to voters, whichever party is in charge,” the editorial board of the The Charlotte Observer recently wrote. “It essentially robs millions of voters of their voice, since the outcome is preordained.”The problem exists in states where Democrats last drew the districts, like Illinois and Maryland — and it’s even more severe in Republican-drawn states, like Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.The simplest way to see gerrymandering is to compare the current House to the previous one. In 2016, Republicans won the House popular vote by a mere 1 percentage point — but that translated into a 47-seat advantage, even larger than the current Democratic margin. Gerrymandering continues to make the votes of some Americans count more than others.The good news is that some states are starting to draw districts more fairly, thanks either to judicial rulings or voter initiatives. In November, anti-gerrymandering ballot measures passed in Colorado, Michigan and Missouri.But the ultimate solution should be federal — to create a uniform set of rules and keep both parties from being tempted to gerrymander. Which brings us to the news on Friday that the Supreme Court agreed to hear two gerrymandering cases. ...The justices and democracyUnfortunately, the justices may decide to make the gerrymandering problem even worse.When Anthony Kennedy was on the court, the court repeatedly sidestepped a definitive ruling on the issue, as Amy Howe of SCOTUSblog explains. The four justices appointed by Democratic presidents favored such a ruling, but the five Republican-appointed justices did not. And other than Kennedy, who seemed torn, the Republican justices were willing to uphold gerrymandering plans.Now that Brett Kavanaugh has replaced Kennedy, the legal scholar Richard Hasen predicts that the court is likely to support gerrymandering — by reversing lower-court rulings that have found it to be unconstitutional. Even worse, Hasen writes in The Atlantic, the court could eventually hear a case challenging ballot initiatives that restrict gerrymandering. If so, the court would be engaging in an aggressive move to reverse the democratic process.This is likely to be a long fight. I continue to think a federal law to restrict gerrymandering is the best long-term plan."
284,"President Trump, as his Twitter feed amply demonstrates, is more of a Fox News guy than an HBO guy. It’s too bad. Mornings might be less stressful if the president spent them opining on “My Brilliant Friend” rather than on “Fox & Friends.”But he has lately developed an affinity for one of HBO’s shows. Or at least its advertising.In November, announcing sanctions on Iran, the president tweeted out a picture of himself on a mock “Game of Thrones” promo, with the caption “Sanctions Are Coming,” a variation on the show’s tagline “Winter Is Coming.” He apparently liked the image so much that he bought the poster. A copy lay in front of him at his Cabinet meeting Wednesday.Thursday, on his Instagram account, he rolled out the sequel: “The Wall Is Coming,” with the president giving an Ice King stare over a rendering of a spiky barrier.It was, superficially, an apt use of imagery. HBO’s epic does feature a massive border wall, stretching across the border wastes of the fantasy realm of Westeros. The slight problem — spoiler alert for anyone who isn’t caught up, including, apparently, the entire White House staff — is that at the end of the most recent season that wall spectacularly collapsed, done in by the (blue) fire and fury of a zombie dragon.But there’s a bigger dissonance than that. Mr. Trump is a fan of tough-guy imagery, and he, or whoever makes his memes, probably just liked the idea of depicting himself as the patriarch of House Trump — First of His Name, Protector of the Realm — going medieval on national security.However, he might not like what “Game of Thrones” actually has to say about leadership in general, and walls in particular.Certainly Mr. Trump could find role models on the show. It involves the rise to dominance of a cunning, wealthy family that doles out power positions to relatives and has a penchant for gold. (Although there is some question as to whether Mr. Trump, like the Lannisters, pays his debts.)And yes, looming over the whole thing, there is — or was — a great, big, beautiful wall. But it was never intended to keep out people.In the story, based on a book series by George R.R. Martin, the ice wall was built thousands of years ago, with magical assistance, to keep out the White Walkers (the “Others” in the novels), a race of frigid beings dedicated to snuffing out all life. (I’ll let you Google the details.)[Plan ahead for the season to come with our culture calendar.]But as the Walkers lay dormant for centuries, people in Westeros started to forget. This nightmare enemy of all mankind, they decided, was a fairy tale. Instead, they came to believe, the wall was there to protect the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros from the “wildlings” — their term for the poor suckers who happened to live on the desolate northern side of the wall when it went up.Over generations, the Night’s Watch — the force created to patrol the Wall — changed its self-image too, thinking of itself as a kind of border patrol, an icebound I.C.E., there to defend Westeros from what it saw as savages who wanted to pour over the border and steal the riches of honest, hardworking Westerosi.If you’ve watched “Game of Thrones,” you know where it goes from there. The Walkers rise again, and the Night’s Watch leader Jon Snow (Kit Harington) wants to make common cause with the wildlings. “They were born on the wrong side of the wall,” he says. “That doesn’t make them monsters.”His comrades, declaring this fake news, stab him to death. (Only temporarily!) But by the most recent season, with the zombie army encroaching, a resurrected Jon has convinced the squabbling armies of Westeros to pause their war for the Iron Throne — sort of — to fight the undead.In “Game of Thrones,” in other words, nationalism and tribalism are not essential forces for preserving society but an existential threat to survival. The Wall is a mighty symbol of protection but ultimately an ineffective one; the only salvation, if there is one, is people deciding they have more to gain by working together. And the worst leaders (if sometimes the most successful) are those like Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey), who see disaster as an opportunity to decimate and divide rivals.The president is a creation of TV and a voracious consumer of it, but his tastes are limited and specific. He likes cable news in general, and news about himself best of all. He became a star in reality TV, which relies on condensing human experience into catchphrases and simple, broad symbols, and he applied its lessons on the campaign trail by rendering the idea of security as a great big wall.He has never, however, seemed to be much of a follower of scripted TV dramas, which at their best draw out life’s complexities.So to him — or the social-media staff in charge of realizing his worldview — “Winter Is Coming,” the motto of House Stark, is a macho threat. (Better look out, sucker! I’m bringing some winter down on you!)As any fan of the series knows, it’s not; it’s a warning, a caution, a reminder that if we fall into pettiness and division, the storm will come for us all, all the same."
285,"WASHINGTON — President Trump raised the possibility on Friday of declaring a national emergency to allow him to build a wall along the southwest border without congressional approval, hours after Department of Homeland Security officials requested additional support to erect temporary barriers between the United States and Mexico.Mr. Trump’s comments followed a contentious meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House. It failed to produce a deal to end the two-week partial shutdown of the federal government, a funding lapse that began with the president’s insistence that Congress allocate $5.6 billion for the wall.“We can call a national emergency and build it very quickly,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden when asked about an emergency declaration.Asked if his claim was intended to scare Democrats into making a deal, he replied, “I never make threats.”[President Trump took the public stage this week clearly intent on framing the conflict on his own terms.]Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, presidents are allowed to take unilateral action in times of crisis, provided they notify Congress, specify the circumstances that necessitated the declaration and document all uses of executive authority that are covered by the emergency.Officials at the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense Departments have researched the issue for Mr. Trump. However, no emergency order has been drafted or approved, one official with knowledge of those plans said.The Homeland Security Department submitted an official request for assistance from the Pentagon on Friday, a Defense Department official said. But the military has yet to determine what resources are needed and if any additional troops are required for the mission, the official said.The moves come as the president finds himself trapped between a central campaign promise to build a wall and rising anxiety among Republicans over political damage inflicted by a shutdown that Mr. Trump has defiantly owned.Speaker Nancy Pelosi has ruled out paying for a border wall, even at a much lower funding level, despite suggestions by Mr. Trump that the government shutdown could last “months or even years.”Administration officials have been scrambling to tackle the legal and logistical problems involved with steering previously allocated funding toward any project that can be described as a wall, a fence or a barrier.The definition of a wall has grown ever more elastic.The White House and homeland security officials have been pushing the Pentagon to continue to use military troops at the border — mainly to install, extend and repair a section of concertina wire used to stop immigrants from entering unmanned sections of the southwest border.Mr. Trump tweeted last month that “the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall” — a reference to several hundred miles of fencing along the border.The temporary troop deployments are just one of many recommendations that the homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, and her staff have made to the Pentagon.One possible solution, in the absence of new congressional allocations, is figuring out a way to steer contracts already planned for Army Corps of Engineers projects toward some kind of barriers. But lawyers at the Homeland Security and Justice Departments have yet to determine if doing so could withstand court challenges, two senior administration officials said.Mr. Trump spent the holidays at the White House to demonstrate his determination to secure new border funding. Yet he has struggled to dramatize his cause, as stories of federal employees and other Americans suffering from the effects of the shutdown pile up.On Thursday, homeland security officials abruptly canceled a scheduled press briefing by Kevin K. McAleenan, the commissioner of United States Customs and Border Protection, when Mr. Trump decided that he wanted to appear in front of the cameras himself. He did so, in the White House briefing room, with Border Patrol and other immigration enforcement employees who had been meeting with him in the Oval Office.“It was completely off the cuff,” Art Del Cueto, a Border Patrol agent in the room with Mr. Trump, said shortly after leaving the White House. “I don’t know who in the room — it may have been him — that was like, ‘We should go out there and do a presser.’ So we did.”Mr. Del Cueto and other members of the Border Patrol’s labor union have met with Mr. Trump several times in his presidency — so frequently, they said, that they could not remember the number of times they had been to the Oval Office.Separately, on Friday, Mr. Trump in a tweet denied as “FAKE NEWS” a New York Times article reporting that he was considering nominating former Senator Jim Webb, Democrat of Virginia, as his next defense secretary. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned last month to protest Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from Syria."
286,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon is poised to send at least 2,000 more active-duty troops to the southwestern border, Defense Department officials said Tuesday, deployments that have already cost the military hundreds of millions of dollars and thrust the department into the center of the debate over border security and President Trump’s proposed wall.The acting defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, told reporters that the United States would be sending “several thousand” additional troops to provide more support for the Department of Homeland Security’s border patrol efforts. Defense Department officials later said that they expect that number to be around 2,000.That would come on top of the 2,400 troops who are there now, bringing the deployed number at the border close to the high of 5,900 that it reached in the weeks surrounding the midterm elections in November.The deployment of several thousand military troops to secure the southwestern border will total more than $600 million by the end of the fiscal year in September, Pentagon officials also told the House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday.The deployment of active-duty troops through the end of January is estimated to cost $132 million, said Vice Adm. Michael Gilday, the director of operations for the joint staff. The cost of the National Guard’s operations at the border through the fiscal year, he estimated, will cost $550 million.Since Mr. Trump declared what he called a national security crisis at the border that warranted the deployment of active-duty troops, the Defense Department has sought to limit their role. But the administration has kept them in the mix. The additional troops will be used to install concertina wire and provide more surveillance of the border area, Mr. Shanahan said.Mr. Shanahan replaced Jim Mattis, who resigned in December as defense secretary, in a rebuke of much of Mr. Trump’s national security policy.At one point last year, Mr. Trump described a “wall of people” to stop caravans of Central American refugees and called for up to 15,000 troops to defend the border. The Pentagon reluctantly sent 5,900, then cut that number quickly back to 2,400. The president also spoke of telling the military to respond to migrants throwing rocks as if they were rifles.But the deployments can go only so far. The Posse Comitatus Act, dating to Reconstruction, bars American forces from engaging in law enforcement activities within the borders of the United States.Democrats say the deployments — especially the ones just before the midterms — were flagrantly political.“I am extremely concerned that we preserve the reality and perception that the U.S. military is apolitical,” said Representative Elissa Slotkin, Democrat of Michigan. “It is hard to feel it wasn’t political given how close it was to the midterms.”Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, upon being told that Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, declined his invitation to testify on the issue of border security, cried foul.“Your attempt to use the President’s recent shutdown as an excuse not to testify before Congress prior to the impending shutdown is outrageous,” Mr. Thompson wrote to Ms. Nielsen in a letter on Tuesday.Appearing before the House committee for the first time since Democrats took control this month, Admiral Gilday and John Rood, the under secretary of defense for policy, defended the deployments and said the military’s presence have yielded “very successful” results.“We believe that our military’s presence and support has served to increase the effectiveness” of operations at the border, Admiral Gilday said, adding that the Defense Department has a “long history” of supporting efforts to secure American borders.“We’re not trying just to have a photo op down there,” he continued.As negotiators from the House and the Senate begin meeting this week to hash out a plan to secure the southwestern border and fund the government, Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee seized on the Pentagon’s cost estimates to press for more border security funding.“We’re here at this moment in time because we failed to provide adequate resources” to the Department of Homeland Security, said Representative Paul Mitchell, Republican of Michigan.Democrats on the committee remained skeptical.It is “unclear why this is an appropriate use of the military’s time and resources,” said Representative Adam Smith of Washington, the chairman of the committee. “It appears service members are laying concertina wire and performing other tasks that are better suited for civilian law enforcement agencies.”Admiral Gilday said active-duty troops were deployed before the midterms because thousands of migrants were “massing” along the border. The Trump administration chose to send troops because they could be deployed more quickly than the National Guard, he said. The Department of Homeland Security is currently tracking three migrant caravans containing 12,000 people moving toward the border, Mr. Rood said.Democrats pressed Defense Department officials to identify which projects would be affected if Mr. Trump declares a national emergency and moves funds to build a border wall. Mr. Rood declined to answer, and added that the department had “only done the preliminary preplanning” for such an event.“We are supporting our federal partners on the border, and that mission has been extended until September,” said Lt. Col. Jamie Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. “We are currently sourcing the units involved and there will be an increase of a few thousand troops.”"
287,"On Tuesday the designer and filmmaker Tom Ford was the second-highest trending topic on Twitter for a reason that had nothing to do with the actual news he was making.He was trending because of a quote that had been attributed to him stating Melania Trump was a “glorified escort” and that he was refusing to dress her. His office, however, was quick to point out that he had never said any such thing. Rather, in a 2016 interview on “The View,” he said that (at one pre-campaign time) he had been approached to dress Mrs. Trump, but he declined because she wasn’t “really his image” and besides, he believed the first lady should wear American and wear affordable — and his clothes were neither of those things.This matters not so much because it is yet another example of the nefarious ways false information spreads over the internet (though it is that) but because on Tuesday Mr. Ford also became chairman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, the industry lobbying group, watchdog and, occasionally, scapegoat. That makes him the effective face of the industry. And that means that what he says, or what he is said to have said, and what he stands for, will become even more fraught, because he no longer simply speaks for himself, but for American fashion. He succeeds Diane von Furstenberg, who held the post for 13 years, making her the second longest-serving leader in the group’s history (her predecessor, Stan Herman, lasted 16 years). “People keep saying to me, ‘Why did you agree to do this?’” Mr. Ford said on a call from Los Angeles, where he is based. “The answer is: Out of a sense of duty, I guess. At a certain point in your life you’ve learned enough and done enough, you should share what you know. I think that sense of giving back is very American. It’s certainly much less a European thing. I think I can do a good job and I think I have a vision for it, so why not add it to my list of things to do?”It’s an interesting time to add the CFDA to a to-do list that includes women’s wear, men’s wear, beauty, accessories and filmmaking. The lack of racial diversity at many fashion brands is still very much an issue; Calvin Klein, once a tent pole of American style, just announced it was closing its designer-led Collection line; there’s a general sense of an identity crisis at New York Fashion Week as young designers jump ship for other cities or decide to sit seasons out; and everyone is worried about the future of department stores, once the style conduits to the country. Not to mention the fact that fashion still has a somewhat fractious relationship with the current presidential administration.“Diane approached me and then Anna approached me and then Steven approached me and then Diane approached me and then Anna approached me and then Steven approached me,” said Mr. Ford, referring to Ms. von Furstenberg; Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue and artistic director of Condé Nast; and Steven Kolb, chief executive of the CFDA.“I was courted for awhile,” Mr. Ford said. The hard sell reflects both the seriousness of the job and the complications of taking it on at this time. They put a heavier onus on what could be a ceremonial position, and mean it will be incumbent on Mr. Ford to articulate some sort of way forward for the industry and the CFDA’s 495 members.As to what, exactly, that way forward might be, however, he declined to go into detail until his term officially starts in June, after the organization’s annual fashion awards (nominations were just released, and the fact that Sander Lak of Sies Marjan is in the running for women’s wear designer of the year, when last year he won emerging designer, reflects the general confusion). What Mr. Ford would say was that he felt his international background — his years as creative director of Gucci and, later, Yves Saint Laurent from 1990 to 2004, his time based in London with his own brand from 2010 to 2016 — would inform his message.“I think the key to the future of American fashion is to become more international and more global,” Mr. Ford said. “Having recently returned to America, one of the things that struck me the most in every industry and in American life was how isolated America was and how inward looking. I’ve always thought of myself as an international designer, designing to a global market, and I think that American fashion needs to think that way. Even if you’re just starting a business you have to be immediately thinking about what’s going to help you be marketable to the world, and not just to America.”And even more than that — not just to New York. Although the CFDA is based in Manhattan, Mr. Ford, who has been a member since 2000 and has won seven CFDA awards, including the lifetime achievement prize in 2014, has no plans to move, or to be in the city more than the “four or five times” a year he currently visits. He also has no plans to make himself an example of a designer who recommits to New York Fashion Week on a long-term basis.“I have a global business and sometimes I may need to show in another country,” he said (he has shown in London and Los Angeles). “Sometimes I may need to show in Asia; I may need to show in Europe. I was very honest and upfront about that. But I think the CFDA is an American thing and not so much a New York thing. “Arguably New York is the center of a certain America, and I realize part of the CFDA is organizing and — I don’t want to say policing — New York Fashion Week. But it is also encouraging American designers to be successful and part of that is embracing the fact we live in a big world,” he said.It’s an interesting statement, and one that verges on the political in a time when the fight over a border wall has been one of the defining discussions of the year. Under Ms. von Furstenberg, the CFDA lobbied for greater intellectual property protections for designers, embarked on a model health initiative, raised the volume on the conversation about diversity and inclusion, and brought new American designers to Paris for a fashion week showcase. Now it is up to Mr. Ford to choose his issues and decide how to direct his new cast.“I’m pretty steel-willed,” he said."
288,"Unlike Donald Trump, the former Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz is a genuinely successful businessman who built a company that’s become part of the daily lives of people across America. For this, those of us who are horrified by Trump’s relentless grifting should be grateful. It gives us something concrete to boycott should Schultz decide to launch a narcissistic spoiler campaign for president.In an interview with Scott Pelley on “60 Minutes” on Sunday, Schultz decried “extremes on both sides” and said he’s considering a run for president as a “centrist independent.” He hasn’t yet made up his mind, and perhaps the overwhelmingly negative reaction from almost all segments of the Democratic Party, as well as some NeverTrump Republicans, will dissuade him. There’s a danger, though, that the reality-distorting effects of being a billionaire will warp his judgment, convincing him that his business acumen is transferable to the realm of politics. If so, he could end up helping Donald Trump get re-elected.Shultz appears to share the  conviction, endemic among American elites, that the country hungers for a candidate who is socially liberal but fiscally conservative. After all, if you’re rich, you probably know a lot of people like this. “I’m a socially liberal, fiscally conservative centrist who would love to vote for a rational Democrat and get Trump out of the White House,” a chief executive of a major bank, who wanted to remain anonymous, recently told Politico, lamenting Michael Bloomberg’s poor odds in a Democratic primary.[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]But this frustrated executive’s politics aren’t widely shared by people who haven’t been to Davos. In a 2017 study, the political scientist Lee Drutman plotted the 2016 electorate along two axes, one dealing with social issues and identity, the other with economics and trade. Only 3.8 percent of voters fell into the socially liberal/economically conservative quadrant.Indeed, Trump’s campaign demonstrated that the truly underserved market in American politics was voters who are socially conservative but economically liberal — the photonegative of what Schultz is offering. Such voters — the type who might resent both immigrants and Wall Street — make up 28.9 percent of the electorate, according to Drutman’s study.Schultz makes much of the fact that around 40 percent of Americans identify as “independent.” But as anyone who has spent 15 minutes googling should know, independent is not the same thing as centrist. Most independents lean toward one party, and as the Pew Research Center has demonstrated, in the past two decades independents have grown more ideologically polarized, not more moderate. America has two independent senators. One of them is Bernie Sanders.Even if there were a latent constituency of modern Rockefeller Republicans longing for the leadership of an enlightened plutocrat, third-party presidential campaigns are terrible vehicles for building political power. America’s two-party system, unfortunate as it is, is an inevitable result of the winner-take-all nature of our elections. It cannot simply be wished away.There are policies that could potentially break the two-party stranglehold on our politics. Ranked-choice voting, which Maine used for the 2018 congressional elections, lets voters select candidates in order of preference. One by one, the candidates with the fewest votes are eliminated. Their supporters’ votes are apportioned to those voters’ next-highest choice, until someone emerges with a majority. If Schultz were serious about challenging party monopolies he might invest some of his fortune in efforts to pass similar reforms elsewhere.Absent such changes, his candidacy would threaten to siphon away enough votes to give Trump a second term. In 2015 and 2016, Bloomberg, a billionaire businessman whose politics are much like Schultz’s, considered mounting an independent campaign for president. His team looked closely at poll data and focus groups, and found he’d be potentially competitive only in blue states. “All of the results were very consistent,” Howard Wolfson, Bloomberg’s political adviser, told me. “An independent with Mike’s profile would have merely resulted in Trump’s election.”Obviously, Trump won anyway, but Bloomberg’s research underscores the folly of Schultz’s trial balloon. On Monday, Bloomberg, who is contemplating a 2020 run as a Democrat, put out a statement that seemed aimed at Schultz, though it didn’t mention him by name. “In 2020, the great likelihood is that an independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the president,” wrote Bloomberg. “That’s a risk I refused to run in 2016 and we can’t afford to run it now.”By flirting with such a risk, Schultz is demonstrating a level of megalomaniacal recklessness that is itself disqualifying. “I think all American citizens should be worried about the possibility of Donald Trump being re-elected with 40 percent of the vote,” said Wolfson.Then again, on “60 Minutes,” Schultz likened Democratic proposals for universal health care to Trump’s border wall. Perhaps from his vantage point, re-electing this president doesn’t seem uniquely catastrophic when set against the danger of European-style social democracy. He recently set out on a nationwide tour, so hopefully he’ll hear from Americans who disagree. Meanwhile, among the challenges we’re called upon to meet in this moment of profound democratic crisis, finding another place to get a latte is an easy one."
289,"President Trump seems to think that his hard-line immigration stance is a political winner, saying he’s willing to keep much of the government shut down in order to get funding for his border wall. Polls suggest voters don’t see this Mr. Trump’s way, and blame him, not the Democrats, for the impasse. With Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives on Thursday, he now has the excuse he needs to make a deal.But if he doesn’t compromise, if he instead continues to try to transform his once proudly pro-growth party into the anti-immigration party, he will threaten Republican prospects for a generation. November’s midterm elections provided a clear indication that Mr. Trump’s strident positions on immigration were not widely popular. Ignoring the pleas of top Republicans, the president made the elections a referendum on the issue, vowing to end birthright citizenship, sending the military to deal with a caravan of asylum seekers and championing fringe legislation to cut legal immigration in half. House Republicans paid dearly for Mr. Trump’s gambit. They lost 40 seats, mostly in suburban districts, many of which were longtime Republican bastions whose younger, moderate, college-educated and female voters turned out for Democrats. In increasingly Asian-American Orange County, Calif., which voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, the first time it had gone Democratic since Franklin Roosevelt was president, Republicans lost four House seats. They also lost suburban races in traditionally Republican areas outside of Dallas; Des Moines; Houston; Miami; Philadelphia; Richmond, Va.; and even Salt Lake City. Those results suggest Mr. Trump may be doing to the national Republican Party what Pete Wilson did to the party in California in the 1990s. Hard as it is to believe today, California once reliably voted Republican in presidential elections. Other than Lyndon Johnson, no Democratic presidential candidate won the Golden State in the four decades between Harry Truman and Bill Clinton. Now, Democrats control the entire state government and hold 46 of its 53 House seats and both Senate seats.What happened? Mr. Wilson, then governor, went after immigrants, championing Proposition 187, a 1994 ballot initiative that barred illegal immigrant children from attending public schools and using other social services. Though the measure passed after a contentious fight, it was a hollow victory. An injunction was granted three days after passage, and the measure was ultimately deemed unconstitutional. Several studies have found that Republican support of Proposition 187 and other anti-immigrant efforts alienated white and Latino voters in California from the Republican Party. One of these studies, published in The American Journal of Political Science, points out that Proposition 187 actually reversed the trend of Latinos increasingly supporting Republicans, with “no counterbalancing gain in party supporters from other groups, particularly non-Hispanic whites.” The authors conclude that the “results raise serious questions about the long-term efficacy of racially divisive strategies for electoral gain.” This study should be required reading for Trump Republicans. The Hispanic portion of the United States population today is similar to the portion in California in the early 1990s. About 20 percent of the country is Hispanic; in 1990, 26 percent of California’s population was. You don’t have to be a political wizard to understand that alienating growing blocs of voters — not just Latinos, but also other immigrants and younger people — is bad political strategy.If national Republicans want to avoid the fate of their 1990s California brethren, they must reject Mr. Trump’s approach and make a Republican case for immigration. Prominent Republicans who have criticized Mr. Trump’s divisiveness, such as Utah’s incoming senator, Mitt Romney, should pick up this mantle.My organization, the Becoming American Initiative, seeks to persuade conservatives that expanding immigration will benefit the country. Members of our board, including William Kristol, Linda Chavez and Mona Charen, have worked in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. They have seen firsthand how those presidents’ support for more open immigration systems was not just good for America, but also helped neutralize immigration as a political issue.Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush both called for more work visas, a policy that would allow foreigners to pursue the American dream while contributing to the economy. Similar  immigration proposals, which would help ensure that Mr. Reagan’s “shining city on a hill” isn’t surrounded by a wall, would appeal to the more than one-quarter of the population who are either first- or second-generation immigrants.Republicans should make common cause with immigrants on shared values like work ethic, family and faith rather than writing them off. Judging by Mr. Trump’s shutdown rhetoric, they’ve got their work cut out for them. "
290,"WASHINGTON — The fate of President Trump’s $5.7 billion demand for a border wall is now in the hands of a 17-member bipartisan panel that includes some of the most senior members of Congress and, perhaps more tellingly, lacks the most vocal immigration hard-liners on Capitol Hill.Under the agreement Mr. Trump reached last week with congressional Democrats, a committee of Republican and Democratic lawmakers from both chambers — known as a conference committee — has until Feb. 15 to come up with a border security package.During the 35-day shutdown, many Americans accused Mr. Trump and Congress of acting like toddlers, with Mr. Trump insisting that he had to have the wall, and Democratic leaders insisting that they would not give him a penny for it.Now, a group less dominated by ideology will be in charge.One conference committee member, Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, departed from Democratic orthodoxy on Monday when he told reporters that he would be in favor of including some money for a wall in the border security package. Late last year, Mr. Tester and other Democrats on the Appropriations Committee voted for a spending bill that included $1.6 billion for 65 miles of fencing along the border.“What I hope can happen is we end up with a set of broad-based measures to secure the border, including manpower, wall, technology,” Mr. Tester said. Noting that physical barriers already exist along roughly 600 miles of the border, he added, “I think to take that off the table entirely — this is my opinion, O.K.? — would be not the best direction to go.”The conference panel’s members, appointed by House and Senate leaders, are drawn exclusively from the appropriations committees in each chamber, which have a long history of working in a bipartisan way. (Senator John McCain was fond of saying, “There are Republicans, there are Democrats, and then there are appropriators.”) The first meeting will be Wednesday afternoon.With nine Democrats and eight Republicans, the panel traverses the philosophical spectrum: Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, is an ardent liberal critic of Mr. Trump’s immigration policies, as is Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois.Representative Tom Graves, Republican of Georgia, has co-sponsored legislation to provide $23.4 billion in wall construction money, while Representative Steven M. Palazzo, Republican of Mississippi, has backed a bill that would allow Americans to purchase bonds to help finance a wall. But neither is closely identified with that cause.And the panel includes members of both parties, beyond Mr. Tester, who have been calling for compromise.“This is much more than just a wall,” another Republican member, Representative Chuck Fleischmann of Tennessee, told Fox Business Network last week, in urging an end to the shutdown. “We’ve got to look at border security where there are areas where a wall won’t work; we’ve got to secure it that way. But yes, I think we can sit down and come up with something. The American people want a reasonable compromise that will work for all.”Mr. Durbin helped write the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (Dream) Act in 2001, which would offer a path to citizenship for young immigrants who were brought illegally to the country as children. Members of both parties have suggested some version of the Dream Act could be exchanged for some wall funding.Conference committees, once an elemental part of Congress, occur when the House and Senate have to reconcile two bills. But in the recent past, much of the reconciliation has been done by leadership. Genuine conference committees have become so rare that many lawmakers have never been on one that worked as intended.The border security panel conference includes several Democrats from border states, including Ms. Lee; Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard of California; Representative Henry Cuellar of Texas; and Representative Pete Aguilar of California.It will be led by the top Democrat and Republican appropriators in both chambers: Representatives Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York, and Kay Granger, Republican of Texas; and Senators Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, and Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont.Together, they have more than 100 years of legislative experience — Mr. Leahy alone has been in the Senate for 43 years — and are senior enough to remember the days of real conference committees, when lawmakers worked across party lines to hash out deals.“In my judgment, the next three weeks will be one of the most important work periods in recent history — in my job here,” said Ms. Lowey, who was elected to the House in 1988 and is the first woman to lead its Appropriations Committee. She will be the chairwoman of the conference panel; Mr. Shelby will be its vice chairman.“I’ve been an appropriator for a long time,” she added. “I’m always willing to work across the aisle and find compromise.”What that compromise might look like — and whether it will satisfy Mr. Trump — is unclear.At least one Trump ally on Capitol Hill — Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina — is suggesting that Mr. Trump go ahead and declare a national emergency to build the wall, without congressional support.The Republicans on the panel are Representatives Granger, Fleischmann, Graves and Palazzo; Senators Shelby, John Hoeven of North Dakota, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Roy Blunt of Missouri.The Democrats are Representatives Lowey, Roybal-Allard, Lee, Cuellar, Aguilar and David Price of North Carolina; Senators Durbin, Leahy and Tester. At Wednesday’s meeting, each member will be able to give an opening statement.“We’ve got to come together; the question is, ‘Will we?”’ said Mr. Shelby. Asked if he was optimistic, he said, “Optimistic? I’m cautious, guarded, anxious.”"
291,"Every day, the same scene plays out in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juárez. Mixed into the flow of students, commuters and travelers are asylum-seeking families, arriving at their final destination, the entrance to the United States port of entry.The families drop the required 4 pesos into the turnstile to begin their walk up the international bridge that arches over the Rio Grande and connects this part of Mexico to the United States. Yet when they reach the halfway point, demarcated by orange cones, Customs and Border Protection officers are waiting to turn them away from seeking safety in the United States — a right granted to them under American and international law.Instead, these asylum-seeking families are provided with the same explanation: “We are full.”Conversations surrounding President Trump’s focus on spending billions on a border wall have overshadowed border realities. For the past two years, as the number of asylum-seeking families and children has increased, the administration has ushered in a range of additional restrictive border policies. United States government officials have told migrants to go to ports of entry rather than crossing the border without authorization. However, simultaneously, they have imposed other policies that reject asylum seekers trying to do just that.In July, a family of five arrived (navigating their way through Mexico with the help of smugglers) at the Eagle Pass-Piedras Negras border crossing to apply for asylum. The parents and their children — ages 12, 6, and 3 — had fled El Salvador after receiving targeted threats of violence from Barrio 18, a major gang in Central America.The family approached border officers to assert their right to ask for asylum; they were also seeking help for a son who no longer had medicine for his chronic heart condition. In response, a border officer noted that he was not a doctor, physically pushed the family back across the international line into Mexico, and told them to return to Piedras Negras and the local migrant shelter there.In the shelter, the family put their names on an informal waiting list for their chance to seek asylum again. However, their smugglers learned they had not yet entered the United States and began demanding more money, promising to infiltrate the shelter and kill the family if they did not send additional payments. Several days later, while the family walked to a convenience store, a white van screeched to a halt and armed men forced the family into the vehicle.The family was taken to a house and spent two days in captivity, until Mexican state police arrived. However, these officers had not come to save the family but rather to sit down at the table for a leisurely breakfast and to accept money from the kidnappers. When the police did pay attention to the family, it was to call Mexican immigration agents to deport them. These agents proposed a deal, to release the family for $1,000. But with no more money, the family was transported to a Mexican migration detention center. After languishing for two months, the parents and children were released into Mexico City, where the threats continued both from their former kidnappers and Barrio 18 gang members searching for the family.This family’s harrowing story is far from an isolated case. In February 2017, a Honduran woman and her three children were kidnapped in the border city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas — the migrant kidnapping capital of Mexico — after trying to seek asylum with border officers on three occasions. And in November 2018, a transgender Mexican asylum seeker was robbed and assaulted in Tijuana. The next month, a Cameroonian asylum seeker was stabbed and two Honduran asylum-seeking teenagers were murdered.Routine turnbacks and the expansion of “metering” systems at ports of entry began in 2016. Yet last summer, border officers doubled down on the practice, stationing its agents mid-bridge from El Paso to Brownsville and at border gates from New Mexico to San Diego with instructions to reject people seeking asylum. Today, these turnbacks are occurring daily at major ports of entry along the southwest border.Asylum seekers who are denied entry to the United States must wait in Mexican migrant shelters or on the bridges themselves, vulnerable to a range of rights violations and safety concerns. This follows perilous journeys to escape violence at home to reach the United States and legally request protection.The situation could be improved if United States officials allocated sufficient personnel and resources to efficiently process asylum seekers immediately upon their arrival to the border. However, the Trump administration has not taken these steps and has instead expanded metering and turnback policies. Just last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced it will implement a pilot initiative in California to return arriving asylum seekers to Mexico to await their eventual hearings before an immigration judge. Such a policy deliberately places thousands of people in situations similar to the young family of five that was kidnapped and extortedAs violence and insecurity across Central America continues to go unaddressed, families will continue to join our border communities in search of protection for themselves and their children. Despite attempts to vilify and demonize them as political pawns, asylum seekers from around the world continue to see the promise of the United States. Seeking asylum is a right — one this country must uphold. It is not only the law, it is the moral imperative of this nation. "
292,"President Trump came away empty-handed for now after the longest federal government shutdown in American history failed to pressure Congress into funding his long-promised border wall, purportedly to stop an inflow of drugs and crime from Mexico.But he is not done making his case on immigration.On Sunday he rattled off several figures on Twitter about how many undocumented immigrants there are in the United States, how much they cost the country financially and how many had illegally voted in Texas.There were already many problems with Mr. Trump’s assertion that undocumented immigrants disproportionately bring with them more drugs and crime. And several experts said they had concerns with the figures he disseminated on Sunday.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.In one tweet on Sunday, Mr. Trump said that “58,000 non-citizens voted in Texas, with 95,000 non-citizens registered to vote.” He was citing an investigation that Texas officials had publicized days earlier but that Democrats in the state immediately questioned.The investigation, by the Texas secretary of state’s office, said that 95,000 people who were registered to vote in the state had at some point told a law enforcement agency that they were not citizens. Out of that number, 58,000 had voted at some point since 1996.Politicians and voters’ advocates are asking officials to investigate both figures.“Because we have consistently seen Texas politicians conjure the specter of voter fraud as pretext to suppress legitimate votes, we are naturally skeptical,” Representative Rafael Anchia, a Democrat in the state House, told The New York Times.Even if the numbers are deemed accurate, those 58,000 voters could have become citizens before casting ballots. More than 50,000 people were naturalized in Texas in 2017, according to the Department of Homeland Security.“We have a reason to distrust these numbers,” said Andre Segura, the legal director for the A.C.L.U. of Texas. “There’s a long history of these numbers being inaccurate. Voter fraud is extremely rare.”In Florida, the administration of the former governor, Rick Scott, had tried to purge noncitizens from voter rolls in 2012. It started with a list of 180,000 voters based on driver’s license data, according to The Tampa Bay Times. Ultimately, 85 people were removed from the rolls, according to the newspaper.In another tweet, Mr. Trump said that “the cost of illegal immigration so far this year is $18,959,495,168. Cost Friday was $603,331,392.”It is not clear where Mr. Trump arrived at those figures. They track with a tweet from last month in which he declared that the country loses “250 Billion Dollars a year on illegal immigration.”But several experts said those figures were far too high.There is little research on how much undocumented immigrants cost the United States. The highest costs would generally be related to education and health care, but many undocumented immigrants pay taxes and are typically barred from receiving many of the costliest benefits, like Medicaid.No study seems to comprehensively address a net cost, instead focusing on either the costs or the benefits.“They tend to talk past each other, unfortunately,” said Randy Capps, the director of research for American programs at the Migration Policy Institute.The National Academy of Sciences concluded in 2016 that immigration, both legal and illegal, benefited the economy. It said that the average immigrant cost state and local governments about $1,600 a year from 2011 to 2013, but that their children and grandchildren paid far more in taxes than they consumed in public services.Alex Nowrasteh, a senior immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, said the highest figure he had seen came from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which favors restricting immigration. It has said undocumented immigrants cost the country at least $116 billion per year.The Cato Institute disputes that figure, which Mr. Nowrasteh said did not take into account the economic benefits of undocumented immigrants. He and others have questioned the group’s methodology.“There’s no basis to any of those numbers about the fiscal cost,” he said. “The president’s numbers are even twice as bad.”Mr. Trump also claimed that in the United States there are “at least 25,772,342 illegal aliens, not the 11,000,000 that have been reported for years.”Again, several experts said Mr. Trump’s numbers were too high.It appears that Mr. Trump is making his claim based on a study conducted by researchers affiliated with Yale University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which estimated the number at 22 million.Starting with an estimate in 1990, the researchers modeled how the population would change in future years based on immigration rates, demographic change and deportations, among other factors, eventually arriving at the 22 million estimate.The conclusions of that study, published in the journal PLOS One in September, have been challenged, with some questioning whether it underestimated the number of immigrants who had left the country.The researchers have also acknowledged that their results diverge from existing estimates. Most other studies say the number is around 11 million or 12 million. The Pew Research Center estimated that it was about 10.7 million in 2016. In 2015, the Department of Homeland Security estimated the number to be 12 million.“There’s been no evidence of a new, rapid increase of the population,” Mr. Capps said.William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, said the methodology used by Pew had been vetted over decades.“They have a general sense that what they are doing is reasonably O.K.,” he said of the Pew researchers. “I trust them. They have been doing this for a long time.”"
293,"Tax preparers, bracing for a tricky filing season, are advising taxpayers to file returns as they usually do, but to be prepared for possible delays if they are due refunds.The Internal Revenue Service is scheduled to begin processing 2018 federal tax returns on Monday, but is facing two major challenges that threaten to make this tax time chaotic. Even with the government reopening, it will take a while for the I.R.S. to return to normal. The shutdown started as I.R.S. employees were in the midst of being trained about the sweeping changes that Congress made to the tax code in 2017, the head of the union representing the agency’s workers said. So I.R.S. employees may not initially be fully up to speed and able to answer questions and tackle the inevitable snafus.Nearly three-fourths of all returns result in refunds, and the average refund last year was nearly $3,000, the I.R.S. reports. Many families rely on their refunds to make purchases or pay bills.The I.R.S. has said it expects refunds to be issued on schedule. Typically, that means nine of 10 refunds are issued within 21 days, if the return was filed electronically and the refund is sent using direct deposit.“The I.R.S. expects business as usual with refunds,” said Lisa Greene-Lewis, a certified public accountant with the popular tax preparation software TurboTax.Cindy Hockenberry, director of tax research and government relations at the National Association of Tax Professionals, said it remained to be seen how quickly the I.R.S. could get operations running, since the end of the impasse came just days before the opening of tax filing season.“I still think it will take a bit of time to get everything rolling 100 percent at the I.R.S.,” she said, adding that “if there is another shutdown in three weeks, we’ll be back to square one.”Much of the federal government has been shut down for more than a month as a result of the political stalemate between President Trump and Democrats in Congress over funding for a border wall.Tony Reardon, national president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said on Thursday that the I.R.S. staff and agency funding had already been diminished before the shutdown and that it would probably take time for the agency to get back up to speed when it does reopened.While the government is reopening for at least three weeks, it’s unclear whether all I.R.S. employees will return to work immediately, Mr. Reardon said on Friday evening. “The agency is hopeful of getting normal operations going on Monday,” he said, since tax filing season is officially starting. But workers, he said, were awaiting specific instructions from their supervisors. The union is urging the government to be flexible and pay workers as quickly as possible, he said, since many are facing financial hardship from missing two paychecks during the shutdown.As to the I.R.S. help line, taxpayers and tax preparers will probably have longer waiting times this year.“Even in a good season, there’s a backup,” said Edward Karl, vice president for taxation with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.Despite the uncertain environment, Mr. Karl said, taxpayers who typically file early should do so, as soon as they have the necessary documents, like W-2 income statements.“The critical thing for taxpayers is to presume it’s business as usual,” he said.Meanwhile, the I.R.S. has announced a bit of relief for some taxpayers: If you underpaid your taxes in 2018, you’re less likely to pay a penalty this year. The agency said this month that because of tax changes passed by Congress in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, it would waive the penalty for many filers who underpaid.The change — just for the 2018 tax year — is aimed at helping taxpayers who were “unable to properly adjust” their withholding and estimated tax payments because of the “array of changes” under the tax law, and may have inadvertently underpaid, the I.R.S. said.The federal tax system is “pay as you go,” so taxes must be paid periodically, rather than all at once. Typically, taxpayers pay a penalty if their payments, from paycheck withholding or extra estimated tax payments, total less than 90 percent of the amount owed. (Other criteria also apply. For instance, if you underpaid but owe less than $1,000, you’re not subject to any penalty.) For 2018 returns, the I.R.S. said, the threshold will be lowered to 85 percent.Here are some questions and answers about this year’s tax filing season:When is the deadline?For most taxpayers, the federal filing deadline is April 15. But because of the timing of local holidays on April 15 in Maine and Massachusetts — and another on April 16 in Washington, D.C. — taxpayers who live in Maine or Massachusetts have until April 17 to file.Do I have to wait until Monday to file my taxes?No. Consumers using professional preparers, or do-it-yourself tax software, can prepare their returns ahead of time, and have them filed electronically when the I.R.S. starts accepting them on Monday. The I.R.S. encourages electronic filing “for faster refunds.”I completed my return using TurboTax but got a notice to redo it. What should I do?Some TurboTax users were notified ahead of the filing season that they should redo their returns because of a software glitch. The potential problem occurred when TurboTax, which millions of people use to file their returns, transferred the prior year’s data into the current year’s return. “In some cases,” the notice to users said, “a few pieces of information may be inaccurate or left out.”TurboTax advised users to clear their current return and start over. Intuit, the program’s parent, offered free tax filing for those affected.TurboTax said the glitch had affected a “small” number of filers but declined to be specific."
294,"This is Jamelle Bouie’s debut column.The wall of Donald Trump’s campaign and presidency has always operated both as a discrete proposal — an actual structure to be built under his leadership — and as a symbol with a clear meaning. Whether praised by its supporters or condemned by its opponents, the wall is a stand-in for the larger promise of broad racial (and religious) exclusion and domination. It’s no surprise, then, that some Americans use “Build the wall” as a racist chant, much like the way they invoke the president’s name. And it’s also why, despite the pain and distress of the extended government shutdown, Democrats are right to resist any deal with the White House that includes funding for its construction.That’s not to say there aren’t practical reasons for Democrats to resist the proposals on hand. The president calls his most recent bid a major compromise, but its headline provision — protections for immigrants covered by either Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or Temporary Protected Status — are short-term and limited. It also puts a cap on the number of Central American migrant children and teenagers who can receive asylum, requiring them to apply in their home countries, while also eliminating automatic court hearings for minors who arrive at the border in order to streamline the deportation process. Together with its $5.7 billion for “the wall,” it’s less a compromise than a near capitulation to the president’s vision for immigration policy — a vision he could not get through Congress when he had Republican majorities in both chambers. A border wall also just won’t work — erecting a barrier does nothing to solve the political conflicts and economic pressures that drive migration to the United States.Agreeing to this deal — or any deal beyond a straightforward bill to end the shutdown — would only validate the president’s extortion tactics, adopted after conservatives pressured him at the end of last year to reject a so-called clean bipartisan bill to fund the government. To agree to wall funding in these circumstances would guarantee a repeat performance the next time President Trump wants to secure a legislative “win” without the difficult work of negotiating with Congress, much less his opposition.But the paramount reason for resisting this deal, and any other, is what it would mean symbolically to erect the wall or any portion of it. Like Trump himself, it would represent a repudiation of the pluralism and inclusivity that characterizes America at its best. It would stand as a lasting reminder of the white racial hostility surging through this moment in American history, a monument to this particular drive to preserve the United States as a white man’s country.In fact, you can almost think of the wall as a modern-day Confederate monument, akin to those erected during a similar but far more virulent period of racist aggression in the first decades of the 20th century. Built as shrines to white racial dominance as much as memorials for any particular soldier, they were part of a larger, national drive to uphold white supremacy against what one nativist thinker termed a “rising tide of color.”This manifested itself across American society. At the grass roots, there was the reconstituted Ku Klux Klan, inspired by D.W. Griffith’s heroic 1915 depiction of Reconstruction-era “night riders” in “The Birth of a Nation.” The Klan strove to secure the power of the white petite bourgeoisie against perceived threats from capital and labor as well as uphold a stridently anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic, anti-Semitic and anti-black vision of white patriarchal authority. At the elite level, likewise, lawmakers and intellectuals fretted about the impact of an influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, as well as China and Japan. Their answer was something of a legislative wall — the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act, which sharply limited European immigration and all but banned it from much of Asia. (A former influential member of the Trump administration praised that law for its severe restrictions on who could enter the United States.)The wall of Trump’s rhetoric and imagination channels all of this, up to and including the nativist tropes that associate nonwhite immigrants with crime and disorder. “BUILD A WALL & CRIME WILL FALL!” the president said in a Wednesday morning tweet.It is true that Democrats have backed both barriers and harsh border policies in the past. President Barack Obama repeatedly offered strict immigration enforcement in return for Republican buy-in to comprehensive reforms. Now Democratic leaders have committed to new funding for additional border security. And the House majority whip, Jim Clyburn, has floated the possibility that Democrats could be moved on funding for the wall, provided it’s a “smart” wall. If, beyond Trump, the larger concern is policies that militarize the border and dehumanize migrants, then Democrats have had a significant part in creating the status quo.But the president’s wall still looms as a racist provocation, a total repudiation of what the historian John Higham called “America’s cosmopolitan faith — a concept of nationality that stresses the diversity of the nation’s origins, the egalitarian dimension of its self-image, and the universality of its founding principles.” For Trump the wall signals his commitment to upholding existing hierarchies and strengthening their material foundations; for his supporters it validates their fears of cultural conquest. For the targets of their anxiety and aggression, it is a threat.Early into the government shutdown, Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the wall “immoral.” She used the right word. The wall is a symbol of exclusion. If even a portion were built, that segment would serve as a modern monument to the worst of our nation’s heritage. No deal or compromise could justify that moral cost."
295,"Walls protect. Walls divide. Both these statements are true. Yet perhaps no issue represents the deep political chasm separating this country as a wall — a “big, beautiful wall” in the words of President Trump.In this lesson plan, students move past the political rhetoric to analyze the function and symbolism of a border wall. They learn about what’s in place already along the United States-Mexico border, they find out what life in the borderlands is like, they learn more about border security and they consider walls as symbols. Then, if you would like to go further, we invite your students to compare President Trump’s proposed wall to other historic walls, from China to Berlin, and we offer a related Student Opinion question about the shutdown and the wall that students can answer._________Ask students to respond to the following prompt:Both of the following statements are true.Walls protect.Walls divide.Which statement do you think is more true? Explain why.Then have students share their answers as a class.If you are feeling a little more adventurous, you can have students stand up and respond to this same prompt using a barometer activity. Tape two signs, “Walls Protect” and “Walls Divide,” on opposite ends of the classroom. Ask students to stand along a continuum between the two signs based on how strongly they feel about their answer to the prompt. Give them a minute to find their spot along the continuum, then have students share what they think and why._________For the main part of this lesson, we propose a stations activity. Depending on your goals, however, you may simply choose to do one of these stations, such as the first one about what is currently in place at the United States-Mexico border, as a whole class activity. Each station has one main resource, or set of resources, accompanied by questions for writing and discussion, as well as suggestions for further research if there is time. The activity concludes with a writing activity in which students reflect on what they learned and what they think.Station 1: The Current U.S.-Mexico BorderInstructions: Close your eyes. Imagine what you think the 1,954-mile United States-Mexico border looks like.Then scroll through this NYTimes.com interactive to learn about what security measures are already in place at the border.Then, answer these questions:1. Describe the current United States-Mexico border as if you were telling a friend who had no idea what the border was like.2. Describe the current United States approach to controlling who and what passes across the border with Mexico.3. Imagine what you think the 5,525-mile United States-Canada border looks like. Then look at some photographs documenting that border. How is the United States’ northern border different from its southern border? Why do you think it is so different?4. Do you think the current approach to United States border security is effective? What ideas do you have to make it more effective? 5. Do you think all, some or no national borders around the world should have walls or fences separating countries? Why?Here are additional resources showing what the United States-Mexico border looks like:“Before the Wall: Life Along the U.S.-Mexico Border”Station 2: Life Along the BorderAccording to this 2014 data from the Mexican government, the total population that lives in cities and counties along both sides of the United States-Mexico border is 14 million people and an estimated one million people legally cross the border every day.What is life like along the border? Watch this video about two towns separated by the United States-Mexico border, Douglas, Ariz., and Agua Prieta, Sonora. Then answer these questions:1. How has life in these two towns changed since a border fence was erected in the past decade?2. How do these towns collaborate and maintain ties even though a border fence separates them?3.

It begins:Then answer these questions:1. How many undocumented immigrants are living in the United States?2. How do advocates see this group of people?3. How does the White House view this same group?4. From where do they come? List the top six countries of origin.If you have more time, choose one or more of the other five sections in the same article to read: “Strong American Ties,” “Criminal Records,” “Overstayed Their Visas,” “Repeat Crossers” and “Asylum Seekers.” For each section you read, write two things you learn or that surprise you.Here are additional resources related to people and things crossing the border illegally: “By Land, Sea or Catapult: How Smugglers Get Drugs Across the Border” “The Number of Undocumented Immigrants in the U.S. Has Dropped, a Study Says.

They can also have real psychological power.Costica Bradatan, a professor in the Honors College at Texas Tech University, wrote about the power of walls back in 2011, in advance of the 2012 presidential election. Read the following excerpts from his essay, and decide if they feel relevant today:He continues:Then answer these questions:1. Costica Bradatan asserts that a good deal of the power of walls and fences come from their psychological power. What does he mean? To what extent do you agree?2. He argues that walls are not built for security, but instead for a sense of security. Why does he make this distinction? Do you agree?3. Do you think walls have a different psychological effect from fences? Or are they really just the same thing with a different name?Station 5: A Political SymbolHours before a partial government shutdown kicked in at midnight on Dec. 22, President Trump released a video reiterating his demand for additional funding for a “wall or a slat fence or whatever you want to call it.” He said, “We need a great barrier.” In the video, he claimed: “It’s very dangerous out there. Drugs are pouring in, human trafficking, so many different problems, including gangs like M.S. 13. We don’t want them in the United States.” The White House previously declared there is a “crisis at the border.”The Times Editorial Board counters Mr. Trump’s claim that border security is a crisis in this editorial, writing:Writing in National Review, a conservative magazine and website, Jonah Goldberg agrees that the wall is in fact a big symbol: “Trump’s wall is now an entirely symbolic affair.” He continues: “The symbolism is more important than the reality. Indeed, the president has offered to compromise, saying that we don’t have to call it a wall and it doesn’t even have to really look like one. But that doesn’t matter either, because for Democrats, any structure that the president could claim victory over would be a defeat.”Answer these questions:1. Do you agree that the border wall has become a political symbol for both the president’s supporters and opponents? Why?2. As of Jan. 3, parts of the United States government were closed because the president and Congress could not agree on the president’s demand for $5 billion in funding to begin construction of a border wall. Do you think the two branches of government will be able to get past this impasse? Should either side compromise? And if yes, what should a compromise look like? 3. In its editorial, the Times Editorial Board suggests the need for sensible border security investments and immigration reform. In his essay, Mr. Goldberg writes that the symbolism of the wall fight has made immigration policy itself “something of an afterthought.” First, do you agree with either or both of these positions? Second, do you think the president and Congress will be able to move past the shutdown standoff to address larger issues related to immigration? Why or why not?4. Walls also can have great symbolic power. The Department of Homeland Security unveiled eight wall prototypes in October 2017, which President Trump visited six months later. None of these prototypes have been selected, and no wall has been built. But these eight prototypes have symbolic power.Choose one of these eight prototypes and explain what you think it symbolizes from two points of view: first, for the president and his supporters, and second, for the president’s political opponents.Now, look at some proposals that weren’t selected, including a 2,000-mile pink wall, a shopping mall and a detention center. Again, choose one proposal and explain the symbolic value for both the president’s supporters and opponents.Here are additional resources related to the wall as a political symbol:National Review | “Shutdown Symbolism” National Review | “The Irrational Allergy to the Wall” “End of Government Shutdown May Depend on the Definition of ‘Wall’”Conclusion and ReflectionAfter students have completed the four stations, have them discuss what they learned and what surprised them.

296,"[Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.]Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman who just joined the Democratic presidential race, gained an instant following last year when he came within three points of unseating Senator Ted Cruz.But while he was able to stand out in his Senate campaign with a broadly liberal message and no signature policy issue, that broad message is not likely to be enough in a ballooning Democratic field.This time, the specifics are going to be crucial. Here’s a look at where Mr. O’Rourke stands on some major issues.As President Trump’s proposed border wall has become one of the biggest issues in American politics, Mr. O’Rourke has made immigration the centerpiece of his speeches.In addition to supporting the Dream Act and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, he has called for the closing of private immigrant detention centers, denounced the “militarization” of immigration enforcement and spoken out against the wall.[Beto O’Rourke announces candidacy, joins field filled with committed progressives]“We are not safe because of walls but in spite of walls,” he said at a rally in El Paso last month  held at the same time Mr. Trump was holding his own rally nearby. Far from extending a barrier across the entire border, he has said, he would like to remove the existing fencing in El Paso — one of the country’s largest border cities, and Mr. O’Rourke’s hometown.In his State of the Union address, Mr. Trump held up El Paso as an example of the need for a wall, claiming that the city had been one of the most dangerous in the United States until a border fence was built there.But the crime rate in El Paso actually fell long before the fence was built and rose afterward, and Mr. O’Rourke is holding up the city as an example of the lack of need for a wall.Mr. O’Rourke arguably first made his name when, after the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016, he live-streamed the sit-in he and other Democratic representatives were holding on the House floor in support of stricter gun laws.The Republican-controlled Congress did not pass any gun control legislation then, but Mr. O’Rourke continues to support similar policies, including universal background checks, magazine size limits and restrictions on some semiautomatic weapons.He also opposes concealed carry reciprocity, which would make concealed carry permits granted in any state valid nationwide, forcing states with strict licensing requirements to recognize permits from states with looser standards. It is one of the National Rifle Association’s legislative priorities.While Mr. O’Rourke supports universal health care — increasingly a litmus-test position for Democratic candidates — he hasn’t committed to a specific way to get there. During his Senate campaign, he suggested that universal health care could take the form of a single-payer system or “a dual system,” in which a government-run program would coexist with private insurance.He has given conflicting messages on the most prominent proposal, “Medicare for all.”In 2017, during his time in the House, he said unequivocally, “A single-payer ‘Medicare for all’ program is the best way to ensure all Americans get the health care they need.” But during his Senate campaign, he carefully avoided those words, calling instead for “universal, guaranteed, high-quality health care for all.”He does support expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and has urged Texas to do so. Other points in his 2018 platform included allowing the government to negotiate prescription drug prices with manufacturers and creating incentives for insurers to participate in the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges.When it comes to proposals for mitigating climate change, opponents frequently cite the potential costs of those plans. But Mr. O’Rourke has emphasized the financial impact of climate change itself. Billions of dollars that are spent on steps like sea walls, which would be critical if climate change continues unchecked, is money not spent on other priorities, he noted at a town-hall event with Columbia University students last month.At that event, Mr. O’Rourke spoke positively about the Green New Deal, calling it technically and logistically doable. As for its political prospects, “I don’t know,” he said. “That’s up to all of us, right?”He supports the Paris climate accords, and has also made a point of emphasizing effects that climate change is having: more storms like Hurricane Harvey, for instance, which devastated Texas.Mr. O’Rourke emphasized criminal justice in his 2018 campaign, focusing in particular on racial and economic inequities. In an op-ed in The Houston Chronicle, he described his own criminal record — he was arrested once for attempted forcible entry and once for drunken driving when he was in his 20s; both charges were dismissed — and argued that his success since then had been possible because of his race and economic status.“The chance that I had, and which I have made the most of, is denied to too many of our fellow Texans, particularly those who don’t look like me or have access to the same opportunities that I did,” he wrote.He called for closing private and for-profit prisons, decriminalizing marijuana and expunging the records of people previously convicted of possessing it, eliminating mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent crimes, and reforming the bail system so people charged with misdemeanors would not be incarcerated because of their inability to pay.He also emphasized rehabilitation for offenders released from prison, including the restoration of voting rights. Currently, those rights vary drastically by state.Like many of the Democratic candidates, Mr. O’Rourke has criticized Mr. Trump’s trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, which have hurt some farmers and blue-collar workers. In his Senate campaign, he emphasized the needs of farmers, calling for a stronger crop insurance program and federal investments in rural infrastructure, including high-speed internet, roads and schools.He has also drawn connections between agricultural policy and immigration policy, noting that immigrants — many of them undocumented — make up a large share of farm laborers. On that basis, he has cast immigration reform as an economic issue as well as a social one.“We should treat these individuals with dignity and respect,” he wrote on his website last year, “because they are a critical component of our agriculture communities.”"
297,"WASHINGTON — The Senate is poised as early as Tuesday to act on a Trump-backed measure to end the partial government shutdown, but a bill promoted as a compromise to pair the president’s wall with legal protections for some immigrants would also severely restrict migrants’ ability to claim asylum, drawing fierce opposition from immigrant rights groups.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, is planning on Tuesday to put the measure on the Senate’s agenda, setting up a likely vote on Thursday, absent any agreement from Democrats to act on it sooner. But its prospects in the Senate are dim, and with the shutdown now in its fifth week, 800,000 federal workers are almost certain to miss their second paycheck on Friday.The 1,031-page bill, made public on Monday evening by the Senate Appropriations Committee, would fund shuttered federal agencies through the end of the fiscal year. It includes $5.7 billion for the border wall that Mr. Trump has proposed and large increases for detention of and removal of immigrants, as well as three-year provisional protections for 700,000 of the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers, and 300,000 immigrants mostly from Latin American countries who have been living in the United States under Temporary Protected Status.But while Republicans say the protections are drawn from the Bridge Act, a bipartisan measure, that bill would in fact protect hundreds of thousands more Dreamers, who were brought to the United States illegally as children. The Republican proposal would shield only those who applied for and received work permits under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, created by President Barack Obama, which Mr. Trump rescinded in 2017.[Senate leaders have reached a deal that can end the government shutdown by the weekend.]Federal court decisions have kept DACA in place, and on Tuesday, the Supreme Court again declined the Trump administration’s request to review the legality of the program, almost certainly keeping it in place for the rest of the year. That decision by the court significantly devalued Mr. Trump’s overture to Democrats resisting wall funding.The new Senate measure also includes several provisions that are meant to make it more difficult for migrants to claim asylum in the United States, a legal process that allows people fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries to seek refuge. The changes have been top priorities of Stephen Miller, the conservative White House aide who crafted much of Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda.It would bar Central American children from seeking asylum in the United States, instead requiring them to apply in their own countries, in what the legislation describes as a program that “reduces the incentive for such persons to make the dangerous journey to the United States southern border to request asylum.”But Democrats and immigrants’ rights advocates denounce the plan as cruel. While the Obama administration created a similar program to expedite the claims of Central American children seeking asylum, it never moved to block such minors from applying inside the United States.“These are children who are often desperately fleeing terrible violence back home,” said Representative Diana DeGette, Democrat of Colorado. “They are literally running for their lives and asking for our country to help. Instead of offering them help, this proposal would require border officials to turn a deaf ear to their desperate pleas and send these kids back to the very places they just risked their lives to escape.”A separate provision would allow immigration authorities to quickly remove Central American minors seeking asylum in the United States, a change to an anti-child-trafficking statute that some scholars said would violate international law.“In effect, we are looking at the rapid expulsion of these children,” said Greg Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “The effect of the law will be to send people back into harm’s way, which would be a violation of international law.”The measure also adds a high bar for asylum claims across the board, mandating that they be deemed “in the national interest.” It would introduce a host of new grounds for deeming an asylum claim “frivolous,” including if the migrant seeking protection was also trying to obtain work authorization, had used a fraudulent document — knowingly or unknowingly — or did not file in a timely way.Republicans are arguing that the bill would do precisely what Democrats have been demanding: reopen the federal government immediately. As an added sweetener to Democrats, the measure also includes $12.7 billion for disaster relief, and would renew the Violence Against Women Act, which authorizes and funds services for victims of domestic violence — and expired at the end of last year.But the Senate math does not work in Mr. McConnell’s favor. He would need seven Democrats to join with all 53 Republicans for the measure to pass. But there are no more than a handful of Democrats in Republican-leaning states — Senators Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Doug Jones of Alabama and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia — who might vote in favor.A spokesman for Mr. Manchin said the senator would remain undecided until he saw the text of the measure. Ms. Sinema and Mr. Jones have not announced their intentions.House Democrats are also planning this week to bring up a package of legislation to reopen the government and provide some funding for border-related operations, including infrastructure improvements at ports of entry and immigration judges. They are still weighing whether to bring up their own border security proposal as part of a measure to fund the Department of Homeland Security. But given that none of their plans include money for a wall, Mr. McConnell has said he will not bring them up in the Senate."
298,"As Donald Trump was fighting with Congress over the shutdown and funding for a border wall, his administration implemented a new rule that could be a game-changer for health care. Starting this month, hospitals must publicly reveal the contents of their master price lists — called “chargemasters” — online. These are the prices that most patients never notice because their insurers negotiate them down or they appear buried as line items on hospital bills. What has long been shrouded in darkness is now being thrown into the light.For the moment, these lists won’t seem very useful to the average patient — and they have been criticized for that reason. They are often hundreds of pages long, filled with medical codes and abbreviations. Each document is an overwhelming compendium listing a rack rate for every little item a hospital dispenses and every service it performs: A blood test for anemia. The price of lying in the operating suite and recovery room (billed in 15-minute intervals). The scalpel. The drill bit. The bag of IV salt water. The Tylenol pill. No item is too small to be bar coded and charged.But don’t dismiss the lists as useless. Think of them as raw material to be mined for billing transparency and patient rights. For years, these prices have been a tightly guarded industrial secret. When advocates have tried to wrest them free, hospitals have argued that they are proprietary information. And, hospitals claim, these rates are irrelevant, since — after insurers whittle them down — no one actually pays them.Of course, the argument is false, and our wallets know it.First of all, hospitals routinely go after patients without insurance or whose insurer is not in their network. When Wanda Wickizer had a brain hemorrhage in 2013, a Virginia hospital billed her $286,000 after a 20 percent “uninsured” discount on a hospital bill of $357,000 — the list price, according to chargemaster charges. Medicare would have paid less than $100,000 for her treatment.Second, those list prices form the starting point for negotiations, allowing hospitals and insurers to take credit for beneficence, when there is none.I recently received an insurance statement for blood tests that were priced at $788.04; my insurer negotiated a “discount” of $725.35, for an agreed-upon price of $62.69 “to help save you money.” My insurer’s price was around 8 percent of the charge. Since my 10 percent co-payment amounted to $6.27, my insurer happily informed me, “you saved 99 percent.”Not!If a supposedly $1,000 TV is “on sale” for $80, it’s not really a discount. It’s an absurd list price.Just as airlines have been shown to exaggerate flight times so they can boast about on-time arrivals, hospitals set prices crazy high so they can tout their generous discounts (while insurers tout their negotiating prowess).Another rationale for those prices is just plain greed. Dr. Warren Browner, the chief executive of California Pacific Medicine, describes this as the “Saudi Sheikh problem”: “You don’t really want to change your charges if you have a Saudi sheikh come in with a suitcase full of cash who’s going to pay full charges,” he said.But in an era when American patients are expected to be good consumers and are paying more of their bills in the form of co-pays and deductibles, they have a right to the information on list prices. They have a right to make sure they are reasonable.Although making chargemaster pricing public will not, by itself, reform our high-priced medical system, it is an important first step. Maybe, just maybe, a hospital will think twice before charging a $6,000 “operating room fee” for a routine colonoscopy if its competitor down the street is listing its price at $1,000. Making this information public should bring list prices more in line with what is actually paid by an insurer, a far better measure of value.And while the lists are far from user-friendly, researchers and entrepreneurs can now create apps to make it easier for patients to match procedures to their codes and crunch the numbers. With access to list prices on your phone, you could reject the $300 sling in the emergency room and instead order one for one-tenth of the price on Amazon. You could see in advance the $399 rate your hospital charges for each allergen it applies in a skin test and avoid the $48,000 allergy test — with an $8,000 deductible. As a next step, regulators should insist that these prices be easily accessible on hospitals’ home pages — perhaps in the place of “PAY YOUR BILL NOW” — and translated into plain English. Seema Verma, the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has suggested that she may well do so.Patients can help, too: Check out your hospital’s price list. If it’s not detailed or complete enough, demand more. For discrete items, like an M.R.I. of the brain or a vitamin D blood test, take the trouble to scan the chargemaster for the item. Reject an overpriced procedure (even if your insurer is paying the bulk of the bill) and take your business elsewhere.Justice Louis Brandeis famously said, “Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.” But, in this case, the reform will work only if people take the trouble to look — and to act — now that the lights are turned on."

301,"• The 116th Congress, with the House in Democratic control, has come to order.• The House approved legislation to reopen the government.• Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, was elected speaker.• The House has begun changing its rules to reflect the Democrats’ new priorities.The House, with its new Democratic majority, passed two bills on Thursday night to reopen the government — one major spending bill to fund most shuttered departments and agencies through Sept. 30 and a stop-gap measure to restart the Department of Homeland Security for a few weeks — without funding for a border wall.The measures are likely to go nowhere for now, but they will raise pressure on Republicans to come to the negotiating table. Senators Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine, two of the most endangered Republicans up for re-election in 2020, said they want a vote.But the White House formally notified Congress of the president’s intent to veto the legislation, and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has said he will not put them to a vote without Mr. Trump’s support.The bills both have bipartisan stamps on them. The measure that would fund most of the government was assembled from six spending bills that passed the Senate Appropriations Committee with broad support. It passed easily, 241-190, with seven Republicans voting yes. The stopgap measure, which passed 239-192 with a handful of Republicans crossing party lines, is similar to one that passed the Senate in December without dissent.— Emily CochraneThe House on Thursday night approved the first part of a package of rules changes designed to improve order in the House chamber, ease introduction of bipartisan legislation and recognize the growing diversity among lawmakers. The other two parts are expected to be considered Friday and next week.The measure faced some opposition from the House’s most liberal members, particularly Representatives Ro Khanna of California and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who objected to the inclusion of so-called pay-as-you-go provision, which requires all new spending to be offset by equal cuts or tax increases. Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio and a prominent critic of Ms. Pelosi, argued that Republicans had not abided by such strictures of fiscal discipline, so Democrats shouldn’t impose a straitjacket on their ambitions. In the end, Mr. Ryan voted yes.“I just don’t think this is the time for us to tie our hands behind our back,” Mr. Ryan said in an interview on Wednesday. “It’s a big issue for me after watching the Republicans erode a lot of these essential investments that we need to make.”But the inclusion of other provisions, including a rule that would force House lawmakers to be financially liable for discrimination settlements as well as sexual harassment settlements, made it difficult to vote no. The rules changes will also make it easier to raise the government’s statutory borrowing limit by making a boost to the debt ceiling automatic with the passage of an annual budget.The package includes of priorities for Democratic lawmakers and members of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus that helped Ms. Pelosi secure the votes for speaker.It gives lawmakers 72 hours to read any bill before a vote. And it creates a select committee on climate change, a priority for several newly elected representatives. The package also changes traditional rules of decorum on the House floor to allow for religious head gear, a nod to Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, the newly elected Democratic representative who wears a head scarf.— Emily CochraneRight on schedule, the House gaveled in for the 116th Congress, with Democrats now in control. The name plate wasn’t on the door of the Capitol’s sumptuous speaker’s suite yet, but Ms. Pelosi strode out of the speaker’s office toward the chamber, grandchildren in tow.Lawmakers and their children and grandchildren waved from the well of the House to family members seated in the galleries above. The press section was packed standing-room-only with journalists, and visitors clogged the hallways waiting their turn to go through full-body security scanners and take seats in the balcony overlooking the floor.Tony Bennett, who sang “I left my heart in San Francisco” at a dinner honoring Ms. Pelosi at the Italian embassy Wednesday night, was spotted in the visitors gallery, as was Mickey Hart, former drummer of the Grateful Dead.Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, nominated Ms. Pelosi to be speaker, prompting a standing ovation from most of the Democratic side of the House and much of the spectators in the gallery.While some Republicans clapped, few if any stood during the multiple ovations during his glowing introduction of Ms. Pelosi.“House Democrats are down with N.D.P.,” Mr. Jeffries said, using Ms. Pelosi’s initials.Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, received a standing ovation from her colleagues when she nominated Representative Kevin McCarthy to be speaker.Ms. Cheney referenced Mr. McCarthy’s efforts in working to secure border-wall funding — “yes, Madam Clerk, build the wall” — in a nod to the ongoing government shutdown, which is at an impasse over the demand to fund the wall at the southwestern border. While Republicans stood, no Democrats acknowledged the remark.[When the House and the Senate Are Controlled by Different Parties, Who Wins?]Just before 1 p.m., the House began its roll-call vote to elect a new speaker, with each member calling out the name of his or her preferred candidate. Most Democrats were voting for Ms. Pelosi, while most Republicans voted for Mr. McCarthy, but there were defectors on each side.A handful of freshmen Democrats voted for others. Representative Anthony Brindisi voted for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, while Jason Crow voted for Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, bouncing his baby boy as he spoke, voted for Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois. Representative Jim Cooper, a longtime detractor of Ms. Pelosi, voted “present.”Representative Ben McAdams of Utah voted for Representative Stephanie Murphy of Florida. Representative Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania voted for Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III. Representative Kathleen Rice of New York, one of the leading anti-Pelosi rebels, voted for Stacey Abrams, the failed Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia.Three freshmen with national security backgrounds, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, voted against her as well. Representative Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey simply voted present.Republicans had their own defectors. Representative Justin Amash voted for Representative Tom Massie of Kentucky.Technically, photos and videos are prohibited on the floor of the house chamber. But that didn’t stop a number of members from documenting the historic vote.Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, posted a video on Twitter of her vote. And Veronica Escobar, Democrat of Texas, could be seen taking a selfie with Ms. Pelosi and a handful of other women members on the Democratic side of the chamber.Ms. Pelosi suffered more than a dozen defections, mainly from freshmen who won their Republican districts in part by pledging to oppose her as speaker.Freshmen who did not vote for Ms. Pelosi: Anthony Brindisi of New York, Jason Crow of Colorado, Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, Ben McAdams of Utah, Max Rose of New York, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey and Jared Golden of Maine.Defector serving his first full term: Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania.Opponents with more experience in the House: Jim Cooper of Tennessee, Ron Kind of Wisconsin, Kurt Schrader of Oregon and Kathleen Rice of New York.The final tally: Ms. Pelosi — 220; Mr. McCarthy — 192; Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio — 5, Representative Cheri Bustos, Democrat of Illinois — 4; Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois — 2; Stacey Abrams of Georgia — 1; Joseph R. Biden Jr. — 1; Representative Marcia Fudge, Democrat of Ohio — 1; Representative Joseph p. Kennedy III, Democrat of Massachusetts — 1; Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia — 1; Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky — 1; Representative Stephanie Murphy, Democrat of Florida — 1; Present — 3.Republicans and their well-financed political arms have for years campaigned against Ms. Pelosi as an out-of-touch, elitist San Francisco liberal, tying every sort of Democratic candidate to her. In 2018, it didn’t work.But with her second election as speaker, the biggest Republican super PAC — and the one that arguably tried hardest to tie Democratic candidates to Ms. Pelosi — practically celebrated. The Congressional Leadership Fund put Democrats on notice:The National Republican Congressional Committee blitzed out text messages to voters in 15 districts that flipped from Republican to Democrat, announcing the new Democratic member had voted for Ms. Pelosi after saying he or she wouldn’t. “Fight back NOW!”Republicans appear determined to keep Ms. Pelosi’s speakership — and the Democratic House — limited to two years.On the other side of the Capitol, the scene was more subdued as Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath of office to more than 30 new senators, who raised their right hands and signed their names one by one into the public record.“Do you solemnly swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that you will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that you take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which you are about to enter, so help you God?” Mr. Pence asked each senator.The freshly elected and re-elected senators were young — the youngest, Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, is 39 — and old — the oldest, Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, is 85. Several are former members of the House. One, Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, was the Republicans’ presidential nominee in 2012 and has already earned Mr. Trump’s ire for his independent streak.In total, the new class gives Republicans a slightly more durable majority, 53 to 47, in the upper chamber.— Nicholas FandosEven before she was elected speaker, Ms. Pelosi on Thursday morning started a historic day with a left hook, suggesting that a sitting president could be indicted. She made the comments in an interview with the “Today” show on NBC, when the host, Savannah Guthrie, asked if she agreed that the Justice Department guidelines against indicting a sitting president should be honored by the special counsel, who is investigating whether President Trump’s campaign colluded with Russians seeking to put him in the White House.[With the gavel in hand, she will cement her status as the highest-ranking and most powerful elected woman in American political history. Read our profile of Ms. Pelosi.]“I do not think that that is conclusive,” she said. “No, I do not. I think that that is an open discussion. I think that is an open discussion in terms of the law.”For good measure, she warned her left flank that the House would not move quickly to impeach Mr. Trump, but she did not take impeachment off the table.“We have to wait and see what happens with the Mueller report,” she said. “We shouldn’t be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn’t avoid impeachment for a political reason. So we’ll just have to see how it comes.”— Maggie HabermanMr. Trump claimed on Thursday that the government shutdown, now in its 13th day with 800,000 federal workers furloughed or working without pay, was “only because of the 2020 presidential election.”The House will vote this evening on two bills to reopen the government, one to fund the Department of Homeland Security into February — but without funding for a border wall, which Mr. Trump demands — and another to fund the rest of the shuttered departments and agencies through Sept. 30.But with House action coming, Mr. Trump is keeping up blame game.— Emily CochraneSwearing-in day is a time for lawmakers to make statements about themselves. Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, Ms. Omar, and Deb Haaland, Democrat of New Mexico, did so with their attire.Ms. Tlaib, a Palestinian-American and one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress (the other is Ms. Omar), wore her mother’s thobe — a traditional Palestinian dress — on the House floor. Her decision attracted attention on Twitter, with a hashtag #TweetYourThobe, encouraging Palestinian women around the country to tweet photos of themselves wearing thobes.Ms. Omar, a Somali refugee who wears a hijab, or head covering, became the first person to do so on the House floor. She has worked with Democratic leadership to carve out a religious exemption to a 181-year old rule barring hats of any type — a move that has drawn criticism from an evangelical pastor who complained she would make the House floor “look like an Islamic Republic.” The Orthodox Union, an umbrella group representing Orthodox Jews, supports the move.Ms. Haaland, who is one of two of the first Native American women to join the House, wore traditional Pueblo dress — including silver and turquoise jewelry and moccasins.— Sheryl Gay StolbergShowing her trademark confidence, Ms. Pelosi has already released excerpts from the speech she plans to give when she wins the speaker’s gavel — assuming she will win an election against the Republican leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California. (The Democrats have 235 members to Republicans’ 199.)On an incoming freshman class that is historically female and remarkably diverse:On growing income disparity, as the rich grow richer and the rest struggle to keep afloat:On climate change, an issue that she failed to legislate on the last time she was speaker — with disastrous political results:Representative Jim Langevin of Rhode Island, a veteran Democrat and the first quadriplegic elected to Congress, will have the honor of presiding over the first session of the 116th Congress — and the opening debate over how to reopen the government.In a new House that includes the first two Muslim women, the first two Native American women and a slew of other diversity firsts, Ms. Pelosi turned to the 54-year-old New Englander, who has been in the House since 2001.“As Speaker, when America marked the 20th anniversary of the landmark, bipartisan Americans with Disabilities Act, it was my honor to implement changes to our institution to make it possible for our colleagues with disabilities to preside over the House,” Ms. Pelosi said, announcing her decision. “Now, it is my great honor and joy to build on that progress by selecting Congressman Jim Langevin to serve as the first Speaker Pro Tempore of the new Congress. Together, we are proudly reaffirming a fundamental truth: that in our nation, we respect people for what they can do, not judge them for what they cannot do.”"

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox.On Day 26 of the partial government shutdown, Jimmy Kimmel said he might have figured out a way to convince President Trump to abandon his course. He noticed that Trump hadn’t played golf since before the shutdown began. (He last played on Nov. 25, the longest spell without a golf game in his presidency.)Kimmel presumes that Trump knows it would look bad for him to be out on the course instead of negotiating with Democrats to reopen the government.“I know it doesn’t mean much to Donald Trump that a bunch of Americans are being forced to work without paychecks,” Kimmel said. “But I know what does matter to you. I know what you care about down to the bottom of your Kentucky-fried little heart. And that is golf.”Kimmel suggested to the president that he give up on funding a border wall and simply reopen the government so he can hit the links again.Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, asked Trump on Wednesday to either delay or cancel his State of the Union address amid the shutdown. She suggested that he could submit his remarks in writing, rather than delivering them to Congress. Both Stephen Colbert and James Corden saw a problem with that idea.Chris Christie announced that he would release a memoir about his experiences in Trump’s inner circle. The title is “Let Me Finish: Trump, the Kushners, Bannon, New Jersey and the Power of In-Your-Face Politics.” Colbert and Seth Meyers both had some fun with that.Baker Mayfield of the Cleveland Browns is a sensational young quarterback.

303,"With Senator Rand Paul’s decision to support a resolution to block President Trump’s emergency declaration, Congress appears ready to deliver a stern rebuke to the president over his border wall and a clear statement that it will defend its ability to control federal spending.Senator Paul, a libertarian-minded Kentuckian, said he will join fellow Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, giving proponents of the resolution of disapproval the 51 votes they need, if Democrats remain united in their support.On Monday, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, confirmed that the measure has the votes to pass the Senate. Senate leadership, he said, has been conferring with the Senate parliamentarian to see if the House-passed resolution could be amended before the vote. “It’s an interesting question,” Mr. McConnell said at a news conference in Kentucky. “It’s never been done before.”The measure, outlined in the National Emergencies Act, is the simplest way for Congress to end a president’s national emergency declaration. Mr. Trump has said he will veto it, and neither chamber is likely to muster the two-thirds majority needed to overturn the veto. But the plaintiffs in multiple lawsuits will most likely seize upon a congressional repudiation as support for their argument that, in declaring a national emergency to take money for his wall that was not appropriated by Congress, Mr. Trump is subverting the Constitution, which grants Congress clear control over federal spending. The remaining question: How stern a rebuke will the Senate deliver?Here’s what to watch for as more Republican senators prepare to announce how they will vote on the resolution.Mr. Trump is hoping to divert $3.6 billion from military construction projects to his cherished wall at the southwestern border, effectively subverting lawmakers and the budget they set. Members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, who pride themselves on bipartisanship, have raised concern that Mr. Trump is taking funds that were carefully doled out after months of negotiation in the bill that he signed last month to fund the government through Sept. 30. His declaration marks the first time the National Emergency Act has been invoked because Congress has denied the president funds. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said the president should use funds already approved by Congress, for instance from Defense Department accounts to support interdiction of illegal drugs.“It avoids taking money for military construction projects specifically approved by Congress such as military barracks and hospitals,” Mr. Alexander said in a speech on the Senate floor Thursday. “And it also avoids months or years of litigation, which could make it unlikely the full 234 miles are ever built.”Others like Senator Martha McSally, Republican of Arizona, have said that they are seeking assurances that key military construction projects will not be affected. In a private lunch with Vice President Mike Pence last week, lawmakers asked for details about what projects would be affected. The Defense Department has not released that information. Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri and another member of the Appropriations Committee, has also expressed misgivings about Mr. Trump upsetting the panel’s handiwork.[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]Multiple Republican senators have expressed unease about the precedent set by the declaration and the potential that a future Democratic president could use a national emergency declaration for liberal purposes, once Congress forfeits its exclusive, constitutionally granted power of the purse.Senators Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas, and Mike Lee of Utah have all voiced concern on the constitutional question, though none of them has explicitly promised to overturn the emergency declaration. Mr. Tillis, in an opinion piece published in The Washington Post outlining his argument, warned that conservatives needed to consider what some of the current Democratic presidential candidates would do with a national emergency: implement parts of the Green New Deal to address climate change, or limit access to guns to address gun violence, among other possibilities. Even Mr. McConnell acknowledged Monday that the precedent was a concern and was part of the reason he had previously “argued, obviously without success, that the president not take this route.”Supporters of the declaration say that the president is within his rights to use powers that Congress gave him through the National Emergencies Act in the 1970s. “Using this authority is not and was not my preferred choice,” said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, speaking Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.”But Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, in an opinion piece on Fox News published late Sunday, was clear: “In September of 2014, I had these words to say: ‘The president acts like he's a king. He ignores the Constitution. He arrogantly says, 'If Congress will not act, then I must,’” Mr. Paul wrote, adding, “I would literally lose my political soul if I decided to treat President Trump different than President Obama.”Even Mr. McConnell, the first to endorse Mr. Trump’s declaration, declined earlier this week to weigh in on the legality of the measure.“We’re in the process of weighing that,” Mr. McConnell said when asked at a news conference on Tuesday. “I haven’t reached a total conclusion.”Republican senators facing a difficult re-election campaign next year are confronting a dilemma: Stick with Mr. Trump’s core voters or side with swing voters who largely oppose the wall and the emergency declaration to fund it. Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, hailing from a state that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, may be the most vulnerable Republican up for re-election next year, and he has not declared where he stands on the resolution of disapproval.Nor has Ms. McSally, another targeted Republican up for election next year for the seat she was appointed to fill after John McCain’s death. Two other Republicans targeted by Democrats, Ms. Collins and Mr. Tillis, have come down on the side of opposing the emergency declaration.A vote supporting the resolution, framed as a defense of Congress’s constitutional power of the purse — or conversely, a vote in support of Mr. Trump’s policies and use of executive power — could sway voters.

304,"Fabio Bucciarelli was named Photographer of the Year in the 76th Pictures of the Year International competition for a portfolio featuring his coverage of Gaza and the United States-Mexico border published by Yahoo News. Jessica Phelps was named Newspaper Photographer of the Year for her work at The Newark Advocate, her hometown newspaper in central Ohio. The Multimedia Photographer of the Year award went to Emily Kassie of the Marshall Project.The New York Times received the Angus McDougall Overall Excellence in Editing award from POYi, which is a program of the Missouri School of Journalism. Jeffrey Furticella, a Times metro photo editor, was named Newspaper Visual Editor of the Year, while Morrigan McCarthy of The Times’s national desk received an Award of Excellence in that category. Jonah Kessel of The Times was a finalist for Multimedia Photographer of the Year.“It is a particularly great honor to receive the Angus McDougall award since, more than any other honor, it recognizes the value of teamwork and the many talented editors and photographers who contribute to our visual report,” said Meaghan Looram, The Times’s director of photography. “I believe our portfolio this year highlighted the broad variety of photography that our staff and freelance contributors are creating, and the versatility and ingenuity of our photo editors and our print and digital design colleagues who are devoted to presenting our visual journalism to our readers in the most powerful formats for every medium.” Ms. Phelps grew up in a mostly rural and conservative area outside of Newark, Ohio. From an early age she wanted nothing more than to leave: After studying photography at the Columbus College of Art and Design, she spent two years living on a goat farm in Italy, then spent time in Chile, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. After turning her attention to photojournalism — and running out of money — she made her way back home. Now at The Advocate for six years, she has learned to appreciate her hometown.“I understand the supportive nature of my community and that everyone is there for everyone else when somebody is in need,” she said. “I came back to it with both the eyes of an outsider and somebody who grew up there. I now understand that people are just living their lives doing the best they can and that we’re all human.”Her winning portfolio included a long-term project on an Iraqi family that was resettled in Ohio after the father had worked as a translator for the United States military. The story, which followed their journey raising their three children as Americans but with an appreciation of their Iraqi heritage, also took first place in the Daily Life Picture Story category.Mr. Bucciarelli’s winning portfolio included a photo essay on Hondurans fleeing violence in their country and waiting in Tijuana, Mexico, as they applied for United States asylum, as well as another story in which he followed a single family across the border. He also had a story on the protests in Gaza along the border with Israel.Mr. Bucciarelli also received first place for News Picture Story for his images on the United States’ border wall with Mexico, and he tied with Nicole Tung for a second place in the same category for his Gaza story.Mr. Bucciarelli, a freelance photographer from Turin, Italy, has devoted most of the last eight years to covering conflict and received the Robert Capa Gold Medal award from the Overseas Press Club of America in 2013 for his images from Syria. But what gratifies him most, he said, is ensuring that uncomfortable truths are not ignored.“That’s better than the prize, because people don’t want to see what is happening,” he said. “If you wake up in the morning to get a cup of coffee and you see a terrible picture about a conflict going on, you probably think a little more about that — and your coffee doesn’t taste so good.”The New York Times’s visual investigations team was awarded first place in the Documentary Project of the Year category for a selection of videos titled “Visual Forensics,” for which Mark Scheffler was the executive producer and Malachy Browne was the senior producer. “This award is a reflection of The Times’s commitment to investing in innovative storytelling — the kind that has allowed the video unit to build an industry-leading open-source investigative team,” said Nancy Gauss, The Times’s executive director for video. “Time after time, this team set the record straight, exposed government deceit and set a standard for transparent and explanatory storytelling. This is a new form of investigative journalism that combines traditional reporting with the forensic analysis of videos, photos and satellite images, and 3-D crime scene reconstructions. The team’s commitment to uncovering the truth through deeply reported visual stories is something we are all really proud of.”In the Documentary Journalism category of the multimedia division, ProPublica won first place for “Unprotected,” produced and directed by Nadia Sussman and Kathleen Flynn with the reporter Finlay Young. The New York Times took second place for the “‘It’s an Act of Murder’: How Europe Outsources Suffering as Migrants Drown.”National Geographic swept all three places in both the Magazine/Media Visual Editing award and the Magazine/Media Visual Editor of the Year award, with Kurt Muchler winning both categories.Mr. Furticella of The Times also received first in the Newspaper Visual Editing category.April Saul took first in General News for an image of a shooting victim, and Tyler Hicks, a Times staff photographer, took second for a photograph of Amal Hussain, a malnourished 7-year-old Yemeni girl who later died. Stuart Palley of The Los Angeles Times won first place in Spot News, and Demetrius Freeman, a freelance photographer for The New York Times, received first in the Daily Life category.Antonio Faccilongo of Getty Images Reportage won the World Understanding award, and Adrees Latif of Reuters took first in the Community Awareness award.Matt Gade of The Daily Republic in Mitchell, S.D., was named Sports Photographer of the Year. In Sports Action, Bernat Armangue of The Associated Press took first.Jalal Shamsazaran won the Environmental Vision award, and Lynn Johnson of National Geographic took first in Science and Natural History Picture Story.

305,"Are you a Valentine’s Day person? If not, welcome to a growing club of detractors. Only 51 percent of Americans plan to celebrate the “holiday” in 2019, according to the National Retail Federation, marking a 12-year downward trend. But if you are an observer, how nice — for your loved ones. Retailers are expecting you to spend a record amount on presents this season (an average of $161.96, up 13 percent from 2018). At least you die-hard romantics are making up for the rest of us. Speaking of gifts, here’s mine to you: All you need to know about the latest business and tech news, gathered into one email that’ll set you up for the week ahead. Chocolates sold separately.Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive and the wealthiest man in the world, accused the owner of The National Enquirer on Thursday of attempting to extort and blackmail him by using racy photos that Mr. Bezos had texted with his girlfriend, the former television host Lauren Sanchez. In a candid blog post, Mr. Bezos pasted emails from the tabloid’s representatives who threatened to release the images if he did not stop investigating how they had obtained his texts. “Of course I don’t want personal photos published, but I also won’t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks and corruption,” Mr. Bezos wrote. If you’ve ever considered going into crippling debt, the government just made it easier to do so. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said on Wednesday that it planned to eliminate Obama-era rules that protect consumers from taking on bigger loans than they can handle. Under the proposal, lenders would be able to grant high-interest payday loans (short-term loans intended to tide people over until their next paycheck) without making sure consumers can actually pay them off. And those lenders would be allowed to do so repeatedly, contributing to a cycle where borrowers spin into ballooning debt. The agency said its policy would give people more access to credit. But critics say it will help predatory lenders take advantage of people who already can’t make ends meet. It’s not just your imagination — the past five years have been the hottest on record in Earth’s history, according to data from NASA. The report set the stage for liberal Democrats to unveil their Green New Deal on Thursday, a proposal for sweeping changes that would make the United States carbon neutral by 2030 and create millions of “green jobs” in the process. The measure was drafted by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, and it won’t go anywhere for now — Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has no plans to bring it for a vote. Either way, it’s a bold rallying cry, and may gain steam going into the 2020 elections. As the economy recovers from the government’s longest shutdown in history (and will be recuperating for some time), Congress is working to prevent another one starting after midnight on Friday. That’s the deadline for Mr. Trump to strike an agreement with lawmakers on a new spending bill that will keep the lights on at federal agencies. Mr. Trump continues to insist on funding for a border wall, but is showing some signs of willingness to compromise. Speaker Pelosi says she’s aiming for “good news in a short period of time.” Are you sick of hearing about the costly trade dispute between the United States and China? Me, too. But this week could be the beginning of the end of it — or, at least Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin seems to hope so. He’s traveling to Beijing with other American officials to continue talks that started in Washington in January. If the two sides can’t hammer out a resolution before March 2, the Trump administration will raise punishing tariffs on Chinese goods, hurting businesses and consumers in both countries (and others). For his own part, Mr. Trump said it was unlikely that he would sit down with President Xi Jinping of China before the deadline. The monetary repercussions of Britain’s chaotic withdrawal from the European Union keep piling up. Last year, the country experienced its slowest economic growth in a decade, according to a new report from the Bank of England that, predictably, attributed the slump to the “fog of Brexit.” Those clouds will probably stick around this week as Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain continues her dogged efforts to patch up the tattered proposal. European leaders said they wouldn’t renegotiate the deal, but now they’re vaguely open to “talks.” Of course, the major sticking point — the border between the Irelands — remains part of the plan, so you can guess how those discussions will go. Data from pharmacies in different neighborhoods shows that rich people buy different prescription drugs than poor ones. Apple has fixed the glitch that allowed people to eavesdrop on each other’s FaceTime calls and thanked the 14-year-old who discovered it by offering to pay for his education. Instacart, which offers delivery services through an app, backed off its policy to count customers’ tips toward its workers’ minimum wages — a victory for members of the gig economy. And finally, Carlos Ghosn, the disgraced former chairman of the automaker Renault, may have spent 50,000 euros (about $57,000) on his own lavish wedding at the Palace of Versailles in 2016. You’ve got to hand it to him — it looks like a great party."
306,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.[Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.]Cash-strapped government workers  are worried about buying food and making rent. Trash and human feces (seriously!) are piling up in national parks. Even the Secret Service is feeling stressed.And yet, 19 days into what’s become the country’s second-longest government shutdown, there’s no compromise in sight, and no additional negotiations scheduled.The problem, of course, is politics. The shutdown hinges on a border wall battle that’s become about so much more than a wall. In many ways, President Trump’s fight for his “big, beautiful wall” is a metaphor for the current politics of Washington.You have a broadly unpopular Republican president, already operating under a cloud of investigations, obsessed with keeping his promises to his supporters ahead of what’s expected to be a tough re-election race. And you have a Democratic opposition equally driven by their voters to oppose him at every turn.Those politics are the undercurrent for all the talks about the shutdown, and they’re fundamentally at odds with each other. And each sides sees political benefit to holding out and resisting any sort of compromise.Here’s what Democrats see:• Midterm wins. Democrats won control of the House despite efforts by the president to turn the final weeks of the campaign into a referendum on undocumented immigrants. Mr. Trump couldn’t get his wall funded when he controlled both houses of Congress. Why should they give now, Democrats argue, if his own party wouldn’t?• The base. Yes, some Democrats have backed border fencing in the past. But Mr. Trump’s hard-line policies, which Democrats see as racist and xenophobic, have pushed the party to the left. And it’s harder to cut deals when the debate becomes about morality.• The dealmaker has no clothes. Storming out a meeting after saying “bye-bye” isn’t a good look for any president, Democrats believe, but particularly one who ran on his ability to negotiate. The broader impact of the shutdown cuts through the theatrics the president typically uses to get out of tricky situations.• Jumpy Republicans. On Wednesday night, eight House Republicans broke with the president and voted for a Democratic bill that would reopen the Treasury Department. At least four G.O.P. Senators have expressed some support for reopening the government. The most jittery of all? Republicans up for re-election in purple states.What the White House sees:• The other base. Mr. Trump measures his political success by whether he keeps his supporters happy. That’s part of why he rejected a deal on the shutdown negotiated by his own aides and G.O.P. leaders after conservatives voiced opposition. And his base wants that wall.• Mueller? Mueller? The constant focus on the shutdown provides Mr. Trump and the White House with a break from the story line that really makes them nervous: the special counsel investigation.What Republicans see: • Opposition to Mr. Trump never pays. There are 19 Senate Republicans up for re-election next year in red states. A lesson many took away from the president’s support of primary challengers during 2018 midterms was that Republican establishment doesn’t win by contradicting Mr. Trump.• A longer timeline. The decisions by the White House to pay out food stamps through February and process tax refunds means Republicans have a bit more breathing room. Particularly in poorer districts, extending these programs provides essential cash infusions to large parts of their voting base.• The elusive deal. Senate Republicans have grown increasingly aggravated with the lack of clarity from the White House, leaving them unsure about whether Mr. Trump would even sign a deal they managed to cut with Democrats. That’s part of why the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has kept his distance from the talks. “It’s always difficult,” Senator John Cornyn told The Washington Post, “when the person you’re negotiating with is someone who changes his mind.”But don’t forget this:Elections are not won or lost on shutdowns.In 1995 and 1996, Americans blamed the Republican Congress for shutdowns. The party held onto its majorities in the 1996 election. In 2013, Americans once again blamed Republicans for the shutdown. In the midterms that followed the next year, the party gained seats in the House and won back the Senate.Have you been personally affected by the shutdown? Tell us about it: OnPolitics@nytimes.com. Our inbox is always open!____________________After a day of fruitless negotiations over the wall, President Trump traveled to a border town in Texas today to make his case. We decided to check in with Linda Qiu, The Times’s fact checker, and test the veracity of some of the president’s recent talk about the border.Lisa: In his prime-time address on Tuesday, the president said the southern border was at a crisis point. What do you make of that? Have things gotten considerably worse down there? Linda: Mr. Trump said the word “crisis” six times in that nine-minute address! But there’s not really a good case for a border crisis. Illegal border crossings have been declining for about two decades. I’ll bore you with some numbers now: From the 1980s to mid-2000s, apprehensions at the southwest border were between 1 million and 1.6 million annually. Last year, the number was just under 400,000. Now, there has been an uptick in monthly crossings in October and November, to about 50,000 apprehensions each month. But compare that to 2000, when the monthly number was between 70,000 and 220,000.It’s also interesting to me that Mr. Trump has sort of stopped trying to use data to support his arguments. Instead, he’s talking more about “Angel Families” — people whose loved ones were killed by undocumented immigrants — as he did in the speech on Tuesday night and during a round-table today. (And some of these families really appreciate the president advocating on their behalf!) But certainly, it’s more beneficial for him to highlight these specific tragedies than talk about the body of research that shows that immigration does not lead to more crime, and that immigrants are actually less like to commit crimes than native-born Americans.So at the end of the day, it’s an emotional appeal, rather than a statistical or empirical argument about any “crisis.”Lisa: The appeal to emotions reminds me of the migrant caravan, which the president helped turn into a national story ahead of the midterm elections. What happened to the caravan? Did the migrants ever come to the U.S.?Linda: Some migrants certainly did try. Remember that televised clash in late November? Hundreds of migrants attempted to run toward a border crossing in San Diego, and Customs and Border Protection closed the border and fired tear gas into the crowd. Our colleagues who have been traveling with the caravan also reported in December that about 2,000 have made appointments with immigration officials to petition for asylum — which is perfectly legal — and they’re facing long waiting times. A lot of migrants have also decided to just stay in Mexico for the time being. And some have attempted to cross the border illegally.Now that Washington is at an impasse over the president’s border wall, Mr. Trump has been talking caravans again. This time he’s warning of a new caravan forming in Honduras. And I imagine this won’t be the last time we hear him talking ominously about groups of migrants coming to the southern border.For more, check out Linda’s Fact-Check of the Day. Today’s topic: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s speech in Cairo.____________________Our colleague Astead Herndon, who covers national politics, sent us this update today on the latest from a big-name 2020 hopeful.Senator Kamala Harris continues to ready her likely presidential campaign, and this week came with significant clues on what to expect from the California Democrat as she prepares for the national circuit.Ms. Harris held several media appearances as she hawked her pointedly timed new book, “The Truths We Hold,” including guest spots on Good Morning America, The View and several late night talk shows. The message: She’s a unifier in a time of deep polarization and division.“We’re at an inflection moment, not only in the history of our country but the history of our world,” Ms. Harris said on ABC’s Good Morning America. “There are a lot of people who rightly feel displaced. They are wondering: Where do they belong? Are they relevant? Are they seen? Are we thinking about them?”“We need leadership has a vision of the future in which everyone can see themselves,” she said.Though Ms. Harris is expected to announce her presidential candidacy in the coming weeks, a source close to the senator said there’s no imminent plans on when that will happen. Ms. Harris will be in New York City Friday, for a book event at the famed 92nd Street Y on the Upper East Side.This week she also tweeted a call for nationalized legal marijuana and said incarcerated persons who were convicted on nonviolent marijuana-related charges should have their records expunged.Ms. Harris has, at times, come under fire from social justice activists who say her tenure as California attorney general did not match her progressive rhetoric. It is one of several challenges facing Ms. Harris’s candidacy, which will be one of the first viable campaigns for president launched by a nonwhite woman.[Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox.]____________________• Scientists have found that the oceans are heating up 40 percent faster than a U.N. panel estimated five years ago, and that ocean temperatures have broken records for several straight years.• Video games as a varsity sport?

307,"Julián Castro, the former housing secretary and former mayor of San Antonio, announced on Saturday that he would run for president, one of the most high-profile Latino Democrats ever to seek the party’s nomination.His first campaign stop will be in Puerto Rico, where he will speak on Monday at the Latino Victory Fund’s annual summit and meet with residents still struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria. Later in the week, his campaign said, he will go to New Hampshire.“When my grandmother got here almost a hundred years ago,” Mr. Castro said at the Plaza Guadalupe amphitheater in San Antonio, in the neighborhood where he was raised. “I’m sure that she never could have imagined that just two generations later, one of her grandsons would be serving as a member of the United States Congress and the other would be standing with you here today to say these words: I am a candidate for president of the United States of America.”Mr. Castro’s announcement had been expected for several weeks. He established an exploratory committee in December, two months after publishing a memoir, “An Unlikely Journey” — a familiar path for presidential candidates who want to play up their life stories and qualifications and, perhaps, get ahead of their biggest vulnerabilities. This month he also visited two of the early caucus and primary states, Iowa and Nevada.He joins Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former State Senator Richard Ojeda of West Virginia and former Representative John Delaney of Maryland on the list of Democrats who have said definitively that they will seek for the party’s 2020 nomination. That list is expected to grow considerably in the coming weeks and months.In his speech on Saturday, Mr. Castro emphasized education, calling for a national version of the prekindergarten program he established in San Antonio when he was mayor. To fund the program there, he increased the city’s sales tax — a politically risky proposition, especially in Texas, but San Antonio voters approved it.His message was firmly progressive. He called for a higher minimum wage, denounced police killings of African-Americans, which he described as “state violence,” and embraced the Black Lives Matter movement. He also condemned President Trump’s immigration policy, including the practice of family separation and the proposed border wall, and declared that his first executive order if elected would be to rejoin the Paris climate accords, which Mr. Trump left.George Rodriguez, a conservative blogger, talk-show host and Fox News contributor whom Texas Republican leaders designated as their spokesman on the announcement, said after the speech that the discussion of immigration had stood out to him. Mr. Castro, he said, did not “seem to be able to distinguish between legal and illegal immigration.”Mr. Rodriguez also argued that the San Antonio pre-K program, which was one of Mr. Castro’s chief accomplishments as mayor, had duplicated existing programs like Head Start. “How much of an accomplishment that is is rather dubious,” he said.[Read about what Mr. Castro and the other early entrants will be doing in the early days of the 2020 campaign.]Mr. Castro, 44, was raised in San Antonio in a politically active family. His mother, Rosie Castro, was an activist with the Mexican-American political party La Raza Unida and frequently took Julián and his twin brother, Joaquin — now a congressman — to rallies and meetings. Joaquin Castro will be the chairman of Julián’s campaign.At the age of 26, Mr. Castro became San Antonio’s youngest City Council member, and after one unsuccessful campaign for mayor in 2005, he was elected to the city’s top job in 2009. In 2012, he delivered the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention — the same platform that catapulted Barack Obama, then a little-known state senator, to national prominence in 2004. Mr. Obama, as president, later chose him to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development.In a statement on Saturday, the Republican National Committee previewed one of the main arguments it is likely to use against Mr. Castro, calling him a “lightweight” without the experience needed to be president.Mr. Castro has brushed off concerns that he is not as experienced or as well known as many of the other likely candidates.“In my whole life, I don’t think I’ve ever started out as the front-runner,” he told The New York Times last month. “I grew up in a neighborhood where nobody growing up there was the front-runner at anything. So I’m not going to concern myself with who people think of as the front-runner and who they don’t.”Among the Democrats frequently mentioned as 2020 contenders, he is one of the youngest. If elected, he would be the third-youngest person ever to become president, after Theodore Roosevelt (42) and John F. Kennedy (43).The full field of candidates could include former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Bernie Sanders of Vermont; and former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas, who ran a high-profile but unsuccessful campaign against Senator Ted Cruz last year.Surrounded by his supporters after the speech, Mr. Castro was asked whether he expected to face a fellow Texan, Mr. O’Rourke, in the race. “There will probably be 15 or 20 people in the race, so it’s going to be crowded,” he said."
308,"This editorial has been updated to reflect news developments.You know the system has broken down when the clearest way out of a government shutdown may be for the president to declare a fake national emergency.This was the direction President Trump appeared to be leaning on Thursday, as he flew to McAllen, Tex., to promote his border wall — a P.R. stunt that he didn’t want to perform and that he said in advance was unlikely to bear fruit. ""It's not going to change a damn thing,” he was reported to have said, “but I'm still doing it.""He’s probably right. Negotiations to end the shutdown prompted by Mr. Trump’s wall fixation have gone nowhere — despite the president’s storming out of his Wednesday huddle with lawmakers — and his show at the border won’t change that. The growing sense is that to break the impasse Mr. Trump will need to find a way to at least claim to be building his wall without Congress, possibly by attempting the norm-shattering and constitutionally suspect tactic of declaring the border situation a national emergency requiring military intervention.As the president stews over his wall, more and more Americans are feeling the squeeze from what has become the government’s longest stoppage ever. Millions of lives already have been upended — well beyond the 800,000 federal workers not getting paid — and millions more could be if the dysfunction continues, disrupting everything from air travel to the federal courts to basic services throughout Indian Country like health care and law enforcement.How did we get into this sorry situation? A meltdown of this magnitude typically has many causes. In this case, the president’s inability to reach some sort of deal rests heavily on several basic failures of understanding by him and his team. These include:1. A failure to grasp how divided government works. The president somehow came to believe that he’d have more leverage once the Democrats took control of the House. Maybe someone convinced him that, after the transfer of power, he could shift blame for the impasse onto Speaker Nancy Pelosi — a favorite villain of Republicans. Or maybe he assumed that Pelosi & Company would fold in the face of the dysfunction and public outcry a shutdown would bring. Whatever the logic, Team Trump assumed Democrats would become more pliable, and a deal would emerge.Unfortunately, Mr. Trump has been spoiled by two years of Congress being led by weak-kneed members of his party who, even when troubled by his excesses, largely let him run amok, lest he call down upon them the wrath of the Republican base.But for their part, Ms. Pelosi and her new majority are concerned about presenting a united front against Mr. Trump’s challenges to constitutional authority. With the president’s wall having become a flash point, the political costs to Democrats for cutting a deal seen as advantageous to Mr. Trump would be steep.2. A failure to understand the costs of playing only to the base. While Republican lawmakers may be awed by Mr. Trump’s command of their party’s troops, Democrats are more motivated by the fact that the bulk of the electorate is tired of the president’s divisive demagogy. Time and again, Mr. Trump has chosen partisanship over leadership, doing nothing to expand his appeal. This puts him at a disadvantage in wooing the public to his side of the wall debate.3. A failure to understand Nancy Pelosi. Apparently, Mr. Trump never got around to reading “The Art of War,” or at least not Sun Tzu’s admonition to “know your enemy.” If he had, the president would have tried to develop at least a basic working relationship with Ms. Pelosi. The White House clearly assumed that, at some point — maybe after she secured the speaker’s gavel — Ms. Pelosi would bend to Mr. Trump’s will. But the speaker is not impressed with bluster. She is seldom cowed by political pressure from her own team, much less the opposing one. She plays the long game, and her will is as formidable as Mr. Trump’s, possibly more so. One key difference: Ms. Pelosi knows how the legislative process works.4. A failure to understand shutdown politics. If you don’t want to be blamed for one, don’t say you’re going to own it. Mr. Trump sacrificed that option when he boasted how “proud” he’d be to grind the government to a halt.5. A failure to understand how the government works. Neither Mr. Trump nor anyone on his team had a clue how disruptive even a partial shutdown could be — and how they’d need to scurry to prevent millions of people from losing food stamps, housing or tax refunds.6. A failure to understand how members of Congress operate. Standing by the president when he’s tweeting out empty threats and insults is one thing. But when a shutdown starts causing pain and outrage back home, Republican lawmakers, especially those in vulnerable districts or states, start asking themselves which they value more — their president or their political hides. Even casual students of Congress know that this is not a tough call.Bottom line: Mr. Trump loves to boast that he leads with his “gut.” He really can’t be bothered with all the humdrum details of governing, remaining proudly ignorant of how anything works in Washington — the presidency, the Congress, the Constitution. That’s left him in a standoff for which he was wholly unprepared.For the sake of the millions being hurt, let’s hope he manages to blunder himself back out of this mess soon."
309,"WASHINGTON — The State of the Union address is usually the president’s moment to make his case with soaring words. But newly empowered Democrats on Tuesday delivered their own pointed message to President Trump and the nation: We’re back and we won’t be pushed around.From the party’s restored “Madam Speaker” presiding over the proceedings to the sea of white worn by the scores of Democratic women crowding the party’s side of the chamber, the resurrection of the Democrats as a force in Congress was on full display. At his first speech before a divided Congress, Mr. Trump himself recognized their ascension with his plea for Democrats not to pursue investigations of his administration. There was zero chance of them complying with that request.“We are not here to play,” Representative Mary Gay Scanlon, a freshman Democrat from Pennsylvania, said as she joined other Democratic women earlier Tuesday to celebrate their growing clout. “We are here to be serious.”Their invited guests — undocumented immigrants, sexual assault and gun violence victims, transgender Americans, federal employees who suffered in the shutdown — served as the personification of rebukes to the president and his policies. Also scattered through Mr. Trump’s audience on the House floor were multiple eager Democratic presidential aspirants whose goal is to take Mr. Trump’s job away from him in two years.The event had a different vibe from previous presidential visits to the Capitol for the annual ritual. That was not unexpected since plans for the speech had already been upended once by Speaker Nancy Pelosi — who returned to her old job in January — because of the record-long shutdown of the government caused by the conflict between Democrats and the president over his demand for a border wall, which Democrats consider unworkable and wasteful.The fight over wall funding persists. But the gulf between the Democrats and Mr. Trump goes much deeper than the border dispute. The disdain Democrats hold for this president was palpable in the chamber as they looked sternly on in mostly silent disapproval. Across the aisle, Republicans were left to provide the enthusiastic applause on which Mr. Trump thrives.The president’s call for compromise and comity struck many as particularly hollow after two years of angry tweets, recriminations and personal attacks that continued almost up until the speech. Democrats just weren’t buying it.“He is so disingenuous that when he starts talking about unity it is almost laughable,” said Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts.“It’s hard to listen to a man with such a demonstrated inability to tell the truth — or even keep his word with members of either party — try to sell us on the idea that he’s now ready for bipartisanship and unity, that he’s poised to bring us together,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island.Mr. Whitehouse and other Democrats did commend the president for the military and law enforcement personnel he brought to Capitol Hill for recognition, but said there was a big difference between them and the president.“They rose to the occasion in their own time,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat who could soon be joining the ranks of Democrats seeking the presidency. “He’s not doing a thing.”Representative Lloyd Doggett, a veteran Democratic lawmaker from Texas, spoke for many of his colleagues when he called it “totally outrageous” for the president to use his nationally televised speech to try to undermine the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and multiple inquiries that Democrats are now beginning into the Trump administration.The president essentially offered the Democrats a choice between reaching legislative deals or pursuing “ridiculous partisan investigations,” suggesting the country could not have both. To Democrats, if that choice exists, it is an easy one given that most don’t agree with the president on his legislative ideas. Many of them consider restoring congressional oversight — after two years of what Mr. Doggett termed Republican “overlook” — their prime responsibility after winning back the House in November.Perhaps the best illustration of Democratic sentiment toward the president was in how willing most of them were to sit during the speech and not yield to the impulse to join Republicans in their frequent applause of the president.In the past, lawmakers were uneasy about skipping the ovations for fear of being caught on camera not applauding some patriotic or uplifting moment and seeming disrespectful or churlish. But Democrats on Tuesday had no qualms at all about failing to applaud Donald Trump. They avoided any outbursts or walkouts that could have presented a bad image, but their silence as Republicans clapped repeatedly spoke volumes.The one big Democratic applause line of the night came at Republican expense. As the president was extolling the economy and the new jobs it had created for women in particular, Democratic applause became a crescendo as they realized that some of those new jobs were in the House of Representatives, where Democratic women had taken the place of ousted Republicans. They cheered and cheered.Mr. Trump then urged them to remain standing as he noted “we have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.” He was right, but the increased numbers were on the Democratic side, where women were outfitted in white in tribute to the suffragists of a century ago; House Republicans saw a decline in their women membership in the election.Unified Democrats are feeling confident in their approach after Mr. Trump relented in the shutdown fight and agreed to reopen the government without winning the wall funding. Despite his determined push Tuesday for the wall money, Democrats are very unlikely to give him what he wants in the ongoing negotiations to keep the government open past Feb. 15, though leaders of the talks say a chance for some compromise still exists.Democrats were careful not to completely dismiss the president’s call for bipartisanship, despite their reservations, though they sincerely doubted his sincerity.“President Trump must now take concrete steps to work with Democrats to strengthen the health and economic security of families across America,” Ms. Pelosi said. “After two years of the president’s empty words, the American people deserve real results.”In his speech, Mr. Trump lauded his accomplishments and said, “We are just getting started.” For Democrats, the Trump era cannot end soon enough."
310,"TIJUANA, Mexico — With the bullhorn of a nationally televised address and the prestige of the White House around him, President Trump delivered a dark, if familiar, message to the American people on Tuesday night: The United States needs a border wall to stanch the flow of drugs and criminals, and it has no more room for migrants.In Mexico — the supposed origin and pipeline of these menaces — leaders and citizens reacted with a weary shrug.In the Mexican border city of Tijuana, where thousands of migrants have gathered seeking entry to the United States, most of the televisions in a downtown restaurant showed soccer matches and basketball games. Mr. Trump’s voice, nearly drowned out by music, emerged faintly from a screen in the back.Almost no one seemed to care, or even listen to what the American president had to say.Luis Arce, a 32-year-old lawyer, was among the few who took a moment to reflect on Mr. Trump’s speech. He said he was not surprised by Mr. Trump’s insistence on building a wall, nor by anything else in the remarks.“It’s a tantrum,” Mr. Arce said. “We all know he is temperamental and will never back down on this whim of his, especially since he promised it since his campaign and seems like he can’t take it back.”“A wall will clearly not solve drug addiction, the drug trade, weapons smuggling or illegal immigration,” he added. “Those are problems that have to be addressed and solved by policymaking.”The situation at Mexico’s northern border would seem to demand urgent policymaking, as the migrants gathering at cities like Tijuana have become a humanitarian and political crisis for Mexico.The demands of trying to shelter migrants and improve squalid, crowded conditions have overwhelmed local officials, and the arrival of the migrants has strained relations with the United States. Last week, Mexico called for an investigation into American officers’ repeated use of tear gas across the border.Yet the reaction to Mr. Trump’s speech on Tuesday night was muted.Although only several weeks into his term, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has gone out of his way not to antagonize his American counterpart. After Mr. Trump’s address, he appeared to weigh his words carefully.In a long interview with a Mexican news program, Mr. López Obrador said Mexico would always pursue “a relationship of cooperation, of friendship.” His government, he said, will confront migration “with development, with employment.”After the interview, reporters asked Mr. López Obrador about Mr. Trump’s speech and his insistence on the wall.“I don’t even want to mention the word,” Mr. Lopez Obrador said. “It’s an issue that’s not even on our agenda. I don’t think about it.”Instead, the president said, he would try to bring Mr. Trump around to his way of thinking.“We will persuade him, convince him that we need cooperation for development,” he said. “This is the best way to face the phenomenon of migration.”Vicente Fox, the vocal former president of Mexico, has berated Mr. Trump in the past, and on Tuesday he appeared to see no reason to let up, dismissing the American leader on Twitter: “L’enfant terrible. The enemy of all! Even himself.”Mr. Fox urged Mr. Trump, “Don’t be so stubborn,” saying that Mexico would never pay for the wall and that “as far as I understand the American people will not either.”From the day he announced his candidacy for office in 2015, Mr. Trump has made the reduction of immigration — and the construction of a wall — a central issue of his campaign and presidency, sometimes promising that Mexico would pay for the wall. He has since claimed a revised trade agreement with Mexico and Canada would pay for the wall, an idea rejected on Tuesday by Kenneth Smith Ramos, the chief Mexican negotiator for the deal.“That’s a chapter you will NOT find in the new Agreement, simply because it does NOT exist,” he wrote on Twitter.In a series of fact-checking tweets about the speech, Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico’s former ambassador to the United States, rejected many of Mr. Trump’s claims. “Saying there is a national security crisis on the border does a huge disservice to how the US and Mexico have worked together since 9/11 to ensure our border is not used by terrorists to undermine our common security,” he wrote.On Monday, Mexico’s interior minister, Olga Sánchez Cordero, staked out a position that was in implicit contrast to Mr. Trump’s.“Migrants are not criminals, much less do they constitute a threat to the security of Mexico or the United States,” she said. “They are human beings who seek to escape the reality of insecurity and poverty in their countries of origin, who seek the most elemental thing: the possibility of remaining alive and finding a job that will allow them to advance with dignity.”But although she said Mexico was open and willing to work with the United States, the two sides are still far apart on the nature of the problem itself.Mexicans in Tijuana noted as much on Tuesday, when Mr. Trump spoke.Daniel Gómez, the manager of the bar airing the speech, called it “bad news” that would discourage tourism and hurt the Mexican economy.“It is so frustrating to listen to him say the same things, which are nothing more than excuses to justify the massive problems that exists in the U.S. and blame it all on the foreigner, the Mexican, the other,” he said.“It’s infuriating because we can’t do absolutely anything about it,” he said. “All we can do is what we are doing right now, which is to sit down and watch it from afar.”"
311,"WASHINGTON — Democratic congressional leaders called on President Trump on Tuesday to reopen the federal government while they resolve differences with him over securing the southern border, in a formal response to his prime-time address from the Oval Office that they dismissed as riddled with misinformation and fear-mongering.“The president has chosen fear; we want to start with the facts,” said Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, speaking from her office at the Capitol beside Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, as they delivered a joint response to the president.She said Mr. Trump had rejected bipartisan legislation to reopen the government “over his obsession with forcing American taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective wall — a wall he always promised Mexico would pay for.”Mr. Schumer suggested that the president’s formal address to the nation — Mr. Trump’s first from the Oval Office — had been a stunt. “This president just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration,” he said.The dueling speeches from opposite sides of Pennsylvania Avenue unfolded at the close of Day 18 of a government shutdown over Mr. Trump’s demand for $5.7 billion for a border wall that Democrats have steadfastly opposed.The Democratic leaders’ decision to select themselves as the message bearers to counter the president underscores how a partisan power struggle in a new era of divided government is undergirding the discussions over resolving the shutdown, even as the paychecks of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and benefits for millions of Americans hang in the balance.Mr. Trump, who spent much of the first two weeks of the shutdown cloistered inside the White House saying little about it, is now using the powers of the presidency to focus public attention on his ominous immigration message in an effort to build support for the idea of erecting a large wall on the border with Mexico. Democrats, newly in control of the House, are steering clear of talk of the wall itself, and are instead working to focus attention on the damaging impacts of the shutdown.“We don’t govern by temper tantrum,” Mr. Schumer said. “No president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down, hurting millions of Americans who are treated as leverage.”Appealing to Mr. Trump directly, he added, “Mr. President, reopen the government and we can work to resolve our differences over border security, but end this shutdown now.”Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, used a response to the president he streamed live on YouTube to brand Mr. Trump a liar, and ticked down a list of misstatements the president uttered during his address.“It gives me no pleasure to tell you what most of you already know, and that is that President Trump lies all of the time, and in remarks tonight and in recent weeks regarding immigration and the wall, he continues to lie,” Mr. Sanders said.He went on to discuss the plight of millions of Americans who lack health insurance, elderly people who have no retirement savings, millions more with crippling student debt and the specter of global climate change, arguing that those challenges were far more pressing than the one posed by illegal immigration.“We don’t need to create artificial crises,” Mr. Sanders said. “We have enough real crises.”Mr. Trump is planning a trip to the border in McAllen, Tex., on Thursday, while Democrats plan to bring up a succession of bills this week to reopen shuttered parts of the government, including the Internal Revenue Service, to allow tax refunds to be paid, and the Agriculture Department, to ensure that food assistance and farmer support payments can be made.The Treasury Department and the I.R.S. will come first, then Agriculture and Interior Department programs, including the national parks, on Thursday, followed by transportation and housing programs on Friday.“We are going to, daily, urge and take efforts to open up the government,” said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader. “Whatever problems confront us, they are exacerbated — not relieved — by shutting down government.”A group of Senate Democrats spent Tuesday evening taking turns on the Senate floor calling on Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to bring up the House-passed legislation to reopen the government. The dozen Democrats, led by Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, plan to spotlight the harm from the shutdown on federal workers and those who benefit from government programs.“Rather than Donald Trump putting on a political show tonight on TV and a political trip to the border tomorrow, I invite the president to come anywhere in Virginia, Maryland or the District and sit down with federal employees and explain this crisis and why they are not getting paid,” said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia. “We need to negotiate additional border security — I am all for it — but not holding hostage, literally, our federal employees and countless others.”In the House, the shutdown has proved a unifying issue for newly elected Democrats who campaigned as fierce opponents of Mr. Trump. In a brief but scathing speech from the House floor, Representative Ayanna Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, spoke directly to the president, uttering his name and earning a gentle reprimand from the presiding officer, who reminded her that lawmakers are barred from personally impugning the president or other elected officials.“You devalue the life of the immigrant, the worker and the survivor,” Ms. Pressley said. “This has nothing to do with border security; your shutdown, another Trump-generated crisis, has brought a tsunami of hurt to the American people.”"
312,"CHICAGO — On Day 1 of what would become the longest government shutdown in the country’s history, Mary Kelly had a typically American view of the situation: She was optimistic. As an employee of the Internal Revenue Service, she had been through shutdowns before. This one would not last long, she figured.On Day 24, weeks into her mandatory furlough, she applied for unemployment benefits.Ten days after that, she left her home in the Chicago suburbs, rode a train downtown and joined demonstrators on a windswept Federal Plaza, her cheeks mottled pink from the cold.“I was never scared during shutdowns in the past,” Ms. Kelly, a union officer, said during the protest on Thursday, wearing woolen gloves and clutching a sign. “But now who knows what’s going to happen?”And then on Day 35, with no resolution seemingly in sight, she had her answer in news leaked from Washington: The shutdown was finally coming to an end.“I’m waiting with bated breath,” she said on Friday, glued to her phone for bulletins that congressional leaders and President Trump had reached a deal to temporarily reopen the government. “Hopefully we’ll get a paycheck out of it.”When the partial government shutdown began at midnight on Dec. 22, it left about 800,000 federal employees out of work, with many continuing to show up at their jobs even without the prospect of immediate paychecks. In the beginning, the episode was easily shrugged off as another Washington dysfunction: the result of an impetuous president making an outsize demand for a border wall, a dispute fueled by partisan bickering and likely to wrap up in a few days.Initial nonchalance gave way to worry. Worry gave way to panic. And before it ended in Mr. Trump’s retreat from an insistence on wall funding nearly six weeks after it began, the government shutdown rapidly reordered American life.It showed how far the tentacles of the federal government reach into ordinary lives around the nation, and how even the richest country on Earth could be one domestic crisis away from bread lines. And it may not be final yet, government workers reminded themselves even as they celebrated, as the three-week deal does not preclude another impasse.Although over for now, the shutdown inflicted pain that ran deep.Stunned middle-class people were forced to moonlight, visit food pantries for groceries and apply for unemployment benefits. A stable government job suddenly felt high risk.Some of the federal employees who went unpaid for weeks missed mortgage payments, piled up credit card debt and worried about financial doom.Back pay will make most government workers whole again, but the deal cannot undo all the effects. Many business owners who rely on government workers saw their profits dry up. Many people saw their credit ratings nose-dive. Full of shutdown stress, many saw their marriages fray and noticed as their anxieties were transferred to their children.The shutdown revealed unflattering truths about Americans’ finances: Even neighbors and friends with steady paychecks and the markers of comfortable lives were suddenly surviving hand-to-mouth, teetering on the edge of despair.“I have to come here and see people who are homeless and who biked here, as I’m pulling up in my Subaru,” said Jenny Lunsted, a mother of two and the wife of an unpaid petty officer with the United States Coast Guard, who browsed shelves of canned pumpkin and fresh tomatoes at a food pantry in Stock Island, Fla., on Tuesday. “It’s heartbreaking because you feel almost unworthy and embarrassed at the same time.”The effects cascaded far beyond the plight of individual workers, attracting the attention of Americans oblivious to the outsize role the government plays in their lives.Federal agencies stalled projects. Plane crashes went uninvestigated. Research studies were deferred. A shortage of air traffic controllers caused flight delays across the Northeast on Friday, snarling air travel at some of the country’s busiest airports.A lack of workers left some of the country’s most treasured sites in a state of neglect. That included Yosemite National Park, the place the pioneering naturalist John Muir described as a temple of canyons, rushing waterfalls and sun-streaked granite cliffs.Because of the shutdown, the park was “hanging by a thread,” said Ken Yager, 59, a professional climber who came to Yosemite more than four decades ago and never left the area.All but a skeleton crew of rangers at the park were furloughed, the visitor center was closed and no one answered the phone at the park headquarters. Nearby, the towns that rely on Yosemite tourism for their livelihoods were hurting. Mr. Yager, who runs a cleaning service, laid off most of his employees.Every day the shutdown stretched on, Mr. Yager said, people were “more and more desperate.”It has been more than six weeks since the blustery Oval Office confrontation on Dec. 11 between Mr. Trump and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, and Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader.Mr. Trump, reiterating his campaign pledge to build a border wall, had said he would take the blame for shutting down the government if Democrats rebuffed his effort. “I will take the mantle,” he said in a vow that was replayed on cable news countless times. “I will be the one to shut it down.”And it did shut down, in the early morning of Dec. 22. The shuttered departments included Treasury, Agriculture, Homeland Security, Interior, State, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Commerce and Justice. More than 420,000 federal employees began to work without pay; another 380,000 were furloughed to wait for a resolution from home.Yet the notion of a government shutdown still felt to many like a familiar political ritual rather than a fear-inducing event, at least at first. This shutdown marked at least the 21st time in the last four decades that the government has not passed some form of a spending bill on time.In the first days and weeks, a tangle of complications began to emerge.Sheila Bailey, 73, had set her retirement for Dec. 31, after working for 34 years as a scientist at NASA’s John H. Glenn Research Center in Cleveland. And indeed, the date came and went, and Ms. Bailey is spending her days at home.But she found herself in an unusual limbo: She was not sure if she was a federal worker on furlough or a retired federal worker.“It’s just incredible all the complications,” she said, talking of the difficulties of signing up for Medicare Part B when she could not get the necessary paperwork from NASA. “It’s a mess.”The shutdown’s effects even came over the airwaves, in one case in the form of an off-color word. At a community radio station in Kentucky, a host accidentally played an Alanis Morissette song with an obscenity in it. The station director pointed out that, given a shutdown, the Federal Communications Commission was unlikely to be fielding complaints.In Southern California, Joseph Darling, 33, is a member of an elite federal firefighting crew that uses chain saws and hand tools to attack the nation’s wildfires. He would normally spend this time of year clearing away brush to help diminish future fire danger.But during the shutdown, he was not permitted to do that. Instead, he was confined to his office, waiting to be called to an emergency. “We’re ultimately missing those windows of opportunity,” Mr. Darling said this past week. He could not say that the shutdown would cause a fire to break out, but he could not rule out the possibility that the risk of fire had risen because of the bureaucratic standoff.On Jan. 11, three weeks into the shutdown, the consequences became very real to federal employees as many missed their first paycheck.Johnny Zuagar, 39, of Upper Marlboro, Md., has worked for the Census Bureau for 15 years as a statistician dealing with monthly retail sales reports. At home without a job to report to, he was now dealing with his own finances.“You have got to have food, and you have got to have gas in the car, and your kids still need stuff,” Mr. Zuagar said. “It might take them a while to come get the house, so you work with the mortgage company.”Critical to getting through the shutdown, Mr. Zuagar said, was putting all of that day’s anxiety behind him by late afternoon, when he picked up his boys — ages 8, 6 and 1.Tiarra Carey, an accountant with the Department of Homeland Security, began to trim household expenses. Her older children — ages 13, 11, 8 and 3 — quickly discovered that life had changed. They were used to stopping at Chick-fil-A or going ice skating. Ms. Carey said they could no longer afford that kind of thing.For contract workers, the situation became especially dire. Unlike federal employees, contract workers are not guaranteed back pay. Voyt Quinn, 55, typically empties trash cans at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., earning $13.55 an hour. But when the zoo closed, Mr. Quinn found himself home, racking his brain about how to make ends meet.His employer, Friends of the National Zoo, gave him a small loan to live on. But he will have to pay it back, little by little. He tried to earn some extra money making food deliveries.In Gainesville, Fla., the Peaceful Paths Domestic Abuse Network struggled to provide its usual services, particularly essential in a place where domestic violence is a dominant problem; in the region, there are about 1,700 arrests annually on charges for such crimes. About 35 percent of the organization’s yearly budget comes from federal dollars.For some government workers, the shutdown did not leave them struggling to make ends meet. But it caused other frustrations.Amy Butler, a contractor, is one of the federal government’s experts on the polar vortex, the giant mass of cold air that normally is contained above the North Pole by strong bands of circulating winds, but which can wreak havoc on North American weather when those winds weaken.This year, the polar vortex broke apart days after the shutdown began. Ms. Butler, like other researchers, could not access government databases, so she was effectively blocked from weighing in on internal government debates and putting out analysis during a weather event of huge significance to their jobs and research.“It’s disappointing when there is an event which I feel I’m an expert in, but I can’t share my own work during it because I’m not able to access those resources,” she said.Some families in which both spouses work for the government had to give up two salaries. In Anniston, Ala., Marlin Kimbrough and Kimberly Askew-Kimbrough had a somber conversation with their teenage son about the hardship caused by the shutdown.Tuesday was his birthday. This year, he had to skip gifts and a party.“It hurts the heart, it hurts your feelings,” said Ms. Askew-Kimbrough, who like her husband works at the federal prison in Talladega, Ala. “Thank God that our son is the type of person that understands. I’m quite sure he still feels hurt by it. But he doesn’t wear it on his shoulder.”The White House had asked agency leaders to deliver a list of programs that would suffer if the shutdown continued until March and April, The Washington Post reported this past week. To federal employees on the cusp of losing a second paycheck, the idea that the shutdown could go on that long was unbearable.And in recent days, some furloughed federal workers decided they had had enough. Unions representing air traffic controllers, pilots and flight attendants warned that the shutdown was making air travel less safe. A group of federal employees gathered in the Hart Senate Office Building in Washington on Wednesday, standing in silent protest for 33 minutes — one minute for each day they had been out of work.On Friday, as Mr. Trump spoke from the Rose Garden to announce he had agreed to reopen the government, Americans watched, relieved and elated.It was finally over, at least for a few weeks.In western Wisconsin, Kelly Harris had spent two years in financial purgatory — paying off debts and fixing her credit — to qualify for a federal loan program that helps low-income residents of rural areas become homeowners. The money came through. She moved in with her 15-year-old grandson. It was a dream.But because of the shutdown, she missed her first mortgage payment, due on Jan. 21.Ms. Harris, 55, said the Department of Agriculture offices that handle her mortgage closed before she could get her account number and other basic information about how to pay. She tried calling federal offices, her bank, her senators. Nobody could tell her where to send the check.“I worked so hard to get into this house,” she said. “For me to miss a payment is heart-wrenching.”The thought of defaulting on the home made her sick with worry. She had a 10-day grace period, which was quickly ticking by. She said she had no idea what to do.On Friday, she broke down crying when she heard the news that the White House and congressional leaders had reached a deal.“I am just sitting here bawling,” she said. She said she planned to call her loan officer as soon as she could on Monday, just in the nick of time. “Relief,” she said. “Absolute relief.”"
313,"SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras — A new caravan of migrants is forming in Honduras, and even ahead of its scheduled departure at dawn on Tuesday, battle lines were being drawn to the north, with some vowing to help them on their journey north, and others to block them.For President Trump, the timing of the caravan offered fresh ammunition in his fight with Congress over the $5.7 billion he wants for an enhanced border wall between Mexico and the United States. The dispute has led to a partial shutdown of the federal government.As he did last fall, when another caravan made the same trek, Mr. Trump portrayed the migrants — who say they are trying to escape poverty and violence, and who in seeking asylum are exercising a legal right — in an ominous light.“There is another major caravan forming right now in Honduras, and so far we’re trying to break it up, but so far it’s bigger than anything we’ve seen,” Mr. Trump said on Thursday. “And a drone isn’t going to stop it and a sensor isn’t going to stop it, but you know what’s going to stop it in its tracks? A nice, powerful wall.”Despite Mr. Trump’s assertions, nobody knows how many people will leave on Tuesday and how many more may join the walkers as they cross Guatemala, reach southern Mexico and make their way to the United States border.It was also unclear on Sunday who put the plan in motion for this caravan.Héctor Romero, 37, has decided he is going to join the caravan on Tuesday. “I have had only two days’ work a week for the past three months and that barely covers expenses,” said Mr. Romero, who collects bus fares in a small town about 40 miles west of San Pedro Sula, the city from which the caravan intends to start. “I didn’t have the courage to go last time, but this time I do.”The divorced father of four is taking his 12-year-old daughter with him, believing that it may improve his chances with United States immigration authorities.The first challenge to the migrants may come from their own governments. The deeply unpopular presidents of Honduras and Guatemala, both tarnished by scandal, are eager to maintain the support of the Trump administration. Halting the caravan could help them do that.On Thursday, the chargé d’affaires in the American Embassy, Heide B. Fulton, traveled to the border with Guatemala to tape a plea to migrants. “Don’t let yourself be fooled,” she said. “Don’t invest your time and money in a journey that is destined to fail.”In Mexico, the new government, led by the leftist President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, which took office on Dec. 1, says it will deal with the migrants more humanely than the preceding administration.Officials say they want to avoid a repetition of the “horror” earlier migrants endured as they tried to avoid detection — and deportation — on the perilous trek across Mexico.“Our vision is that migrants are not criminals, much less do they constitute a threat to the security of Mexico or the United States,” Mexico’s interior minister, Olga Sánchez Cordero, said last week in a speech to Mexican diplomats, promising an end to massive deportations.More than 300,000 Central Americans entered Mexico last year, most of them illegally, and an estimated 80 percent of them were bound for the United States border, Ms. Sánchez Cordero said.She said migrants in a new caravan who enter the country at official crossing points and register would be granted visas to stay and work in Mexico or permits to travel under the supervision of migration authorities toward the United States border. But those who cross into Mexico illegally, she said, will be deported.“We won’t allow any entry that isn’t orderly, safe and regulated by Mexican law,” Ms. Sánchez Cordero said.The government’s new policies will be put to the test when the caravan arrives, said Gustavo Mohar, a former migration official in Mexico’s Interior Ministry. “You cannot resolve the problem,” he said. “You manage it intelligently, cautiously, realistically.”He said success, particularly with so much international attention focused on the Central American migrants, would give Mexico “moral authority with the United States.”Traveling in caravans offers safety in numbers from the criminal groups and corrupt officials who prey on migrants, activists say. But the size of recent caravans has become “uncontrollable,” said Irineo Mujica, a member of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, a transnational group that accompanied earlier caravans in Mexico. It is not organizing this new one.As the new caravan prepares to leave, the experience of the last one seems to be guiding the response of governments and people along the way.That previous exodus was a tale told through images: migrants wading across the Suchiate River, which marks the border between Guatemala and Mexico; masses of people filling country roads and cramming into pickup trucks; and the central squares of provincial Mexican cities transformed into cluttered campsites.When the caravan — almost 6,000 strong — reached Tijuana, the migrants found that a high fence and a very long wait to ask for asylum still separated them from the United States. Migrant shelters overflowed and conditions in them quickly worsened. Some migrants gave up.But back home in Honduras, the trials of previous caravans have not been a deterrent for those considering joining the new one. The danger and frustrations pale beside the overwhelming fear of being sent back home, said Sister Lidia de Suazo, the coordinator of pastoral care for migrants at the Roman Catholic archdiocese in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa.“The majority of those who went with the October caravan were not deported,” she said. “So that sends the message back to the countries of origin, and people say, ‘Let’s go too because they won’t deport us.’ ”Miroslava Cerpas, the migration coordinator at the Center for Research and Promotion of Human Rights in Tegucigalpa, said: “We explain the dangers to them. It doesn’t matter what might happen to them, they are going to leave. Many don’t know where they are going but they know what they are leaving behind.”Some of the migrants in Tijuana were considering going south to join the new caravan and accompany those making the trip for the first time. Omar Rivera, 39, a construction worker from El Salvador, was one of them.“A lot of people are coming,” he said as he prepared to board a bus heading south, “and they need our help.”"
314,"Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead.1. The government shutdown is now the longest in history.At midnight on Saturday, the partial shutdown reached 22 days, surpassing the previous record of 21 under the Clinton administration in 1995.President Trump, above, used an Oval Office address and a visit to Texas to push for his long-promised border wall, the central issue of the shutdown. Under pressure from his own party and advisers, the president has backed away from declaring a national emergency to pay for the wall.His aides said they expected the stalemate to be resolved by the time Mr. Trump delivers the State of the Union address on Jan. 29.Have you been keeping up with the headlines? Test your knowledge with our news quiz. And here’s the front page of our Sunday paper, the Sunday Review from Opinion and our crossword puzzles.____2. The shutdown’s day-to-day impact on Americans — even those who work for the government — varies radically from workplace to workplace, or even from colleague to colleague. Above, a protest outside the Federal Center in St. Louis.At one research institute in Colorado, for example, some people are employed directly by the federal government and cannot work or be paid, while others are paid by the University of Colorado, Boulder, but are locked out of their federal offices. For a third group that hasn’t been affected, the institute’s director said, it’s: “Shutdown? What shutdown? I am not feeling anything.”Some states are also feeling the impact more than others. We broke down how federal workers in every state are affected.____3. Days after President Trump fired James B. Comey, above center, as F.B.I. director in May 2017, the bureau opened an inquiry into whether Mr. Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests — either knowingly or unwittingly.That inquiry is now under the purview of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, though it’s unclear whether he is still pursuing the matter.On Tuesday, lawyers for Paul Manafort, who was a top official in Mr. Trump’s campaign, accidentally disclosed that Mr. Manafort had shared polling data with a business associate tied to Russian intelligence. “This is the closest thing we have seen to collusion,” said a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. “The question now is, did the president know about it?”____4. The American military has begun withdrawing equipment — but not troops — from Syria. Above, an outpost on the edges of Manbij.There is confusion over President Trump’s plans to wind down U.S. involvement in the conflict: Last month, officials said the president intended to pull out American troops within 30 days, but more recently, the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, said the pullout was conditional and American forces could remain in Syria for months or even years.And despite those plans, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a speech in Cairo on Thursday that the U.S. would pursue a more activist policy in the Middle East.____5. Julián Castro is running for president.Mr. Castro, above, a housing secretary in the Obama administration and the former mayor of San Antonio, is one of the highest-profile Latinos to ever seek the Democratic nomination.His speech Saturday announcing his run was firmly progressive: He called for a higher minimum wage, denounced police killings of African-Americans and condemned President Trump’s immigration policy.His first campaign stop will be in Puerto Rico on Monday, and later in the week he will go to New Hampshire.____6. Increasing ocean temperatures kill off marine ecosystems, raise sea levels and make hurricanes more destructive.Now scientists say the world’s oceans are warming far more quickly than previously thought, and as temperatures continue to rise, those effects will become more catastrophic.For its part, America’s carbon dioxide emissions rose by 3.4 percent in 2018, the biggest increase in eight years, according to a preliminary estimate released Tuesday. It seems that a steep drop in coal use wasn’t enough to offset rising emissions in other parts of the economy.____7. Jayme Closs has been found.The 13-year-old Wisconsin girl vanished in October, when the authorities found her parents fatally shot in their rural home. The double killing and disappearance stunned the small town of Barron and drew national attention.In the end, it was Jayme herself who broke the case: She emerged Thursday along a wooded road about an hour from her home and asked for help from a woman out walking her dog.Jayme directed the authorities to a local man, Jake T. Patterson, 21, who is being held pending formal charges of kidnapping and murder.____8. Clemson’s 44-16 victory over top-seeded Alabama gave the Tigers their second national championship in three seasons. Above, offensive lineman Sean Pollard celebrating.The team used some big plays, but the roots of Monday night’s performances were planted months ago, with Coach Dabo Swinney’s gutsy decision to start a freshman quarterback named Trevor Lawrence.With the 2018 college football season behind us, here are seven observations and thoughts to guide us to next season’s kickoff.____9.

315,"WASHINGTON — Was this the shutdown to end all shutdowns?The answer could be yes. The toll exacted on government operations and federal employees by the record 35-day stalemate — not to mention the political costs to those in the White House and on Capitol Hill — was so punishing that it is giving momentum to a longstanding call to prohibit the government disruptions that have become a regular facet of Washington hardball.“Shutting down the government should be as off limits in budget negotiations as chemical warfare is in real warfare,” Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said on Friday.He was not alone in expressing those sentiments. Members of both parties said it was past time to enact legislation that would essentially mean the government would remain open at existing spending levels when an impasse such as the fight over the border wall was reached, rather than shuttering parts or all of the government. That’s an outcome that virtually everyone agrees is costly, unnecessary and even embarrassing.“This never should have happened,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, speaking for many.Veterans of past shutdowns have come to learn that there are few, if any, winners in the end and that closing the government has not proved effective as a negotiating strategy for those who use the government as a lever to press their case. It didn’t work for Newt Gingrich in the 1990s, for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and House conservatives in 2013 or for Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and fellow Democrats early in 2018 when they relented on a shutdown after just three days.Government workers are penalized through no fault of their own, constituents are inconvenienced, the nation’s image is hurt and those responsible for running the government look inept, irresponsible and unwilling to reach an accommodation. The tension in this shutdown was evident in the internal finger-pointing that broke out among Republicans as workers missed two paychecks and airports began to struggle with the absences of security workers and flight controllers.“I’ve said repeatedly throughout this process that government shutdowns are a bad idea,” said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. “They hurt federal employees and their families, disrupt critical government services and increase the cost to taxpayers. This shutdown confirmed what we already knew about shutdowns. Let’s do something about it now while the pain and inefficiency of this moment is fresh on our minds.”Mr. Portman has for years sponsored legislation to prevent shutdowns, and he introduced the measure again this month as the government limped along partly closed and federal employees lined up for food assistance and other aid.Under his plan, which has 18 co-sponsors and rising, funding at existing levels would continue for agencies covered by an appropriations measure that was not signed into law by the beginning of the fiscal year on Oct. 1, preventing any lapse that incites a shutdown. To spur a resolution, funding would be reduced by 1 percent after 120 days if no agreement is reached and by 1 percent more every 90 days.“It is one of these moments where after many years of us trying to get something passed that ends the shutdown, I think there is support coalescing around a legislative response,” Mr. Portman said.Senator Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat whose state is home to tens of thousands of federal employees and contractors, introduced his own proposal, partly with the idea of shaming his colleagues and the Trump administration into avoiding such confrontations.Searching for a bill title that would deliver the message, he and his staff came up with Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years, otherwise known as the Stop Stupidity Act. In the event of funding showdowns, his approach would be to maintain spending for all but the legislative branch and the White House.“More than a little bit of common sense tells me that we wouldn’t be here 35 days into this shutdown if all our staffs were experiencing the same kind of shortfall and economic distress that 800,000 of our fellow federal workers experienced,” he said on the Senate floor.Mr. Warner acknowledged that his title was somewhat tongue in cheek and that he would be receptive to making changes in the interest of enacting a law that would prevent recurrences of the last weeks.“The final language in any deal that comes out three weeks from now should put strong provisions and strong penalties in place to prevent this tactic from being used by either party or any White House or Congress in the future,” he said, a view shared by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa.“The final package should also end government shutdowns once and for all,” Mr. Grassley said.In the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi also welcomed the idea on Friday, saying in a meeting with news columnists that she wanted to explore the possibility of legislation that would serve as a shutdown prevention act.Despite widespread sentiment against shutdowns in Congress, there could be opposition. Some lawmakers might not want to surrender potential leverage in the spending wars. There could be resistance from others who don’t like the concept of automatic spending authorization, arguing that it gives up a fundamental power of Congress. Democrats have feared that automatic spending cuts could be a backdoor way for Republicans to cut money for federal programs. President Trump might be reluctant to sign a bill that includes such provisions, though he has now experienced such backlash to the shutdown and might prefer another way to circumvent Congress, such as declaring a national emergency to build the wall if negotiations fall through.Congress will still have its opportunities for brinkmanship such as the need to raise the debt limit, though House Democrats have already taken steps to make that more automatic as well, in an attempt to reduce the threat to economic stability — and eliminate a politically charged vote.Whether they can succeed remains to be seen, but Mr. Portman, Mr. Alexander and others said they were determined over the next three weeks to press the case for permanent protection against shutdowns.“We accepted the idea that shutting down the government is an acceptable bargaining chip in a budget negotiation and it should never, ever be, and we should resolve that that should never, ever happen,” Mr. Alexander said."
316,"Good morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)Xavier Becerra, California’s attorney general, has already sued the Trump administration more than 40 times, positioning himself on the front lines of the Golden State’s resistance to the president’s policies.Yesterday, he added another big lawsuit to the tally.Mr. Becerra, along with his counterparts in 15 other states, challenged President Trump’s plan to declare a national emergency in order to access billions more dollars for a border wall than Congress had granted him.“President Trump treats the rule of law with utter contempt,” Mr. Becerra said in a statement announcing that the suit had been filed in Federal District Court in San Francisco. “He knows there is no border crisis, he knows his emergency declaration is unwarranted, and he admits that he will likely lose this case in court.”It’s a fight that could have major constitutional ramifications. And California is playing a central role.Here’s what else you need to know about the suit:It’s not clear whether any of the fencing President Trump seeks to build would be in California. And it definitely won’t be built in some of the other states that have joined the lawsuit, like New York or Hawaii. So what specific harm gives California the right to sue over it?Mr. Becerra told my colleagues that California and the other states have standing because residents of those states could “lose funding that they paid for with their tax dollars, money that was destined for drug interdiction or for the Department of Defense for military men and women and military installations,” if Mr. Trump gets his way.In his statement, Mr. Becerra described President Trump’s move as “unilaterally robbing taxpayer funds lawfully set aside by Congress.”Still, it’s a really complicated situation. Experts say the success of the lawsuit will most likely come down to legal questions like which entities have the standing to sue in the first place, rather than questions about what’s actually happening on the border.Is this lawsuit the only challenge to President Trump’s action?Not even close. The Trump administration is facing a wave of lawsuits that have rolled in since the president announced his plans last week. And Congress is on a separate track to challenge the emergency declaration, which could include another lawsuit.Where is Gov. Gavin Newsom in all this?He’s enthusiastically onboard with the lawsuit. In a statement sent out by Mr. Becerra’s office yesterday, Mr. Newsom echoed the language he used in his State of the State address last week.“Rather than focusing on fighting the real vulnerabilities facing Americans, the President is using the powers of America’s highest office to fan the flames of nativism and xenophobia,” Mr. Newsom said in the statement. “Our message to the White House is clear: California will not be part of this political theater.”(Read the full story about the lawsuit here.)(We often link to content on sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

317,"On Thursday morning, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross — a man whose extraordinarily shady financial history doesn’t get the attention it deserves — appeared on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” to talk about the government shutdown. He expressed bafflement at the idea of unpaid federal workers suffering financial hardship, wondering why they don’t just take out loans. “There really is not a good excuse why there really should be a liquidity crisis,” he said. “True, the people might have to pay a little bit of interest, but the idea that it’s paycheck or zero is not a really valid idea.” Told that some workers have been relying on food banks, he said, “I know they are, and I don’t really quite understand why.”A few hours later, Larry Kudlow, director of Donald Trump’s National Economic Council, told reporters that federal employees forced to work without pay were “volunteering.” He added, as he stumbled to clarify, that they’re doing it out of their love of country “and presumably their allegiance to President Trump.” (If they don’t work they can be fired.)These officials’ comments were just the latest examples of the blithe let-them-eat-steel-slats attitude that people connected to this administration are showing toward victims of the shutdown. On Monday, Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law and the host of an online pseudo-newscast funded by his re-election campaign, said that the sacrifices of unpaid federal workers are a small price to pay for a border wall. “It’s not fair to you and we all get that,” she said in an interview. “But this is so much bigger than any one person.”[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]In an interview that aired two weeks ago on PBS, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, suggested that furloughed workers were fortunate not to have to use vacation days over the Christmas holidays. “And then they come back, and then they get their back pay. Then they’re — in some sense, they’re better off,” he said.Trump himself has been unable to feign empathy for the 800,000 federal employees who haven’t been paid in more than a month, or the hundreds of thousands of government contractors who likely won’t be paid at all. Earlier this month he retweeted a Daily Caller piece, ostensibly by an anonymous member of his own administration, arguing that the work of most federal employees is worthless. “We do not want most employees to return, because we are working better without them,” it said. On Thursday afternoon, Trump told reporters that grocery stores will “work along” with people who can’t pay for food.One effect of this government shutdown, now in its second month and without immediate end in sight, is to reveal the sham of Trump’s purported populism. It’s true, he’s able to connect culturally with some economically precarious parts of America. Despite being expensively educated, his worldview is basically that of Archie Bunker. He eats fast food, likes pro wrestling and has the terrible taste in interior design common to arriviste dictators. His vulgarity creates a kinship with people who purport to hate elites.Yet in purely financial terms, Trump is as elitist as they come. Though he campaigned as a candidate of (white) workers, he has governed as a shameless oligarch. He has proudly surrounded himself with millionaires and billionaires, seeing their wealth as evidence of their worth. At a rally in 2017, speaking of his economic advisers, he said, “But in those particular positions, I just don’t want a poor person.” He has gone out of his way not to hire anyone who would actually understand the plight of the workers he’s holding hostage.Contrary to Ross’s assumptions, it’s not easy for working people without significant collateral to walk into a bank and get a personal loan. “I don’t think a bank is going to lend to them, or it would be very difficult,” Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, told me. “To think that credit is the way out for these government workers is at best a real stretch.”Some workers are members of credit unions, some of which are offering low-interest loans. Those who own homes might be able to borrow against them. Others, however, will be forced to rely on credit cards, which can charge double-digit interest rates. And then, worst of all, some will resort to payday loans, which can trap people in an asphyxiating cycle of debt.Gary Rivlin, author of “Broke, USA: From Pawnshops to Poverty, Inc. — How the Working Poor Became Big Business,” explained to me how payday loans usually work. If you take, for example, a $400 loan, two weeks later you’ll owe $460. “If the government is still shut down, you take out a $500 loan to pay back the $460, and now you owe $575,” he said. Some online outfits charge even higher interest.As people miss payments on their bills, the financial aftershocks could stay with them long after the government reopens, assuming it eventually does. Diane Standaert of the nonprofit Center for Responsible Lending says there’s a risk of “long-term devastation to people’s financial security.” A missed rent payment or bill can damage someone’s credit report for years, which in turn can make it harder to get a mortgage or rent an apartment. Some employers even check applicants’ credit history when making hiring decisions.Ordinarily, one might expect a presidential administration’s leading economic figures to understand something of these financial realities. But if they cared about people who aren’t rich, they wouldn’t be working for Trump in the first place. The shocking thing isn’t their indifference to the misery they’re causing. It’s that they can barely be bothered to hide it."
318,"Among the casualties of President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to build his border wall is the reputation of the majority leader Mitch McConnell as a Senate institutionalist. The evidence of the last few days has confirmed, if there were still any doubt, that he is no such thing. First, he helped prolong the longest government shutdown in American history by insisting that the Senate would act only with explicit approval from the president. Now Mr. McConnell has fully acquiesced in President Trump’s power grab by supporting an emergency declaration, which he opposed just weeks before, aimed at addressing a crisis that Senate Republicans know does not exist. This display of obedience from the leader of a supposedly coequal branch of government is shocking only if you ever believed Mr. McConnell was an institutionalist. But his defining characteristic has always been his willingness to do anything and sacrifice any principle to amass power for himself. What separates him from the garden-variety politicians — what makes him a radical — are the lengths he is willing to go. Seeing this with clarity should help us grasp the danger to which he is subjecting the Senate — and, more important, our democracy.The signs of Mr. McConnell’s malign influence were always there. Before he became a Senate leader, he dedicated himself to opening the floodgates for corporate money to flow into our political system. Mr. McConnell chased the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law all the way to the Supreme Court; the 2003 challenge to the law bears his name. Mr. McConnell lost that one, but his cause prevailed six years later when the Supreme Court overturned restrictions on corporate contributions in Citizens United. In 2010, as minority leader, Mr. McConnell stated that his main goal was not to help our country recover from the Great Recession but to make President Obama a “one-term president.” A self-declared “proud guardian of gridlock,” he presided over an enormous escalation in the use of the filibuster. His innovation was to transform it from a procedural tool used to block bills into a weapon of nullification, deploying it against even routine Senate business to gridlock the legislative process.The two forces that characterized Mr. McConnell’s career, obstruction and increasing the power of corporate money in our democracy, have worked hand in hand to diminish the Senate and paralyze American politics. The flood of outside money incentivized obstruction over cooperation, and a new generation of Republicans embraced Mr. McConnell’s obstructionist tactics. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, for example, owes his standing to a few filibusters and a super PAC: As a freshman senator, he used Mr. McConnell’s tactics to shut down the government in 2013 and parlayed the resulting attention — and fund-raising — to run for president (and lose to Mr. Trump).Republicans actually took the Senate majority in 2014 in large part on claims to restore the Senate. Unsurprisingly, they broke their promises. Under President Trump, Mr. McConnell continued to run roughshod over Senate traditions, jamming the $1.5 trillion tax bill through without so much as a proper hearing. The one place the Senate has functioned efficiently is in judicial confirmations, but even here Mr. McConnell has cast aside bipartisan norms and reduced the Senate to a rubber stamp for some unqualified, extremist judges, including those rated “unqualified” by the American Bar Association.Mr. McConnell is not playing three-dimensional chess. There is no grand strategy or long game — there is only what best serves his narrow interest. And since 2010, Mr. McConnell has been convinced that his interests are best served through strict obedience to the Republican base. That year, his handpicked candidate, Trey Grayson, lost a Senate Republican primary in Kentucky to an insurgent named Rand Paul. It was a humiliating defeat and called into question Mr. McConnell’s power in his own backyard. It also invited a Tea Party challenge against his re-election in 2014.Since that scare, Mr. McConnell has rigidly adhered to whatever the base wants, institutions be damned. When the base wanted Judge Merrick Garland blocked, he obeyed. When the base wanted Mr. Trump embraced, he obeyed. While Paul Ryan was playing Hamlet in the summer of 2016, Mr. McConnell quickly endorsed Mr. Trump, providing institutional cover and repeatedly assuring Republicans that Mr. Trump would “be fine.” Mr. McConnell didn’t think Mr. Trump was going to win — he has said so himself — but he probably figured that the damage could be contained.The crass self-interest at so many turns now poses a danger to our democracy. With Mr. Trump increasingly erratic and Robert Mueller’s investigation advancing, there is simply no reason to believe he will stand up for American institutions when it counts. He has already demonstrated a willingness to put his self-interest above America’s national security: In a classified briefing in 2016, Mr. McConnell reportedly cast doubt on C.I.A. intelligence about Russia’s interference in our election and threatened that if President Obama publicly challenged Russia, he’d twist it into a partisan issue. And when the four congressional leaders drafted a bipartisan letter to the states urging them to take action to protect our election infrastructure against Russian interference, Mr. McConnell categorically rejected all efforts to strengthen the letter.Last week, Mr. McConnell had a choice. He didn’t have to acquiesce to the emergency declaration — he could have asserted the Senate’s independence at a critical time by passing the spending bill without validating Mr. Trump’s emergency declaration. If that prompted a veto, Mr. McConnell could have overridden it. That would be real leadership, and a clear assertion of the Senate’s independence. Instead, he meekly acquiesced in another presidential power grab.In the months ahead, our institutions are likely to be tested as rarely before. Under a strong leader, the Senate could provide a critical counterweight to an out-of-control executive. Instead, we have a man who will put his self-interest first, every single time. We should enter this chapter with clarity and finally see Mr. McConnell for what he is. He’s not an institutionalist. He is the man who surrendered the Senate to Donald Trump."

321,"WASHINGTON — The White House’s announcement Thursday that President Trump would claim emergency powers to build his border wall without congressional approval was a way out of the political crisis he created over shutting down the government. But while the move means the country will avoid another protracted shutdown, legal specialists warned that the long-term costs to American democracy could be steep.As a matter of political reality, such a declaration permits Mr. Trump to keep the government open without losing face with his core supporters by surrendering to congressional Democrats on his signature issue. As a matter of legal reality, the proposal is likely to be bogged down in a court challenge, leaving any actual construction work based on emergency powers spending an uncertain and, at best, distant prospect.But no matter what else happens, Mr. Trump’s willingness to invoke emergency powers to circumvent Congress is likely to go down as an extraordinary violation of constitutional norms — setting a precedent that future presidents of both parties may emulate to unilaterally achieve their own policy goals.“This is a real institutional threat to the separation of powers to use emergency powers to enable the president to bypass Congress to build a wall on his own initiative that our elected representatives have chosen not to fund,” said William C. Banks, a Syracuse University law professor who is the co-author of a 1994 book about tensions between the executive and legislative branches over security and spending, “National Security Law and the Power of the Purse.”“It sets a precedent that a president can, without regard to an actual existence of an emergency, use this tool to evade the normal democratic process and fund projects on his own,” he added.Emergency powers statutes are laws enacted by Congress that permit the president, upon declaring the existence of a national crisis, to take steps that would normally be forbidden by law. The idea is to allow the executive branch to move quickly in exigent circumstances.While presidents in the modern era have declared dozens of emergencies to address various problems, none has been remotely as disputed as the one Mr. Trump is contemplating. Mr. Banks said he had found no examples of a lawsuit in which someone tried to challenge the factual basis for a president’s determination that an emergency existed, leaving scant guideposts for what courts might do with any legal challenge.Legal specialists have pointed to several statutes that permit the executive branch to redirect military construction funds in a declared emergency that the Trump administration may invoke. One such law, for example, permits the secretary of defense, in an emergency, to begin military construction projects “not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.”Another permits the Army to halt civil works projects during a declared emergency, using the freed-up resources to help construct “authorized civil works, military construction and civil defense projects that are essential to the national defense.”The administration may seek to couple that statute with separate laws to claim Congress has already authorized various border barriers.Still, none of those laws are a perfect fit, specialists say, raising technical disputes that will give litigants plenty to argue about in court. But a more fundamental question for what kind of historical precedent Mr. Trump’s move establishes is whether courts will even allow themselves to address whether it is true, as a matter of fact, that a national emergency exists on the border that a wall would resolve.Critics note that the number of people crossing the border illegally is far lower than it was a generation ago. The relatively new phenomenon of caravans of migrants consists largely of families who present themselves to border officials and request asylum, rather than trying to go deeper into the interior on their own. Most illegal drugs are smuggled in through ports of entry. And there has been no instance in the modern era of a terrorist attack on domestic soil that was committed by someone who sneaked in across the southern border with Mexico.Still, the Justice Department would surely argue that courts should not even consider the facts, but instead should defer to the president’s determination that an emergency exists. There is a long history of courts being reluctant to substitute their own thinking for the president’s in security matters — or declaring that it is a “political question” for the two politically elected branches to work out between themselves.Congress enacted the main umbrella law that has governed how and when presidents may invoke emergency power statutes, the National Emergencies Act of 1976, during the era of post-Watergate overhaul.At the time, while bestowing broad discretion on presidents to decide whether an emergency existed, lawmakers also created a powerful check and balance against abuse: Congress could end the declared emergency if majorities in both chambers voted for a resolution to do so. To keep a president’s partisan allies from bottling up such a measure, the law says that if one chamber passed such a resolution, the other one must bring it up for a vote within 18 days.House Democrats have made clear they will pass such a resolution if Mr. Trump declares a border emergency, forcing Senate Republicans to take a stand on whether his move is legitimate. While Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said on Thursday that he would support Mr. Trump, it would take only a handful of Republican senators to break ranks for the resolution to pass anyway.But that check-and-balance mechanism was severely eroded by a 1983 Supreme Court ruling. It held that to have legal effect, a congressional resolution must be presented to the president for signature or veto, like bills are. The next year, lawmakers revised the emergencies act to replace its call for the type of resolution that takes effect immediately with the kind that a president can veto.Because it takes the votes of two-thirds of each chamber to override a presidential veto, that change has made it far harder, as a matter of political math, for lawmakers to block a dubious emergency declaration. As a result, even if the Senate does initially approve such a resolution, Congress is unlikely to override Mr. Trump’s certain veto of it if most Republican members stick with him.Against that backdrop, Elizabeth Goitein, who oversaw a recent study of presidential emergency powers for the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, said that Mr. Trump’s move, if he indeed followed through, would be an abuse of power and set a precedent that risked making it “open season” for presidents to cynically claim that a national emergency existed to evade democratic constraints.“Every time this president does something that would have been unthinkable under a previous administration, and every time he acts in a way we’re used to seeing in an authoritarian regime, a little piece of our democracy dies, and this is a pretty big piece,” she said. “I know what the potential is for these laws to be abused once that seal is broken.”"
322,"WASHINGTON — Immigrant advocates denounced it as cruel. The conservative right howled that it was amnesty.What President Trump billed on Saturday as a compromise to end the country’s longest government shutdown pleased neither the Democratic congressional leaders whose buy-in he needs to strike a deal nor the core supporters whose backing has always been at the heart of his insistence on a border wall.Instead, in offering temporary protections for about one million immigrants at risk of deportation in exchange for funding for a wall, Mr. Trump did something rarely seen during his presidency. He tried to reach beyond his base of supporters — which polls have begun to show is losing patience with him as the partial shutdown drags into its fifth week — and speak to a broader swath of Americans.The Saturday afternoon speech from the West Wing was an attempt by Mr. Trump to, at the very least, shift the narrative of the past several weeks and show that rather than spoiling for a longer shutdown fight or making unreasonable demands, he was looking for a broadly acceptable way out of a morass he once boasted he was proud to wade into.“I think you could tell by the president’s remarks today,” Vice President Mike Pence said, “that we’re reaching out.”Yet in seeking to inch toward the center, Mr. Trump alienated portions of his hard-right base, the core supporters he most depends on and the group he and his closest aides have most feared losing. That raised the possibility that, in his zeal to get out of an intractable situation, he may have landed himself in the worst of all worlds, without a clear solution or the support of his most ardent followers.[Read: Trump’s Deal Meets With Skepticism Among Immigrants in Texas]The tensions and anger over the policy have been quietly playing out in the West Wing as well, as Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, fended off Stephen Miller, the architect of much of Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda. Mr. Kushner has long been a proponent of protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, while Mr. Miller has pressed for aggressive measures to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration.In recent days, as White House officials had been working out the details of the compromise, Mr. Miller intervened to narrow the universe of immigrants who would receive protection, according to people familiar with the internal discussions who described them on the condition of anonymity.While the original idea had been to include protections for as many as 1.8 million undocumented immigrants eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program known as DACA that protected those illegally brought to the United States as children, Mr. Trump ultimately proposed shielding only the 700,000 who are enrolled.Mr. Kushner conceded in a briefing after the president’s speech that he did not see the proposal as a solution for the DACA program, which Mr. Trump moved to rescind in 2017.“At this moment in time,” Mr. Kushner said, “this is a good path forward.”Many conservatives did not share that view.“Trump proposes amnesty,” the conservative commentator Ann Coulter said on Twitter. “We voted for Trump and got Jeb!” she added, referring to Jeb Bush, who challenged Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016 and supported a broad immigration overhaul that would have given undocumented immigrants a path to legal status.Still, in the eyes of many White House officials, the prospect that Mr. Trump could use the proposal to shift blame for the shutdown and pressure Democrats to end the impasse was worth trying. Mr. Pence argued on Saturday that the speech was a “sincere effort” by Mr. Trump to break the logjam, and he and other White House officials suggested that the measure could attract enough support to succeed from centrist Democrats fed up with the shutdown and willing to side with Republicans.But such a coalition did not appear to be forming, and courting one bears considerable risk for a president who is most comfortable when he is defying convention, eschewing compromise and being hailed as a hero by supporters who often equate bipartisan deal making with weak-kneed capitulation.The vast majority of Democrats knocked the approach. While many of them have pressed for measures to protect DACA recipients and immigrants living in the United States under Temporary Protected Status enacted when their countries were destabilized by war or catastrophe, most regard the proposal he put forth on Saturday as woefully inadequate. It offers only three years of protections for the DACA recipients and those who hold T.P.S., which the Trump administration has also moved to end for several countries.“This is not an amnesty bill,” Mr. Pence said. “There is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal.”That was high on Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s list of reasons to call the plan “unacceptable.”That is unlikely to matter to the president. Despite saying publicly last month that he would be proud to own a shutdown over the wall, and privately displaying confidence that his base would stick with him through the fight, Mr. Trump has been dismayed to find otherwise in recent days.An NPR poll released last week showed Mr. Trump’s approval ratings down and the first cracks in backing among critical supporters, including whites without a college education and white evangelicals.Such pressure from what he has called the forgotten men and women who elected him and chant “Build! The! Wall!” at his arena rallies has swayed Mr. Trump before, including last year, when the conservative news site Breitbart branded him “Amnesty Don” for considering a similar deal that would have provided $25 billion in wall funding for a path to legal status for those the DACA program was created to help. The president ultimately abandoned that agreement, concerned about angering his base and after Mr. Miller and others advised him he should insist on additional immigration restrictions.On Saturday night, Breitbart panned Mr. Trump’s latest idea with the headline “Three-Year Amnesty, Most of Border Remains Open.”"
323,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. “This is not a manufactured crisis. This is truly an emergency.”Kirstjen Nielsen, the Homeland Security secretary, urged Congress to confront what she called a “humanitarian catastrophe” on the southern border by supporting President Trump’s border wall, though it is not clear how a wall would alter the flow of asylum seekers or address their needs.She was also defiant in the face of criticism of how the administration treats migrant families at the border, especially separating families.Separately, in a setback for Mr. Trump, the U.S. trade deficit in goods ballooned to $891.3 billion in 2018, its highest level in history. The deficit expanded mainly because of the strong U.S. economy, which allowed Americans to purchase more from abroad, and the strong dollar, which raised the international prices of U.S. exports._____2. Senator Martha McSally, Republican of Arizona and the first woman in the Air Force to fly in combat, said that she had been raped by a superior officer while serving.She made the disclosure at a Senate committee hearing about preventing sexual assault in the military, above, saying that she had nearly left the service. “I thought I was strong, but felt powerless,” she said. She stayed, she said, to be a voice for women: “It’s personal from two perspectives — as a commander who led my airmen into combat and as a survivor of rape and betrayal.”Also on Capitol Hill, House Democrats were accusing their party’s leaders of treating Representative Ilhan Omar unfairly. They ultimately put off a vote on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism, as critics said Ms. Omar was unfairly singled out._____3. The Supreme Court is getting an education in rap.Hip-hop stars including Meek Mill, above, Fat Joe and 21 Savage filed a brief urging the court to hear the appeal of a Pittsburgh rapper challenging his conviction. The artist, Jamal Knox, who raps under the name Mayhem Mal, was sent to prison for two years for threatening police officers in his song.“A person unfamiliar with what today is the nation’s most dominant musical genre or one who hears music through the auditory lens of older genres such as jazz, country or symphony,” they wrote, “may mistakenly interpret a rap song as a true threat of violence.”_____4. Mark Zuckerberg said he would shift Facebook’s platforms to emphasize private, encrypted communication, a major turn from public sharing.After grappling with years of scandal over data privacy, the Facebook founder and chief executive said he wanted to create systems that would offer users a “digital living room” where they can expect their discussions to be fully private.In other tech news, Tesla is shutting down most of its dealerships — just three months after a sprint to open new locations._____5. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s former top adviser and close friend tried to defuse a political scandal gripping Canada.In testimony before a parliamentary committee, the adviser, Gerald Butts, pictured above, denied that any improper pressure was put on the former justice minister to settle a criminal case.

324,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. We look at what is driving Turks to leave in droves, Apple’s cut to its first-quarter revenue forecast and cultural interpreters in Sweden’s delivery rooms. Here’s the latest: For 17 years, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has won elections by promising to restore Turkey to the glories of its Ottoman past. But after a failed 2016 coup, Mr. Erdogan enforced a sweeping crackdown. In its wake, the economy took a hit and the lira plunged after he won re-election with even greater authoritarian powers. Now, Turks are leaving in droves.Lasting effect: Driven by fear of persecution and economic mismanagement, the exodus threatens to reorder society permanently and set Turkey back decades.Analysis: “The brain drain is real,” one expert said of the flight of more than 250,000 Turkish citizens last year.Apple cut its first-quarter revenue forecast, citing a steep drop in iPhone sales in China. In a letter to shareholders, the company said it expected revenue of about $84 billion in the quarter that ended Saturday, down from a previous estimate of $89 billion to $93 billion.The takeaway: The company’s announcement added to concerns about the ability of U.S. tech giants to navigate an increasingly uncertain economy and a continuing trade war with China. Markets: The new year started on a down note, as shares on Wall Street tumbled at the start of trading, following declines in Europe and Asia, but rose later in the day.E.C.B.: The European Central Bank took control of a struggling Italian bank to prevent a wider crisis.With the partial U.S. government shutdown now in its 13th day, President Trump invited congressional leaders from both parties to a gathering in the Situation Room billed as a border security briefing. The meeting yielded no agreement.Details: The U.S. government has been partly shut down for nearly two weeks after a legislative impasse over funding for a border wall.What to watch for: Democrats take control of the House of Representatives today, the first taste of a split government during the Trump era. Representative Nancy Pelosi, who is likely to be elected speaker, has said the wall cannot be part of any deal to reopen the government.Last year, 28 percent of the women who gave birth in Sweden had been born in another country. That’s where doula culture interpreters come in, a relatively new concept in the Swedish delivery room. The doula interpreters not only act as birth coaches but also provide translation services between medical professionals and immigrants.Why it’s important: Studies show that the support of a trained doula can reduce the risk of complications and interventions during childbirth.Impact: “This was a typical example where it went well, very much because the doula could explain,” one doula interpreter said after a delivery. “I think it helped her be more courageous that the doula was there.”India: Two women in the southern Indian state of Kerala entered a centuries-old Hindu shrine that has long barred women of childbearing age. Hours before the women entered the temple, millions of people formed a 300-mile human chain protesting gender inequality.Russia blast: The death toll from an apartment building that partly collapsed after an explosion this week rose to 38 today. A few others are still missing.Britain: The Foreign Office brought home 82 women from forced marriages over two years, then billed them as much as $1,000 for their return. The country’s foreign secretary said he wanted to “get to the bottom of this particular issue.”Denmark: At least six people were killed when a cargo container carried by a freight train somehow struck a passing passenger train.Space: China reached a milestone in space exploration, safely landing a vehicle on the far side of the moon for the first time in history. Separately, a NASA spacecraft successfully completed a flyby of that small, icy world known as Ultima Thule — the most distant object in space ever explored.Greece: Three migrant fishermen who rescued Greeks from the sea during fast-moving wildfires in July were granted citizenship as a reward.Italy: German soldiers stole a painting from the Uffizi Galleries in Florence, Italy, during World War II. Now the museum wants the German government’s help getting it back from private hands.New year, same you: Are you a grudge holder? It’s nothing to be ashamed of. “Grudges can be good, actually, and we should hold onto some of them, like petty Tamagotchis in our emotional pocket,” our Styles writer says.Tips for a more fulfilling life.Recipe of the day: Marinate salmon in miso paste and maple syrup for a quick, delicious meal.Welcome to 2019. Here’s how to eat a little better.Making changes in the new year? Use science to stick to your goals.How do you acknowledge a colleague’s message? After a recent digital exchange, this writer looked into the history of one of his favored responses: “Roger that.”In the days of Morse code, an R was sent to indicate that a message had been received.That system evolved with the introduction of radio communications. Early transmissions were often of poor quality, so, to avoid misunderstandings, spelling alphabets were developed. Also called phonetic alphabets, they replaced letters with words that started with the corresponding letter.By World War II, the U.S. and British militaries had settled on a standard: Able for A, Baker for B … and Roger for R. (Previously, the British had used Robert.)In the 1950s, a new alphabet — commonly referred to as the NATO phonetic alphabet — was adopted, and is now the most widely used. It replaced Roger with Romeo. (I’m planning to stick with Roger.)Chris Stanford, on the briefings team, wrote today’s Back Story.

325,"Good Monday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.MNG Enterprises, the owner of one of the largest newspaper businesses in the country, made a $12-per-share offer today for Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and dozens of other publications.The news: The proposal from MNG, which owns 200 publications, to buy Gannett represents a 41 percent premium over the company’s closing price at the end of last year. MNG, which has a history of acquiring struggling local papers and cutting costs, has a 7.5 percent stake in Gannett, making it Gannett’s largest active shareholder. Gannett’s stock price surged in premarket trading after the bid.The back story: Over the past few years, MNG has made several approaches about a deal, only to be rebuffed, the WSJ reported. Gannett, whose shares have dropped in recent years, has been seeking to remake itself. In 2016, it backed off a bid to acquire Tronc, the media company now known as Tribune Publishing.The backlash: MNG, one of the largest newspaper chains in the country, owns about 200 newspapers and publications including The Denver Post and The Orange County Register. Last year, frustrated journalists at The Denver paper criticized its owner, making the case for its survival.In related news: The East Bay Express, an alternative weekly in San Francisco, laid off almost its entire editorial staff on Friday, its publisher said, adding that it would rely instead on freelance writers. And after a challenge from Stephen King, The Portland Press Herald in Maine said it would bring back its local book reviews if the author and his followers brought in 100 new subscriptions. They brought in twice that.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Electric vehicles will be a hot topic at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, which opens to the news media and industry executives today and to the public on Saturday.Automakers are preparing to introduce dozens of electric cars and hybrid vehicles over the next few years, the NYT’s Neal Boudette writes. But to sell those cars, they will have to attract a new class of customer:The longest government shutdown in American history, dragging into its 24th day today, could become a side note in an “all-out political war for survival,” as President Trump faces intensifying concerns about his relationship with Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. The NYT’s Peter Baker writes:In recent days, The Washington Post found that President Trump had repeatedly tried to hide details of his conversations with Mr. Putin. The NYT reported on the F.B.I.’s counterintelligence investigation of Mr. Trump, which was initiated after he fired James Comey as F.B.I. director and questioned whether he had been influenced by Russia.Asked in an interview on Fox News on Saturday night if he was a Russian agent, President Trump said it was “the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked.” He did not issue an explicit denial.The new Democratic House majority has seized on the revelations, adding another pressure point in President Trump’s strained relationship with Congress. Negotiations to end the shutdown, at a standstill over President Trump’s demand for border wall funding, could end up on the back burner, even as contagion effects seep through the economy.• As a result of the shutdown, 800,000 federal workers are either furloughed or working without pay, and many are filing for unemployment benefits. NASA laboratories, Smithsonian museums and other sites in Washington are empty. There are fewer food inspections, longer airport security lines and more trash in those national parks that are still open.• Air traffic controllers working without pay in New York on Friday received a pizza delivery from colleagues in Canada.• More than 300 small-business loans — or nearly $200 million in capital — are not being approved each day.• Contract workers, who will most likely not be reimbursed for unpaid wages, may be especially hard hit.• Wall Street deals that require national security reviews or approval from antitrust regulators will have to wait.• GoFundMe will refund more than $20 million in donations raised to help fund the border wall. The campaign organizer, Brian Kolfage, had initially promised to return the funds if the effort fell short of its $1 billion goal.This week brings quarterly results from major banks, with Citigroup reporting today, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo tomorrow, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday and Morgan Stanley on Thursday.The last three months of 2018 were rough for the six financial giants, which lost more than $200 billion in value amid a record stock sell-off. The new year has only intensified nervousness over slowing global growth while providing a steady drumbeat of unimpressive holiday sales, and slashed revenue and profit forecasts.Risk aversion in the market has cramped liquidity, leading to increased warnings about volatility fueled by automated trading programs. And the effect of the 2017 tax overhaul is waning, putting companies in the difficult position of comparing their current lackluster results with their strong performance after the law first went into effect.The cavalcade of data demonstrating China’s slowing economic growth continues, with the largest drop in exports in two years.Analysts had expected the Chinese government to report a gain in outbound shipments for December. Instead, the dollar value of exports slumped 4.4 percent from a year earlier, as Chinese electronics and other products struggled to excite international consumers.Imports fell 7.6 percent; domestic demand for goods is weakening, with car sales contracting for the first time in more than two decades last year, and sliding 13 percent last month in the sixth straight month of declines.The figures underscored a recent refrain on Wall Street: China’s powerhouse economic engine is sputtering.• China’s overall trade surplus is at its lowest level since 2013. However, even amid a bitter trade feud with the Trump administration, China’s surplus with the United States is the largest it has been in more than a decade, with exports from China growing 11.3 percent last year, compared with a 0.7 percent increase in imports from the U.S.• But China’s foreign direct investment in North America and Europe has slumped to a six-year low. American regulators are intensifying their oversight of deals with Chinese companies, and Chinese officials have tightened the flow of funds overseas. Chinese investment in the U.S. fell 83 percent last year, while its investments in Canada surged 80 percent.• Foreign companies continue to complain about barriers in China. Applications submitted by Visa and Mastercard to process renminbi payments have been largely ignored by China’s central bank, according to the FT.• Equity markets in Asia and Europe slipped on hearing on of the unexpected contraction in exports.Michael Bloomberg’s publisher recently released a revised edition of his 1997 book, “Bloomberg by Bloomberg,” and Andrew notes that it offers some nuggets about the roles of government and philanthropy that could become talking points on the campaign trail if he runs for president in 2020.• “Philanthropy has traditionally been thought of as an alternative to government — and in some cases, it is. But I also see it as a way to embolden government.”• “There are powerful disincentives working against government innovation, because innovation involves risk, and risk involves the potential for failure. And if there’s one thing that scares politicians — not to mention their political advisers — it’s failure.”• “The second disincentive working against innovation in government is more understandable: fiduciary duty. As an elected official, you are responsible for spending taxpayers’ dollars wisely, and it can be hard to justify spending the public’s money on an untested idea, especially when budgets are already stretched thin. That’s where philanthropy comes in.”NBC and Megyn Kelly reached a final agreement on Friday to part ways, nearly three months after she wondered aloud on-air why it was inappropriate for white people to dress up in blackface for Halloween.

326,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has latched on to the idea of using steel to build his wall along the southern border, praising himself for fulfilling two campaign promises at once: keeping out illegal immigrants and resuscitating a struggling industry.“They were doing very poorly when I took office, and now they’re doing very well,” Mr. Trump said of American steel makers before boarding Marine One this month. “Our steel industry was dying, and now it’s very vibrant.”But in the 10 months since the Trump administration imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel imports, prices in the United States have now fallen back to levels last seen before the tariffs were announced on March 1.Hiring in the steel sector remains stagnant, in part because new mills have become more reliant on automation. Even with the opening and restarting of several mills last year, direct steel industry employment was 146,300 as of November — 4 percent lower than it was four years ago, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. Industry analysts estimate that steel companies made 50 announcements of plans for new mills and investments last year and that three dozen plants were built or restarted.Investors are increasingly wary about the industry’s long-term strength. Stock prices for some of the nation’s biggest steel manufacturers dropped by as much as 47 percent in 2018 amid fears of slowing global economic growth and the potential for Mr. Trump to reach trade deals that remove the tariffs.“We fully expect the players in the steel supply chain to have weaker years in 2019,” said Philip Gibbs, a metals analyst at KeyBanc in Ohio.The Trump administration imposed sweeping steel and aluminum tariffs on trading partners like Europe, Canada, Japan and Mexico, saying it was trying to protect American security by preventing a flood of cheap metals into the United States. The tariffs, which went fully into effect in June, initially goosed steel prices in the United States, which jumped more than 50 percent after it became clear that the tariffs would really be put in place.Mr. Trump has routinely pointed to the rising prices as a boon to American steel companies. But the price spike ultimately hurt demand as industries that rely on the metal, like automakers and homebuilders, struggled to absorb the rising costs or passed them on to customers.Caterpillar, the farm equipment manufacturer, said last year that it would face $200 million in additional costs because of the steel tariffs. General Motors slashed its profits forecast for 2018 because of higher steel costs. Many businesses chose alternative materials or delayed investments, putting pressure on steel prices, which have since fallen.According to S&P Global Platts, prices for American-made hot-rolled coil steel, the industry benchmark, jumped 41 percent in the first half of 2018 and then fell about 21 percent from that peak in the second half of the year. That trend is likely to continue this year.“Steel prices remain under pressure to begin 2019,” said Michael Fitzgerald, a metals pricing specialist at S&P Global Platts. “Typical seasonal improvements following the slower holiday period are yet to take hold as domestic steel buyers no longer fear a supply crunch.”American businesses and trade groups have repeatedly urged the Trump administration to remove the tariffs, arguing they hurt domestic companies, not competitors, and will ultimately undercut economic growth.“Tariffs are taxes paid for by American families and American businesses — not foreigners,” said Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.American steel makers are feeling the pressure. Despite strong earnings in 2018, the stock prices of steel companies have been in a deep slump as investors fret that they are being propped up by government support that will be temporary. In the last year, shares of AK Steel are down 56 percent, US Steel is down 46 percent, Steel Dynamics is down 29 percent and Nucor’s stock is down 18 percent.John J. Ferriola, the chief executive of Nucor, said that the falling stock price is head-scratching because he believes that the industry is on solid footing. While Mr. Trump’s tariffs have provided a “tailwind,” a strong economy, tax cuts and anti-dumping measures put in place by the Obama administration have revived the steel industry, Mr. Ferriola said.“There’s a lot of doomsday talk about the tariffs and a lot of misinformation,” Mr. Ferriola said in an interview. “I keep hearing about how it is driving down demand and putting our customers out of business. We had a record year last year, and many of our customers also had a record year.”Nucor announced last week that it plans to build a $1.35 billion steel plant in the Midwest. However, trade experts and steel analysts worry the additional capacity could drive down steel prices even further and question whether such projects will eventually be scrapped if the economy cools.A key for the industry will be improving efficiency while the insulation from the tariffs remains.“Historically the U.S. steel industry has received a tremendous amount of trade protection over the last 40 years in different forms,” said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The issue is that during the periods that they do receive protection, they don’t historically tend to invest in becoming more efficient and more competitive.”In the near term, the steel industry’s best hopes for a meaningful lift would be Mr. Trump and Congress joining forces on major infrastructure legislation that would keep America’s steel mills churning.With such movement unlikely amid partisan gridlock in Washington, some are hanging their hopes on the possibility of a border wall built with steel slats or, as Mr. Trump recently suggested, “steel that has concrete inside.” According to an analysis conducted by the American Iron and Steel Institute, the industry’s lobbying group, an all-steel barrier along the border could consume as much as three million tons of steel.“If they decide to build a barrier and decide to make it out of steel, the industry stands ready and capable and more than able to provide the steel and assist in the construction,” Mr. Ferriola said."
327,"Good Thursday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.Trade talks between midlevel American and Chinese officials, extended from a planned two days to three, ended yesterday in Beijing after negotiators made progress but released few details.What happened: According to U.S. officials, negotiators discussed intellectual property protections, so-called forced tech transfer and China’s promise to buy “substantial” amounts of American agricultural, energy and manufacturing products. China’s commerce ministry spoke of “extensive, in-depth and meticulous exchanges.” Wang Qishan, China’s vice president, said today that the two countries “must adapt to the new reality, keep looking for and expanding our common interests, deepening and promoting practical cooperation.”What’s next: No date or location is set for the next round of talks. Higher-level discussions could occur in Davos, Switzerland, if President Trump attends the World Economic Forum meeting there, starting Jan. 22. But he may cancel if the partial government shutdown is not resolved by then. China’s economic czar is expected to visit Washington sometime after that. The Trump administration has set a March 2 deadline to wrap up negotiations, after which it says it could raise tariffs.What’s at stake: If China and the U.S. let tensions escalate and investors pull back, “you’re looking at enough of a tightening in financial conditions to say that a global recession is a real risk,” Peter Hooper, a former Federal Reserve official and Deutsche Bank’s chief economist, told Bloomberg.President Trump wants to calm volatile financial markets. And China’s leader, Xi Jinping, needs to perk up a slowing economy. A measure of factory prices in China last month showed the slowest increase since late 2016. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told Bloomberg Television yesterday that there is “pretty clear evidence that things have slowed down a fair amount in China.”“There are a lot of grounds for concern,” he added.What else: • Auto importers in the Chinese port city of Tianjin are rushing to get American-made cars through customs, taking advantage of a temporary cut in the 40 percent tariff that Beijing imposed on them last July.• Amid suspicion from the F.B.I. and American universities, China is going quiet about its “Thousand Talents Program,” which has attracted thousands of scientists and experts to the country since 2008.• The Hang Seng stock index in Hong Kong recorded its best day in more than a month yesterday and closed on its fifth straight rally today. U.S. equities also rose, though not as much as in recent days.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Welcome to Day 20 of the shutdown, which could become the longest in history on Saturday. Yesterday, President Trump stormed out of a meeting with congressional leaders, throwing what Democrats described as a “temper tantrum” over his demand to fund a border wall, a key sticking point in talks to reopen the government. On Twitter, he called the session “a total waste of time.” The NYT writes:Today, President Trump will visit the border in McAllen, Tex. Yesterday, he reiterated a threat to invoke emergency powers to fund his wall without congressional approval. That, writes Charlie Savage in the NYT, “would be an extraordinary violation of constitutional norms — and establish a precedent for presidents who fail to win approval for funding a policy goal.”Some consequences of the stalemate:• In Washington, one of the richest areas in the country, it’s affecting retailers, tourist centers, salons, garbage bins and more.• Nationwide, restaurants struggling with a severe worker shortage said they will continue hiring even though they can no longer check recruits’ immigration status online.• Coast Guard employees received a five-page tip sheet suggesting that they could stay afloat without their paychecks through garage sales, babysitting, dog-walking, serving as “mystery shoppers” or, as a last resort, declaring bankruptcy.• This was expected to be a banner year for I.P.O.s. But with work halted at regulators, it could be only the fourth year since 1995 when no major company goes public in January. Other deals, including CVS’s purchase of Aetna, could also be delayed.Two Federal Reserve officials said yesterday that the central bank should assess economic conditions before it considers raising rates again. And they did so as the Fed released the minutes of its December meeting, showing that it reached the same conclusion.The takeaway: Central bank officials are now not likely to raise the benchmark interest rate at their January meeting nor at one in mid-March, writes the NYT’s Binyamin Appelbaum. But they still expect strong enough economic growth to justify increases this year.The reaction: Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, was criticized for not saying more to soothe investors in December. “He could have handled that differently, and better,” one economist said. The dollar fell to a three-month low against the euro after the meeting minutes were released.The next step: The Fed is considering options to keep interest rates in its target range. One approach would be to slow the decline of bank reserves in the system.Theresa May, Britain’s prime minister, is getting backed into a corner over Brexit — and she knows it.Her plans for how Britain’s departure from the European Union will play out are strongly expected to be rejected by Parliament in a vote next week — two and a half years after Britons voted to leave the bloc in a referendum, and a month after this vote was first scheduled.Yesterday, lawmakers moved to block Mrs. May from stalling further. They have also passed a measure aimed at making it harder for the government to exit the E.U. without a deal.The withdrawal is scheduled for March 29. Many are concerned that, without an agreement with Brussels in place, economic chaos could ensue. Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, meets with Mrs. May today, and automakers such as Honda, Nissan and Toyota, which manufacture in Britain for export into continental Europe, are pushing him to press the case against a no-deal Brexit.Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, pushed for fresh elections if Parliament turns down Mrs. May’s plan. The British public is still deeply conflicted over the E.U., as shown in these charts from Bloomberg.President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has embraced a pro-labor program of higher wages and taxes, but the early results have been discouraging, writes the NYT’s Michael Schuman.Growth has slowed, unemployment has risen and small-business owners are complaining. The troubles suggest South Korea’s limits in solving economic problems, especially without addressing underlying structural issues. Rapid changes like Mr. Moon’s can also have unintended consequences. The biggest is the strain on small businesses, which are often unable to pass on higher costs to their customers.U.S.-North Korea talks:  A second summit meeting between the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Trump to negotiate the terms of denuclearizing the North is “close,” Mr. Moon said today after Mr. Kim’s visit to China this week. He added that North Korea should take more concrete steps to secure U.S. concessions.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles will pay nearly $650 million to settle lawsuits over illegal software that allowed diesel vehicles to thwart emissions tests and release higher levels of pollutants, according to the NYT.The settlement, which is expected to be announced today, does not include an admission of guilt by the company or a declaration of wrongdoing by the Environmental Protection Agency. Earlier, the agency found that Fiat used technology that could turn off pollution controls under certain driving conditions.The Justice Department sued Fiat over the issue in 2017. The company will recall 104,000 diesel-powered Ram 1500 trucks and Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicles to install new software.Other auto news: • Tesla’s chief, Elon Musk, wrote on Twitter yesterday that it will stop selling the cheapest versions of its Model S sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle from Monday, and suggested that the upcoming Roadster sports car might be able to levitate.• Rolls-Royce had record sales last year, as wealthy buyers spent some of their gains from the Trump administration’s tax cuts.• Toyota is recalling 1.7 million vehicles in North America, 1.3 million in the U.S., to replace potentially lethal Takata front passenger airbag inflaters.• The Pixar co-founder John Lasseter, who resigned from Disney in June after complaints about unwanted touching, will build an animation production company affiliated with Paramount.

328,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has proved himself adroit at creating villains to serve as his political foils. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, he introduced a new one: socialists.Right after his calls to support the overthrow of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and condemning the “socialist policies” that have reduced the country “into a state of abject poverty and despair,” he made a quick segue to the home front.“Here in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” the president said, adding, “Tonight, we resolve that America will never be a socialist country.”Tuesday night’s speech contained more than a few suggestions of what Mr. Trump’s 2020 campaign could look like. The president dwelled on the economy, pointing to the low unemployment rate, continuing growth and the tax cut passed by the last Republican Congress. He spoke of trying to reduce prescription drug costs and battling H.I.V., perhaps with an eye to the kinds of suburban female voters who deserted Republicans in the midterm elections. And for his hard-core followers, he argued for the border wall.The threat of socialism was something new. But it could become the kind of rhetorical touchstone of his re-election campaign that sounding the alarm about “criminal illegal aliens” was in 2016.If it does, it could provide Mr. Trump with a potentially effective weapon in confronting an increasingly aggressive and more liberal Democratic Party, defining it through attacks on Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who describe themselves as democratic socialists, and other members of the party pushing progressive policies like a 70 percent tax rate and “Medicare for all.”The president’s economic advisers began sounding the socialist alarm in the fall in a 72-page report criticizing what it described as the socialist ideas of leading Democrats, linking them with the failed economic policies of communist governments in China, the former Soviet Union and other countries. The word “socialism” appeared 144 times — on average, twice a page.The report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, “The Opportunity Costs of Socialism,” did not prescribe any action but was meant to serve as a warning about the destructive economic policies that Mr. Trump believes Democrats would inflict on the United States.Policies like tuition-free college were mentioned in the same ominous tone as the atrocities committed by Vladimir Lenin and Mao Zedong. The report suggested that Democratic policies emulating Venezuela would cause the American economy to shrink by 40 percent, just as Mr. Trump did on Tuesday night.Yet there is no evidence of any growing public angst about socialism sweeping the United States. As a political philosophy and organizing tool, it took modest root in the country in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but never gained widespread appeal. Eugene V. Debs, a labor leader from Terre Haute, Ind., was a five-time candidate for president, never to great effect, peaking at 6 percent of the vote in 1912.“You really have not had a self-consciously socialist movement of any size and influence since the 1930s,” said Michael Kazin, a professor of history at Georgetown University and the author of a history of the American left. “Clearly this is an attempt to portray Democrats as too radical for Americans and to connect them to Venezuela, which is of course a clever thing do since Venezuela is falling apart under an ostensibly socialist government.”But the supposed threat of creeping socialism — and the dangers posed by someone like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez — have become favorite talking points for conservatives like the TV personality Sean Hannity of Fox News, who tells his viewers that far-left socialism had taken over the Democratic Party. Mr. Trump is now firmly aligned with that view.“Most Americans are obviously not up on the distinctions between democratic socialists and communists,” Mr. Kazin said. “He, like other conservatives who had talked about the so-called Red Menace over the years, is trying to confuse the two things in people’s minds.”But that is not how conservatives look at the way Mr. Trump seems ready to portray Democrats.“From a political standpoint, he is defending free enterprise, free markets and freedom,” said Greg Mueller, a conservative strategist. “They want to take the country toward socialism and their party is divided on that and there is a major fight in their party over whether to be a socialist party.“This is a great debate for Trump to define in 2019 and the 2020 campaign,” he added.Republicans, with limited success, tried at times to label President Barack Obama a socialist, particularly for his call for higher taxes on the wealthy, Mr. Kazin said, noting that this effort coincided with a shift in public opinion where Americans viewed socialism more favorably.But a Gallup poll in August showed that Democrats had a more positive view of socialism than they do of capitalism, 57 percent to 47 percent. Their view has been relatively stable since 2010, but attitudes toward capitalism have become more negative, coinciding with the financial crisis that fueled animus toward the large banks and investment firms blamed for the economic devastation.Among Americans ages 18 to 29, the Gallup poll found, 51 percent were positive about socialism while 45 percent viewed capitalism favorably. Gallup noted there was a marked, 12-point decline in younger adults views on capitalism is just two years.“Every single policy proposal that we have adopted and presented to the American people has been overwhelmingly popular,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez told MSNBC late Tuesday. And she dismissed Mr. Trump’s criticism. “He feels himself losing on the issues,” she said, and now must engage in ad hominem attacks.But it was no accident that Mr. Trump chose to introduce the socialist menace in perhaps the highest-profile setting available to a president as the first step in trying to paint Democrats as too far left, just as they start to engage in a presidential nominating process that will shape the party’s image.And even some of the president’s harshest critics say he may be on to something.“The idea of throwing the socialist thing out there politically is pretty crafty because, truly, there is just enough truth in there to make it sticky and interesting,” said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist and longtime Trump critic. “They are lurching left. For once, somehow, a little honesty crept into one of Trump’s proclamations. It’s code for the loony left.”"
329,"WASHINGTON — A defiant President Trump declared on Thursday that he has all but given up on negotiating with Congress over his border wall and will build it on his own even as he dismissed any suggestions of wrongdoing in the investigations that have ensnared his associates.In an interview in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump called the talks “a waste of time” and indicated he will most likely take action on his own when they officially end in two weeks. At the same time, he expressed optimism about reaching a trade deal with China and denied being at odds with his intelligence chiefs.“I think Nancy Pelosi is hurting our country very badly by doing what she’s doing and, ultimately, I think I’ve set the table very nicely,” Mr. Trump said. He made no mention of closing the government again, a move that backfired on him, but instead suggested he plans to declare a national emergency to build the wall. “I’ve set the table,” he said. “I’ve set the stage for doing what I’m going to do.”Addressing a wide range of subjects, Mr. Trump brushed off the investigations that have consumed so much of his presidency, saying that his lawyers have been reassured by the departing deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, that the president himself was not a target. “He told the attorneys that I’m not a subject, I’m not a target,” Mr. Trump said. But even if that is the case, it remains unknown whether the matter would be referred to the House for possible impeachment hearings.[Read excerpts from the interview with the president.]Mr. Trump added that he never spoke with Roger J. Stone Jr., his longtime associate who was indicted last week, about WikiLeaks and the stolen Democratic emails it posted during the 2016 election, nor did he direct anyone to do so.“No, I didn’t. I never did,” he said of speaking with Mr. Stone on the subject. Did he ever instruct anyone to get in touch with Mr. Stone about WikiLeaks? “Never did,” he repeated.The president dismissed the importance of the proposed Trump Tower his team was seeking to build in Moscow at the height of the 2016 campaign, and he denied his own current lawyer’s account of how late in the campaign he was still discussing the project. He also denied that his Twitter messages about former associates who are cooperating with prosecutors amount to witness tampering.Mr. Trump said he played no role in directing White House officials to arrange for Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, to receive a top-secret clearance. Mr. Kushner’s application was rejected at least once after concerns were raised by the F.B.I. about his foreign contacts. The C.I.A., which also raised concerns, has continued to deny him access to “sensitive compartmentalized information.”The interview with Mr. Trump came on a busy day at the White House as the president seeks to rebound from the 35-day partial government shutdown that failed to force Democrats to finance his wall and took a toll on his poll numbers. With most Americans blaming him for the standoff, Mr. Trump expressed frustration that he has not gotten credit for what he sees as his accomplishments, including deregulation, increased military spending and nuclear talks with North Korea.Fresh from a meeting on trade with China’s vice premier, Mr. Trump seemed relaxed and confident as he sought to make his case, distributing handouts including, at one point, printed copies of two tweets sent out in his name even as he was speaking with his visitors.The interview was arranged after Mr. Trump reached out to A. G. Sulzberger, the publisher of The New York Times, and invited him for an off-the-record dinner. Mr. Sulzberger declined, saying he would prefer an on-the-record interview that included two of his reporters. The president agreed.Mr. Trump sat behind the Resolute Desk, sipping periodically from a glass of Diet Coke with ice cubes floating in it and resting on a gold coaster. His acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney; his senior communications adviser, Bill Shine; and his press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, sat in on the session with Mr. Sulzberger and the two reporters.Mr. Trump spoke with a low voice, his arms folded tightly during questions about the Russia inquiry as his aides grew fidgety. But he was more good-humored at other points. He grew most animated when condemning media coverage he considers unfair.[Read the president’s comments about the news media, which, in lengthy and at times contradictory remarks, he deemed “important” and “beautiful,” but also “so bad” and “unfair.”]He disputed persistent reports of dysfunction in the White House, noting that members of his staff write up summaries of kiss-and-tell books that have been published for him to peruse. “I have somebody — boom boom, they give me the quotes.”At one point, he scoffed at the notion that he was making money from the presidency, calling the job a “loser” financially.“I lost massive amounts of money doing this job,” he said. “This is not the money. This is one of the great losers of all time. You know, fortunately, I don’t need money. This is one of the great losers of all time. But they’ll say that somebody from some country stayed at a hotel. And I’ll say, ‘Yeah.’ But I lose, I mean, the numbers are incredible.”Still, he rejected speculation that he might not run for re-election next year. “I love this job,” he said. And he said he did not think he would face a challenger for the his party’s presidential nomination, even though several Republicans are considering running. “I don’t see it,” he said. “I have great support in the party.”Watching the emerging Democratic field, Mr. Trump said the opposition party has “really drifted far left,” and he derided Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as damaged while expressing admiration for the campaign kickoff of Senator Kamala Harris of California, who drew thousands of supporters.“I would say the best opening so far would be Kamala Harris,” he said, pronouncing it “Kameela.” “I would say in terms of the opening act, I would say, would be her.” He added, “A better crowd — better crowd, better enthusiasm.”“Some of the others were very flat,” he added. “I do think Elizabeth Warren’s been hurt very badly with the Pocahontas trap,” he added, using a favorite slur to refer to the senator’s effort to prove she has Native American heritage. “I think she’s been hurt badly. I may be wrong, but I think that was a big part of her credibility, and now all of a sudden it’s gone.”The president had tough words as well for Ms. Pelosi, who has adamantly refused to approve even a dollar of the $5.7 billion he has sought for his border wall, which she has denounced as “immoral.” Mr. Trump had gambled that he could force her to back down through the government shutdown and was vexed when he could not.“I’ve actually always gotten along with her, but now I don’t think I will anymore,” Mr. Trump said. “I think she’s doing a tremendous disservice to the country. If she doesn’t approve a wall, the rest of it’s just a waste of money and time and energy because it’s desperately needed.”Mr. Trump has been considering an emergency declaration to spend money on a wall even without congressional approval, an action that even some Republicans have objected to and that would certainly draw a court challenge. “I’ll continue to build the wall and we’ll get the wall finished,” he said. “Now whether or not I declare a national emergency — that you’ll see.”The president defended his decisions to pull troops out of Syria and draw down forces in Afghanistan on the same day that the Senate advanced a Republican-sponsored measure condemning a “precipitous withdrawal” from those two countries. “I got elected on saying we’re getting out of these endless wars,” he said.Given that, however, Mr. Trump did not explain why he has taken such an assertive stance in trying to force out President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, even leaving open a military option, while not criticizing other autocratic countries like Saudi Arabia. “I’m just saying this: Terrible things are going on,” he said. “Terrible things are going on in Venezuela.”“Now in Saudi Arabia, a lot of improvement has been made in Saudi Arabia,” he said, while adding that the assassination of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was “a terrible crime.”On another point of contention, the president noted that he summoned his intelligence chiefs, including Dan Coats, the national intelligence director, to the White House on Thursday because he had heard they had contradicted his foreign policy during testimony this week to Congress. Mr. Coats and the others told lawmakers that North Korea was unlikely to give up its nuclear arsenal, that Iran has not restarted work to build one and that the Islamic State was not defeated, all assessments that clash with the president’s worldview.But Mr. Trump said the intelligence chiefs told him their presentation was misinterpreted. “They said, ‘Sir, our testimony was totally mischaracterized,’” Mr. Trump said. “I said, ‘What are you talking about?’ And when you read their testimony and you read their statements, it was mischaracterized by the media.” Even though he had assailed the chiefs earlier in the week, he said, “I’m happy with Dan Coats.”Mr. Trump said he has likewise received reassurances from Mr. Rosenstein, who until Attorney General Jeff Sessions was fired in November was overseeing the Russia investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.“Rod told me I’m not a target of the investigation,” he said at one point, but then later suggested he had not talked with him directly. “The lawyers ask him. They say, ‘He’s not a target of the investigation.’” Asked if that also covered the separate investigation by federal prosecutors in New York, he said, “I don’t know about that.”Neither Mr. Rosenstein nor Mr. Mueller has said whether Mr. Trump is a target, and the president could not recall when Mr. Rosenstein would have assured him. Mr. Mueller has been known to explore whether the president’s actions amounted to obstruction of justice. But since Justice Department policy bars indicting a sitting president, it is unclear whether the term “target” would apply.Mr. Trump denied having anything to do with Mr. Stone’s involvement with WikiLeaks, which during the 2016 campaign posted Democratic emails online that were stolen by Russian intelligence services. He expressed sympathy for Mr. Stone for his arrest at the hands of heavily armed F.B.I. agents.“I’ve always liked — I like Roger, he’s a character,” Mr. Trump said, insisting that the F.B.I. agents charging “a house like they did at six o’clock in the morning. I think that was a very sad thing for this country.”Mr. Trump offered a vague account of his involvement in the proposed Moscow project. Michael D. Cohen, his former personal lawyer, has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the project and told the authorities that talks continued into the summer of 2016, even as Mr. Trump was securing the Republican nomination.Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s current lawyer, said recently that talks went all the way through the November election, only to later claim that he was mistaken and speaking only hypothetically.“He was wrong,” Mr. Trump said on Thursday. “Rudy has been wrong a little bit. But what has happened is this: I didn’t care. That deal was not important. It was essentially a letter of intent or an option.”Asked when in 2016 the last conversation he had about the project was, he said, “I would say it was early to middle of the year. Now, I don’t know that Cohen didn’t go a little bit longer than that. I don’t think it would be much longer.” He added: “I was running for president; I was doing really well. The last thing I cared about was building a building.”Mr. Cohen has been the focus of Mr. Trump’s ire lately, including hostile tweets that his former lawyer and others interpreted as threats. Among other things, the president has written that the authorities should be looking into Mr. Cohen’s father-in-law.“It’s not witness tampering,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s not witness tampering at all.”Asked what the point was then, he said, “I think people have the right to speak their mind. You know, speaking your mind. I’ve heard that for a period of time. But other people have said it, too. I mean, many people have said it.”Mr. Trump denied that he was upset to see William P. Barr, his nominee for attorney general, attest to his long relationship with Mr. Mueller during his confirmation hearing and commit to letting the special counsel finish his investigation. “I did hear the statement and it was totally acceptable to me,” the president said.He said he was not initially aware that Mr. Barr, as a private lawyer, had drafted a memo criticizing Mr. Mueller’s possible approach to obstruction of justice. “I mean, I read it afterwards,” he said. “But I did not know.” He added, “I never read the memo.”"
330,"KODIAK, Alaska — The morning after more than 40,000 Coast Guard members missed their first paycheck, and the federal government’s shutdown stretched into its fourth week, Eleanor King placed an empty jar next to her diner’s cash register.In scribbled black marker, a sign on the jar, written in all capital letters, read: Donation Coast Guard. By 9 a.m. on Wednesday, nearly an hour before a rainy winter sunrise, the jar held $120 — money with which patrons were effectively buying meals for members of the maritime force.While the shutdown has affected hundreds of thousands of federal workers across the United States, halting paychecks and furloughing those who have been deemed nonessential personnel, it has brought a particular chill to Kodiak, a small town of 6,300 on an isolated island in the Gulf of Alaska.Roughly a quarter of the island’s population is either an employee or dependent family member of the Coast Guard, which has now had to scale back some of its operations in one of the world’s most dangerous waterways.A high cost of living is common to communities in the Alaskan wilderness, but the Coast Guard contingent in Kodiak makes the town especially vulnerable to the drought in federal cash. Local businesses like Ms. King’s diner are losing money daily even while trying to help.Kodiak’s predicament is a result of President Trump’s political fight with Congress over $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall, forcing the government to shut down and leaving a series of agency budget bills unfinished. That included funding for the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of the Coast Guard.“This impacts everyone,” Ms. King said. Like some of the other businesses in Kodiak, her diner is giving a 10 percent discount to Coast Guard members; the donations from her jar help pay for meals.The Coast Guard is the only branch of the military that is part of an otherwise completely civilian agency. It was created to enforce maritime laws and conduct rescue operations at sea, but it can be ordered to protect the United States from foreign threats during war or conflicts.That the Coast Guard is going without pay during the shutdown is “the first time in our nation’s history that service members in a U.S. armed force have not been paid during a lapse in government appropriations,” Adm. Karl L. Schultz, the Coast Guard commandant, said in a statement on Tuesday. If the shutdown continues, Coast Guard retirees will also not be paid at the end of the month.Jed A. Bergstrom, who runs a food bank at a Baptist mission community center in Kodiak, said a Coast Guard family showed up at his door the day after service members were supposed to be paid.Residents are donating fish and game from their freezers to their neighbors. Big Al’s Take and Bake, another restaurant in the area, sent more than 30 pizzas to a food bank on the Coast Guard base. They quickly disappeared.Alexandra’s Salon, a hair styling shop, is giving i.o.u.s to clients instead of making them pay, and the Alutiiq museum, focused on the community’s native heritage, has waived its $7 entry free.But eventually, said Mayor Patricia B. Branson, if the government does not reopen soon, the business owners and landlords will have to find a way to get paid.“I think it’s important that the people in the faraway land D.C. understand what’s going on in a small town,” she said. “And how people are affected by all this nonsense.”Legislation that was introduced earlier this month by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, known as the Pay Our Coast Guard Act, has gained support in Congress in recent days. But its fate, at least in the short term, remains unclear.Other organizations have raised funds to help Coast Guard families, including a $15 million donation from the USAA financial services company.Flush with greenery and emerald water in the summer, while cold and wet in the winter, Kodiak is economically supported by the Coast Guard base, one of the largest in the United States. The town is also dependent on its fishing port, which often oscillates between being the second- and third-most prosperous in the country.The fishing industry off Alaska’s coast rakes in more than $4 billion annually, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. But with most of that service also closed, Kodiak’s primary economic driver might soon be in jeopardy.For now, though, little has changed. The fishing season for pollock opened this week in the northern Pacific, and the Coast Guard moved a MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter and its Kodiak-based crew hundreds of miles to a small base in the Aleutian Islands to help, if need be, with search-and-rescue missions.Still, the Coast Guard has had to stop some of its law enforcement missions in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. Some routine patrols have been halted, as has the practice, in at least some cases, of boarding fishing boats to ensure that crews are following maritime laws.“Generally, activities have been scaled back if it doesn’t support life and property or the protection of national security,” said Lt. Brian Dykens, a Coast Guard spokesman.Besides search and rescue, and unlike air stations in the mainland United States, the Coast Guard missions in Alaska often include medically evacuating people from remote areas — as aircrews have done at least seven times since the shutdown began.In the winter, the Bering Sea is known for its hurricanelike weather and 50-foot waves. It has claimed the lives of dozens of fishermen in recent years.Salt water, battering winds and constant strain ensure that Coast Guard aircraft need constant maintenance. The flights that are based in Kodiak are responsible for covering four million square miles of coastline and ocean.But with hundreds of civilians on furlough, a backlog of repair requests are quickly accruing at the Coast Guard’s primary maintenance hub in North Carolina. Already, active-duty Coast Guard mechanics are filling in for their furloughed civilian colleagues at the Kodiak Air Station.If it drags on, the ability of the force to initiate the most rudimentary search-and-rescue missions are at risk of being hampered, said one Coast Guard official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the effects of the shutdown. Some of the smaller Coast Guard air stations across the country could close.Lt. Cmdr. Zachary Koehler is among the Coast Guard helicopter pilots in Kodiak who are currently not being paid as they undertake missions over the volatile Bering Sea. He and his wife, Beth, have a son and daughter, both 11, and run Grand Slam, a toy store the family opened in 2017. The store has lost 30 percent in sales this month compared to last January.“In the first couple days, I think everyone thought this wasn’t going to continue,” Ms. Koehler said. “So they kept spending like they usually do. And after that first weekend, it was amazing — it just stopped.”“It hurts,” said Aimee Williams, who spent 12 years in the Coast Guard and is married to a C-130 pilot who is still in the service. “And it’s just going to keep getting worse here until it’s fixed.”"

332,"Last month, when Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, first met with President Trump about funding for a border wall, I wrote an article about the burnt orange MaxMara coat Ms. Pelosi wore when she exited the White House, which had set social media aflame.The story reached a huge audience, but not everyone was happy. One irritated reader tweeted, “Would a man’s suit get this much ink?”Given that I have written about President Trump’s suits, Jeb Bush’s shirtsleeves and Marco Rubio’s shoes, my answer is yes.Another reader, Suzanne Mintz of Kensington, Md., wrote in a letter to the editor: “Shame on you for feeling the need to remind us that although Ms. Pelosi is a highly accomplished politician and fearless leader, what she is wearing is equally important. You owe her and all women an apology.”The issue came up again recently, when the new Congress was sworn in, and Ms. Pelosi officially became speaker of the House.The Times wrote about Ms. Pelosi’s history-making ascendancy and in the course of doing so mentioned the color of her dress (hot pink). The detail also made it into a tweet from a Times account. Readers once more took issue.“I look forward to your headline about Trump having worn a navy suit and red tie at his next press conference, and about McConnell wearing a black suit and blue tie when announcing that he won’t let the Dems’ bill be voted on in the Senate,” read one tweet.I understand where these readers are coming from. There is no question fashion has been used as a tool to dismiss women in the past. But there are reasons my colleagues and I consider what a politician — male or female — wears, well, worthy of consideration.For starters, dress is, without question, an important part of a politician’s tool kit. (It is part of everyone’s tool kit, but for the sake of this discussion let’s just focus on politicians.)In an increasingly visual age, how you look is part of the message you are communicating. That photo of Ms. Pelosi in an orange coat and dark glasses is more effective than any logo at communicating women’s relish at being on the front lines. (The director Barry Jenkins even put it on a sweatshirt, which he is giving away.)I don’t think there’s any question Ms. Pelosi picked a hot pink dress for her swearing-in both because she knew it would make her stand out in what was still a room full of dark suits, and because of the symbolic nature of the occasion: a color traditionally associated with delicate femininity had become a color associated with a seat of power. That’s a strategic and savvy choice, and to take notice of it is to acknowledge the multidimensional chess game Ms. Pelosi is playing, not to demean her.We make instant judgments about each other based on image all the time. It’s human instinct, and part of how we decide if someone is “likable” or “believable” or a “leader,” and it’s part of the way our leaders try to influence our feelings about them.This is true for both men and women. A good friend of mine, a man who is a political crisis consultant (like Olivia Pope on “Scandal”), once told me I would not believe the amount of time he has devoted to discussing tie colors with clients (at their request) when they could have been talking about, say, a peace process.To ignore how public figures use what they wear is to ignore one of the ways our own understanding is being manipulated. I consider it part of my job as The Times’s chief fashion critic to help readers understand how fashion is being used to communicate, in the same way Andrew Ross Sorkin helps us understand economic policy.Admittedly, if this context is missing, that’s our mistake; if we are going to use clothes as a signpost of related substance, that connection should be clear. (That is why we deleted our tweet that referred to Ms. Pelosi’s dress: The context was missing.)To include fashion analysis as a part of a political article would be sexist only if we ignored the policy proposals of female politicians and wrote solely about their clothes, or never wrote about the clothes of male politicians. Neither is the case with our coverage.That being said, in my experience our readers pay much less attention when we write about men and dress. When I wrote about Tim Kaine and his dad look, for example, during the 2016 campaign, it elicited a pretty low response. I have long written about tie color, especially during debates, as well as about the Casual Friday-ization of the White House under President Barack Obama.Granted, there is more opportunity to write about female clothing than male clothing, because there is more variety, but that is part of what makes it interesting. And in many ways, their broader fashion options are a boon for women, not a problem.After years of complaining about people focusing on her clothes, for example, Hillary Clinton turned the attention on her wardrobe into an enormous asset by making it a running joke. (Remember her very first “hard choices” Instagram post about her suits?) This defanged its pejorative power, humanized her and gave supporters a uniform to wear as a badge of solidarity. Can you imagine a man trying to make #PantsuitNation a thing? No one would even know they were looking at anything special.The more we recognize the role clothes play in life and politics, the more we are all willing to talk about it, the more we normalize it, the less potential it has as a weapon in any situation.I’d be interested in hearing your thoughts on this, and would welcome comments; I’ll try to respond to a selection.Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated what the director Barry Jenkins is doing with sweatshirts he made of Nancy Pelosi in an orange coat. He is giving them away, not selling them."
333,"WASHINGTON — There was no golf. There were no meetings. There were no activities, other than a rare visit to church. So President Trump did what he could do: He tweeted.Since his election, Mr. Trump has averaged about 16 tweets per weekend, according to a New York Times analysis of his tweets as collected by the Trump Twitter Archive website. But last weekend proved to be an unusually active 48 hours online for Mr. Trump: From Friday morning to Sunday evening, Mr. Trump tweeted over 50 times, counting the retweets that amplified supporters who have limited public reach on their own.Ensconced in the White House, Mr. Trump saw enemies everywhere, and his tweets reflected that, stoking new tensions and nursing past grievances.He took on “Saturday Night Live,” which on March 16 aired a rerun from Christmas, and suggested that the Federal Communications Commission “look into” late-night shows and examine them for anti-Trump bias. He accused Senator John McCain, who died of brain cancer last year, of collaborating with Democrats and claimed that Mr. McCain, a former prisoner of war, was “last in his class” at the Naval Academy. (Mr. McCain actually graduated fifth from the bottom.) And he defended Tucker Carlson and Jeanine Pirro, the Fox News opinion hosts who have been under fire for making bigoted statements, encouraging Fox executives to “stay strong” in the face of criticism.Mr. Trump’s advisers have shared with him data showing that even his supporters do not like the tweet storms, and have advised him to act more “presidential” as his re-election campaign draws nearer. At rallies, even die-hard Trump fans who arrive early dressed in “MAGA” gear admit that while they are willing to overlook the president’s online musings, they would prefer seeing fewer of them.Mr. Trump often likes to buck the advice he gets, and it was clear over the weekend that he was trusting his gut again, and going his own way.“Stop working soooo hard on being politically correct, which will only bring you down, and continue to fight for our Country,” he said in a tweet on Sunday that appeared to be directed at Fox executives who had temporarily removed Ms. Pirro from her Saturday night slot after she suggested that Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota and one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, may practice Shariah law.“The losers all want what you have, don’t give it to them. Be strong & prosper, be weak & die!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. He also singled out two weekend Fox News anchors, Arthel Neville and Leland Vittert, who are less opinionated than the late-night hosts who double as the president’s personal friends and informal advisers, asking rhetorically whether they were “trained by CNN prior to their ratings collapse.”Later on Sunday, he shared a homemade meme from a little-known Twitter user, who goes by the handle @LonewolfnDuke, which depicted him as “an American president having to fight an American government to protect American citizens.”But it was unclear what had provoked the president’s flurry of activity, and even advisers were searching for the normal cues that set him off: White House officials performing poorly on the Sunday show circuit, or the president’s delayed distillation of negative coverage from the week before.Mr. Trump on Friday was rebuked by Senate Republicans, 12 of whom voted with Democrats against a national emergency to build a border wall. But the border barely figured into Mr. Trump’s weekend tweets, which appeared to be driven more by idle hands and an empty weekend schedule.People who spoke with Mr. Trump on the phone over the weekend said he seemed to be in good spirits. Others who communicated with him said he had spent some time railing privately against Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy F.B.I. director. But they also said he appeared to be a little aimless, and the outpouring seemed to be more driven by a lack of structure. Mr. Trump had skipped his regular weekend trip to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, because of a family commitment that kept him grounded in Washington.There was a four-hour lull in Mr. Trump’s online activity on Sunday, when he left the White House to visit St. John’s Church for St. Patrick’s Day. But for the most part, the president — bored, agitated or both — appeared to spend the weekend online.Mr. Trump shared with his 59.1 million followers a report circulating on right-wing sites that Minnesota Democrats had grown unhappy with Ms. Omar, and accused a “Democrat” union leader in Ohio of standing in the way of putting an idling General Motors plant in the state back into operation.Jack Posobiec, a Trump supporter known for advancing conspiracy theories on Twitter, including “Pizzagate,” marveled that his messages were being retweeted by the leader of the free world. The president shared two tweets initially sent by Mr. Posobiec, one a local news article about an MS-13 gang stabbing, and another criticizing CNN over a segment examining the links between Mr. Trump and white nationalism.“I realize the president’s just reading my Twitter account going through the tweets,” Mr. Posobiec said in a 13-minute video he posted analyzing the experience. “Let’s see what else he’s up to today.”As is often the case, there was a correlation between what appeared on Mr. Trump’s Twitter feed and the programming on Fox News. The weekend tour into conspiracy theories kicked off on Friday, when Mr. Trump elevated a nascent movement that calls itself “Jexodus,” the brainchild of a conservative Jewish activist that describes itself as a group of “proud Jewish millennials tired of living in bondage to leftist politics.”“The ‘Jexodus’ movement encourages Jewish people to leave the Democrat Party,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, although there is no evidence to suggest that Jewish voters have been deserting the party. But Mr. Trump appeared to be reacting to an appearance on “Fox & Friends” by the group’s spokeswoman, Elizabeth Pipko, a former model and Trump 2016 campaign staff member.Brian Ott, who studies the effects of rhetoric at Texas Tech University and is the author of a book studying Mr. Trump’s tweets, said the president appeared to have become less concerned with the consequences of his messaging.“Not only is it already getting worse,” Dr. Ott said, “I don’t think we’ve even seen the tip of the iceberg yet. As these investigations begin to close in on him, really his only play is to stoke vitriol and violence.”Tweeting has also become a normal part of how the president circumvents the news media and his own advisers to communicate to the public what is on his mind. But the weekend whirlwind was so unusual that it created its own mini news cycle, with targets using their own platforms to respond and aides fielding questions from reporters about the president’s mental state.Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, defended him on Monday morning after her husband, George Conway, spent the weekend raising concerns about “Narcissistic Personality Disorder” and said on Twitter that Mr. Trump’s “condition is getting worse.”“No, I don’t share those concerns,” Ms. Conway told reporters outside the White House.Meghan McCain, a host of “The View” and the daughter of Mr. McCain, said the attacks — which included a presidential retweet of a woman who claimed that “Millions of Americans truly LOVE President Trump, not McCain” — only made her feel bad for Mr. Trump’s family.“I can’t imagine having a father that does this on the weekends,” Ms. McCain said."
334,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. President Trump departed for Hanoi, Vietnam, for his second summit meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. Mr. Kim has arrived, after a long, winding train journey. Above, a banner for the meeting.Mr. Trump said he expected a “very tremendous summit,” amid indications that the administration may be preparing to deliver something that Mr. Kim desperately wants: a joint political statement declaring a formal end to the Korean War.Senator Lindsey Graham said in a tweet that the summit meeting was “our last, best chance to end the nuclear conflict with North Korea on peaceful terms.” We took a detailed look at how Mr. Graham, once a Trump skeptic, became the president’s unlikely sidekick._____2. Two major domestic events will be playing out in Washington while President Trump is traveling.On Tuesday, the House is to vote on a resolution to end Mr. Trump’s national emergency, which he declared in order to use expanded powers to funnel money to his promised border wall. More than 25 former Republican lawmakers and nearly 60 former senior national security officials are urging Republicans to sign on, and there could be enough defections to give the measure momentum in the Senate. Above, construction this month on a border fence seen from Tijuana, Mexico.And on Wednesday, when Mr. Trump sits down with Kim Jong-un,  Michael Cohen is to testify in Congress about his 10 years of service to the Trump family.Mr. Cohen is expected to address Mr. Trump’s finances, compliance with campaign finance laws and business matters._____3.  The trade war deadline has been delayed, but it’s not clear for how long.Over the weekend, President Trump halted plans to sharply escalate tariffs on Chinese imports on his March 1 deadline, saying that negotiators were making “substantial progress” and that President Xi Jinping of China would soon join him at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s Florida resort, for a “signing summit.” Above, a U.S. trade delegation meeting with Chinese counterparts last week.But the decision came amid growing concern among his advisers that the “biggest” trade deal in history could end up being modest, if one happens at all, and that Democrats could pounce on the issue in 2020.In China, the trade war and economic troubles have intensified the Communist Party’s chronic fears of social unrest._____4. The stock market has had its best start since 1987.And that is strange, because whole categories of investors have been selling: pension funds and mutual funds, as well as nonprofit groups, endowments, private equity firms, personal trusts and armchair investors.So who is pushing prices higher? In part, the companies themselves.Flush with cash from last year’s tax cuts and a growing economy, they have already bought back more than $190 billion of their own shares — a practice that before the early 1980s was considered a legal gray area._____5. The 91st Academy Awards went off in Los Angeles without a host and largely without a hitch. Oh, except for that controversy over best picture.The Academy is getting intense blowback for giving the honor to “Green Book,” a segregation-era buddy film. What some experienced as a feel-good depiction of people bonding against the odds struck others as retrograde and even bigoted. Our critics Manohla Dargis, A. O. Scott and Wesley Morris discussed the aftermath. Above, the principals of “Green Book” celebrating.Here are the full list of winners and the fashion from the red carpet, a place that has become more welcoming and political._____6. Vice President Mike Pence announced additional sanctions against Venezuela, targeting four officials allied with President Nicolás Maduro. He promised an additional $56 million in aid and urged regional leaders to freeze assets of the state oil company.The sanctions came after efforts to get aid into the country foundered amid scattered deadly violence. Just one truck made it across the border.Meeting in the Colombian capital, Bogotá, with the Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, above left, Mr. Pence said that “the tragic events” had “only steeled” America’s resolve._____7. Britain’s opposition Labour Party said that it was prepared to support a second referendum on withdrawal from the E.U.After the resignations of nine Labour Party members last week, and with more looming, the party’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, above center, dropped his longstanding resistance to a second vote on leaving the bloc. But getting an amendment for a new vote through Parliament any time soon is unlikely.Mr. Corbyn, a lifelong critic of the E.U. and a socialist, has drawn much of his support from disaffected young people in Britain who grew up under austerity and are now turning to trade unionism and socialism._____8. As Democrats seek a path back to the White House in 2020, they are debating whether to redouble efforts in Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that went for President Trump in 2016. Above, Senator Kamala Harris, a presidential contender, campaigning in Iowa on Saturday.The other option is to reach more for Sun Belt states, like Georgia, Florida and even Texas, that have shown flashes of blue.The question goes to the heart of a conflict over the party’s ideology — whether Democrats will become more progressive or more centrist. Candidates who have joined the race so far appear to be trying to do both.Meanwhile, upping the populist theme of her run, Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would no longer hold private fund-raisers and one-on-one meetings with big donors._____9. Now, a matter of universal concern. Scientists have been grappling with a discrepancy in their models of the universe. It appears to be expanding 9 percent faster than previously thought, changing the forecast for the ultimate fate of everything.In the short term, scientists are rewriting cosmic history. They have invoked a new particle and a theoretical force that could have emerged about 100,000 years after the Big Bang, sped up the expansion and then vanished._____10.

335,"To the Editor:Re “Trump Appeals Directly to U.S. for Border Wall” (front page, Jan. 9):In his brief address from the Oval Office of the White House on Tuesday night, President Trump relied on tired stories of immigrant violence that he has often repeated, backed by statistics of dubious validity and delivered in his typically nonemotive style. Mr. Trump’s advisers thought this speech would move the nation and cause a dramatic shift in public sentiment to support the wall or take the onus of the government shutdown off him. They were wrong.Arguably, the speech is simply a sign of his desperation. The man is consumed by an obsessive need to fulfill a campaign pledge punch line. He seems to believe that to abandon the wall might risk losing some of his core base, the same group whose good will he may need to help him overcome a future impeachment challenge.Mr. President, as you have done so many times in your two years as president, your speech further debased the dignity of the office. In the past, Oval Office speeches have been reserved for true national crises, not those manufactured to serve a president’s own political self-interest. As if we really need any more evidence, Mr. Trump once again underscored that he is unfit to occupy the White House.Ken DerowSwarthmore, Pa.To the Editor:Much of President Trump’s Oval Office address focused on the crimes committed by illegal immigrants. We need to remember that wherever you have people, you have sin. Even our outstanding military has a small percentage of personnel who commit crimes while serving overseas. I hope that no one would argue that because of this minuscule minority the military should be forbidden from serving overseas. Therefore, we should be equally sensitive when talking about illegal immigrants. It is wrong to tarnish all because of the crimes of a very small minority.(Rev.) Ian S. MarkhamAlexandria, Va.The writer is the dean and president of Virginia Theological Seminary.To the Editor:Senator Chuck Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi say the border situation is a manufactured crisis. Yet the Democrats have claimed chaos and crises dozens of times since President Trump took office, most of them minor blips long forgotten. Mr. Trump gave the best performance Tuesday night. Usually mocked for his appearance, he looked respectable, focused and earnest. Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi, strangely positioned in a narrow hallway, looked tired, uncomfortable and deer-eyed.Mr. Trump was authentically himself. Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer are just hanging on too long.Mark R. GodburnNorfolk, Conn.To the Editor:The man who sold me my office computer made a lot of unrealistic promises, none of which were fulfilled, and he ended up costing me a lot of money. The man who sold me my car talked me into a lot of needless extras, even though he told me he was doing the opposite. Deception is standard operating procedure in the sales world.Now we have a man in the White House who, after all, got there by being a great salesman. He is trying to sell us something we don’t need just so he can collect his commission, i.e., re-election. I can only hope that people don’t fall for it.Benjamin H. BloomPhiladelphiaTo the Editor:In President Trump’s address to the nation, he stated that migrant children are being used as human pawns by vicious gangs. And that is exactly what Mr. Trump is doing to federal workers, who are receiving no pay during the government shutdown.JoAnn Lee FrankClearwater, Fla.To the Editor:I wonder if President Trump has thought of starting his own GoFundMe page for his wall, as some of his supporters have done. It might save face for him, it would show him who his supporters really are and we could reopen the government.Ganka BrownLaguna Beach, Calif.To the Editor:President Trump has never addressed the nation with such fervor concerning gun control following any of the mass shootings by Americans. It appears that as far as he is concerned, “thoughts and prayers” are enough for those who have lost loved ones to domestic killers. Only those killed by illegal immigrants are worth such public presidential concern.James QuinnLilburn, Ga.To the Editor:Re “Trump Suggests Declaring National Emergency to Skirt Congress on Wall” (news article, Jan. 5): Do we have a national emergency? You bet! Do we need to fix a broken immigration system? Sure, and there is bipartisan support to do so. Is the broken immigration system the national emergency? No. The national emergency is that President Trump has shut down the federal government, causing significant and in some cases irreparable harm to federal workers, private industry that supports the government and our national parks.The national emergency also includes that our system of checks and balances can be upset by one man, Senator Mitch McConnell, refusing to let Congress do its job. The framers of the Constitution never saw this coming. They must be spinning in their graves.Barry LurieBala Cynwyd, Pa.To the Editor:One problem with wall negotiations is they don’t have the right people in the room. They need Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter and Fox News. These are the real parties that can give President Trump permission to accept a House Democratic offer to end the government shutdown. They need to give the president reassurance that he won’t be scolded and punished by far-right conservative media.Mark BradyDix Hills, N.Y. "
336,"WASHINGTON — Republican leaders scrambled to keep rank-and-file members in line ahead of a House vote on Tuesday to kill President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency on the Mexican border, as Democrats appealed to Republicans to protect Congress’s constitutional power to control federal spending.The House’s vote on a declaration of disapproval will force Republicans to choose between the congressional prerogative over federal spending established in the Constitution and a president determined to go around the legislative branch to secure funds for a border wall that Congress has refused to grant.Many Republicans were clearly uneasy with the president’s action, but few were ready to declare their support for legislation overturning it.On Monday, Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, became the second Republican senator to say he would support the Democratic resolution.“There is no intellectual honesty in now turning around and arguing that there’s an imaginary asterisk attached to executive overreach — that it’s acceptable for my party but not thy party,” Mr. Tillis wrote in an opinion article published Monday in The Washington Post.Last week, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she would support a resolution, barring any extraneous additions. Other Republicans were holding their fire.“I wish it wasn’t necessary” for Mr. Trump to have declared a national emergency, said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, arguing that the issue could have been avoided if Democrats had agreed to more funding for physical border barriers.“I think it’s a shame that what should be a nonpartisan issue has turned into obviously a very partisan issue,” he added. “I’m still considering my alternatives.”The resolution is expected to sail through the House on Democratic votes, but significant Republican defections would give it momentum in the Senate and could raise the specter — however remote — that Congress could override Mr. Trump’s promised veto, should the resolution reach his desk.Democrats framed Tuesday’s vote as a referendum on protecting the separation of powers and Congress’s constitutional right to determine federal spending levels — an argument that appealed to several conservatives in both chambers.Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas and the author of the resolution, warned Monday at a news conference that without congressional interference, Mr. Trump would “try this again on other issues,” while Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California expressed confidence that her Republican colleagues’ belief in the separation of powers would push them to support the one-page resolution.“This isn’t about the border,” she said. “This is about the Constitution of the United States.”But Democrats were also making a less lofty case to wavering Republicans. They circulated a list of all of the possible military construction projects in each district that could lose money shifted instead to Mr. Trump’s wall.Several lawsuits have already been filed to challenge the merits of the declaration, but the easiest way for Congress to counter it is through the resolution of disapproval, authorized by the National Emergencies Act of 1976. Once it passes the House, the Senate is required under the law to take it up within 18 days.On Monday, Mr. Trump trained his attention on the Senate, where only four Republican votes are needed to pass the measure, should Democrats remain united, as expected. The president warned Republicans, via Twitter, not to “fall into the Democrats ‘trap’ of Open Borders and Crime!”Several conservative senators have expressed concern that Mr. Trump’s declaration is setting a precedent that could be used by a Democratic president determined to secure funds that Congress will not give.Others have balked at the prospect of siphoning money away from military projects. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa — who said he was “leaning no” on voting for the resolution — suggested that Congress review the power to declare national emergencies granted to the president under the National Emergencies Act.Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, called Mr. Trump’s declaration “unnecessary, unwise and inconsistent with the Constitution.” Yet he declined to say how he would vote on a resolution ending it, telling reporters, “I’m going to wait and see what the resolution says.”In the House, top Republicans were urging their members to focus on what they say is a legitimate need for border security money and the precedent set by other presidents who have declared their own national emergencies, according to one Republican aide.Only one House Republican, Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, has signed on to the resolution to block the declaration, scorning the idea that congressional Republicans who attacked President Barack Obama’s use of executive powers “now cry out for a king to usurp legislative powers.”Top Republicans, including Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, said they were confident that there will be enough support to prevent the two-thirds majority needed to override the veto. But Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the Republican whip, and other members of his vote-counting team were set to lobby for votes against the resolution during a session on Monday night.Democrats’ argument was buoyed by two letters from more than 25 former Republican lawmakers and nearly 60 former senior national security officials, who appealed to Congress to end the national emergency declaration.“It has always been a Republican fundamental principle that no matter how strong our policy preferences, no matter how deep our loyalties to presidents or party leaders, in order to remain a constitutional republic, we must act within the borders of the Constitution,” wrote the former members of Congress, including Senators John C. Danforth, Chuck Hagel, Olympia J. Snowe and Richard G. Lugar, who implored Republicans to protect Congress’s constitutionally mandated power of the purse.The security officials said there is neither a “documented terrorist or national security emergency at the southern border” nor an “emergency related to violent crime.”Mr. Trump’s assertions “are rebutted not just by the public record, but by his agencies’ own official data, documents and statements,” the officials, including Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of state, and John O. Brennan, the former C.I.A. director, said in their declaration.“Under no plausible assessment of the evidence is there a national emergency today,” they wrote.“This isn’t about Trump or the wall, this is beyond that,” said former Representative Mickey Edwards, Republican of Oklahoma and the author of the letter to conservative lawmakers. “This is about the constitutional obligations of Congress and how much Congress is going to surrender those duties.”“If Congress gives up the power of deciding what money you can spend and where,” he added, “it has basically surrendered its entire constitutional obligation.”Members of the House Appropriations Committee will hold a hearing on Wednesday to examine the effect of the declaration on military construction and readiness, and members of the House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on Thursday in part to examine Mr. Trump’s use of powers under the National Emergencies Act.“If we’re going to let the president, any president, on a whim declare emergencies simply because he or she can’t get their way in Congress, we have fundamentally changed the building blocks, the strong, proud building blocks that the Founding Fathers put in place,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, in a speech on the Senate floor."
337,"There are more than 48,000 people being held in immigrant detention in more than 200 facilities in the United States. More than two-thirds of them, according to the National Immigrant Justice Center, are confined by private companies, working on contracts with the federal government. Those numbers have ballooned in the last two years under the Trump administration, drawing new attention to the terrible conditions detainees are living in.One feature of privately run centers — the Voluntary Work Program — is the subject of six separate lawsuits, which say that privately run immigrant detention centers are coercing detainees into working for a dollar a day and punishing those who don’t. The lawsuits demand, among other things, that the practice stop and that detained workers be paid minimum wage.Congress should not wait for these lawsuits to be decided. Democrats have won the House, so even if they can’t stop the president’s anti-immigrant push, they can push to raise the obsolete and exploitative $1-a-day wage. And, just as they have rejected Mr. Trump’s request for $5.7 billion for the border wall, they should reject the request for $2.8 billion to expand detentions to 52,000 beds.Prison labor is nearly as old as the American prison system itself, and it is protected by the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery and indentured servitude except as punishment for a crime. This exception means that prisons can require their prisoners to work, even without compensation. But immigrant detention is civil confinement, not criminal. People held in these facilities are not charged with any crime; they are being detained while awaiting asylum or deportation hearings. Under Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Voluntary Work Program, however,  immigrant detention centers need not pay workers more than one dollar a day, a rate set by Congress in 1950 and codified in the 1978 Appropriations Act. It has never been increased or adjusted for inflation.Detainees say that the Voluntary Work Program is not really voluntary. If they attempt to take a day off or refuse to work, staff members punish them by withholding essential items, threatening to move them to more dangerous housing units or locking them in their cells. Wilhen Hill Barrientos, a Guatemalan asylum seeker and a plaintiff in the lawsuit against CoreCivic’s Stewart Detention Center in Georgia, said that he had to either work for a few cents an hour or go without basic things like soap, which he could get only through the commissary.According to Mr. Barrientos’s lawsuit, one night a guard awakened him for the 2 a.m. shift in the kitchen rather than his scheduled 10 a.m. shift. When he refused, the guard threatened to move him to a violence-plagued dormitory, so Mr. Barrientos acquiesced.Martha Gonzalez, from Mexico, was detained in three different CoreCivic prisons in Texas from May 2016 to August 2017 as she awaited a T-1 visa, which is granted to victims of human trafficking. She worked in the kitchen and sorted clothing. When she once tried to take a day off, she told me, the prison staff then punished her by refusing to give her basic hygiene supplies such as sanitary pads and toothpaste. CoreCivic did not respond to Ms. Gonzalez’s allegation but said that its work programs are “completely voluntary” and that “detainees are subject to no disciplinary action whatsoever if they choose not to participate in the work program.”A representative for GEO Group called the lawsuits’ allegations baseless, saying that “this is a strictly voluntary program” and that GEO Group provides hygiene products free of charge upon request. Private corporations hold less than 10 percent of the nation’s prison population, but more than 70 percent of people in immigration detention. The government pays them a fixed daily price per person, so they have an economic incentive to run their facilities as cheaply as possible, relying on detainees to cook meals, mop hallways, scrub toilets, mow lawns and even cut hair.In 2016, CoreCivic’s revenue from Stewart (where Mr. Barrientos and other detainees worked in the kitchen) was about $38 million; in 2017, contracts with ICE comprised 25 percent of its $1.76 billion in revenue. For GEO Group, ICE contracts comprised 19 percent of its $2.26 billion revenue in 2017. At the same time, the detention centers provide the barest minimum to detainees, while charging them exorbitant rates for necessities. In immigrant detention, a phone call can cost as much as $12.75 for 15 minutes. Four ounces of toothpaste sells for $11.These two corporations have become the giants of the private prison industry. Between 2016 and 2018, CoreCivic spent $2.8 million in lobbying and over $700,000 on campaign contributions while GEO Group spent $4.4 million in lobbying and $2.5 million on campaign contributions. Each company also donated $250,000 to Mr. Trump’s inauguration.They blame the 1978 Appropriations Act for the low wages. As GEO Group puts it, “The wage rates associated with this federal government program are stipulated under long-established guidelines set by the United States Congress.” That is true. If Congress instead forced these companies to pay the federal minimum wage, their profit margins would drop dramatically.But the dollar-a-day rule has stalwart defenders in Congress. In response to a class-action lawsuit in which formerly detained immigrants said they were forced to work, 18 Republican congressmen sent a letter on March 7, 2018, to the attorney general at the time, Jeff Sessions, the head of ICE and the secretary of the Department of Labor, exhorting those agencies to help GEO Group defend itself. “Unless your agencies act to intervene in these lawsuits, immigration enforcement efforts will be thwarted, and the end result will be millions of dollars of unnecessary loss to the federal government in terms of additional expenses for immigration detention,” they said. In other words, they worried that if the private prisons were forced to pay reasonable wages, the companies would pass on those costs to the federal government.The lawsuits are not pushing to end the Voluntary Work Program altogether. They understand that it allows people who are in detention to buy things they need and keep in touch with their families by phone, which becomes even more urgent as the number of families torn apart by detention increases. Instead, the lawsuits are pushing for an end to exploitation and a fair wage for their work.Yes, paying detainees a minimum wage would make these facilities much more expensive to operate. But if privately run detention centers rely on a business model based on forced labor, perhaps they should not exist at all."
338,"WASHINGTON — Richard M. Nixon once said, “People react to fear, not love; they don’t teach that in Sunday school, but it’s true.”No president since has deployed fear quite like Donald J. Trump. Whether it is the prospect of a crime wave at the border with Mexico or nuclear war with North Korea, President Trump has persuaded his supporters that there is plenty to fear beyond fear itself.In an interview as a presidential candidate in 2016 with Bob Woodward and Robert Costa of The Washington Post, Mr. Trump said, “Real power is — I don’t even want to use the word — fear.”As president, he initially tried to intimidate some of the nation’s strongest allies, including Canada, Mexico, Britain, France and Germany, in trade talks. He demanded political loyalty from Republicans in Congress and drove several who bucked him from office, notably Senators Bob Corker and Jeff Flake. But as his presidency enters its third year, a less convenient truth is emerging: Few outside the Republican Party are afraid of him, and they may be less intimidated after the disastrous government shutdown.But Mr. Trump has shown little inclination to modulate his style, and that carries risks. He could well face a challenge for the Republican nomination in 2020, and congressional Republicans from swing states could begin to distance themselves from him.One of the clearest signals came last week when Republicans, backing an amendment offered by Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, opposed the president’s call for withdrawal of United States military forces from Syria and Afghanistan as part of a Middle East policy bill. Only three Republicans voted against it.“I believe the threats remain,” Mr. McConnell said in a speech last week. “ISIS and Al Qaeda have yet to be defeated, and American national security interests require continued commitment to our mission there.”Mr. McConnell also counseled the president last week against declaring a national emergency to get a wall built on the southwestern border, even as Mr. Trump emphasized that he was reserving that option.Even his supporters say the president, who uses the word “tough” as a favored expression of admiration, has not made a measurably effective transition from the world of private business to public office.“It is a common trait among those who ran privately held corporations,” said Ari Fleischer, who served as White House press secretary for George W. Bush and frequently defends Mr. Trump. “Their way is the only way. Their will gets it done. They’ve been successful against all odds, built something huge, and when they declare it so they expect everybody around them to make it so. That’s Donald Trump’s behavior, and that doesn’t always work in politics or in government.“Politicians don’t operate the way he does,” Mr. Fleischer said. “Frankly, it’s put him at risk and put the Republican Party at risk, but it also allows him to take on China and do something of tremendous consequences that no politician would ever do. If Trump is successful, this will be a better country and a better world for it.”Yet there is little evidence that President Xi Jinping of China, or any other foreign leader, is cowed.And certainly not Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The president initially said he felt comfortable negotiating with Ms. Pelosi, but in interviews aired on Sunday, he sharpened his attacks on her and said her obstinacy on the border wall was damaging the country.Mr. Trump has found that his lack of experience in politics and diplomacy, which require policy knowledge, team building and nuanced negotiating ability, has left him at a decided disadvantage despite his boasts about his deal-making prowess.“He’s surrounded in these standoffs by people who have all those boxes checked,” said Timothy O’Brien, the author of “TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald.” “Nancy Pelosi has been doing this for quite a while, Putin has been doing this for a quite a while, Xi has been doing this quite a while. They’ve all been running circles around him.”“The next question is when does he really realize that for what it is, and I think the answer for that is he never will,” Mr. O’Brien said, “because it would admit either defeat or acknowledgment of his inadequacies, and he will just never do that.”The government shutdown is just the latest and highest-profile example of Mr. Trump sounding assertive but gaining little, at least so far. American allies, diplomats said, have more a sense of resignation than fear in dealing with him. The list of threats from Mr. Trump is long, but the number of times he has followed through is exceedingly short.“He is playing a role, and the role, much like on ‘The Apprentice,’ was of the strong, able character, but it’s a role,” said David Axelrod, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama. “Every foreign leader and every practicing politician has taken a measure of him and understands the basics, that he responds to strength and there’s not a lot behind the facade.”In recent months, Mr. Trump has had tense conversations with, among others, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and President Emmanuel Macron of France, who has felt trolled by Mr. Trump over the state of the French economy, people familiar with the conversations said.The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has indicated to people that she does not consider Mr. Trump a serious person to talk with. His get-tough, tariff-driven approach to bringing China to heel has had mixed results at best, hurting some American industries and sending markets plunging. Even on one of the most prominent issues that has provoked his threats — the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico — Mr. Trump did not walk away with anything close to a windfall.Instead, most trade experts said the revised trade accord included modest substantive changes that will benefit the United States, and others said the biggest difference may be symbolic: a change in the name, to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Congress has yet to vote on that pact.But there is one place where Mr. Trump’s fear tactics have been an unqualified success: among Republicans. Mr. Trump has held an iron grip on the Republican base, making it difficult for fellow party members, who also rely on those core voters, to oppose him.“There is no constituency within a party that is so dominated by one individual that is charting a course with the opposition unless you want to be a former lawmaker,” said Josh Holmes, a Republican strategist who is close to Mr. McConnell.Other presidents have held out the fear of recrimination from the Oval Office to get their way, but they did not use Mr. Trump’s blunt instruments alone.Lyndon B. Johnson was known for his lean-in, hardball persuasion, but unlike Mr. Trump, Johnson entered a negotiation with an idea of what his opponents wanted and found a way to get it for them, in exchange for getting what he wanted. Even Nixon later acknowledged that he did not really believe fear was a successful prime motivator.“Nixon said that, but he didn’t believe it and he didn’t practice it,” said Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian and author of the recent best seller “Presidents of War.” “He actually spent decades building relationships in Washington, with his party leaders, with Democrats, and around the world. So yes, there were certainly elements of fear in all those relationships, but he knew you needed both the carrot and the stick.“Mr. Trump, given his background as a deal-making real estate developer with close relationships with politicians, might have been expected to do the same in Washington. But among Democrats, he has done the opposite.“It’s almost as if he only has one tool in his toolbox,” Mr. Beschloss said."
339,"They keep coming. Armed with replica automatic weapons firing blanks, gallons of stage blood and mangled Mexican accents, the cartels are streaming across our undefended border, and into our multiplexes and our video streams.These onscreen villains torture their enemies, they kill good Americans and they might turn up anywhere. Last year, in “Sicario: Day of the Soldado,” which is just one of at least six films in which the great Benicio Del Toro wrestles with Latin American drug lords, or plays one himself, they were linked to the bombing of a supermarket in Kansas City.The cartel operative — be he a kingpin or a hit man or a small-time drug dealer — has become the dominant image of Latino people in American television and cinema. He’s of course also the dominant image of Latino people in the discourse of the president of the United States.By the next network upfronts, or summer movie blockbuster season, Latino drug operatives may outpace their chief rivals — jihadist terrorists and Russians mobsters — and become the country’s leading screen bad guys.“You two understand that we’re dealing with a virus?” a Mexican cop asks his American counterparts, referring to the drug-fueled corruption overwhelming a fictitious Mexican town in the CBS television drama “SEAL Team.” “Here, everyone is born infected.”The dialogue and imagery of cartel movies associates Latino identity with inherent, pure evil again and again. It’s time for Hollywood to ask: What message are we sending to the American public by asking this country’s Latino actors to act out one execution-style killing after another? And isn’t this all becoming a bit tired and predictable?The quality of these dramas, speaking in purely artistic terms, varies widely: from the Emmy-winning TV series “Breaking Bad” and the not-so-celebrated 2013 comedy film “We’re the Millers” to this year’s widely panned “Peppermint” and Clint Eastwood’s largely well-received “The Mule.” But they repeat the same tropes: Latino gang members grimacing as they mad-dog confused white people; a secret meeting on a Mexican hacienda, with tequila served and Latinas in bikinis as poolside eye candy.“It’s become a genre. You can see it,” Mr. Del Toro told The Guardian in June. Regarding films about drugs, he said, “They’re becoming the new Westerns.”Unfortunately, this new genre doesn’t purport to depict events from America’s past, but rather a supposedly real menace in the here and now. In late December, President Trump shut down parts of the government over the border wall he wants to build to keep out immigrants he says are drug-dealing criminals. He’s never stopped making up false and distorted statements about the dangers posed by Latino immigrants. All the while, Hollywood has been inventing screen stories that sell the image of lawbreaking Latinos as a threat to American peace and security.In the odious 2018 film “Peppermint,” Jennifer Garner acts out a Trumpian fantasy. As a suburban mom whose husband and daughter were killed by Latino drug dealers, she becomes a one-woman vigilante army, killing a series of Latino assassins and destroying a piñata warehouse that doubles as a drug lord’s secret headquarters. The New Yorker called it “a racist film that reflects the current strain of anti-immigrant politics and its paranoid focus on MS-13.”Like the drug dealers in “Peppermint,” the bad guys in Latino drug war films are often a mishmash of tropes and stereotypes. The cartel operatives in “SEAL Team” resemble an Islamic State army as they launch a Benghazi-style attack on the show’s heroes. The Americans take refuge in a Mexican church and summon other Navy SEALS to rescue them. The show aired not long after Mr. Trump sent troops to the Mexican border to stop a caravan of Central Americans.Hollywood has become addicted to the narco narrative because it offers a tried-and-true tale of good and evil on an epic scale.The new Netflix series “Narcos: Mexico” features an excellent, nuanced performance by Diego Luna as a smart, enterprising and deeply flawed man. But watching Mr. Luna build his “empire,” I longed to see a Latino actor play a big Hollywood role without seeing him leave the usual trail of cocaine and severed heads in his wake.In “The Mule,” Mr. Eastwood plays an older man filled with regrets after a lifetime of alienating his wife and daughter. The drug dealers are really just stand-ins for forces that are eating away at many American families: rampant gun violence and the cruel logic of capitalism. The bad guys in narco films are always ruthless hyper-entrepreneurs, and in “The Mule” they tell Mr. Eastwood’s character, “We own your ass.” In “The Mule,” as in countless films of lesser quality, Latino stereotypes become symbols of a white man’s powerlessness and his unchecked desires. For his role in “Ozark,” Jason Bateman earned a Golden Globe nomination as yet another ordinary gringo caught up in the machinations of a Mexican cartel.Meanwhile, in real life, Latinos are acting out their own human foibles, and trying to build their own private empires, in fields that don’t involve criminal activity. They manage your local Walmart, study law, get divorced, attend cosplay conventions, and do all sorts of things you rarely see them do in mainstream American television and film.The dominant story among the more than 57 million Latino people in the United States is not the drug war: It’s inequality, immigrant ambition and the wounds caused by the separation of extended families. These themes await a treatment as virtuosic as “There Will Be Blood,” or as smart and cutting as “Get Out.”Mr. or Ms. Studio Executive, instead of another film with fake tattoos and stilted accents, consider investing in new talent and greenlighting a big, smart Latino project. And think of the narcos as chili powder — as a spice, they should be used sparingly.Insist on quality and complexity in the screen stories you tell about Latino people, and you might even look like a genius as you tap into a true and untold American epic more compelling than any cartel conspiracy."
340,"Mr. Barr used his opening remarks to the committee to clarify that he has no intention of firing Mr. Mueller before his work is done and to indicate that he would provide “as much transparency as I can consistent with the law” around the investigation’s results. The rule of law, he insisted, should be above and outside of the politics that divide the nation.“It is in the best interest of everyone — the president, Congress and, most importantly, the American people — that this matter be resolved by allowing the special counsel to complete his work,” Mr. Barr said. He added: “I will follow the special counsel regulations scrupulously and in good faith, and on my watch, Bob will be allowed to finish.”Mr. Mueller is believed to be in the final stages of his inquiry, which he took over from the F.B.I. in May 2017 after agents opened it nearly two and a half years ago.“The country needs a credible resolution of these issues,” Mr. Barr said.The fate of Mr. Mueller’s findings — an expected report — was a recurring topic. Mr. Barr said that Mr. Mueller’s report to the attorney general will be “confidential,” but the attorney general will then produce his own report to Congress based on that material. He said that he intended to be as transparent as possible given grand-jury secrecy rules, but that he would not let the White House edit or change it, as the president’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has suggested may happen.“That will not happen,” Mr. Barr said.— Nicholas FandosThroughout the hearing, Mr. Barr espoused surprisingly more moderate views than he has previously, and not only about presidential power and law-enforcement independence. He also found himself backpedaling a bit when pressed about his defense of Mr. Trump's push for an investigation into Hillary Clinton. Mr. Barr had said in 2017 that he saw far more basis to investigate the Obama administration’s approval of the sale of a Canadian mining company to a Russian state-owned corporation than to investigate possible Trump campaign coordination with Russia’s election interference.The sale, which was approved while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, has been the subject of a conspiracy theory about Mrs. Clinton and her family’s foundation that circulates in some conservative circles despite being debunked.Mr. Barr initially suggested his comment, which appeared in a New York Times article, had been mischaracterized. The reporter who wrote the article, Peter Baker, tweeted Mr. Barr’s 2017 email containing the comment in full, putting to rest the possibility of misinterpretation. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, later read aloud from the tweeted email during the hearing, noting that Mr. Barr had testified earlier about the seriousness of Russia’s election meddling and pressing him about why he would assert that the Uranium One sale deserved more scrutiny. Mr. Barr hemmed and hawed, acknowledging that he had “no specific information about Uranium One that would say that it had not been handled appropriately” and that he did not mean the Clinton Foundation merited a criminal investigation.He suggested that he been “using it really as an example of the kinds of things that were floating around and some people felt had to be looked at” too, to make the point that calling for investigations into political opponents was bad: “I don’t subscribe to this ‘lock her up’ stuff,” he said, referring to a popular chant at Mr. Trump’s political rallies about jailing Mrs. Clinton.— Charlie SavageThe Justice Department has held for decades time that indicting or criminally prosecuting a president while in office would violate the Constitution by undermining his ability to do his job. Despite a spirited legal debate about the validity of those opinions, Mr. Barr said he saw no reason to revisit them.“I actually haven’t read those opinions in a long time, but I see no reason to change them,” he said, in response to prompt by Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who said he believed the president could be indicted while in office and a trial postponed until his time there ended.— Nicholas FandosDemocrats tried repeatedly to get Mr. Barr to chastise Mr. Trump for his attacks on federal law enforcement and condemn his fanciful use of facts. Mr. Barr did not take the bait, and his response may offer an early glimpse of how he might navigate one of the most uncomfortable positions in the government — overseeing and defending an investigation loathed by the president who nominated him.Even as he offered a consistent defense of Mr. Mueller (“I have the utmost respect for Bob”) and pledged to defend his investigation, Mr. Barr pointedly declined to criticize the president directing unrelenting attacks on investigators and elements of the Justice Department itself. And he said he was not concerned by what Senator Mazie Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, called “the way Donald Trump undermines the institutions in our society that help us to maintain a moral consensus” with false information.Instead, Mr. Barr suggested that the president’s position was a reasonable one, at least as it pertained to the Mueller inquiry.“It’s understandable that if someone felt they were falsely accused they would view an investigation as something like a witch hunt where someone like you or me who doesn’t know the facts, you know, might not use that term,” Mr. Barr said.— Nicholas FandosSenators of both parties extended career guidance, praise and even snacks to Liam Daly, Mr. Barr’s young grandson who sat through the hourslong hearing.Liam’s parents are both Justice Department leaders, and he was deeply engaged in the confirmation process.“You are doing great so far,” he wrote in a note to Mr. Barr that was captured by a Reuters photographer. “I am having so much fun.”After Mr. Barr said that Russia posed a threat to the United States, Liam offered a subtle adjustment. “I think Russia’s people are fine,” he wrote to his grandfather. “The government is the problem.”Liam, 8, is also an avid reader of the children’s edition of The New York Times, a Justice Department official confirmed; Mr. Barr’s wife bought him a subscription. Liam found a recent article on the Supreme Court interesting, the official said.— Katie BennerSenators have asked Mr. Barr about the last attorney general. They have called out former top F.B.I. officials by name. And they have spent an inordinate amount of time playfully counseling his grandson by name. But they have hardly mentioned the acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker.Mr. Whitaker had proven to be a lightning rod for scrutiny since he took over the Justice Department when former Attorney General Jeff Sessions was fired late last year. He ignored the advice of ethics experts at the department and decided to take a direct role overseeing the Mueller investigation, an inquiry of which he has been highly critical, and Democrats argue that his temporary appointment was legally dubious in the first place.Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee announced on Tuesday that they had reached an agreement for Mr. Whitaker to testify in public on Feb. 8. The committee’s chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, said he expected Mr. Whitaker to appear “whether or not the current lapse in appropriations has been resolved, and whether or not the Senate has confirmed a new attorney general.”— Nicholas FandosMr. Barr took a hawkish stance on China that comports with the Trump administration’s view, calling it “the primary rival of the United States” and praising former Attorney General Jeff Sessions for cracking down on Chinese intellectual property theft and espionage.While he was general counsel of Verizon, Mr. Barr said, he was well aware of the potential national security threat posed by the Chinese telecommunications and tech equipment companies Huawei and ZTE. The intelligence community has long warned that firms were too close to the Chinese government and that they could use their products to monitor communications on behalf of Beijing.— Katie BennerUnder questioning by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, Mr. Barr pledged to obey and uphold a 2015 law that restricts interrogators to the techniques listed in the Army Field Manual.“That was an important change because I think it gave clarity to the law and I will support that,” Mr. Barr said.Ms. Feinstein, who chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee when it produced a lengthy investigative report about the C.I.A.’s torture program under the Bush administration, noted that it had relied upon secret memos by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel blessing techniques like extended sleep deprivation and the suffocation tactic known as waterboarding despite anti-torture laws.She also noted that in 2005, Mr. Barr had defended President Bush’s purported legal right to withhold Geneva Convention protections from terrorism detainees and to submit them to coercive interrogation, including “inflicting pain, discomfort and other things to make people talk” so long as it does not involve “the gratuitous barbarity involved in torture.”Pressed by Ms. Feinstein about whether waterboarding counted as torture, Mr. Barr said he did not know if it counted as such under the law in 2005, but that because of the newer law, “right now it’s prohibited, so, you know, the law has definitively dealt with that.”— Charlie SavageTheir tones were starkly different, but a coalition of liberal and conservative senators who teamed up last year to push into law major revisions to federal sentencing and prison laws pressed to make sure Mr. Barr understood that times had changed since he was last in office.“During your previous tenure as attorney general, you literally wrote the book on mass incarceration or wrote this report,” said Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, referencing a 1992 Justice Department memorandum, “The Case for More Incarceration.” Mr. Booker urged Mr. Barr to say that the spike in incarceration caused by those policies had disproportionately affected black Americans.Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, sought assurances that Mr. Barr that he would implement the new bill, which lowers mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, promotes anti-recidivism programs, and expands early release.The short answer was yes, but Mr. Barr bristled at the suggestion he was hostile to the bill. He said he viewed tough-on-crime policies of the 1980s and 1990s, when he was last in office, as responsible for the ensuing drop in violent crime.“I don’t think comparing the policies that were in effect in 1992 to the situation now is really fair,” he told Mr. Grassley. He added, “I think the time was right to take stock and make changes to our penal system based on our current experience.”— Nicholas FandosDemocratic senators wanted other assurances of noninterference, too, particularly for regular federal prosecutors who be separately investigating Mr. Trump or building cases that could be damaging to his interests. Here, Mr. Barr drew a distinction between the special counsel’s investigation, which is governed by special rules, and matters considered through the department’s normal channels.“I have the responsibility to use my judgment and discretion that are inherent in the office of attorney general to supervise,” he said, referring to cases brought through the usual order. To let individual U.S. attorney’s work without supervision or make assurances about individual investigations would be an abdication of that responsibility, he said.Mr. Barr said that he would not stand for efforts to interfere or scuttle investigations within the department for political reasons, but offered a caveat about presidential power.“I would not stand by and allow, you know, an investigation to be stopped if I thought it was a lawful investigation,” he said. “I wouldn’t stand by for that, but the president is free to fire his, you know, officials that he’s appointed.”Democrats had at least one high-profile case in mind. Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have built a case that has implicated Mr. Trump in a scheme to pay hush money to two women during the 2016 campaign to stop them from speaking publicly about affairs they said they had with him.“The point is,” Mr. Barr said, “if someone tried to stop a bona fide, lawful investigation to cover up wrongdoing, I would resign.”— Nicholas FandosAsked whether he would consider jailing journalists “for doing their jobs,” Mr. Barr paused before explaining that he could conceive of situations “as a last resort” where a news organization or journalist needs to be held accountable for “putting out stuff that they know will harm the country.”The Justice Department has cracked down in recent years on government employees who share classified information with reporters. Under former President Barack Obama, the Justice Department prosecuted more leaks than all previous administrations combined. Reporters are loathe to reveal sources, and some have been jailed for refusing a judge’s orders to do so.Mr. Barr’s hesitation may have been because of the Justice Department’s long pursuit of the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange over the site’s publication of troves of secret government papers. Obama-era lawyers debated whether to charge him but held off because they could never decide on a clear answer to the question of how his work differed from that of traditional news organizations.But prosecutors have secretly charged him, they mistakenly revealed last year, raising questions of whether they set aside concerns about setting a precedent that would chill press freedoms because of WikiLeaks’ release of stolen Democratic emails that Russian intelligence operatives hacked during the 2016 election. — Katie BennerMr. Barr said he agrees with the president about the need to change the nation’s immigration laws, including his demand for a border wall that has prompted the nation’s longest government shutdown.“We need money right now for border security — including barriers and walls and slats and other things,” Mr. Barr said, “anything that makes sense in different areas of the border.”Tuesday marked the 25th day of the partial government shutdown with little indication that Mr. Trump and congressional Democrats were any closer to a compromise on funding for a border wall.Mr. Barr said he would like to see an agreement between lawmakers and the president that recognizes the need for border security, “and part of that common-sense matter needs barriers.”— Eileen SullivanAsked what he would do if confronted with a situation where he might have to resign, Mr. Barr cited his age and his previous stint as attorney general to say he will be unshackled from politics to make the right decision, regardless of whether it is politically prudent for his career or for the president.“It might give me pause if I was 45 or 50 years old, but it doesn’t give me pause right now,” said Mr. Barr, 68.He added: “I will not be bullied into doing anything I think is wrong by anybody whether it be editorial boards or Congress or the president. I’m going to do what I think is right.”— Michael S. SchmidtMr. Barr has long advanced an unusually expansive view of executive authority. He has portrayed the president, not the attorney general, as the nation’s top law-enforcement official, and suggested that Congress cannot bar a president from using his executive powers — like to pardon someone or “start or stop a law enforcement proceeding” — in a corrupt way.This has raised the question of whether his permissive theories would unleash Mr. Trump, who is not known for his self-restraint. But in several ways on Tuesday, Mr. Barr appeared to walk back or qualify some of his earlier writings, putting greater emphasis on the Justice Department’s independence and legal limits on the presidency.For example, Mr. Barr said that if a president directed the Justice Department to close an investigation to protect himself or his family, that would violate the Constitution. And asked by Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, whether a president could pardon someone in exchange for a promise not to incriminate him, Mr. Barr said “that would be a crime.”— Charlie SavageMr. Barr defended as “entirely proper” his decision to write an unsolicited, lengthy memo to the Trump administration legal team in June arguing that Mr. Mueller should not be permitted to investigate the president for violating criminal obstruction-of-justice laws based on how he chose to exercise his constitutional powers, like to fire a subordinate or order an investigation closed.Mr. Barr stressed that he was “in the dark” about what Mr. Mueller’s obstruction theory was, and said that he was merely speculating. He emphasized that his concern was the “ramifications down the road” of establishing such a rule.“One theory in particular that appeared to be under consideration under a specific statute concerned me because I thought it would involve stretching the statute beyond what was intended and would do it in a way that would have serious adverse consequences for all agencies that are involved in the administration of justice, especially the Department of Justice,” he said. “And I thought it would have a chilling effect going forward over time.”— Charlie SavageMs. Feinstein read excerpts from Mr. Barr’s writings on a president’s purported power to control all law-enforcement activity and said she intended to press him on whether he would resist political interference from Mr. Trump, noting his calls for new criminal inquiries into Democrats like Hillary Clinton.“It’s important that the next attorney general be able to strongly resist pressure, whether from the administration or Congress to conduct investigations for political purposes,” she said. “You must have the integrity, the strength and the fortitude to tell the president ‘no,’ regardless of the consequences.”In his opening statement, Mr. Barr appeared to embrace that principle.“The attorney general must ensure that the administration of justice, the enforcement of the law, is above and away from politics,” he said. “Nothing could be more destructive of our system of government, of the rule of law, or the Department of Justice as an institution than any toleration of political interference with the enforcement of the law.”— Charlie SavageMr. Barr briefly spoke of his commitment to public service and the Justice Department. He noted that most of his children are government lawyers, including one in a top position at the Justice Department. One of his three daughters coordinates the department’s response to the opioid crisis, and a son-in-law also works in the department’s national security division.“Somebody needs to make money in the family,” joked Mr. Graham.— Katie BennerWhen Mr. Barr was nominated to serve as attorney general the first time in 1991, the Democratic Senate unanimously confirmed him by voice vote. He should not expect such a smooth ride this time around, but with Republicans in control of the chamber by a 53-to-47 majority, his confirmation appears to be on track.Two wild cards could scramble the usual partisan divide. A handful of moderate Republicans facing re-election fights in 2020 or simply skeptical of Mr. Trump’s intentions could theoretically swing against Mr. Barr if he fails to convince them that he would stand up for the special counsel. If these senators — Cory Gardner of Colorado, Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Mitt Romney of Utah and others — banded together with a united Democratic caucus, they could kill the confirmation.But Democrats may also be motivated to quickly move Mr. Barr through confirmation. They have been highly critical of the acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, a Trump loyalist whom they view as a direct threat to Mr. Mueller, and want him out of office as quickly as possible. If they view Mr. Barr as sincere in his public assurances about the investigation, it is a swap many Democrats might eagerly make.— Nicholas Fandos"
341,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox.President Trump has worked hard to stem and suppress the various investigations surrounding him, leaving him open to accusations of obstruction of justice, according to a New York Times report published this week. He has also publicly attacked the investigation more than 1,100 times since he took office, The Times found. (When the article came out, Trump remained true to form: He savaged it.)Stephen Colbert highlighted one part of the report, which points out that Trump’s behavior has slowly come to feel like the norm for many Americans. Colbert urged his viewers not to become inured to the president’s behavior.Trevor Noah followed up on the recent discovery, through a court filing, that the Sackler family was much more directly involved in covering up the addictive qualities of OxyContin than had been previously known. The family is widely known for its philanthropy, but it has also played a major role in the scourge of opioid abuse that suffused America over the past quarter-century.Purdue Pharma, the Sacklers’ company, aggressively marketed the drug to doctors, sometimes with the help of exotic dancers. Noah commented on one pharmaceutical executive and former stripper who allegedly bribed and engaged in sexual acts with doctors she was trying to persuade to prescribe more opioids.Seth Meyers pointed to a new argument that’s becoming popular on Fox News: that perhaps Trump shouldn’t declare a national emergency to build the border wall (a move that could well be struck down by federal courts anyway, experts believe) because then a future Democratic president might invoke emergency powers to fight climate change.It’s clear which situation Meyers thinks would be the real emergency.Meyers played a clip of Trump trying to persuade the Fox News host Chris Wallace that the worsening of California forest fires isn’t due to climate change, but lack of forest maintenance. The president claimed that one governor had told him raking the leaves below trees would help solve the problem.

342,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. The Senate voted to block President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency on the border with Mexico, setting up the first veto of his presidency.Twelve Republicans joined all 47 Democratic senators, after the House passed a similar resolution last month. The declaration would have redirected $3.6 billion from military construction projects toward building the border wall, even after Congress rejected a funding request.The bipartisan rebuke was the first time Congress has blocked a presidential emergency declaration. “It’s pure and simple: It’s a vote for border security, it’s a vote for no crime,” Mr. Trump, above, told reporters ahead of the vote.Earlier in the day, the House voted overwhelmingly to demand the public release of the special counsel’s report on the Russia investigation._____2. The captain of the doomed Ethiopian Airlines jetliner seemed calm at first. Then he sounded panicked.Minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa on Sunday, his Boeing 737 Max 8 had accelerated to abnormally high speeds. “Break break, request back to home,” he urgently radioed controllers, who had seen that the jet was oscillating vertically by hundreds of feet.These details, provided to our reporter by a person who reviewed the air traffic communications, shed chilling new detail about the final minutes of the jet, which crashed, killing all 157 people aboard.Many pilots are abuzz about the strange acceleration. And some are worried their hands-on flying skills are lacking amid increased automation, in the wake of recent crashes of 737 Max 8s, above, in Indonesia and Ethiopia._____3. In other international news:Lawmakers in Britain voted to delay the country’s departure from the European Union beyond the original March 29 deadline after two years of negotiations. In a flurry of votes on several amendments, Parliament, above, also rejected holding a second referendum on Brexit.Separately, two rockets were fired at Tel Aviv from the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military reported. One landed in an open area, and the other was intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome missile-defense system. Initial Israeli news media reports said there was no damage or casualties._____4. The relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook massacre won a major court battle over gunmakers’ liability in mass shootings.The ruling, which allows a lawsuit brought by relatives to go to trial, could force gun companies to turn over internal communications they have fought to keep private. It also validates the new strategy lawyers used to find a route around federal protections for gunmakers. Above, Bill Sherlach, whose wife was killed in the shooting, responding to the ruling.“I am thrilled and tremendously grateful,” said Nicole Hockley, whose 6-year-old son, Dylan, was killed in his first-grade classroom in the 2012 shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. “No one has blanket immunity.”_____5. There were pole-vaulters who didn’t pole-vault. A tennis player who didn’t play a single tennis match. A long snapper who weighed 145 pounds and had stopped playing football.The largest college admissions scandal in recent history has shed new light on the role of college sports in gaining entry to the nation’s top schools.As the scandal broke, students at a school in Kansas City, Mo., who had been working for months to gain entrance into some of the same universities named in court documents called it a harsh lesson in the limits of meritocracy.We also went to the University of Southern California, one of the schools most entangled in the scandal, where four athletics officials are charged with taking bribes, more than the number named at any other school._____6. In 2020 news, Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman, is running for president.Mr. O’Rourke, above in Iowa, a Democrat whose near-miss Senate run against Ted Cruz propelled him to stardom last year, announced his intention in a video on his Twitter profile. He has been criticized for not taking a strong enough stance on key Democratic issues — he has declined to call himself a progressive — and for his lack of a campaign infrastructure.We also took a look at how Texas is nearing battleground status._____7. The reputed Gambino mob boss Frank Cali was murdered outside his home on Staten Island.Until Wednesday, it had been decades since an organized crime leader had been killed in New York City. The Gambino family was once the nation’s largest and most influential Mafia group, but several of its leaders were convicted in the 1990s of crimes like murder and racketeering. Above, the scene outside Mr. Cali’s home.Mr. Cali, 53, rose to power by avoiding detection, nothing like John Gotti, the “Dapper Don” who ruled the same operation when Mr. Cali was a little boy. Here are five other high-profile mob hits in New York City from over the years._____8. Japan’s ice monsters are disappearing.Tourists from around the world travel to see the juhyo — huge, Godzilla-like creatures, naturally formed by snow and ice, encasing conifer trees spread across a mountainous landscape. Researchers have tracked a steady deterioration of the ice monsters because of warming temperatures.“I am very worried about greenhouse effects,” said a professor. “By the end of the century, the juhyo will disappear from Earth.” Above, a student collecting snow to sample for airborne contaminants.In other climate news, students in more than 100 countries are planning to skip class on Friday to demand action on climate change._____9. Hudson Yards is Manhattan’s biggest, newest, slickest gated community, according to our architecture critic, who calls it “a relic of dated 2000s thinking.”At $25 billion, the Far West Side development, above, is the largest mixed-use private real estate venture in American history. Many of its tenants were lured by lucrative tax breaks provided by New York politicians to the developers.“It is, at heart, a supersized suburban-style office park, with a shopping mall and a quasi-gated condo community targeted at the 0.1 percent,” Michael Kimmelman, our critic, writes._____10. Finally, happy Pi Day!Pi is defined as the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter, something the internet reminds us of every March 14 (or 3.14). But the famous mathematical ratio, estimated to more than 22 trillion digits (and counting), is the perfect symbol for our species’ long effort to tame infinity, one mathematician, Steven Strogatz, writes.“For some people, Pi Day is an occasion to marvel at circles, long revered as symbols of perfection, reincarnation and the cycles of nature,” writes Mr. Strogatz. “But it is the domestication of infinity that we really should be celebrating.” Above, the Children’s Museum of Houston’s celebration for Pi Day in 2011.Or if you’d rather use the unofficial holiday as an excuse to have a slice of pie, that’s O.K., too.Have a sweet night._____Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

343,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. Our team of Washington reporters uncovered a secretive layer of President Trump’s public war on the investigations encircling him, particularly that of the special counsel, Robert Mueller.They interviewed dozens of current and former government officials and others close to Mr. Trump and reviewed confidential White House documents, finding numerous unreported episodes of pressure and intimidation over the last two years that may expose him to accusations of obstruction of justice.Their published report, at 4,500 words, is our most-read article today.Separately, House Democrats are investigating an administration effort to bring nuclear power plants to Saudi Arabia despite repeated warnings that potential conflicts of interest around the plan could put U.S. security at risk._____2. Sixteen states have banded together to challenge President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the border, setting up a constitutional clash over the scope of presidential emergency powers.Their lawsuit argues that the president doesn’t have the power to divert federal funds to build his promised border wall because Congress controls spending. House Democrats are also gearing up to confront the president.

Above, Mr. Sanders at the Iowa State Homecoming Parade in October.Here’s the full Democratic field (so far)._____4. Egyptian officials detained a veteran Times correspondent and forced him back to London without explanation, in an escalation of a severe crackdown against the news media under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.In another case, the photojournalist pictured above, Mahmoud Abou Zeid, was due to be released in September after five years in prison but remains in detention.The Times correspondent, David Kirkpatrick, a former Cairo bureau chief, was denied entry at the Cairo airport and held without food or water for seven hours.

American teachers have mounted the most sustained educator protest movement in decades — and it doesn’t show any signs of stopping.Teachers walked out of classrooms again in West Virginia on Tuesday, above, helping to kill a bill that would have allowed tax dollars to pay for private school tuition and established charter schools in the state for the first time. Those in Oakland, Calif., plan a strike for Thursday.We look at the resilience of a movement that has grown from demanding higher wages and benefits for educators to a broader push for school reform._____6. The Roman Catholic Church confirmed that it has general guidelines for what to do when clerics break celibacy vows and end up fathering children, a growing issue that strikes at the heart of the Vatican’s culture of secrecy.It appears to be the first admission that such a practice existed. The children are often a result of affairs, though some are the product of rape or abuse. Above, Vincent Doyle, the son of a priest.Some of these children are among those descending on Rome to press their cause during the Vatican’s unprecedented meeting this week on the child sexual abuse crisis.Separately, Southern Baptists announced plans to address sexual abuse in the wake of an investigation by The Houston Chronicle and The San Antonio Express-News. The reporting revealed that nearly 400 Southern Baptist leaders had been accused of sexual misconduct or crimes against more than 700 victims since 1998._____7. What if stemming the tide of misinformation on YouTube means punishing some of its biggest stars?It’s a question vexing the platform as it tries to rein in bad actors with a new recommendation algorithm. Instead of aiming to maximize the amount of time users spend on the site — rewarding those who traded in viral stunts and baseless rumor-mongering — the company says it is trying to reduce the spread of “borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways.”And harmful, our tech and culture columnist notes, is a circular notion: “A conspiracy theory is harmful if it results in harm — at which point it’s often too late for platforms to act.”_____8. “Sweatpants are a sign of defeat.”That was the witty, highly recognizable Karl Lagerfeld, the most prolific designer of the 20th and 21st centuries.

344,"ALBUQUERQUE — Almost immediately after President Trump declared a national emergency on Friday so he could proceed with his ambition to build a wall along the border with Mexico, some of his opponents announced their next move: We’ll see you in court.Citing a dearth of evidence for a border crisis and fears over what is shaping into a colossal seizure of private property by the federal government, the Texas county of El Paso, together with human rights and pro-democracy groups, said on Friday that they planned to file a lawsuit almost immediately seeking to block the declaration.The groups argue that communities along the border would be harmed, not saved, by the construction of the wall, and that Mr. Trump had no legal basis for declaring an emergency. Theirs would be the first in an array of legal challenges already coalescing in an effort to thwart Mr. Trump’s plan.“There is zero factual support for the existence of a national emergency at the border,” said Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, one of the groups preparing to challenge Mr. Trump in court. The declaration, Mr. Saenz added, “would be a laughable object of ridicule were it not so dangerous.”[Read the first edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up for it here.]The brewing legal battles are likely to focus on such issues as the rights of private property owners; tribal sovereignty of Native Americans living along the border; and how far presidential powers extend.Mr. Trump predicted during his declaration of the emergency that he would face legal obstacles. “Sadly we’ll be sued, and sadly it will go through a process, and happily we’ll win,” he said.Courts have been grappling for at least a decade with lawsuits involving the Secure Fence Act of 2006, legislation passed under former President George W. Bush that authorized the construction of about 700 miles of barriers and fencing along the border with Mexico. Dozens of lawsuits filed by property owners challenging that project are still unresolved.The emergency declaration stands in contrast to that previous construction initiative because Congress this week refused in its bipartisan budget deal to allocate the funds needed to build the kind of wall the president wants. With Mr. Trump determined to go forward, these are just some of the legal battles that are expected.If the festering tension in South Texas over the last decade is any indication, some of the most strident opposition to Mr. Trump’s wall is expected to come from owners of land along the border who face seizure of their property by the federal government to build it.Landowners in Texas, largely in the Rio Grande Valley, filed hundreds of lawsuits aiming to block the Bush administration from building fencing along the border. Some property owners opposed the government’s seizure of their land, while others said the compensation offered by federal authorities was too low.Attention may now shift farther west to El Paso. Broad criticism of Mr. Trump in that city, a Democratic bastion in a state otherwise largely dominated by Republicans, emerged in recent days over the president’s widely discredited claim that border fencing had reduced crime there.El Paso County, which encompasses the city of El Paso and is home to about 800,000 people, joined the Border Network for Human Rights; Protect Democracy, a group aiming to curb authoritarian-style politics; and the Niskanen Center, a nonpartisan think tank, in preparing a lawsuit over Mr. Trump’s declaration.Ricardo Samaniego, who heads the governing county court of commissioners, said that Mr. Trump’s emergency declaration “will further damage El Paso County’s reputation and economy, and we are determined to stop this from happening.”Precedent suggests that those living in the path of the planned wall may have a difficult time challenging it in court: Landowners have lost nearly all of the earlier cases aimed at preventing the federal government from seizing their property, though some ended up securing more compensation than initially offered.Democratic leaders in Congress have vowed to overturn the emergency declaration. “This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said in a joint statement.California officials announced on Friday that they planned to sue and said they hoped other states would join. “The president is exploiting a serious law,” the state’s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, said at a news conference with Gov. Gavin Newsom. “There is no emergency here for the nation.”Mr. Newsom said that California would be affected by construction of a wall more than any other state. “Fortunately Donald Trump is not the last word,” he said. “The courts will be the last word.”Another legal battle already underway involves the sovereignty of Native Americans living along the border.Leaders of the Tohono O’odham Nation, whose land in Arizona runs along 75 miles of the border, have already announced opposition to the border wall by taking their fight to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, a part of the Organization of American States aimed at preventing rights abuses.Tohono leaders say that a wall infringes on the right to freedom of movement among the tribe’s members, who live on both sides of the border. Verlon M. Jose, vice chairman of the Tohono nation, has said that the Trump administration would have to build the wall “over my dead body.”The Tohono O’odham’s petition at the human rights commission seeks to impede more wall construction. Other tribes along the border, including the Kickapoo in Texas, the Kumeyaay in California and the Cocopah in Arizona, are examining how to proceed after Mr. Trump’s declaration.Still, the Trump administration has been loath to respond to claims of rights abuses, and it has stopped cooperating with United Nations human rights investigators.That could mean that tribes need to rely on the legal system in the United States to resolve differences over the wall.Environmental groups are also mobilizing to fight the wall in court, but recent legal decisions raise doubts about their ability to successfully argue that federal authorities are circumventing environmental laws.The Supreme Court declined in December to hear a challenge by conservation groups to the proposed wall construction in California, leaving in place a ruling by a federal judge in San Diego that allowed construction to proceed.The plaintiffs in that case argued that the wall would violate environmental laws and imperil habitats for some animals. They unsuccessfully challenged a 1996 law that allows the Department of Homeland Security to waive other laws in order to build walls or barriers on the border.Even if an environmental challenge might have an uphill climb in the courts, it could have the effect of delaying wall construction in parts of the border, potentially for months or years.“I expect legal challenges to tie this up for a long time,” said Cristina Rodriguez, a professor at Yale Law School. “The president and his people are aware of this, but they may care more about the optics of the wall than what actually happens on the border.”"
345,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to decide whether the Trump administration may add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census questionnaire that will be sent to every household in the nation.The court’s move added a highly charged and consequential blockbuster to what had been a fairly sleepy term. The justices have mostly avoided controversy while they adjusted to the new conservative majority created by the arrival in the fall of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.The federal government has long gathered information about citizenship, but since 1950, it has not included a question on it in the forms sent once a decade to each household. Last month, a federal trial judge blocked the Commerce Department from adding the question, saying that the process that led to the decision was deeply flawed.The Supreme Court stepped in before any appeals court had ruled on the matter, and it put the case on an unusually fast track. The Supreme Court’s speed was almost certainly a result of a looming deadline — the census forms are set to be printed in June.Without immediate action from the court, the solicitor general, Noel J. Francisco, told the justices, “the government will be disabled for a decade from obtaining citizenship data through an enumeration of the entire population.”The Supreme Court scheduled arguments for late April, and it is expected to rule before the end of June.The case — United States Department of Commerce v. New York, No. 18-966 — is the latest test of the scope of executive power in the Trump era. Last year, the justices upheld President Trump’s authority to restrict travel from several predominantly Muslim countries. More recently, the court rejected the administration’s request to reinstate a ban on asylum claims by immigrants who cross the southern border illegally.On Friday, Mr. Trump said he expected his declaration of a national emergency to build a border wall to be challenged in court. He predicted that the administration would lose in the lower courts but prevail in the Supreme Court.The census case has its roots in the text of the Constitution, which requires an “actual enumeration” every 10 years, with the House of Representatives to be apportioned based on “the whole number of persons in each state.”“By its terms, therefore, the Constitution mandates that every 10 years the federal government endeavor to count every single person residing in the United States, whether citizen or noncitizen, whether living here with legal status or without,” Judge Jesse M. Furman of the Federal District Court in Manhattan wrote last month in his decision, setting out the consensus view.Critics say that adding the question on citizenship would undermine the accuracy of the census because both legal and unauthorized immigrants might refuse to fill out the forms. By one government estimate, about 6.5 million people might decide not to participate.That could reduce Democratic representation when congressional districts are drawn in 2021 and affect the distribution of hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending. Judge Furman found that were the question added, Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas would risk losing seats in the House and that several states could lose federal money.Dale Ho, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged the addition of the citizenship question, said that it “would cause incalculable damage to our democracy.”“The evidence presented at trial exposed this was the Trump administration’s plan from the get-go,” Mr. Ho said.Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, has said that he ordered the question to be added in response to a December 2017 request from the Justice Department, which said that data about citizenship would help it enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965.In a detailed decision after an eight-day trial, Judge Furman concluded that Mr. Ross had dissembled, saying that “the evidence is clear that Secretary Ross’s rationale was pretextual.”“While the court is unable to determine — based on the existing record, at least — what Secretary Ross’s real reasons for adding the citizenship question were, it does find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that promoting enforcement of the” Voting Rights Act, or V.R.A., “was not his real reason for the decision,” Judge Furman wrote. “Instead, the court finds that the V.R.A. was a post hoc rationale for a decision that the secretary had already made for other reasons.”Judge Furman had called for Mr. Ross to be questioned under oath, but the Supreme Court blocked that order in October. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, said the court should have gone further, shutting down all pretrial fact-gathering in the census case. Justice Gorsuch added that there was no indication of bad faith in Mr. Ross’s conduct.“There’s nothing unusual about a new cabinet secretary coming to office inclined to favor a different policy direction, soliciting support from other agencies to bolster his views, disagreeing with staff or cutting through red tape,” Justice Gorsuch wrote at the time. “Of course, some people may disagree with the policy and process. But until now, at least, this much has never been thought enough to justify a claim of bad faith and launch an inquisition into a cabinet secretary’s motives.”In November, the Supreme Court rejected a request from the Trump administration to halt the trial, over the dissents of Justices Thomas, Gorsuch and Samuel A. Alito Jr.In his ruling last month, Judge Furman relied on evidence in the so-called administrative record, meaning the materials the government said Mr. Ross had considered before making his decision.Evidence presented at the trial showed that Mr. Ross had wanted to add the question long before the request from the Justice Department. The letter from the Justice Department, Judge Furman wrote, was an attempt “to launder their request through another agency — that is, to obtain cover for a decision that they had already made.”Documents disclosed in the case showed that Mr. Ross had discussed the citizenship issue early in his tenure with Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist and an architect of the Trump administration’s tough policies against immigrants, and that Mr. Ross had met at Mr. Bannon’s direction with Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state and a vehement opponent of unlawful immigration.“In a startling number of ways,” Judge Furman wrote, “Secretary Ross’s explanations for his decision were unsupported by, or even counter to, the evidence before the agency.”Judge Furman ruled that the administration had violated federal statutes. But he rejected a constitutional challenge based on equal protection principles, saying that there was not enough evidence in the record to conclude that Mr. Ross had intended to discriminate against minorities and unauthorized immigrants.The lawsuit challenging the addition of the question was filed by New York, other states, localities and advocacy groups. They said that asking the question was a calculated effort by the administration to discriminate against immigrants.“Adding a question about citizenship to the census would incite widespread fear in immigrant communities and greatly impair the accuracy of population counts,” Letitia James, New York’s attorney general, said on Friday after the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.In urging the Supreme Court to review Judge Furman’s decision, Mr. Francisco, representing the Trump administration, wrote that Mr. Ross had wide discretion over the census that could not be second-guessed by courts. He added that questions about citizenship have often been asked of at least a sample of the population in many earlier censuses and are commonplace in ones conducted by other developed democracies."
346,"Good morning.(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.)This week, my colleague Tim Arango wrote about the rocky, contentious rollout of a new law that requires police departments to make public more records about officers’ conduct.The law suddenly made California — which has one of the nation’s highest rates of police shootings — among the most open states when it comes to police records. For decades, it has been one of the most secretive. The change has caused friction between law enforcement agencies and those pushing for transparency, including journalists and family members of people who have been killed by the police. That’s where Tim picks up the issue today: More than a quarter of a million dollars to provide public police records?The San Diego Sheriff’s Department this week told KPBS that it would cost $354,524.22 to provide records on police shootings that the television channel had requested under a new state law.That response, KPBS said, is “the latest development in a battle between law enforcement agencies and media organizations across the state.”With lawsuits pending, how much departments can charge to provide records is a new front in what will most likely be a long, multifaceted fight.Several stories were published this week about departments charging thousands of dollars to meet requests, something the American Civil Liberties Union argues undercuts the intent of the law. In Anaheim, a woman was asked to put down a $3,000 deposit when she asked for records from her son’s killing by the Anaheim police in 2009, according to Fox 11. The Voice of San Diego was told by the sheriff’s department it would have to pay $246,759.32 to obtain the records it wants, Sara Libby, the outlet’s managing editor, wrote on Twitter.Some departments are citing the precedent of a case in which the National Lawyers Guild sued the California city of Hayward to obtain body camera footage. An appellate judge in that case ruled that those seeking records can be forced to pay the labor costs for officers to review records and make redactions.But the California Supreme Court agreed to review the case, which means it’s no longer a binding precedent, said Alan Schlosser, senior counsel at the A.C.L.U. in Northern California, who is representing the lawyers’ guild in the case.“Right now the issue is undecided,” said Mr. Schlosser, whose brief for the Supreme Court is due today.At stake, he said, is the validity of the new law. Depending on its interpretation, the records “could remain secret unless you pay.”For families who have lost loved ones in police shootings, the new law promised a measure of healing. But the debate means many of those families will have to keep waiting.“It’s been 10 years now,” said Donna Hernandez, whose son, Kevin Wicks, was killed by the Inglewood police in 2008. “But it’s like yesterday.”(We often link to content on sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand have all endorsed the resolution sponsored by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts.Conservative critics predictably call it “a shocking document” and “a call for enviro-socialism in America,” but liberal condescension has cut deeper. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, essentially dismissed it as branding, saying, “The green dream, or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they’re for it, right?” Others have criticized it for leaving out any mention of a carbon tax, a cornerstone of mainstream climate-policy proposals, while embracing a left-populist agenda that includes universal health care, stronger labor rights and a jobs guarantee. What do these goals have to do with stabilizing atmospheric carbon levels before climate change makes large parts of the world uninhabitable? What has taken liberal critics aback is that the Green New Deal strays so far from the traditional environmental emphasis on controlling pollution, which the carbon tax aims to do, and tries to solve the problems of economic inequality, poverty and even corporate concentration (there’s an antimonopoly clause).But this everything-and-the-carbon-sink strategy is actually a feature of the approach, not a bug, and not only for reasons of ideological branding. In the 21st century, environmental policy is economic policy. Keeping the two separate isn’t a feat of intellectual discipline. It’s an anachronism.Our carbon emissions are not mainly about the price of gasoline or electricity. They’re about infrastructure. For every human being, there are over 1,000 tons of built environment: roads, office buildings, power plants, cars and trains and long-haul trucks. It is a technological exoskeleton for the species. Everything most of us do, we do through it: calling our parents, getting to work, moving for a job, taking the family on vacation, finding food for the evening or staying warm in a polar vortex. Just being human in this artificial world implies a definite carbon footprint — and for that matter, a trail of footprints in water use, soil compaction, habitat degradation and pesticide use. You cannot change the climate impact of Americans without changing the built American landscape.So the proposals to retrofit buildings, retool transportation and build a clean-energy system are simply ways of tackling the problem where it starts. They are public-works projects because large capital projects — especially ones that, like highways, involve widespread public benefit — have always required public money. They are jobs programs, unless robots do the work, so the jobs might as well be good. The deeper point is that any economic policy is a jobs policy. The oil and gas sector provides at least 1.4 million American jobs, more if you believe industry estimates, and depends on public subsidies and infrastructure. You might say that producing the disaster of global climate change has taken a lot of economic policy and produced a lot of jobs programs. Reversing direction will take the same. Since environmental policy can happen only through economic policy, there is no avoiding decisions about what sorts of work there will be, and in which industries. It’s unsettling, but maybe a little less so when you consider that we’ve been doing it all along, usually without owning up to it.Take the Green New Deal’s proposal to work with family farmers and ranchers to reduce the carbon footprint of agriculture. It might sound like a sop to rural representatives, the locavore caucus of the Democratic Socialists of America, or both. (And that wouldn’t make it wrong.) But food is our everyday metabolism with the natural world, which is why agriculture emits 9 percent of United States carbon, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. (Other estimates are considerably higher.)Forty percent of our land is farmed or ranched, which is to say, the soil is basically conscripted as a food factory. The food system is already pervasively shaped by the Farm Bill, which spends nearly $15 billion per year on subsidies and $10 billion on conservation measures, deeply shaping what farmers grow and where, and tending to benefit large, industrially oriented operations. Food production can be much less carbon-intensive with changed practices in cropping, fertilizing, irrigation and waste management, many of them well suited to small farming. Moving in that direction, though, would require rattling the cage of big American agriculture.As with energy, getting lawmaking involved wouldn’t be new. It has taken years of agricultural policy to get us into this mess. Getting out of it is a question not of whether lawmaking also produces economic policy and jobs, but of what kind.The Green New Deal isn’t the only approach, of course, but its broad ambitions mark out the ground where future climate fights will happen. Because reshaping our environmental impact means reworking our economy, there will inevitably be competing visions about who deserves to benefit and what kind of economy we should build. Centrist proposals will concentrate on promoting investment in new technologies, with profits going, pharma-style, to private researchers and manufacturers.If Trumpist nationalism outgrows its climate denialism but survives to fight again, it will double down on supporting national energy industries and denying the ethical responsibilities of global interdependence by building border walls against climate refugees. To the left of the Green New Deal, there will be louder calls to nationalize fossil fuels in order to leave them in the ground. (A carbon tax would be compatible with any of these visions, depending on who paid it and how the revenues were spent.)Curiously, the idea that environmental policy could ever be separated from the larger economic order, or from fights over fairness, is recent, a product of an unusually technocratic period in American politics. Arguing for the Clean Air Act on Earth Day 1970, Senator Edmund Muskie, Democrat of Maine and the law’s lead drafter, insisted that “man’s environment” included “the shape of the communities in which he lives” and that “the only kind of society that has a chance” was “a society that will not tolerate slums for some and decent houses for others, rats for some and playgrounds for others, clean air for some and filth for others.”For Senator Muskie, environmentalism meant that no neighborhood or job should be toxic. In the three years that followed, the country adopted the most ambitious and effective environmental legislation in its history, including Mr. Muskie’s Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act. Mr. Muskie’s approach remains a model of visionary environmental lawmaking. Like much new radicalism, the Green New Deal is good sense rediscovered."
348,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Bitter cold is spreading across much of North America in the wake of two storm systems that brought heavy snow from California to Maine and lethal tornadoes to the South.Search and rescue teams and volunteers rushed to help in rural Lee County, Ala., where at least 23 people were killed in a “monster tornado,” including three children, and many more were injured. The twister was categorized as an EF-4, with 170-mile-per-hour winds. A mile wide, it carved a 28-mile track of devastation.The death toll — higher than the nation’s total for all of last year — is expected to rise._____2. The Democrats revealed the breadth of their efforts to investigate President Trump and his administration for possible obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power.Jerrold Nadler, pictured above in February, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, sent demands for documents to 81 agencies, individuals and other entities including the White House; the Justice Department; the F.B.I.; Jared Kushner; David Pecker, chairman of The National Enquirer’s publisher; the Trump campaign; the Trump Foundation; and the presidential inaugural committee.Also included: Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization official who was repeatedly named by Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, in his public testimony last week when asked who would have insight into any financial irregularities._____3. More news from Washington:Four Republican senators have now said they will support the resolution to block President Trump’s emergency declaration: Rand Paul of Kentucky joined Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Thom Tillis of North Carolina.If Democrats remain united, the measure will pass in the Senate next week — a stern rebuke to Mr. Trump’s efforts to take control of federal spending to build his border wall. Above, a section in Nogales, Ariz.Far from Washington, the reporter who wrote our investigation of sexual violence at the U.S.-Mexico border gave us a look at an unusual courtroom moment from 2017, when an undocumented woman who broke her silence about the smuggler who sexually assaulted her was comforted by the judge, who happened to be the daughter of migrant farmworkers._____4. The field of Democrats vying to run for president in 2020 grew yet larger. Keep count with our candidate tracker.John Hickenlooper, 67, a two-time Colorado governor and a pro-business social progressive, focused on a national “crisis of division” when he announced on “Good Morning America.”But some of the hopefuls are focused on fighting climate change, notably Washington’s governor, Jay Inslee, who joined the race last week.And Senate Democrats, facing a showdown vote soon over the embattled “Green New Deal,” are preparing to make climate a central issue of their own 2020 campaigns._____5. A trade deal with China is close, according to people with knowledge of the talks. Above, workers transport imported soybean products at a port in Nantong, Jiangsu Province.The deal would roll back tariffs on both sides of the Pacific if China alters economic policies that prevent American companies from operating there. In Beijing, the National People’s Congress is poised to approve a string of sweeping new foreign investment rules, but in legislation made up of many single-sentence broad pronouncements.At the same time, the tug of war over the Chinese tech giant Huawei continues. Its financial chief, Meng Wanzhou, is awaiting an extradition hearing on Wednesday in Vancouver, where she has become both a subject of curiosity and a polarizing figure._____6. News from the tech world.Google, which has been accused before of underpaying women, conducted its annual study of internal pay imbalances. The results yielded a head-scratcher: more men than women being underpaid (and so more corrective raises for men).The company said the study did not address broader issues of gender inequity, and that it also needed to weigh factors like whether newly hired employees were assigned to appropriate pay levels.And our columnist Kevin Roose found a cautionary tale for the tech giants pursuing military contracts: Dow Chemical’s Vietnam-era agreement to produce napalm, one of the most notorious military contracts of the past century._____7. Juan Guaidó, the Venezuelan opposition leader,  returned to the country to greet cheering crowds after violating a travel ban to leave in the first place.“We just got through passport control and will head where our people are!” he posted on Twitter from the airport in Caracas. It was not immediately clear whether he would be detained by government security forces. President Nicolás Maduro’s government has said Mr. Guaidó violated restrictions on his travel and could face arrest.Meanwhile, the Trump administration escalated its warnings toward the Maduro government, saying that any violence or threats would be met with a swift response._____8. The second part of HBO’s “Leaving Neverland,” which details sexual abuse allegations against Michael Jackson, premieres tonight (8 p.m. Eastern).It will immediately be followed, on HBO and OWN, by “After Neverland,” in which the director and the two men who accuse Jackson speak with Oprah Winfrey before an audience of abuse survivors.After the first part of “Leaving Neverland” aired on Sunday, Jackson’s fans came out in full force to defend him on social media, blogs, message boards, podcasts and YouTube videos. The director, Dan Reed, called them “the Islamic State of fandom.”Read our critic’s conclusion — that the documentary breaks the spell Michael Jackson once cast — and our recaps._____9. Luke Perry, the actor who became famous in the ’90s as the bad-boy heartthrob Dylan McKay on “Beverly Hills, 90210,” died on Monday. He was 52.His family said he had been hospitalized since suffering a stroke last Wednesday.The writer and director Joss Whedon, who worked with Mr. Perry on the 1992 movie “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” said on Twitter that he was “Funny, committed, and always gracious. He shouldn’t be gone.” Read our appraisal.Also,  Keith Flint, 49, a founding member of the British dance act the Prodigy, was found dead in England. A bandmate said he had killed himself._____10.

Rising numbers of researchers, new fossil finds and high-tech tools of analysis — CT scans, chemical analyses, new microscopic techniques and the like — have created “a golden age.”Among the discoveries: T. rex emerged from much smaller tyrannosaurs late in the age of the dinosaurs, with a big brain, a shortish life span — and feathers.Have a colossal evening.Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

349,"WASHINGTON — The Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives was a blessing in disguise for a president who needed a foil, Republicans predicted last November. President Trump, who had only the press and the special counsel to battle with, they said, would find a useful antagonist in Speaker Nancy Pelosi.It hasn’t exactly turned out that way.After a series of misadventures, Mr. Trump has conspicuously laid off personal attacks aimed at Ms. Pelosi. Even as the standoff over funding a border wall appears to be finally ending with a deal seen as a defeat for the president, he has blamed unnamed Democrats but not their most prominent leader. And there has been no undermining Trumpian nickname — the president has said his moniker for Ms. Pelosi is, simply, “Nancy.”Mr. Trump, who once stalked Hillary Clinton, the former Democratic nominee, around the presidential debate stage and continues to encourage “lock her up” chants at his rallies more than two years later, simply gazed up at Ms. Pelosi during his State of the Union address — and then found himself the target of ridicule for the picture of her giving him what appeared to be a dismissive clap of the hands.“She has a unified Democratic caucus behind her, and she’s not intimidated,” said Representative Katherine M. Clark, Democrat of Massachusetts. “I don’t think that Donald Trump has run into that too often in his life, and he doesn’t know quite what to make of it all.”Without his anticipated punching bag, Mr. Trump has been left searching for an alternative, delivering haphazard attacks on Democrats as they announce their presidential campaigns, trial-and-error hits on an inchoate field of 2020 contenders.The question is whether a strategy of personal attacks that helped lift Mr. Trump to victory in 2016 will work when there’s no clear political opponent who rises above the rest.“Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!”Giving it right back, Ms. Klobuchar responded, “I wonder how your hair would fare in a blizzard?”On Saturday, Mr. Trump officially welcomed Senator Elizabeth Warren to the presidential field, writing on Twitter: “Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!”At a rally in El Paso on Monday night, Mr. Trump attacked Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman who is considering a presidential bid. “We were challenged by a young man who lost an election to Ted Cruz,” Mr. Trump said. “They said, ‘Hey, you’re supposed to win in order to run.’ By the way we — I — I’m one for one.”Democratic operatives predicted Mr. Trump’s attempts to personally demonize his political opponents won’t work when it’s not one on one.“He’s better with a foil, but unless he can hone in on one or two people, it ends up being less than the sum of its parts,” said Brian Fallon, a former press secretary for Mrs. Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. “If he’s scattershot weighing in on everyone who announces a presidential campaign, it’s not going to have the intended effect.”Mr. Trump’s allies disagree. “The Democratic field is both undefined and starting out with positions on the far left,” said Raj Shah, a former White House spokesman who is now advising Mr. Trump’s 2020 campaign. “Raising the profile of these out-of-touch positions and their controversies plays to the president’s advantage.”Some of Mr. Trump’s attacks appear to be doing just that. Ms. Warren, whom Mr. Trump has long viewed as an easy target, has apologized for identifying herself as Native American for two decades, essentially admitting that she did what Mr. Trump has accused her of: misrepresenting her race.Republican National Committee officials said they credited Mr. Trump with forcing the Native American issue back to the forefront. “The president reignited the conversation about her false Native American heritage claims last year, and she still can’t move past it,” said Ronna McDaniel, the committee’s chairwoman.But in general, his denigration of Democratic presidential candidates is not being guided by any field data from his campaign about who his most viable opponent is, and what the candidates’ biggest weaknesses are, according to a campaign operative.Trump officials said they viewed Senator Cory Booker, Senator Kamala Harris and Ms. Warren as the three most viable candidates, so far, to enter the race. But Mr. Trump has not landed on a strategy for diminishing Ms. Harris, and has praised her instead. “I would say, the best opening so far would be Kamala Harris,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times last month. “Better crowd, better enthusiasm. Some of the others were very flat.”Meanwhile, he has weighed in on candidates considered second tier, as well as those who have yet to enter the race.Ms. Klobuchar’s snow-blanketed kickoff rally turned into a briefly viral moment that Mr. Trump simply couldn’t pass up, the operative said. His strikes against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has yet to decide whether he will run, appear to be in the workshop phase.“When I say something that you might think is a gaffe, it’s on purpose; it’s not a gaffe,” Mr. Trump said at a recent off-the-record lunch with network anchors. “When Biden says something dumb, it’s because he’s dumb.”Rather than individuals, Mr. Trump’s campaign operatives, meanwhile, are hoping to elevate Democratic positions that seem out of step with the mainstream, like a 70 percent top tax rate, abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement and questioning American support for Israel.The only presidential tweet backed by political advice, they said, was Mr. Trump’s broadside against the “Green New Deal,” an ambitious Democratic proposal that seeks to combat climate change by calling for the United States to eliminate additional carbon emissions by 2030.Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, discussed the Green New Deal with Mr. Trump, an aide said, citing it as an example of a vulnerability for Democrats, and a way to brand them as “socialists.”“I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday. “It would be great for the so-called ‘Carbon Footprint’ to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military — even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!”"
350,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. A bipartisan push to end the U.S. shutdown, France and Germany renew their vows, and the White House backs Venezuela’s opposition. Here’s the latest: Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, announced a bipartisan effort that could reopen the government for a few weeks and allow President Trump to deliver his State of the Union address. Chances of success: slim. Details: The Senate will vote on two competing bills on Thursday: a measure backed by Mr. Trump that includes funding for his wall, and a short-term spending bill favored by Democrats that would fund shuttered agencies through Feb. 8 without a wall. Neither measure is likely to get the needed votes, but there was hope that they could augur more cooperation.Behind the scenes: In single-minded pursuit of a border wall, Mr. Trump has virtually pressed pause on the rest of his agenda.Go deeper: The shutdown has forced some of the unpaid 800,000 federal workers to enter the gig economy to make ends meet. Here’s a roundup of all our other shutdown coverage.Two and a half years ago, 52 percent of British voters expressed support for leaving the E.U. But public opinion has flipped, with a slight majority now in favor of remaining, and a second referendum is thought likelier than ever. But would it do any good? Analysis: Experts say that referendums tend to be highly imperfect measures of public opinion. Illustrating this, many of the voters who selected “leave” in 2016 had very different, and mutually exclusive, ideas about how that would work, leaving Parliament to try to sort it out.Effects: A second referendum could deepen the chaos created by the first, our columnist argues. Whatever the result, half the public would probably feel cheated, undercutting an already shaky faith in British democracy. And then there’s the problem of getting a divided Parliament to agree to a ballot and decide which options to include.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France — representing countries that for ages waged ruinous wars against each other — met in a German city to renew the Élysée Treaty of 1963 that established comity between the two countries as the bedrock for a united Europe. But the ceremony was a reminder of the Continent’s current instability. “Seventy-four years after the end of World War II — a lifetime — things considered self-evident are again being called into question,” Ms. Merkel said.Breakdown: The new accord pledges to deepen Franco-German economic integration and diplomatic coordination as well as military cooperation, with an eye toward making Europe less dependent on the U.S. Critics said that the agreement was relatively weak, and many smaller E.U. countries looked askance at the renewed friendship, seeing it as domineering. Moreover, Mr. Macron is largely reviled at home and Ms. Merkel is on her way out, threatening to open a void at the center of the European project. In Britain, the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei donated to top schools, held parties for political leaders and sponsored a charity founded by Prince Charles. In Germany, it sponsored the recent convention of the governing Christian Democratic Union.Europe is now Huawei’s biggest market outside China, generating $20 billion in revenue together with the Middle East and Africa in 2017 — about a quarter of its total business. That’s the result of a 15-year campaign to cultivate closer ties with European governments.Why it matters: Europe, like the U.S., is now beginning to turn on Huawei over concerns that its technology is being used for espionage. The U.S. plans to ask Canada to extradite a top Huawei executive within the next week. European officials are considering restrictions, companies are reassessing deals and organizations are returning donations.But untangling may be difficult, as Huawei’s equipment plays a crucial role in Europe’s wireless infrastructure. Severing ties could delay hyperfast 5G networks.Huawei’s response: The company has consistently denied wrongdoing. But as criticism mounts, it is working to ease concerns, including by allowing German officials to inspect its engineering and code.Venezuela: Vice President Mike Pence offered the most explicit American backing yet for the opposition movement trying to unseat President Nicolás Maduro, declaring “unwavering support” for planned mass protests. Chris Brown: The R&B singer was released without charges after being questioned in Paris over accusations of rape, according to the authorities there. Mr. Brown has been involved in a string of violent episodes over the past few years.Russia: In a surprise move, an escort from Belarus who once claimed to have information about Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election was released from detention in Moscow, her lawyer said.Davos: With President Trump a no-show at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, Brazil’s new leader, Jair Bolsonaro, the so-called Trump of the Tropics, has taken up the populist mantle at the event.U.S. Supreme Court: The justices voted 5 to 4 to allow President Trump’s policy barring transgender people from serving in the military to go into effect temporarily while court challenges proceeded.The Oscars: Netflix received its first best picture Oscar nomination for “Roma,” which will be competing against “Black Panther” and “A Star Is Born,” among others. Here’s a complete list of nominees and a look at all the snubs and surprises.Climate change: A record number of Americans now believe that global warming is a real threat, according to a new survey. Soccer: Emiliano Sala, a player who recently moved to the English Premier League, and a pilot are feared dead after the small airplane they were on disappeared over the English Channel. New Zealand: The unruly behavior of a British family touring the country — from refusing to pick up garbage left on a beach to throwing food on a cafe floor — captured locals’ unease about a boom in tourism.Tips for a more fulfilling life.Recipe of the day: Pick up some harissa, a North African chile paste, and make spicy chickpea soup.How to handle the dreaded “Reply All moment.”Athletes’ strategies can prepare you for life’s discomforts — and open your mind.World leaders and chief executives are converging in Davos, Switzerland, for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum.The global elite come to discuss the world’s problems — and maybe squeeze in some skiing.Long before the forum existed, Davos was linked to Europe’s bourgeoisie as the setting of “The Magic Mountain,” the 1924 novel by Thomas Mann. It’s regarded as one of the greatest works in modern literature.We asked Pamela Paul, the editor of the Book Review, what today’s readers should know about the book, which follows a wealthy young German through seven years in a tuberculosis sanitarium just ahead of World War I.“Many people read it as a metaphor for the sickness of Europe on the brink of war,” she answered. “Well-heeled invalids gather indefinitely, for a cure that doesn’t necessarily come — perhaps deliberately. The longer they stay, the greater the owner’s profits.“They spend their days gossiping, pursuing love affairs and having abstract arguments that never reach any decisive resolution.”Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.Check out this page to find a Morning Briefing for your region.

351,"The last government shutdown ended because Democrats stood firm against President Trump’s border wall. But funding will soon run out again, talks between Democrats and Republicans are in crisis, and Mr. Trump remains committed: “The Wall will get built one way or the other!” he tweeted on Saturday.The Senate’s minority leader, Chuck Schumer, has made it clear that Mr. Trump won’t get his way: “Democrats are against the wall.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has admirably enforced party discipline, has called the wall “immoral.”Yet at the same time, Ms. Pelosi has emphasized that “Democrats are committed to border security.” She has critiqued the wall on the narrow grounds that government should instead employ “evidence-based knowledge about how we best secure our border.” James Clyburn, the majority whip, fleshed out what that might look like: a “smart wall,” including more Border Patrol agents. This, too, is immoral.It’s also bad politics. Democrats should follow their voters, who increasingly want more open borders, and reframe the immigration debate by rejecting the very notion that the border needs more “security” and making it clear that the real problem is the denial of migrants’ rights. The time has come for the Democratic Party to push for concrete policies to make the border more open.There is plainly no need for more security on the border. Illegal entries to the United States (as measured by Border Patrol apprehensions, which the government has long used as a proxy) began to fall at the turn of the century, and have plummeted since 2006. They remain at historic lows today. Those who are coming to the country are often Central Americans fleeing violence that United States policy in the region helped foment.And when it comes to drugs — a favorite justification of Mr. Trump’s for his wall — evidence shows that more “border security” does not stop trafficking. From the 1970s on, every crackdown on a drug-smuggling route, whether it was heroin via the French Connection or cocaine through the Caribbean, has only led to new innovations in the trade that have empowered murderous Mexican cartels. Some scholars even argue that the rise of fentanyl can be traced to drug interdiction.Then why, if there isn’t truly a crisis on the border, do the Democrats continue to invoke the need for more “border security”? Largely because the conversation about the border and immigration has moved so far to the right over the past 30 years. As the linguist George Lakoff and Sam Ferguson, his student at the time, wrote more than a decade ago, the narrow framing of the “immigration” debate “has shaped its politics, defining what count as ‘problems’” and, as a result, “constrains the solutions needed to address that problem.” When the “problem” is defined as “illegal immigration,” it becomes about “the illegal act of crossing the border without papers,” and so “the logical response to the ‘wave’ of ‘illegal immigration’ becomes ‘border security.’”Since Bill Clinton’s presidency, the Border Patrol has grown from 4,100 agents in fiscal year 1992 to more than 19,000 today. The United States has built hundreds of miles of border fencing since the 2006 Secure Fence Act, which Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton voted for. “Well, I voted for border security, and some of it was a fence,” Mrs. Clinton feebly said in 2016 when pressed about the 2006 vote that within a decade had become controversial.Democrats have for far too long let their political opponents define the terms of debate. Now they’re doing it again: House Democrats’ proposal heading into the negotiations with Republicans didn’t include funding for new physical barriers or additional Border Patrol agents, but it did offer significantly increased funding for “border security technology.”That’s not only bad for immigrants who, as a result of militarized borders are more likely to be kidnapped, violently assaulted and driven to cross via the lethal desert. It’s also bad for Democrats, who are handing ammunition to the nativist right at a time when Republicans are on the back foot and polls show that Democratic voters are moving decidedly leftward on immigration and the border.[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]Voters used to overwhelmingly favor less immigration, but opinions have changed fast amid an immigrant rights movement that took off in 2006 and partisan polarization driven by aggressive enforcement. In 1994, just 32 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning Americans and 30 percent of Republicans agreed that immigrants strengthened the country, according to the Pew Research Center. But by 2016, the share of Democrats who said so had skyrocketed to 78 percent. In 2006, 37 percent of Democrats said that immigration levels should be decreased, while only 20 percent said that it should be increased. In 2018, 40 percent said that it should be increased, with just 16 percent calling for restriction. The same trend has held on border politics: In 2010, 47 percent of Democrats said that they equally prioritized legalizing undocumented immigrants and “better border security and stronger enforcement of immigration laws,” while just 29 percent prioritized legalization alone. By 2018, the number prioritizing legalization alone skyrocketed to 51 percent.Under President Trump, polarization has accelerated — and that’s a good thing. The vanishing bipartisan consensus orchestrated mammoth deportations and militarized the border in the quixotic hope of placating the nativist right and winning it over to supporting immigration reform. This strategy only inflamed the right’s paranoiac ravings and helped move the goal posts to new extremes. Which is why we find ourselves, in 2019, with the possibility of beginning a second government shutdown over the wall.So, what should the Democrats pursue instead? A break with a failed bipartisan consensus.Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib, all Democrats who are new to the House, have drafted a letter urging opposition to any deal that increases Department of Homeland Security funding in any form. That’s a good start.The border must be demilitarized, which would include demolishing the already-existing wall and dramatically downsizing the Border Patrol. Criminal sanctions on illegal entry and re-entry must be repealed. Opportunities for legal immigration, particularly from Mexico and Central America, must be expanded. The right to asylum must be honored. And citizenship for those who reside here must be a stand-alone cause, unencumbered by compromises that are not only distasteful but also politically ineffectual — and that today would provoke opposition from the nativist right and the grass-roots left. If Democrats stick to the center on immigration, they will find themselves fighting on two fronts. A fight against Republicans, with the left at their back, will be far easier to win — and a more noble victory.Simple realism dictates that no legislation to grant citizenship to the millions of undocumented Americans who deserve it will be passed until the Republicans are defeated. There’s no use trying to appease them. The bipartisan consensus supporting harsh immigration and border enforcement has fractured. Democratic elected officials need to catch up."
352,"It was a week with a crushing streak of news, so we’ll break it down into manageable parts. 1. In Washington:President Trump’s former lawyer and personal fixer, above, painted a damning picture of life inside the president’s inner circle.While Democrats are not likely to immediately pursue impeachment, Michael Cohen’s statements may open a new phase of political turbulence for Mr. Trump heading into the 2020 election.Here are five takeaways from Mr. Cohen’s testimony.We also reported that Mr. Trump ordered in May that Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, be given a top-secret security clearance, overruling officials’ concerns. House Democrats are demanding more information about the matter.Congress was busy elsewhere on Capitol Hill: The House passed two major gun control bills after two decades of inaction. And Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, was confirmed to be the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.Have you been keeping up with the headlines?

On the international front:Talks between President Trump and the North Korean leader to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons abruptly collapsed, with both Mr. Trump and Kim Jong-un walking away empty-handed. Above, the leaders in Hanoi, Vietnam, this week.Our reporters look at how the summit failed after two years of threats, hubris and misjudgment on both sides. Experts think North Korea may take this as an opportunity to continue building out its nuclear arsenal, and tensions are likely to resume.In Afghanistan, American negotiators and Taliban officials are getting closer to an agreement to end the nearly 18-year war in Afghanistan.____3. President Trump may have a surprising new ally along the southern border — the Mexican government.Mexican authorities are blocking groups of migrants at border towns and aiding tough asylum policies, carrying out the Trump administration’s immigration agenda across widespread stretches of the border. Above, migrants seeking asylum in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, in January.But Mr. Trump’s agenda is facing growing pushback in the U.S. from Congress: The House voted this week to block the president’s declaration of national emergency to fund his border wall; the Senate is expected to take up the bill in mid-March. And Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of Homeland Security, is scheduled to testify before Congress on Wednesday about the administration’s border security policies.To read more stories about life on the ground at the U.S.-Mexico border, sign up for our limited-run newsletter, Crossing the Border.____4. We also looked at two growing leadership scandals abroad.In Israel, the attorney general said he plans to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on bribery and other corruption charges. The announcement came just 40 days before Mr. Netanyahu is to stand for re-election. If the case proceeds, Mr. Netanyahu, pictured above this week, would be the first sitting prime minister to be indicted.Between the corruption charges and a stiff electoral challenge, Israelis are pondering what a post-Netanyahu Israel would look like.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada is also embroiled in scandal. He and his aides are accused of pressuring a former minister to drop a criminal inquiry, with elections just seven months away.____5. A recent Florida massage parlor sting exposed a secretive underworld of human trafficking: A $3 billion-a-year industry where many mostly foreign women work as prostitutes to pay debts to smugglers, spa owners and lawyers.A spa in Jupiter, Fla., caught the attention of the nation when a sweep led to the arrest of Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots. Law enforcement officials said there were an estimated 9,000 illicit massage parlors across the country, from Orlando to Los Angeles. Above, a spa in Hobe Sound, Fla., was shut down after an investigation into prostitution and human trafficking.____6. SpaceX and NASA launched the Crew Dragon capsule to the International Space Station — the first American spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts since the shuttle was retired in 2011.The capsule carried no crew, but the success sets up a near future with astronauts traveling to orbit from the United States again, possibly as soon as the end of the year. NASA astronauts have flown to the International Space Station aboard a Russian spacecraft for the past eight years.In other space news, the universe appears to be expanding faster than expected.

Above, Mr. Jackson and one of his accusers, Wade Robson, in 1990.Mr. Jackson’s estate has already begun its war on “Leaving Neverland” and is seeking $100 million in damages from HBO.“There has always been this shadow or cloud about Michael,” said a former financial adviser to Mr. Jackson, who died nearly 10 years ago. “With this documentary about to be shown to millions and millions of people, and all the notoriety that it’s now getting, I think it will have a detrimental effect to the legacy and the estate.”____8. $330 million.Bryce Harper’s 13-year deal with the Philadelphia Phillies is the richest in baseball history. At 26 years old, and given the length of the contract, Harper has more or less bound himself to the team for the remainder of his career — and a sports culture all its own, our baseball columnist writes. Mr. Harper, above in September, was last with the Washington Nationals.Stars like Harper aside, baseball players are struggling to get the contracts they want. Is there something they can learn from basketball players?“It feels like baseball lives in the past, and that undercuts player power,” one historian said. “Whereas the N.B.A. imagines itself as the future, and it has to create a world in which players have more power.”____9.

353,"Iowa’s two Republican senators on Saturday condemned Representative Steve King’s remark questioning why white supremacy is considered offensive, the latest blowback from party leaders who remained largely silent over the years as the G.O.P. congressman made racist remarks and demeaning insults about immigrants.Mr. King, a longtime Iowa lawmaker who narrowly won re-election in November, drew rebukes from Democrats as well and sparked talk of a House censure resolution this week after The New York Times published an article about Mr. King’s influence on President Trump, the border wall debate and the intensification of white identity politics in the Republican Party. In an interview with The Times, Mr. King said at one point: “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?”Reflecting on the record number of black people and women in the new Congress, he added: “You could look over there and think the Democratic Party is no country for white men.”[Read Steve King’s remarks to The Times and his history of influence with President Trump.]On Saturday morning Iowa Senator Joni Ernst wrote on Twitter: “I condemn Rep. Steve King’s comments on white supremacy; they are offensive and racist — and not representative of our state of Iowa.” She linked the tweet to an opinion article published Friday by Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, a fellow Republican and the Senate’s lone black G.O.P. member, who called out his party for staying silent on racist comments.Iowa’s senior senator, Charles E. Grassley, also criticized Mr. King in remarks to Axios published Saturday. Mr. Grassley had endorsed Mr. King in November for re-election, even after another Republican leader had denounced Mr. King as a white supremacist.“Iowa needs Steve King in Congress. I also need Steve King in Congress,” Mr. Grassley said in that endorsement.Before this week, Iowa’s senior Republicans often courted Mr. King and his supporters. Ms. Ernst appeared with him at a rally in his district the Monday before Election Day, after he had endorsed a Toronto mayoral candidate with neo-Nazi ties. Gov. Kim Reynolds named Mr. King a co-chair of her 2018 campaign and declined to distance herself when pressed before the election, saying, “I can’t be held responsible for everyone’s comments.”Mr. King has made racist comments for more than a decade that party leaders have mostly ignored. But his statements published Thursday in The Times went further than ever, triggering a barrage of public criticism from top House Republicans as well as a former G.O.P. presidential candidate and conservatives in the media.Mr. King took to the House floor on Friday to try to explain his remarks, saying he was “simply an American nationalist.” He did not apologize for his remarks to The Times.In a statement on Saturday, the Congressional Black Caucus called for Mr. King to be stripped of his committee assignments. The chairwoman of the committee, Karen Bass, a Democrat of California, said in the statement, “Like Donald Trump, Steve King has sought again and again to give comfort to white supremacists, something that should never be allowed in the halls of Congress or the Oval Office.”House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, was among the party leaders who denounced him. “Steve’s language is reckless, wrong and has no place in our society,” Mr. McCarthy said.Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-highest ranking Republican in the House, wrote in a tweet that Mr. King’s remarks “are abhorrent and racist and should have no place in our national discourse.”Mr. Scott’s opinion column in The Washington Post focused on criticizing his party for frequently failing to condemn people like Mr. King.“Some in our party wonder why Republicans are constantly accused of racism — it is because of our silence when things like this are said,” Mr. Scott said.In a statement after The Times article was published online, and in a six-minute speech in the House on Friday, Mr. King strenuously denied that he was a white nationalist or white supremacist.“I reject those labels and the evil ideology they define,” he said. He did not dispute making the original remarks, but argued that he was raising a historical question about how and when the phrases came to be used to criticize people.Mr. King, a 69-year-old former bulldozer operator who is in his ninth term, began his speech by saying he had made “a freshman mistake” by speaking to The Times.“I regret the heartburn that has poured forth upon this Congress and this country and especially in my state and in my congressional district,” he said.There were rumblings in the House on Friday about trying to formally reprimand Mr. King. Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, said that he was considering drafting a House resolution censuring him. And at least one top Democratic leader, Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, the highest ranking African-American in Congress, told CNN he would support Mr. Ryan’s move.Still, it was far from clear that Democrats would actually follow through. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned the comments and acknowledged Democratic interest in taking some action, but said late Friday she was not prepared to make any announcements.Democrats are focused on the shutdown fight with the president and may be inclined to let Republicans sort out their own dirty laundry.And strategists in both parties said the reaction, to some degree, reflects the degree to which Mr. King has become a millstone for his party. If Mr. King is on the ballot in 2020, they say, it could benefit Democrats by depressing support for the Senate re-election effort of Ms. Ernst in Iowa.“What I don’t like is he’s a drag on all our candidates and an in-kind contribution to Pelosi,” said David Kochel, a Republican strategist in Iowa.Two Iowa Republicans announced this week they would challenge Mr. King in a primary in 2020 for his Fourth District seat. He will likely face severe difficulties in raising money if he seeks re-election.Jeb Bush, the former 2016 presidential candidate, wrote on Twitter, “Republican leaders must actively support a worthy primary opponent to defeat King, because he won’t have the decency to resign.”The conservative National Review published an editorial on Friday: “Dump Steve King.”"
354,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has insisted that he is not going to compromise with Democrats to end the government shutdown, and that he is comfortable in his unbendable position. But privately, it’s sometimes a different story.“We are getting crushed!” Mr. Trump told his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, after watching some recent coverage of the shutdown, according to one person familiar with the conversation. “Why can’t we get a deal?”The president is confronted by a divided and partially shuttered government with an untested staff that has undergone yet another shake-up. Polls show that most Americans blame him for the government shutdown, and his advisers are warning him of its negative effects on the economy. And as the shutdown enters its 27th day on Thursday with no end in sight, most of his top aides would like him to find a way out.Mr. Trump has told them he believes over time the country will not remember the shutdown, but it will remember that he staged a fight over his insistence that the southern border be protected. He wants Democrats to come back to the table agreeing with his position on a wall, and he does not understand why they have not.But despite his public bravado, and the tweets about “Radical Democrats,” Mr. Trump has had recurring moments of frustration as he takes in negative news coverage of the shutdown, pointing his finger at aides for not delivering the deal he wants. Yet the aides say that the president believes he is still playing a strong hand and that any moments of frustration have been fleeting.Some of his fellow Republicans are wondering if there is actually a plan on how to achieve that deal. “The White House and its allies have to have a sense of clarity and a sense of achievement on this, and in order to get there you really do have to have a much broader strategy from the beginning,” said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist. “This has largely been driven by a reaction to the latest 30 minutes of a cable news cycle.”To the extent there has been a strategy, aides have encouraged Mr. Trump to use his State of the Union address, scheduled for Jan. 29, to move public opinion to his side, an opportunity now threatened by Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s request on Wednesday to delay the speech or scrap it all together. But the president shrugged off his Democratic antagonist’s bold move, and did not even mention it at a lunch with a bipartisan group of House members on Wednesday, according to an attendee.The president remained silent on Twitter for much of Wednesday, and Democrats who met with Mr. Trump said they found him to be in a congenial mood. “It was productive and constructive,” said Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, one of seven Democrats who attended the meeting.The meeting, aides said, had been intended to show moderate Democrats just that — that the caricature of Mr. Trump throwing a “temper tantrum” and storming out of a meeting, painted last week by Ms. Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, does not capture the whole picture.Behind the scenes, meanwhile, the White House is in a moment of transition as West Wing staff members become acclimated to the leadership style of a new chief of staff. Mr. Mulvaney, a former congressman from South Carolina, has told aides he has no plans to duplicate the type of chain-of-command structure preferred by John F. Kelly, the retired Marine general he replaced. Nor did he want to limit anyone’s access to Mr. Trump.“You’re all adults,” Mr. Mulvaney told the White House staff members in attendance, according to an administration official in the room. “You all have relationships with him.” Mr. Mulvaney said he was not interested in managing those relationships himself.Mr. Mulvaney, who started in an acting capacity on Jan. 3, after the shutdown was underway, has more experience as a principal than as a staff member. While serving as director of the Office of Budget and Management, he was not particularly close with Mr. Trump, who aides said came to admire his skills on television.Under Mr. Mulvaney, some of the rules of the Kelly era have been undone. Access to the Oval Office, for one thing, is easier. Where Mr. Kelly’s instinct was often to keep extra bodies out of meetings, now aides who want to attend meetings are welcome to grab a chair in the back and sit in.In his meeting with his staff, Mr. Mulvaney brandished a copy of “The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency,” by the author Chris Whipple, sharing passages about successful management models from past administrations.Mr. Mulvaney stressed that he didn’t need to always be in the room with the president or to sign off on everything. But, he said, he wanted to be kept in the loop.Unlike his predecessors, according to White House officials, Mr. Mulvaney is not interested in challenging what has revealed itself to be the one constant in the Trump White House: the special status reserved for Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, the president’s family members and senior advisers, in the West Wing.Mr. Mulvaney’s more hands-off approach to the family members has allowed Mr. Kushner to position himself among lawmakers on Capitol Hill as the person who can deliver to Mr. Trump what he wants. The dynamic, according to multiple White House officials, is similar to the opening days of the administration, when the staff to the new president was just beginning to meet with Washington officials and Mr. Kushner often told people that “everything runs through me.”This time, however, Mr. Mulvaney is doing nothing to curb his influence. In fact, he is treating Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump as assets, rather than rivals. And they are seeing a new ally. On Sunday night they hosted Mr. Mulvaney and his wife at their Kalorama mansion for a social dinner.His appearance in B-roll shots on cable news channels, traipsing the halls of Congress shoulder to shoulder with Vice President Mike Pence, have left current and former Trump aides frustrated with the appearance that Mr. Kushner is serving as a de facto chief of staff. Multiple White House officials said he is ascendant in the West Wing after his successful role in helping to pass a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill.But people close to Mr. Kushner insist that he is simply trying to provide assistance during a difficult period and is not looking to undermine Mr. Mulvaney’s role, while Mr. Kushner has insisted he is planning to return to his longer-term projects when the shutdown is over.Under Mr. Kelly, any conversations with elected officials were required to be coordinated through the former legislative affairs director, Marc Short. But during Mr. Mulvaney’s tenure, Mr. Kushner has reached out to Democratic lawmakers and then briefed Shahira Knight, the legislative director, on his calls after the fact. The new system has been greenlighted by Mr. Mulvaney, who has also shrugged off any issue with Mr. Kushner taking a lead role.But it is not clear that Mr. Kushner’s outreach, or any relationships he has forged over the past two years with Democratic lawmakers, has resulted in any movement in getting Mr. Trump the success he is seeking in funding the border wall.A senior White House aide said on Wednesday night that the view from inside the White House was that neither side was willing to take the leap and compromise. And Mr. Trump’s ability to make a national emergency declaration, the aide said, was still an option that was on the table."
355,"MCALLEN, Tex. — President Trump was briefed near a county park on the Rio Grande on Thursday on the perils of drugs and violence seeping across the Mexican border. But the river he visited has seen its share of both treachery and normalcy.Just a few months earlier, a short walk from the spot where Mr. Trump stood, two retired Border Patrol agents had set off from the park in their boat. They were testing a new engine in anticipation of a fishing trip. They cracked open some Bud Lights, but the engine died while they were on the water, and on-duty Border Patrol agents, old friends of the guys in the boat, sped out on the river to give them a tow.There were no migrants apprehended, no heroin seizures. It was just one ordinary, leisurely moment on a border that hums with a continuing stream of migrants — and the easy rhythms of day-to-day life — amid a swirling national controversy over proposals to extend a massive wall along its banks.The border depicted by the president and the one lived by most McAllen-area residents are two very different places. The collision between the border’s reality and how it is being portrayed for those thousands of miles away came sharply into focus on Thursday during Mr. Trump’s trip to McAllen, where he met with local, state and federal officials amid protests and counterprotests.Mr. Trump carried his message of border security to a majority-Hispanic city of 142,000 that has been on the front lines of the surge in Central American families coming into the United States.Preliminary plans are underway to expand some border fencing in parts of the Rio Grande Valley, but McAllen has a well-honed infrastructure to handle migrants, both legal and illegal. Many here have been frustrated that the city has become the symbol of a faraway political debate so entrenched it has shut down parts of the federal government.“On the one hand, I don’t like my city being portrayed as if there’s a crisis and unrest, when the reality is we’re one of the safest cities in the U.S.,” said Monica Stewart, a longtime resident and small-business owner who has advised lawmakers on border security and international trade issues.Ms. Stewart does not believe the border wall Mr. Trump wants to build is necessary, and said there were better ways to improve border security using technology.McAllen — which was named for the family that settled in the area in the early 1900s — is a largely blue city, with scores of Hispanic Democrats who help run its municipal agencies, courts, schools and businesses. Many of them were critical Thursday of the president’s visit and said they believed he had manufactured a border crisis to sell his plan for a wall.But McAllen and the larger Rio Grande Valley region are also home to small but vocal numbers of Hispanic conservatives. Many are from middle-class Mexican-American families who have lived in the area for generations and do not identify with the Central American migrants fleeing poverty and violence.Like much else about life on the border, McAllen is never quite what people imagine it to be.One of the most frequent places to run into Border Patrol agents in McAllen is not on the border itself but at Wingstop or Buffalo Wings & Rings. McAllen has synagogues and country clubs. Its biggest employer is the local school district and community college. Its tallest building is the 17-story Chase Tower, home to real estate developers and Senator Ted Cruz’s district office.And its politics are far from predictable.As the president traveled through town, all he had to do was look out the motorcade’s windows to see a mix of opposition and support for his visit. Parts of the route were lined with protesters who waved signs — “Our home is not a crisis” and “No al muro” (Spanish for “No to the wall”) — and with Trump supporters who had their own signs.At one moment on the protester side, police officers wrestled at least one person to the ground as tempers flared.The McAllen police said two people were arrested following a confrontation between Trump supporters and protesters.Joe Cantu, a 75-year-old Trump backer who wore a red Make America Great Again hat and matching T-shirt, parked at a mall near the airport and was preparing to join a crowd of fellow supporters who gathered to cheer the president’s visit. Some held flags and signs reading “Build the Wall” and “Latinos for Trump.”“Hell yeah, we need a wall,” said Mr. Cantu, a South Texas native who is the former police chief of the nearby town of San Juan.Mr. Trump at one point walked over to dozens of supporters gathered at the airport.“Oh, I like that,” Mr. Trump said when a supporter handed him a military baseball cap with “Trump” emblazoned on the front.Joaquin Zamora, a city commissioner who was part of a contingent of officials and supporters who greeted Mr. Trump at the airport, said he was proud to have the president of the United States visit the city where he was born and raised. But he did not completely support Mr. Trump’s plan to build a wall in a region that thrives on binational commerce and trade.“I think over all it’s not the neighborly thing to do with our neighbors to the south,” said Mr. Zamora, 47, who is also a Hidalgo County prosecutor. “You shouldn’t be using immigration to shut down the government to get what you want. Certainly I think there’s other ways to go about it.”Mr. Zamora said he hoped the president’s visit would help dispel, not fuel, misconceptions about the city.“We’re a wholesome community,” he said. “We’re an American city that’s on the border. What we don’t want is the perception that we’re a dusty border town with burros and carts, AK-47s being fired every 30 minutes and Molotov cocktails being thrown. Because that’s not what’s happening in McAllen.”The county park adjacent to where Mr. Trump got his briefing, known as Anzalduas Park, lies directly along the Rio Grande, and on Thursday, for the presidential visit, it was closed to the public.City residents said the last time that happened for a presidential visit was in 2006, when President George W. Bush held a news conference there. It is, they said, a place where families go on weekends for barbecues and gatherings, and one of its defining features is that just across the river, on the Mexican side, families fill the banks for their own barbecues and gatherings.They are so close, united by a river, that they could wave at one another. Sometimes, they do just that."
356,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. In an exclusive wide-ranging interview, President Trump said he will proceed on a border wall without lawmakers and dismissed any suggestions of wrongdoing in investigations that have consumed his presidency.Mr. Trump called the current negotiations over the wall “a waste of time” and indicated he will likely take action on his own when they end in two weeks: “I’ve set the table. I’ve set the stage for doing what I’m going to do.”On the topic of China, he expressed optimism at reaching a trade deal. And he denied being at odds with his intelligence chiefs, just a day after calling them “naive” on Twitter.The interview was arranged after Mr. Trump reached out to the publisher of The Times, and invited him for an off-the-record dinner. The publisher declined, saying he would prefer an on-the-record interview that included two of his reporters. Mr. Trump agreed._____2. The polar vortex continued to cripple much of the country as temperatures remained near record lows across the Midwest for a second day. Parts of the Northeast also endured subzero wind chills. Above, Chicago at sunrise.At least 21 deaths have been connected with the record-breaking cold, including a University of Iowa freshman who was found unconscious near his dorm, and who died at the hospital.The sustained cold taxed energy systems and forced the cancellation of thousands of flights and closings of schools and universities. In Milwaukee, wind chill fell to minus 50. Here’s what photographers across the frigid regions are seeing.But the cold is expected to begin to lift on Friday. By the end of the weekend, temperatures in some areas could swing up to the 40s or 50s, bringing rain instead of snow._____3. The Senate, in a stinging bipartisan rebuke to President Trump, advanced a measure opposing his moves to withdraw troops in Syria and Afghanistan.The measure, written by Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, warned that “the precipitous withdrawal of United States forces from either country could put at risk hard-won gains and United States national security.”The measure was backed by virtually every Senate Republican and will be added to a broader bipartisan Middle East policy bill expected to pass the Senate next week.But the bipartisan spirit had its limits. Mr. McConnell (above, on Capitol Hill today) called a proposal to make Election Day a holiday a “power grab” by Democrats._____4. Companies across Britain, faced with increasing uncertainty around the country’s departure from the E.U., have been stockpiling products, making backup plans and exploring new shipping routes. International banks are shifting thousands of jobs from Britain to the Continent.“It’s meant extra resources, extra overtime, to get it done,” said one executive of an auto parts factory in the Midlands of England, pictured above. “It’s incredibly annoying. It’s frustrating.”The economy is 2.3 percent smaller than it would have been if Britain had voted to remain in the E.U. in 2016, according to one research institution. And investment in the auto sector was found to have plunged by almost 50 percent in 2018._____5. The cold war between the two giant companies over data use and privacy is heating up.Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has cut off Facebook’s access to apps and updates that it was working on internally, citing violation of Apple’s rules with a research app that allowed Facebook to snoop on users’ online activity.Our tech writer sees the possibility that Mr. Cook, above in September, could become “a technology regulator of last resort — using the power of Apple’s iOS operating system as a cudgel to force software companies to respect user privacy and play by the rules, or risk losing access to millions of iPhone users.”_____6. Three people in California were indicted in a crackdown on a multimillion-dollar “birth tourism” business as part of the biggest federal criminal probe to target an industry that capitalizes on the birthright of U.S. citizenship.The businesses were dismantled following raids in Irvine, Calif., in 2015, including the one pictured above. They coached clients to falsify U.S. visa applications and pay indigent rates at hospitals where they delivered. Some Chinese couples were charged as much as $100,000 for a package that included housing, nannies and shopping at Gucci, according to the indictments.One suggested pregnant mothers indicate that they intended to stay at a Trump luxury hotel, to convince immigration officials that they were well-to-do vacationers._____7. Jason Hairston played briefly in the N.F.L., hunted with Donald Trump Jr., and owned a successful hunting gear and apparel company. For years, he was convinced he had the degenerative brain disease known as C.T.E. from his football years.When he fatally shot himself in his bedroom last September, his family and friends were shocked. Not his wife, who watched his decline up close. “We were really good at hiding it,” she told our reporter.We took a look at the history of his deterioration, and the posthumous confirmation of C.T.E._____8. Frida Kahlo meticulously built her own image as an artist in the 20th century. Now, a sweeping survey in New York examines how she did it, and why.Through her own works and collections, the show, at the Brooklyn Museum, highlights Kahlo’s skill of leaving behind a public persona that still resonates well into the 21st century. It is the biggest stateside show ever devoted to the artist. We have images of some of the exhibits here.We also have a review of “Black Leopard, Red Wolf,” the first volume of Marlon James’s “Dark Star” trilogy. The novel is packed with dizzying references fused into something new and startling, our former chief book critic Michiko Kakutani writes._____9.

357,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has long claimed that he puts “America first” overseas. But in two remarkable statements on Thursday, Mr. Trump and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, explicitly favored foreign autocrats over elected American leaders.Mr. Pompeo chose Cairo, the site of President Barack Obama’s 2009 address to the Islamic world, to deliver a caustic, point-by-point repudiation of Mr. Obama’s message. He paid tribute to Egypt’s repressive president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, for his courage in supporting Mr. Trump’s alternative approach.About an hour later, on the South Lawn of the White House, Mr. Trump said that China’s Communist Party bosses negotiated in better faith than the Democratic leaders in Congress, with whom the president is in a bitter standoff over his border wall that has shut down much of the federal government.“I find China, frankly, in many ways to be far more honorable than Cryin’ Chuck and Nancy. I really do,” Mr. Trump said, referring to the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “China is actually much easier to deal with than the opposition party.”This is the same China that Mr. Trump’s national security strategy designated as one of the greatest threats to American interests — a revisionist power determined to “erode American security and prosperity” with predatory trade practices, military aggression, and a regime that represses its people while trying to undermine America’s democracy.Mr. Trump’s affinity for strongmen is well established, as is his contempt for his predecessor and his habit of gleefully ridiculing opponents, regardless of their party affiliation. But rarely has the Trump administration offered such a striking display of embracing autocrats as friends and painting those at home with whom it disagrees as enemies.“It’s such a break with the tradition that you unify the country against opposition abroad, and you act with a certain decorum in dealing with opponents at home,” said the presidential historian Robert Dallek. “There seems to be none of that in this administration.”Mr. Trump’s comments about Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi came in an off-the-cuff exchange with reporters as he left the White House for a trip to the border in Texas. It suggested that the president was still basking in the afterglow of his steak dinner with President Xi Jinping in Buenos Aires last month, when he agreed to call a truce in his trade war with China.Mr. Pompeo’s address, by contrast, was carefully choreographed in both its language and setting — a highly symbolic effort to discredit what Mr. Obama heralded as America’s “new beginning” with the Muslim world.Mr. Obama, the secretary of state said, underestimated the scourge of radical Islam; declined to stand up to the mullahs in Iran, even as they brutally cracked down on protesters; turned the other way while the militants of Hezbollah massed rockets against Israel; and did nothing after President Bashar al-Assad of Syria used sarin gas against his own people.“The age of self-inflicted American shame is over, and so are the policies that produced so much needless suffering,” Mr. Pompeo said at the American University in Cairo. “Now comes the real new beginning.”Mr. Pompeo lauded Saudi Arabia for working with the United States to curb Iran’s malign influence in the region. He said nothing about human rights and did not mention the killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which the C.I.A., an agency he once led, concluded was ordered by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, a close ally of Mr. Trump.To those who watched Mr. Pompeo harshly question Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2015 when he was a House member investigating the Benghazi attacks, the fact that he would attack a Democratic president was hardly surprising. But that he did it on foreign soil angered some diplomats, who subscribe to the adage that partisan politics should stop “at the water’s edge.”Even those who were deeply critical of Mr. Obama’s Middle East policy said they found Mr. Pompeo’s speech off-key — more a stunt aimed at his boss back in Washington than a serious attempt to set out a new blueprint for American involvement in the region.“There’s something a little cheap about going to Cairo,” said William Kristol, the neoconservative political analyst, who has been equally critical of Mr. Trump. “If he doesn’t approve of Obama’s Cairo speech, the way you do that is not to give another Cairo speech.”Mr. Kristol noted that Mr. Obama’s speech was also a rebuke of his predecessor, George W. Bush, especially for the Iraq war and his use of torture on suspects after the terrorist attacks of September 2001. But by comparison with Mr. Pompeo, Mr. Obama’s language was delicate.“9/11 was an enormous trauma to our country,” Mr. Obama said at Cairo University. “The fear and anger it provoked was understandable, but in some cases, it led us to act contrary to our own ideals.”In his dissection, Mr. Pompeo did not mention a line that would seem more likely than any other to provoke a Trump official: Mr. Obama’s admission that the United States played a role in overthrowing the democratically elected government of Iran in 1953 — a coup, he said, that had left a residue of suspicion toward America. Mr. Pompeo’s focus was on making the Iran of today start “behaving like a normal country.”For all his contempt toward Mr. Obama, Mr. Pompeo fell back on some positions that sounded a lot like those of the last administration. In Syria, he said, the United States would “work through the U.N.-led process to bring peace and stability to the long-suffering Syrian people.”Nor is it clear that Mr. Trump’s praise of autocrats is encouraging them to act in ways that benefit the United States. It may actually do the opposite, as the case of Prince Mohammed demonstrates.The trade talks between the United States and China, which ended this week in Beijing, were less rancorous than the shutdown negotiations between Mr. Trump and the Democrats. But they have yet to produce a breakthrough — and Mr. Trump’s decision to skip the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, later this month because of the shutdown could put off a trade deal even longer.“Strongman envy helps explain both the president’s comments and a muddled view of the Middle East,” said William J. Burns, a former deputy secretary of state who is now president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.“The irony,” Mr. Burns said, “is that trashing his predecessor or congressional opponents on the global stage is seen by those same strongmen as evidence of his weakness and manipulability.”"
358,"McALLEN, Tex. — President Trump arrived in this border town Thursday on a trip that he did not want to take to discuss a crisis that Democrats say does not exist, repeating his request for a long-promised border wall that has led to a bitter political impasse and a 20-day government shutdown.Flanked by Border Patrol officers, as well as Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, and a cache of drugs, cash and weapons seized by the authorities at the border, Mr. Trump again blamed the protracted shutdown affecting vast swaths of the federal government on Democrats. He reiterated an untrue claim that Mexico would indirectly pay for the wall through a revamped trade agreement, and heard from people who had loved ones killed by immigrants.“If we had a barrier of any kind, whether it’s steel or concrete,” Mr. Trump said of tragic stories involving violence and human trafficking, “they wouldn’t even bother trying. We could stop that cold.”But as the government shutdown neared the end of its third week, the president left Washington with no additional negotiations scheduled with congressional leaders over a possible compromise that could both provide border security and open the government. In remarks to reporters on Thursday, Mr. Trump did not rule out declaring a state of national emergency that could allow him to bypass Congress to fund the wall.Asked if he would make such a declaration, an action that would likely face legal challenges, Mr. Trump said: “If this doesn’t work out, probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely.”In the meeting with Border Patrol officials, Mr. Trump did not emphasize the need for an emergency, but invited locals to help him make his case.A local pastor declared the problem a “humanitarian crisis.” Border Patrol officers used visual aids showing stash houses, road checkpoints and drug caches to emphasize the demand for border security and a wall. And at one point, Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who waged a brutal political battle with the president as an opponent during the 2016 primaries, praised Mr. Trump for “infusing more backbone” in the capital.“When we see politicians go on TV and say the border’s secure and there is no crisis,” Mr. Cruz said, “they are ignoring reality.”Mr. Trump repeated his demand for the money from Congress while telling the group that Mexico would somehow provide funds indirectly for the wall, a contradiction of what he said in December when he wrote in a Twitter post, “I often stated, ‘One way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.’”“I didn’t say they’re going to write me a check for $10 billion or $20 billion,” Mr. Trump said on Thursday. “If Congress approves this trade bill, they’ll pay for the wall many times over. When I say Mexico’s going to pay for the wall, that’s what I mean.”The new trade deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, does not stipulate that Mexico provide funds for the wall, and has not been approved by Congress.Back in Washington, the president’s ability to procure funds from other sources has not been successful.Mr. Trump held a brief and contentious negotiation with Democrats and Republican leaders on Wednesday in the Situation Room that ended abruptly when he stormed out of the room after Speaker Nancy Pelosi rebuffed his overture to reopen the government in exchange for wall funding. Ms. Pelosi and Democrats have consistently said they would be willing to negotiate border security issues with him if he would reopen the government, even as Ms. Pelosi has held firm to the position that she does not support funding for a wall.Before his departure, Mr. Trump denied Democrats’ reports that he slammed his hand on the table and had what Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, called “a temper tantrum.”“I didn’t smash the table,” Mr. Trump said later Thursday morning. “I should have.”In a meeting with network anchors this week before his address to the nation, the president dismissed his trip to McAllen, a border community where crime is near a 30-year low, as a “photo op” that he was doing because his top communications advisers counseled him to.In Texas, he listened to tearful stories from people who described violent deaths of siblings and sons, including one woman whose son, a Border Patrol agent, had been killed by an unauthorized immigrant.“Thank you,” Mr. Trump said as he walked over to hug her. “I’m very proud of you right now.”[A shut down government actually costs more than an open one.]Before Air Force One landed in Texas on Thursday, a crowd of supporters with flags and “build the wall” signs gathered near the Rio Grande.The president maintains he has the option of declaring a national emergency to fund construction for the wall, perhaps the central promise that he made to his political base during his campaign, and bypassing a legislative solution. The head of the Army Corps of Engineers traveled with Mr. Trump to Texas on Thursday. Redirecting funds from the Army’s construction agency to build the wall is one option Mr. Trump could use in a national emergency.Mr. Trump said he had the legal authority to make the declaration. “This is a thing that the lawyers tell me is 100 percent,” Mr. Trump said.If the president were to declare a national emergency, which some legal experts say is within his authority, it is sure to stoke debate in Congress.To bolster his campaign for the wall, the president has also scheduled an interview with the Fox host Sean Hannity, who will broadcast his show Thursday night from McAllen. Mr. Hannity is one of the president’s highest-profile supporters and is highly influential among his political base.The president’s trip came a month before some bollard wall construction in the area, based on a previous congressional appropriation, is set to begin.At least seven senior aides were aboard the flight, including Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser; Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his press secretary; Bill Shine, his deputy chief of staff for communications; Mick Mulvaney, his acting chief of staff; and Stephen Miller, a senior White House adviser and architect of the administration’s “zero tolerance” immigration policies."

360,"WASHINGTON — When Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California stepped to a microphone last week and pronounced President Trump’s border wall “an immorality,” most Democrats cheered and nodded their heads.But a few privately grimaced, worried that such stark terminology could make it more difficult for Democrats and Republicans to find their way out of an impasse over border security that has partially shuttered the government for three weeks, deprived about 800,000 federal workers of their pay and increasingly threatens beneficiaries of federal programs.Democrats, said one Democratic lawmaker from a Republican-leaning district who insisted on anonymity to offer a candid assessment, cannot be seen by the public as calling border security immoral.The divide illustrates why Democrats are working to focus public attention on the painful costs of the partial government shutdown — vulnerable families going without food assistance, farmers forgoing crop payments, national parks trashed — and Mr. Trump’s recklessness in courting it, rather than delving into the specific details of erecting a barrier on the southwestern border.While Mr. Trump has launched an elaborate public-relations effort to draw Democrats into a debate over the wall itself — even the material to be used to construct it — Democrats are just as determined to talk instead about a more universally resonant theme: the need to get the government open and functioning while negotiations continue.It is at the heart of Ms. Pelosi’s plan this week to push through the House a series of bills to reopen shuttered federal agencies, including one that passed Wednesday for the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service, among others. Like the others poised to be approved this week in the Democrat-controlled chamber, it is expected to die in the Republican-controlled Senate.The goal: to win over more Republicans in the House and raise pressure in the Senate, where on Tuesday, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska became the latest Republican to call for a vote to reopen the government as talks on border security continue.For Democrats, newly in control of the House, the shutdown fight has proved unifying, crystallizing a near-universal belief in their ranks that Congress should act as a check on the power of a president who has shown little regard for the law and has used his office to sow fear and misinformation on issues like immigration.But while they are almost all opposed to the idea of a wall between the United States and Mexico — which is unpopular among a majority of Americans and strongly opposed by Democratic voters, and which has been dismissed as ineffective by border security experts — Democrats are less united about what form of border security they do support.Some of them, including Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, voted in 2006 for 700 miles of fencing along the border, a position the White House has repeatedly sought to spotlight.On Tuesday, on the morning of Mr. Trump’s address to the nation on the topic, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, did not mention the word “wall” once in 11 minutes of opening remarks with reporters. He then sidestepped a question about the difference between fencing and other border security measures that Democrats have backed in the past and the wall that the president is demanding.“I didn’t answer it, maybe because I don’t have an answer that I think is a really good answer,” he finally conceded. “Fencing and walls have the same effect. One is supported by a large number of experts, but a large number of experts think neither are that effective.”The reality is that making a nuanced argument about border security — a highly technical and politically charged issue — is difficult and divisive. Some Democrats have learned that the hard way in recent days.Representative Adam Smith of Washington, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, seemed to break from Ms. Pelosi’s “immorality” remark during an interview Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” when he tried to explain his past votes for border barriers.“The wall is not in itself a bad idea, it’s just — it’s been done,” Mr. Smith said. “And what the president has not done is, he has not made the case that on the portions of the border where a wall has not been built, how is a wall going to actually enhance border security?”Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, jumped on Mr. Smith’s remarks, saying, “That’s a very different point than the one that Speaker Pelosi continues to make, which is that a wall is immoral.”When Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said this week that Mr. Trump’s recent talk of a wall made of steel slats rather than concrete was “progress,” he quickly clarified that he was not, in fact, buying into the president’s idea.“I said that it was a minor step,” he told CNN on Tuesday. “I was accepting that steel slats are preferred by the Department of Homeland Security over a concrete wall; I was not saying that I think that we should be pouring billions of dollars into a border barrier.”And Ms. Pelosi has also sought to press the more practical argument. On a card of talking points distributed Wednesday by her office, Democrats were instructed to emphasize that they favor “smart, effective” border security solutions, and to focus on Mr. Trump’s tactics. “There is no reason for President Trump to keep government shut down over his demands for an ineffective, wasteful wall,” the card said.Democratic strategists argue that Mr. Trump’s failure to build broad public support for a wall that he has been demanding since the early days of his presidential candidacy has made it easier for Democrats to stake out a unified message.“Obviously, there are some Democrats who talk about the wall being immoral or inconsistent with American values, but across the spectrum of Democrats, there is an emphasis on the degree to which the wall is waste of taxpayers’ money and irrelevant to addressing the most important challenges we face with regard to immigration in the country,” said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. “Democrats are being helped a little bit by Trump’s specificity in what he’s looking for. He keeps talking about something that is very specific, and is something that more than half of all Americans oppose.”Nick Gourevitch, a pollster and communications strategist who advised Democrats during the midterm campaign on Mr. Trump’s fear-soaked immigration message, said Democrats are sticking to the simplest and freshest argument they have to appeal to a public that does not focus on the finer points of border security policy.“The wall is unpopular, and the wall combined with the shutdown is even more unpopular,” Mr. Gourevitch said.“Most presidents don’t lose in a wave election and then double down on the strategy that got them there,” he added, “but that’s what this president seems to be doing.”"

362,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. Michael Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, last month offered federal prosecutors in Manhattan information about possible irregularities within the president’s family business, according to people familiar with the matter.Mr. Cohen, above, is slated to testify publicly on Capitol Hill next week.Mr. Cohen, who worked at the Trump Organization for a decade, spoke with the prosecutors about insurance claims the company had filed over the years, the people said. This suggests that the United States Attorney’s Office in Manhattan, known as the Southern District of New York, is scrutinizing the Trump Organization, and it has recently sought to interview executives. Meanwhile, Manhattan prosecutors are preparing state criminal charges against Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, in an effort to ensure he will face prison time even if he is pardoned by the president for federal crimes._____2. Robert Kraft — the owner of the New England Patriots, the most successful team in the N.F.L. since he bought it in 1994 and the winner of this year’s Super Bowl — was charged with two counts of soliciting sex from a prostitute, according to the police in Jupiter, Fla.A series of massage parlors was raided Tuesday as part of a six-month state investigation of prostitution and human trafficking. Mr. Kraft, 77, above, was said to be a customer of a spa called Orchids of Asia.Detectives in Jupiter said they had video of Mr. Kraft and dozens of other customers involved in sex acts at the Jupiter spa and others in Florida. Mr. Kraft denied that he had engaged in any illegal activity._____3. The R&B singer R. Kelly was charged in Chicago with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse in connection with four victims.The celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti said last week that he had obtained a video showing Mr. Kelly having sex with a 14-year-old girl and had given it to prosecutors in Chicago.On Thursday, two additional women came forward at a news conference in New York, above, organized by their lawyer, Gloria Allred, to accuse Mr. Kelly of sexual abuse and misconduct when they were minors. Mr. Kelly, trailed by accusations of sexual misconduct for two decades, has been under renewed scrutiny since the documentary “Surviving R. Kelly” was broadcast on Lifetime in January. He has denied engaging in any illegal conduct.Separately, a federal judge ruled that prosecutors led by Alexander R. Acosta — who is now the secretary of labor — violated federal law when they failed to tell victims about an agreement not to prosecute Jeffrey E. Epstein, a wealthy New York financier accused of molesting dozens of underage girls in a trafficking ring._____4. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, has acknowledged recently that she could sometimes be “too hard” on staff members.Interviews with more than two dozen former staff members and internal emails suggest a toxic work environment. Ms. Klobuchar, above, in Iowa last week, threw office objects in frustration, including binders and phones, in the direction of aides, former staff members said. She berated an aide for neglecting to bring a plastic fork on a plane and ate a salad with a comb — then told the aide to clean the comb.Ms. Klobuchar’s office said that “these anonymous stories — some of which are just plain ridiculous — do not overshadow the countless experiences of people on the senator’s team who she has been so proud to work with.”In other Washington news,  Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, scheduled a vote for Tuesday on legislation that would end President Trump’s emergency declaration for his promised border wall._____5. The producers of “Empire,” Fox’s second-highest-rated drama, announced that Jussie Smollett’s character would not appear in the final two episodes of the show’s fifth season — which essentially buys time to figure out what to do with his character. Above, Mr. Smollett exiting the Cook County Department of Corrections after posting bail in Chicago on Thursday.The announcement came one day after the police in Chicago arrested Mr. Smollett and said he had staged an attack against himself to garner publicity.Within weeks, 20th Century Fox Television, the studio that produces “Empire,” will be folded into the Walt Disney Company after Disney closes on its purchase of many of Fox’s entertainment properties. Suddenly Disney’s opinions of Mr. Smollett will become a vital part of the calculus._____6. The dollar is still king. Despite many predictions after the financial crisis that the dollar might finally founder, it has amassed greater stature as the favored repository for global savings, the paramount refuge in times of crisis and the key form of exchange for commodities like oil.Its potency has enabled the Treasury to find buyers for bonds at enviably cheap rates and given added bite to Mr. Trump’s foreign policies by amplifying the power of his trade sanctions — especially against Iran and Venezuela.Between the beginning of 2008 and late 2018, the share of reserves that central banks worldwide held in dollars remained roughly constant, at around 62 percent of the total, according to the International Monetary Fund. Reserves entrusted to the euro, the dollar’s most formidable competitor, stand at 20 percent, and China’s currency makes up only 2 percent._____7. Along Venezuela’s border with Brazil, Venezuelan security forces fired on a group of indigenous Venezuelans protesting their government’s determination to block aid deliveries from outside the country. At least two civilians were killed and more than a dozen wounded, according to an opposition lawmaker. Above, an ambulance at the scene.The political opposition, led by Juan Guaidó, the head of the National Assembly who declared himself president last month, has vowed to forcibly bring in aid this weekend.Venezuela is racked by shortages of basic goods and essentials, especially medicine. The aid could be a lifeline for dozens of patients in critical condition or with serious chronic diseases who were interviewed by The Times. But they fear the political standoff will eclipse their emergencies._____8. On the second day of a historic global meeting in Rome on addressing clerical sexual abuse of minors, the American cardinal entrusted by Pope Francis with organizing the meeting presented Roman Catholic leaders with a set of new proposals, including changes to the process for investigating bishops accused of misconduct or negligence.But there was no guarantee that the proposals would be enacted. Above, Evelyn Korkamaz, holding a photo of herself when she was a child, told her story at a news conference in Rome on Friday.While other countries have taken a hard look at the problem of clerical abuse, Italy has approached it with something closer to a cultural and media blackout, and we explored why._____9. By its own admission, the Defense Department allowed a firefighting foam to slip into at least 55 drinking water systems at military bases around the globe, sometimes for generations. This exposed tens of thousands of Americans, possibly many more, to a group of man-made chemicals known as PFAS that have been linked to cancers, immune suppression and other serious health problems.Above, a water tank in Fountain, Colo., a town affected by contamination over the years.Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency said it would begin the process of potentially limiting the presence of two of the compounds in drinking water, calling it a “pivotal moment in the history of the agency.”But many said that was not enough. All told, 10 million people could be drinking water laced with high levels of PFAS — termed “forever chemicals” for their persistence — according to Patrick Breysse, a top official at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The military never alerted all of the people who drank polluted water. A growing movement of veterans and others is demanding answers._____10. “His shoe broke.”That was former President Barack Obama’s correct assessment from the stands after college basketball’s biggest star, Zion Williamson, tumbled 30 seconds into the biggest game of the season, at Duke’s arena, and sprained his knee, sidelining him for one to two weeks.One of his Nike shoes split open, above right, renewing questions about whether sneaker companies, which were at the heart of a federal fraud trial near the start of the season, do more harm than good in college sports.How did it happen? That’s a puzzle even to experts. One guessed “product failure.”Have a good weekend._____Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

363,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. $11 billion. That’s how much the five-week government shutdown cost the U.S. economy, with nearly a quarter of that total permanently lost, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.The number was released as hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to work. After returning to work, subway traffic picked up in Washington, above. Now, a 17-member bipartisan panel has less than three weeks to come up with an agreement on border security.In the meantime, investors and economic policymakers, including the Federal Reserve, are operating without government analyses of retail sales, manufacturing, housing and other parts of the economy.And the State of the Union address is set for Feb. 5._____2. To say it’s really cold in the Midwest just scrapes at the (iced over) surface. The polar vortex is back with a level of cold that a generation of Midwesterners has never experienced. Above, the scene in Appleton, Wis.Punches of snow and life-threatening cold temperatures are crippling much of the region, with school closings and canceled flights. The danger is only expected to grow, with forecasts of highs in the negative teens, and wind chills as low as minus 50 in Chicago and minus 60 in Minneapolis._____3. The Trump administration took steps against two international companies, one in China and one in Venezuela.The Justice Department unveiled sweeping charges against the Chinese telecom firm Huawei, several subsidiaries and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, accusing the company of stealing trade secrets and Ms. Meng of helping banks evade sanctions on Iran.And the Treasury Department announced it would impose sanctions on Venezuela’s state-owned oil monopoly, the most forceful challenge to the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro.In a side note to the Justice Department’s announcement, the acting attorney general announced that special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation was nearing an end._____4. The U.S. and the Taliban agreed in principle to the framework of a peace deal, the biggest tangible step toward ending the 17-year conflict. Many, many details remain to be worked out.Above, Afghan National Army soldiers and American soldiers during an operation to destroy a known Taliban firing position in Kandahar Province in 2013.The possibility of a peace deal has inspired waves of enthusiasm and hope among many Afghans. But for women, it could mean a new horror story.Need a refresher on the Afghanistan war? Here are the basics._____5. Looking to 2020: Howard Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks, began taking steps to prepare for a run for president as an independent.A self-described “lifelong Democrat,” Mr. Schultz said he would begin a three-month crisscross of the country before making a decision. But Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City who is eyeing a Democratic run, argued that Mr. Schultz could split the vote and enable a second term for President Trump.Senator Elizabeth Warren’s passion for policy minutiae has become her way of standing out in a crowded field of candidates.Need help keeping up with the field? We’re keeping track here._____6. In media news, Tom Brokaw, the former NBC anchor, got something of a daylong workshop in cultural diversity after his appearance on “Meet the Press” on Sunday.Why? During a discussion about President Trump’s border wall, he said Hispanics should work harder to assimilate: “They ought not to be just codified in their communities but make sure that all of their kids are learning to speak English, and that they feel comfortable in the communities, and that’s going to take outreach on both sides, frankly.”Among those objecting was the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, which noted that “most U.S. Hispanics are born in the United States; English is their native language.” Mr. Brokaw apologized.Separately, according to tabloid reports, Jennifer Aniston should have given birth to some two dozen babies in the last few years. Our media columnist looks at how readers are drawn to stories they simply want to be true, whether they’re about celebrity baby bumps or President Trump._____7. How’s Apple doing? The company will reveal more about its earnings and forecast Tuesday, a few weeks after reducing its revenue expectations for the first time in 16 years. That may also offer insight into the weakening economy in China — which it relies on as both a market and a manufacturing center.Apple, like many companies, has found that no country can match China’s combination of scale, skills, infrastructure and cost. (We have a case study that hinges on a tiny screw, above.)A monthlong sprint of trade negotiations between China and the U.S. begins Wednesday, seeking to avert a major escalation of the trade war in March._____8. In the fast-growing category of adventure vacations, it’s safe to say that a cycling expedition through West Africa is on the extreme end.Our travel writer, a former Times business editor, went along for about half of the 10-week bike trip from Morocco to Ghana, riding a rough ribbon of road through a region growing more stable.Of the 33 people signed up for the whole ride, 28 made it the full 4,000 miles, pedaling and camping through mountains, deserts, rolling farmland and tropical forests.“We want to live life to the fullest,” said one rider, whose bike computer displayed 35 km/h, or 22 miles per hour. “It’s time to put some Ks down.”_____9. How do you measure a show you were never really meant to see?Awkwardly, for starters. On Sunday night, the live television broadcast of “Rent” had to use footage from a recorded dress rehearsal after a lead actor broke his foot. Only the final 15 minutes or so were live. Much of the hit musical was disappointing, our critic writes, “but clearly there was love in this production, too.”We also took a second look at “My Fair Lady,” 10 months into its run in New York.With four replacement principals in place, the revival is nicely evolving with new stars, our theater critic says. It’s all the more satisfying “when a musical not only lives in the moment but also changes and grows over time,” he says._____10. Finally, we end the day with whodunits.We have six new thrillers to put on your radar. From a plummeting death in which everyone is guilty of something, to a Prohibition-era story in which a woman stumbles off a sleeper train, gutshot, barely alive and splendidly dressed, there’s a mystery for everyone.“We may have to concede that while truth is indeed stranger than fiction,” our reviewer writes, “fiction is substantially better arranged.”Have a gripping night._____Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

364,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. The White House is preparing to establish a panel to study whether climate change is a national security threat, as the government’s own scientific and intelligence agencies have warned.A White House memo describing the panel said it would include William Happer, a climate change denialist, suggesting a new effort by the Trump administration to play down or distort the impact of global warming. Above, heavy rainstorms breached a levee in Novato, Calif., last week.Mr. Happer, a physicist serving as Mr. Trump’s deputy assistant for emerging technologies, is notorious within the science community for his comments that carbon dioxide — the greenhouse gas scientists say is trapping heat and warming the planet — is beneficial to humanity._____2. A Coast Guard lieutenant and self-described white nationalist was plotting to kill a long list of journalists and Democratic politicians when he was arrested last week, the authorities said.Lt. Christopher Paul Hasson was arrested Friday on charges of illegal gun possession, above, but prosecutors said in a filing on Tuesday that the charges were just the “proverbial tip of the iceberg.” They described him as a “domestic terrorist” and said he should be held in detention pending trial because he “intends to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country.”This is a developing story. Check back here for updates._____3. Wall Street is setting its sights on a new target: distressed main streets.Hedge funds and other wealthy investors are raising money for so-called opportunity funds. Spurred by a provision of the 2017 tax package that provides capital gains relief for spending on projects in poor areas, more than 80 of the funds have sprung up since January 2018.They aim to invest in about 8,700 designated “opportunity zones,” like the one above in downtown Salt Lake City, across the country and in Puerto Rico.Fund managers are pitching investors on a combination of outsize returns and a feel-good role in fighting poverty, but skeptics worry that the promises are overly optimistic._____4. The Supreme Court found its way to a unanimous ruling: stronger limits on police power to seize private property.The justices found that the Eighth Amendment’s bar on “excessive fines” should include actions in states and localities, in a ruling that stemmed from the case of a small-time drug offender whose $42,000 Land Rover was seized by Indiana officials.The practice, called civil forfeiture, has been widely used to raise revenue. It has drawn fire from across the political spectrum, and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for eight of the justices, noted its use in Southern states to “subjugate” blacks after the Civil War._____5. “I can’t believe it. I ruined my life. I ruined my future.”Four years ago, Hoda Muthana, above, was a 20-year-old college student in Alabama convinced of the righteousness of the Islamic State. But after being married to three Islamic State fighters and witnessing executions like those she had once cheered on social media, she wants to come home.We spoke with her and a second American woman at a refugee camp in northeastern Syria where they are being held. Less than 24 hours after we published the article, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said she had no legal basis to return, and President Trump tweeted that he had directed Mr. Pompeo “not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!”Separately, Vera Mironova, a visiting fellow at Harvard University who has embedded with Iraq’s special forces, writes in an Op-Ed essay that women are playing an increasingly important role in the Islamic State — and that security forces are not prepared._____6. The clashes between California and the Trump administration now include a transportation improvement project.A day after the state joined a lawsuit challenging President Trump’s emergency declaration along the border, the Transportation Department said it wanted California to pay back $2.5 billion in federal funds that had already been spent on a bullet train to connect Los Angeles and the Bay Area. The department also said it was terminating a $929 million federal grant for the line. Above, the first leg of the rail line in Fresno, Calif.Both Gov. Gavin Newsom and Mr. Trump linked the rail decision to the fight over the border wall._____7. Jussie Smollett is now considered a suspect in the case the “Empire” actor reported as a hate crime against him last month.The Chicago police said that Mr. Smollett was suspected of filing a false police report and that detectives were presenting evidence to a grand jury that he had committed a felony. Mr. Smollett said he had been attacked by two white men in “MAGA” hats who yelled anti-gay slurs, but questions about whether he might have staged the episode have been growing.Mr. Smollett, through his lawyers, has denied any role in coordinating an attack._____8. Pope Francis and other church leaders will kick off an unprecedented conference on Thursday aimed at addressing clerical sexual abuse. Above, Francis at the Vatican today.Victims’ advocates are calling for a uniform set of laws and zero-tolerance policies around the world, but Vatican officials and other leaders have warned that denial about abuse in some parts of the world and legal and cultural barriers to identifying abusers make a worldwide standard for the church virtually impossible.We interviewed bishops and priests on four continents and found that, indeed, views vary widely on the urgency, extent and very existence of sexual abuse by priests. In places where Catholics are a minority, reporting a priest to the authorities could be a death sentence._____9. Don Newcombe, who died on Tuesday at 92, is known for being baseball’s first Black Ace.Just four years after Major League Baseball’s integration, he won 20 games in one season for the Dodgers. In the 67 seasons since, only 195 other pitchers have matched that achievement. Only 14 were black — making an extraordinary club.More on baseball: After Manny Machado agreed to a 10-year contract with the San Diego Padres worth $300 million — the richest free-agent deal in baseball history — we compared all the M.L.B players who signed contracts of at least $100 million._____10. Finally, a horse of a different color.Researchers in Britain dressed up horses in zebra coats to confirm a theory about the evolution of zebra stripes. The stripes seem to make it difficult for flies to land on their bodies, which might explain why they evolved in the first place, researchers found.The high contrast between black and white most likely tricks the fly’s low-resolution vision, which relies on sensing movement. “It’s probably just blowing the fly’s vision away,” one researcher said.It’s also probably time to invest in some zebra print.Have a wild night._____Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

365,"A 61-year-old man from the Dominican Republic has been waiting for his day in federal immigration court since the 1980s, unable to visit his dying mother back home or, in recent years, legally hold a job. His trial was finally to come next week.But because of the federal government shutdown, he stands to lose his precious court date.In the backlogged immigration courts, that is likely to mean not just a few more weeks of waiting, but a few more years. Migrants like this man — who asked to be identified only by his first name, Jose, for fear of repercussions in court — are being sent to the back of the line, with their new court dates coming as late as 2022.From furloughs at the Justice Department to confusion in the courts, to prison officers working without a paycheck, the shutdown has challenged the nation’s courts and criminal justice system and those whose livelihoods depend on them, slowing some cases while throwing others into disarray.[Read more: On Friday, President Trump threatened to keep the government shut down for “months or even years.""]Federal district courts are still operating because they have revenue from court fees and other sources aside from congressional appropriations. But those funds may run out as soon as next Friday, leaving it up to judges to decide which cases are critical and must be heard and which will be delayed. Criminal cases are likely to be prioritized.At federal prisons, which employ roughly 36,000 people, corrections officers who struggle during normal times to cover their bills are now expecting that next week’s paycheck will not arrive. Guards who normally take home $1,000 to $1,400 per biweekly check are scrambling to figure out how to pay for child care, rent and medications.[Read more: With no end in sight to the shutdown, 800,000 federal workers have been sent home or are working without pay.]Eric Young, the national president of prison locals for the American Federation of Government Employees, said he had heard from one prison worker in Florida who needs $200 for his supply of insulin injections. “People are having to decide whether to keep the lights on or pay for their insulin,” Mr. Young said. “It’s depressing. And it’s just unconscionable to know that the federal work force is being penalized because of politics between the parties.”About four out of every five Justice Department employees are expected to keep working, because so many are employed in law enforcement or national security jobs, including at the F.B.I., the D.E.A., and the Bureau of Prisons. But none are expected to be paid during the shutdown, unless their offices have a funding source separate from congressional appropriations.The shutdown has already led to a slowdown in civil lawsuits, and some confusion, as federal judges across the country have issued a hodgepodge of conflicting orders. In the Federal District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, a federal judge ordered that all cases in which the federal government is a party be delayed.Another judge issued an order exempting his own cases from the first judge’s order.The second judge, Joseph R. Goodwin, wrote: “It is my view that the government should not be given special influence or accommodation in cases where such special considerations are unavailable to other litigants.”Justice Department lawyers whose civil cases are not granted delays can keep working to meet court deadlines and requirements for filings and appearances. Most federal prosecutors and support staff for criminal cases are continuing to work.[Read more: What is and is not affected by the shutdown.]Elsewhere, Justice Department lawyers have begged to delay civil cases in which the government — or even President Trump — is being sued, saying they are now prohibited from working on these cases except in emergencies and other very limited circumstances. They have met with mixed success.In a lawsuit alleging that Mr. Trump used his Washington hotel to illegally profit from business with foreign countries, a delay has been granted.But in a case that seeks to block the Trump administration from questioning people about their citizenship in the 2020 census — a measure that critics say is devised to suppress responses from migrants — the judge, Richard Seeborg of Federal District Court in San Francisco, denied a request to delay and ordered the trial to begin Monday. The Justice Department says it will comply.Judges will have significant latitude to determine which cases go forward and which are delayed, once the court fees and other revenue are depleted.“Judges are in the best position to determine what cases have an urgency,” said David Sellers, the spokesman for the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.Mr. Sellers said judges will continue to appoint defense lawyers to represent criminal defendants too poor to pay for one, and jurors will continue to be empaneled. They will get paid, he said, once money is appropriated.Advocates for prisoners and their families fear that the shutdown could delay the implementation of a new criminal justice bill that promised to shorten sentences for some federal inmates by recalculating the amount of good time credit they have earned, because the Justice Department must create new tools and protocols first.The deadlines for those “were already pretty ambitious, even when the department was fully staffed and appropriated,” said Kevin Ring, president of FAMM, a nonprofit group that was founded to oppose mandatory minimum sentences. “We’re watching that closely.”But probably no system is feeling the shutdown as much as the already overburdened immigration courts, where there are more than 800,000 cases pending. Most of these courts, except those that hear the cases of those currently in detention, are now closed because of the shutdown.As a result, the impasse over the Trump administration’s demand for a border wall to halt illegal immigration will result in long delays in deportations for those who are already here but ultimately lose their cases.“That is the irony of this shutdown,” said Judge Amiena Khan, the executive vice president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, the judges’ union. “The impact is most acutely felt in immigration courts and proceedings where cases will not be going forward.”Because of the volume of trials from the past two weeks that now must be rescheduled, the affected cases are likely to be pushed to the end of the judges’ dockets rather than squeezed into their schedules once the shutdown ends.In New York, home to one of the busiest immigration courts in the country, those whose trials have been postponed will have to wait until the end of 2022 and 2023 at the earliest before their cases are heard because of the backlog, Judge Khan said.“I was very nervous because we were so close, and this is just making me even more nervous,” Jose said. “Every day I hope the government reopens.”"
366,"WASHINGTON — The five-week federal government shutdown took a significant economic toll, costing the United States economy $11 billion, with nearly a quarter of that total permanently lost, the Congressional Budget Office said on Monday.The figures are the first official projection of the economic effects of the longest federal shutdown in history, and they show that its cost was nearly double the $5.7 billion request by President Trump for a border wall that fueled the impasse. That is enough to reduce first-quarter growth by about 0.4 percentage points.Much of that spending was simply delayed, and will flow back into the economy as workers get back pay. But the report makes clear that not all the economic damage will be undone and that the effects of the shutdown will linger. With the federal government funded for just three weeks and Mr. Trump threatening to shutter the government again if his demands for a wall are not met, many workers say they are planning to spend less of their income and increase rainy-day savings.Kelly Spencer, a federal contractor at the Justice Department, was planning to buy her first home this spring, but as she returned to work on Monday, she said she was shelving those plans.Ms. Spencer was not paid during the five-week shutdown of the federal government, and as a contractor, she is among the thousands of workers who will not receive back pay. But she said the problem is not just the lost money. She is no longer confident she could make a mortgage payment every month.“This job was supposed to be stable and secure,” she said. While she had worked hard to pay off her debt and clean up her credit to qualify for a mortgage, she was forced to run up credit card debt again during the shutdown.Buying a home, she said, “is no longer in the foreseeable future.”Even those who are getting back pay say they will not return to their previous spending habits, given that another shutdown could happen in a few weeks.“I don’t feel comfortable going back to the spending levels I had before,” said Tamara Brown, a State Department employee. She received half of her missing pay on Monday, and said she expected the rest later this week. Still, she said, “I’m going to be very conservative until I’m sure this is all over.”On the chopping block: restaurant lunches and trips to Target.The report by the nonpartisan budget office said the shutdown, which started in late December and ended Friday, reduced gross domestic product by $3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, and by $8 billion in the first quarter of 2019.The damage caused by the shutdown comes against a gloomy fiscal backdrop. Economic growth already was expected to slow this year. The budget office projected on Monday that real gross domestic product would slow to 2.3 percent in 2019, down from 3.1 percent last year, and that the federal budget deficit would hit $900 billion.Over the next decade, federal debt held by the public is expected to climb from $16.6 trillion to $28.7 trillion. By 2029 it is expected to reach its highest level as a percentage of gross domestic product since the end of World War II.The Federal Reserve, which meets this week, has indicated that it plans to pause and take the measure of the economy before considering any additional increases in its benchmark interest rate.The budget office said growth in subsequent quarters would increase as delayed spending filtered through the economy. However, it estimates that $3 billion will never be recovered. The figure is basically an estimate of the value of the government work that was not performed during the shutdown.The budget office also said the economy suffered “more indirect negative effects,” which are harder to quantify but stemmed from businesses being unable to obtain permits and certifications and reduced access to federal-backed loans. “Such factors were probably beginning to lead firms to postpone investment and hiring decisions,” the office said.Morgan Stanley estimated Friday that the shutdown would reduce first-quarter output by 0.5 percentage points, a slightly larger reduction than the budget office projection, although it also predicted most of the loss would be recouped.Larry Kudlow, the director of Mr. Trump’s National Economic Council, dismissed the C.B.O. report, noting that the budget office regularly has a more pessimistic view of the economy than the White House.“I won’t acknowledge any of that right now,” Mr. Kudlow said on Monday. “Let’s see how it rolls out.”Mr. Kudlow argued that it was difficult to make precise projections when analyzing a $20 trillion economy. He said that the stories of individual hardship were problematic, but that the macroeconomic effects of the shutdown would be minimal.Democrats seized on the report, saying the economic damage should persuade Mr. Trump not to shut down the government again.“As the dust settles from the Trump shutdown, it is clear as day that the president’s temper tantrum caused serious and lasting damage to our nation’s economy,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said on Monday that he did not want to go through another shutdown.“I think a shutdown is a bad idea, remains a bad idea, and I’m optimistic we will not be in that position yet again,” Mr. McConnell said.Laura Dodson, an agricultural economist at the Agriculture Department, said the shutdown was particularly stressful because she had just $1,000 in her bank accounts when her paychecks stopped coming. Her rent was coming due, and she needed money to pay for her ovarian cancer treatments.“The big concern I have is speaking from the standpoint of a millennial, someone in their 20s, is the fear and insecurity,” said Ms. Dodson, 26. “I thought I had a good job with good health insurance and was in a stable spot, but I guess not.”Ms. Dodson said she planned to more aggressively pay off her credit card debt and loans and make sure that she had a larger cash reserve in case another shutdown came.“I am pretty worried that if it goes to a second shutdown, it could go on for months,” Ms. Dodson said.Even with the government open for business on Monday, federal workers who had yet to be paid lined up patiently along Pennsylvania Avenue for free lunches at World Central Kitchen, a nonprofit run by the restaurateur José Andrés that usually serves free meals in communities struck by natural disasters.Mark Stevens, 37, works at the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which is funded by the federal government. He said he was furloughed and then called back to work, but he hasn’t been paid in more than a month.He said he was grateful for the free meal “because I still don’t have any money.”Mr. Stevens said he had about two months of salary in savings when the government shut down, and his landlord helped out by postponing a rent payment. Even so, he said he had a pile of bills to tackle as soon as he got paid.Going forward, Mr. Stevens said he intended to sock away six months of salary.“No more fast food,” said Mr. Stevens, who lives in suburban Maryland. “Less entertainment. No more taking the kids out everywhere.”"
367,"McALLEN, Tex. — It was nearly 9 p.m., hours after the makeshift clinic for newly arrived migrants near the Mexican border in Texas was supposed to close, but the patients would not stop coming: A feverish teenager with a vile-smelling wound on his foot. A man with a head injury and bright red eyes. Children with fevers, coughs and colds.Earlier in the day, a little girl named Nancy had been brought into the clinic with a cough and shaking chills. She had been vomiting, she said, and her spine hurt. An assistant took her temperature. “She’s got 104, almost 105,” she said.The steady flow of migrants who arrived that night at the volunteer respite center operated by Catholic Charities here in the Rio Grande Valley had just been released by Customs and Border Protection after being apprehended near the border. The new arrivals had been in federal custody for up to 72 hours, but most had received no real medical attention — the volunteer physicians at the private clinic were the first doctors many had seen since crossing the border.“He may lose that leg,” Dr. Martin Garza, a local pediatrician who works at the clinic every other weekend, warned the father of the teenager with the foot wound, handing him a course of antibiotics to take with him. “I cleaned it up as much as I could.”An average of 2,200 migrants a day are now crossing the nation’s 1,900-mile border with Mexico, many after grueling journeys that leave them injured, sick or badly dehydrated. Yet most of the nation’s Customs and Border Protection facilities along the border lack sufficient accommodations, staffing or procedures to thoroughly assess health needs or provide more than basic emergency care, a situation that has led to dangerous medical oversights.[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]Six adults died in C.B.P. custody in the fiscal year ending in October, at least three of whom had a medical emergency shortly after being apprehended. Another, who had serious chronic diseases and was hospitalized, died from health complications last month. In December, two migrant children — Jakelin Caal Maquin, 7, and Felipe Gómez Alonzo, 8 — died within three weeks of each other after showing signs of illness while being held and transported by Border Patrol agents in Texas and New Mexico.A New York Times review of records and dozens of interviews with migrants, agents, researchers and health workers suggest that some of these deaths were not anomalies, but rather signs of entrenched problems that have repeatedly put detainees with medical conditions at risk.At respite centers like the one in McAllen, Tex., that shelter migrants for a night or two after they are released from Border Patrol custody, doctors say the care provided by the agency has sometimes been so poor that they have had to send new arrivals straight to emergency rooms.“They’re not treated as if their health and well-being is valued on any level,” said Dr. Anna Landau, a family medicine doctor who volunteers at a migrant shelter run by Catholic Community Services in Tucson. “How do you send people who are clearly hurting, clearly in pain and suffering, how do you just move them through as if they’re just another number, as opposed to an actual human being?”Migrants crossing the border from Mexico may be injured scaling barriers, in vehicle accidents, by gunfire or from nearly drowning. They may be suffering from dehydration, heat exhaustion or communicable illnesses — from influenza to chickenpox — that often spread in conditions of close confinement, though none so far have presented what health officials regard as an unusual or alarming public health or infectious disease threat. Some require medications for chronic diseases such as asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure. Yet Border Patrol facilities until now have failed to provide comprehensive health screenings for those in their care. Medications — including lifesaving prescriptions for such conditions as asthma, heart disease and infant diarrhea — are routinely confiscated. Some migrants describe being left alone in concrete cells with broken bones and recent surgeries, their pain medication deeply inadequate.In the coming days, the agency is expected to announce significant changes related to the health of migrants, including policies requiring Border Patrol agents to conduct more thorough interviews of each migrant who is processed through the system, and to refer all those who need care to a medical provider.The agency is also building a large new processing center in El Paso and adding $47 million to a private contract for migrant medical care.“We’re doing everything we can to ensure rapid medical care when needed,” Kirstjen Nielsen, the Homeland Security secretary, said at the White House in January. “The men and women of C.B.P. and ICE are doing the best they can with what they have, but they don’t have the facilities, the resources or the legal authorities to keep up with this crisis.”[Read: The Hidden Nightmare of Sexual Violence on the Border]Representative Raul Ruiz, a Democrat from California who is also a physician, helped secure funding for additional measures to improve migrant health after visiting border facilities where he said he saw children coughing and sneezing and infants without diapers, all packed tightly into cells with little in the way of food, soap and other basics. The Border Patrol stations and those working there were “unprepared, untrained and underequipped in dealing with the humanitarian needs of families,” he said.The moves come after years of warnings from both inside and outside government that were largely ignored by an agency that saw its primary mission as law enforcement — catching and deporting illegal border crossers, not nursing them back to health.“Border Patrol is a law enforcement agency. It’s not a humanitarian agency,” said Dr. Alexander L. Eastman, a senior medical officer with the Homeland Security Department who is trying to put into place, for the first time, a comprehensive approach to the care of migrants across the department.Some health care workers said they have seen Border Patrol agents in the field prioritize enforcement of immigration laws over migrants’ urgent medical needs. Ambulance crews near the border say they sometimes face delays at Border Patrol checkpoints.In one case around five years ago, described to The Times by two people who worked for an emergency medical response team in Starr County, Tex., a critically ill woman was driven across the bridge from Mexico into Rio Grande City and loaded into an ambulance from a nearby hospital. A paramedic, Sergio Garza Jr., began to help her with her breathing. But a C.B.P. employee, he said, opened the back doors of the vehicle and ordered the patient sent back, because she did not have papers to enter the United States.Mr. Garza and the director of his ambulance company protested, to no avail. Mr. Garza grudgingly transferred the patient back to a Mexican ambulance, which did not have trained personnel aboard, both he and the director recalled. Mr. Garza said he showed the patient’s husband how to squeeze an oxygen bag to try to keep his wife alive as she was driven toward a distant Mexican hospital. She died on the way there, the emergency workers said.For at least a decade, families and advocacy organizations have reported lapses in medical care for people in the custody of C.B.P. Complaints filed over the past few years included a mother who gave birth prematurely and was later forced to stay with the baby in a “dirty hold room,” a detainee who was refused access to prescribed heart medication, and a woman who had heavy vaginal bleeding after a sexual assault and was not provided any medical attention.The number of deaths remains unknown and is perhaps unknowable — the agency until December was not required to independently review or publicly report health-related deaths in its custody. And the consequences of failing to address urgent medical needs often emerge after detainees are quickly passed on to another agency, or released.In 2015, C.B.P. addressed some of the criticisms by establishing its first nationwide standards on transport and detention. However, the standards are nonbinding — the agency cannot be sued for not following them — and the subject of medical care in detention covers less than a page.Detention by Customs and Border Protection is intended to be brief — 72 hours or less, according to the standards. However that guideline is often broken. Felipe Gómez Alonzo, the boy who died in December and had influenza, was in his sixth day of detention when he was taken to a hospital, according to a timeline provided by the agency.At the hospital, Felipe was found to have a 103-degree fever. He was discharged from the emergency room several hours later, and agents took him back to a temporary holding cell at a highway checkpoint. Hours later, as the boy grew sicker, no medically trained agents were on duty there. He was returned to the hospital, but lost consciousness on the way.“Children should not be held in C.B.P. holding cells longer than 24 hours,” said Kathryn Hampton, a program officer for Physicians for Human Rights and the author of a recent study that found that the focus on securing the border has come at the cost of migrants’ safety.In some cases, Border Patrol agents take sick migrants to be seen at hospitals, but problems persist once they are brought back to C.B.P.’s crowded, ill-equipped facilities.Sonia Diaz-Castro, 39, an asylum seeker from Honduras, had fallen off the top of a 25-foot border wall as she entered the United States last year and was left barely able to move, with a broken elbow and pelvis.Border Patrol agents in New Mexico took her twice to local hospitals, and a doctor at one of them said he was promised by the agents that she would be given a wheelchair and have someone on hand to help her get around. She had neither. Though she was barely able to move, she was left alone in a concrete cell. When she had to use the toilet, she was forced to drag herself across the floor using her broken arm.“I just felt like crying out — like the only thing I could do was cry, and when I think about it, it still makes me want to cry,” Ms. Diaz-Castro said of the experience.On a typical afternoon in early February, Border Patrol radios in South Texas crackled with reports of “bodies,” people whose unauthorized crossing of the border had been detected by ground motion sensors and cameras on poles and tethered radar blimps.Agents responded as about 60 people from Honduras, Guatemala, Ecuador and Nicaragua, including mothers with children and some unaccompanied minors, clambered off rafts after crossing the Rio Grande. Hefting bags and babies, they climbed a muddy dirt path that cut through spiny brushlands, walking toward the agents, who awaited them at a gap in the border wall.René Reyes, a Border Patrol agent and emergency medical technician, eyeballed them for, he said, “anything life-threatening.”Mr. Reyes stopped briefly to ask parents about a boy with surgical scars on his head who was wearing a mask over his nose and mouth. He had a condition that causes too much fluid to build up in the brain, but he appeared stable. “The kids look O.K.,” Mr. Reyes concluded. His initial assessment of the entire group lasted less than five minutes.The children would get a more thorough medical check at their next stop, one of two temporary detention facilities in an industrial part of McAllen. Inside the agency’s largest processing center for migrants, chain-link fencing divides a vast warehouse with concrete floors into clusters of cells separating men from women and older children from parents. The site was opened in 2014 specifically for the temporary holding of families and unaccompanied children. When that site is full, an older facility with enclosed, jail-like cells processes families several blocks away.That afternoon, medical screeners sent a newly arrived 6-month-old, Victoria Medina, to the hospital after noticing that she was sick with a fever, severe cough and diarrhea. Hospital workers treated the baby and sent her back to C.B.P.That night Victoria’s mother, Mayte Medina, an 18-year-old from Honduras, lay on the bare floor of her chilly isolation cell under a thin Mylar sheet and held on tight to her coughing baby. The fever broke, but the diarrhea continued; the bottle of medicine Ms. Medina had carried with her to treat it had been in her backpack, which was confiscated when she was taken into custody. “I told everyone about it, everyone that saw her,” Ms. Medina said. “They never gave her anything.”Ms. Medina’s relatively easy access to medical care was possible in part because she was apprehended in the heart of the Rio Grande Valley, the most heavily trafficked way station for migrants in the United States. Last year, more than 63,200 migrants traveling as families were apprehended there.The Border Patrol facilities in McAllen are among the few in the country that have a small number of midlevel health professionals — nurse practitioners or physician assistants — on site. As government officials examine how they might expand medical services, those sites have been looked at as potential models.But even in those places, providing care in a facility where the ultimate decisions are controlled by law enforcement authorities sometimes frustrates practice and strains ethics. A former contract health care worker at the McAllen sites, who was not authorized to speak on the record by her previous employer, Loyal Source, recalled several occasions when she had alerted agents that a patient needed to go to the emergency room. Two or three hours later, she said, the patient was still there.Sometimes, she said, she blocked migrants with high fevers from being released to longer-term detention facilities. But she also sometimes felt intimidated, as if she would be blamed for slowing down the flow.She said that according to protocol, if a woman claimed that she had been raped, she had to be offered access to medical care to check for pregnancy, trauma and sexually transmitted infections. But that didn’t always occur, she said.In recent months, large groups of children and families have crossed into the United States  in remote desert areas lacking in medical infrastructure, including Antelope Wells, N.M., where one of the fatally ill children, Jakelin Caal Maquin, had arrived. A total of 15 Border Patrol stations or ports of entry that are within 100 miles of the southern border have no hospital within an hour’s drive, the Times review found.It is a perilous twist on a problem that has existed for years, after changes in border enforcement practices pushed furtive crossings into these areas.Some migrants encounter agents and turn themselves in; others spend days traversing vast ranchlands in extreme heat. Hundreds die every year. Agents often have to extract sick migrants from rough terrain to meet ambulance personnel, who may have to drive for hours to reach hospitals.An earlier attempt to solve the problem led to the creation in 1998 of a unit trained in tactical rescues and emergency medical services that has performed thousands of medical interventions. A separate program trains regular agents as emergency medical technicians. Over all, around 6 percent of Border Patrol agents can act as emergency medical services providers. Still, the vast majority have only basic training. Their protocols and equipment are limited. And they are not present everywhere their skills are needed.Where local emergency rooms are close at hand, Border Patrol agents tend to err on the side of caution, taking their charges for costly and sometimes unnecessary medical evaluations, several health providers said.In other cases, the Border Patrol focuses on moving migrants quickly through the system, and many end up in shelters and clinics run by charities, such as the one operated by Catholic Charities in McAllen.On a recent evening, dozens of migrants were dropped off at a shelter near the southern border of California, run by the San Diego Rapid Response Network. They stood outside, lined up near white tents under lights powered by a roaring generator. Medical workers supported by the county screened them for communicable diseases and other conditions.The rotating medical team diagnosed many untreated conditions that could spread, including 362 cases of lice, 113 cases of scabies, 22 cases of possible influenza, and four cases of chickenpox in the first two months of this year. The medical professionals referred 52 people to an emergency room.One young man stood out that evening. He limped to the tent on crutches, in great pain. A metal fixator emerged from his lower left leg, swaddled in layers of bloodied gauze. The only medical record a nurse could find in his belongings was a single X-ray showing a severe fracture he had sustained on his journey to the United States.The man had undergone surgery on his leg at a nearby hospital and was returned to detention the previous night. Now he was at the shelter. “They just dropped him here,” Dr. Kathy Fischer, the doctor on duty, said with a note of incredulity in her voice. “It’s kind of crazy.”"
368,"LAREDO, Tex. — Priscilla Villarreal roams the streets of Laredo in an old Dodge pickup, scrambling to drug busts and murder scenes to bring her tales from the dark side of the southwest border to her many viewers.Rappers celebrate her scoops, proclaiming that “she gets more love than our own city’s mayor.”“I guess this makes me famous, huh?” said Ms. Villarreal, 34, a 10th-grade dropout with a shaved head, an abundance of tattoos and an impassioned 119,000-strong following on Facebook. She is arguably the most influential journalist in Laredo, a border city of 260,000.Reporting in profanity-laced Spanglish and calling herself La Gordiloca, which roughly translates as the Crazy Fat Lady, Ms. Villarreal’s swift rise to prominence reflects how many people on the border now prefer to get their news — and just maybe, provides a glimpse at the future of journalism.All the notoriety amounts to a big shift for Ms. Villarreal. Just a few years ago she was working part time for a wrecking crew removing scrap from tractor-trailer crash sites. She was struggling with depression and post-traumatic stress after losing a baby born prematurely.[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]But Ms. Villarreal embarked on a second career in muckraking in 2015. She has held local officials accountable — emerging victorious from a caustic legal battle with the Laredo Police Department over press freedom — and unearthed stories that were not being told.“News on the Move,” she calls it.Fans stop her on the street now to ask for autographs or selfies; Laredo eateries hire her to advertise their cuisine.“She’s already something of a folk hero down there,” said Daxton Stewart, a journalism professor specializing in media law at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth. “What’s fascinating is that she’s doing it the old-fashioned way, but with new technologies, by breaking news the authorities just don’t want out there.”Her recent reports include a horrific case of child abuse (“Teenagers having babies!!” she opined), the arrest of a school superintendent in Waco for possession of marijuana (“Let’s all do a petition for him in Laredo so he won’t lose his job!!”), drug raids and messy tractor-trailer accidents.Ms. Villarreal reports entirely on Facebook, often by live-streaming video on her page on her iPhone. Some follow her because of her fire-breathing reporting style, blending facts with chisme (gossip), but many in Laredo welcome her exposés on public corruption in a city whose abundant reports of graft are the target of an F.B.I. investigation.In February, for instance, she scooped the competition with a report about a former Laredo police investigator who was accused of taking gambling proceeds from raids on slot-machine casinos, then was allowed to resign when confronted with the findings.It took days for competitors to finally catch up and get the story about Anthony Carrillo Jr., 47, a 26-year veteran of the police force, when he was charged with tampering with evidence and abuse of his official capacity.Laredo police officers arrested Ms. Villarreal in December 2017 and charged her with two counts of misuse of official information, a third-degree felony. They said the charges were in connection with her reporting on the 2017 suicide of a Customs and Border Protection supervisor, whose name Ms. Villarreal published.For months before her arrest, the police department had also been hunting down the source of other leaks to Ms. Villarreal. They identified a police officer suspected of supplying the information — a woman who had worked on the force for 19 years — after searching the officer’s phone and finding hundreds of calls exchanged with Ms. Villarreal.The department placed the officer on suspension for 20 days and said in a statement that the case against Ms. Villarreal involved an “obligation to the protection of a person’s right to privacy as it relates to sensitive information.”The district judge who examined the case promptly dismissed the charges against Ms. Villarreal, but the legal battle left her with mixed feelings about her work.“The case made me even more well-known in Laredo, and more sources talk to me now,” she said. “But I remain scared, and who I’m most scared of here aren’t the criminals or smugglers. It’s the Laredo Police Department.”Without editors to review her work, Ms. Villarreal reports almost entirely on her own. The only person who occasionally helps her monitor developments in Laredo is her mother, Maricela Rodríguez, 55, a former migrant worker who used to harvest sugar beets in Minnesota to support her family.“I'm still learning how to say things like ‘allegedly’ or ‘it’s being said’ when I’m describing breaking news,” Ms. Villarreal said. “It’s a challenge, because I speak the language of the streets, and that’s why people follow me.”As newspapers in this part of Texas cut staff and resources for reporting, Ms. Villarreal is pressing ahead. She makes a small amount of money by promoting restaurants she frequents, though it is not enough to replace her 1998 Dodge Ram truck, which she bought used for $700 and affectionately calls her Blue Demon.“For some reason, I find reporting therapeutic,” said Ms. Villarreal, describing her severe depression after losing her baby a decade ago. She said she gained about 100 pounds after the loss, and tried to commit suicide by slitting her wrist.One part of the job that she dislikes, Ms. Villarreal said, is what she calls “my haters.” Some go on her Facebook page and mock her appearance or her demeanor. Others express disgust at all her swearing. Indeed, many of her reports would have trouble finding their way into the pages of a family newspaper.“Every other word out of her mouth is obscene,” said Abundio Rene Cantú, a lawyer for a Laredo day care center that sued Ms. Villarreal for defamation after she reported that children at the site were being mistreated. Ms. Villarreal is appealing an initial ruling against her.“This is a woman who has no respect for the rule of law, or due process,” Mr. Cantú said. “I feel she is a danger to this community because she interferes with law enforcement.”When Ms. Villarreal recently declared opposition to President Trump and his plans for a border wall, some conservatives in Laredo questioned whether she was an undocumented immigrant. (Ms. Villarreal’s grandparents are from Mexico and she was born in the United States.)Most days, she pays her detractors little heed. On a recent day, she prowled the city in the Blue Demon, cranking up the volume as she sang along with Tejano bands like Siggno.Stopping for lunch a short stroll from the border, at the La Posada Hotel, Ms. Villareal was quickly recognized. Some diners stopped to give her a hug and express best wishes about a new revelation: Ms. Villarreal is pregnant. Others lined up to take selfies with her.“I’m one of your top fans,” Hilda Peña, 72, told Ms. Villarreal after wandering over to take a photograph with her. Ms. Peña, a retired financial services administrator, said that Ms. Villarreal won her over last year with her reporting on Juan David Ortiz, the Border Patrol agent accused of killing several women in Laredo. (According to investigators, he has confessed to four killings; he has pleaded not guilty.)“With that serial killer on the loose, I wondered if I should get my gun,” Ms. Peña said. “But La Gordiloca made it clear when the situation was under control.”"
369,"Good morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)After about a week on the picket lines, Los Angeles teachers and district officials reached a deal yesterday to end a historic strike that put the struggles of public schools front and center for a national audience.And although Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles has previously shied away from involving himself in the affairs of the nation’s second-largest school system, with the brighter spotlight and a potential 2020 presidential bid on the horizon, he jumped into action over the last several days, acting as a kind of mediator.My colleague Jennifer Medina, who’s been following the strike closely, spoke to Mr. Garcetti about the strike. Here’s part of their conversation.Jennifer Medina: Before the strike, contract negotiations had stretched on for nearly two years. How and why did you step up to get involved as a mediator? Eric Garcetti: I have a good relationship with the school district and the union knows me and trusts me, so it seemed clear that I could do things other people weren’t able to do. The depth of the lack of the communication took my breath away. Everybody had an excuse to say, ‘We’re not going to sit down.’ There’s plenty of blame, but I think I can help people get to know each other. In August, I started these conversations and then got more involved in December, saying you should be sitting down with each other and offered City Hall or even my office. There was just a lot of mistrust at the beginning. I laid down some ground rules: no surprises, positivity, confidentiality and a commitment — nobody was going to walk away from the table.You called this a “new day” for public schools in Los Angeles — do you think this will significantly change the public’s attitude about public education? Absolutely. For 10 or 15 years, it’s just been: Are you pro-charter or pro-union? There hasn’t been a culture of cooperation. I said from all along, I will only stay involved if we move beyond that.The final round of negotiations stretched into dawn Tuesday morning. Did you ever think a deal might not happen? It almost all fell apart this morning. It had gone over the cliff. We had done all the other items — I think there were 27 other issues that had been resolved by then. But we still had a disagreement about the class size cap. The teachers have for so long seen class size as an unachievable, never-enforced ideal. Superintendent Austin Beutner really wanted to hold on to the prerogative to change it if he needed to. I said it was time for a new day on this, because I think it’s the right thing to do.What do you see as the future of charter schools here? Will we stop seeing their growth in Los Angeles or in the rest of the state? I’m very agnostic on whether our schools are charters or noncharters. I think we should focus on the schools we already have and not have more charters pull away from the district to continue their expansion. We should have more accountability on what’s the costs and consequences of having these charter schools.How will the district come up with the money to pay for all this? I think they realized they could stretch further than they initially thought, while the union realized they could get something in every category they wanted. I think this is a new day to say how people can come together, not just for one philosophy versus another.

371,"WASHINGTON — In pursuit of a wall, President Trump ran into one. A single-minded drive to force Congress to finance his signature campaign promise has left Mr. Trump right back where he started, this time seeking a way to climb over the political barrier in his way after trying to charge through it did not work.As he inched closer to reluctantly accepting a bipartisan spending compromise without the money he demanded for his border wall, Mr. Trump offered no acknowledgment on Wednesday that his pressure tactics had failed even as aides sought to minimize the damage by tamping down criticism on the right.One call was made to Lou Dobbs, a favorite of Mr. Trump’s whose Fox Business Network show he often tries to catch live. Another was placed to Sean Hannity, the Fox host who regularly talks with the president. The message: Mr. Trump deserved support because he still forced concessions that he would never have gotten without a five-week partial government shutdown.Even so, it was arguably the most punishing defeat Mr. Trump has experienced as president, and it left the White House scrounging for other ways to pay for a wall on the southwestern border and rethinking its approach to a Congress now partly controlled by Democrats. Mr. Trump’s inability to reach a satisfying deal despite the negotiating experience he regularly touted on the campaign trail suggested that any aspirations of collaboration across party lines may be even more elusive than he had imagined.“We shut down the government for 35 days, we put America through this crisis, we jeopardized our economy — for what?” said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat in the upper chamber and a member of the House-Senate committee that negotiated this week’s spending deal. “Totally unnecessary.”The agreement that lawmakers produced this week would allocate $1.375 billion for fencing along the border, even less than was on the table at one point last year. The Senate plans to vote on the measure on Thursday, followed by the House. Mr. Trump would not say whether he would sign it, but he seemed to be leaning toward it in the interest of avoiding another government shutdown at midnight Friday.“With the wall, they want to be stingy,” Mr. Trump complained about Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional Democrats during an encounter with reporters on Wednesday. “But we have options that most people don’t really understand.”Those options involve diverting money from other programs and potentially declaring a national emergency to access further funds. In the end, aides said, Mr. Trump may even secure more money than Congress denied him. But those options were just as available to Mr. Trump in December before the showdown that closed federal agencies.While acknowledging disappointment in the agreement, the president and his aides characterized it as better than it seemed, citing money it will provide for overall border security. Mr. Trump argued that the shutdown had been useful because it educated the country about troubles at the border and, if nothing else, he has framed the national debate on his terms.That did not completely assuage conservatives. Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, contradicted the White House line and declared that the agreement was “a bad deal for the president.”“Only in Washington, D.C., can we start out with needing $25 billion for border security measures and expect applause at 1.37,” he said Tuesday on Fox News. “I mean, only in D.C. is that a winning deal.”Mr. Meadows and his allies were among those targeted by the White House in hopes of avoiding a more threatening conservative revolt. A meeting with members of his Freedom Caucus in the Oval Office was partly aimed at urging them to hold their fire in television interviews when talking about the bill, according to a person briefed on the effort.And indeed, despite his complaints about the bill, Mr. Meadows made a point on Wednesday of not blaming Mr. Trump. “I think he handled it as well as anybody could handle it, given a dysfunctional Congress,” Mr. Meadows told reporters.Among those involved in the outreach, according to the person briefed on the discussions, was Bill Shine, a White House deputy chief of staff and former Fox executive who in the West Wing is seen as adept at getting some hosts at Fox to respond to White House concerns.Since coming to office, Mr. Trump has missed several opportunities to make more progress on the wall. Instead of Mexico directly paying for a $25 billion, 1,000-mile concrete barrier, as the president once said would happen, he has been seeking partial installments from Congress, arguing that his new trade agreement with Mexico will ultimately pay off enough to offset the cost. The partial installments have generally gone to replacing or repairing existing barriers, not to building the new concrete or steel walls Mr. Trump wants.At one point last year, the president and Democrats were close to a deal in which he would get all $25 billion for the wall in exchange for protections for 1.8 million young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. But Mr. Trump ultimately turned away because he also wanted cuts to legal immigration that Democrats would not accept.In his budget request for this year, Mr. Trump asked for $1.6 billion, and the Senate Appropriations Committee agreed on a bipartisan basis to give him that last summer. But the measure stalled until after the midterm elections in November.By the time Mr. Trump met with Ms. Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, in December, they offered $1.375 billion. The president then insisted on $5.7 billion, and when he did not get it, much of the government was left without the funding to keep doors open.During the shutdown, Ms. Pelosi took an even harder line, saying she would not spend a single dollar on Mr. Trump’s wall, although she said she would provide money for other border security.The deal reached this week returned to the same $1.375 billion available in December to pay for 55 miles of fencing along the border, although not walls based on the new steel or concrete prototypes Mr. Trump has promoted.Mr. Trump and his aides claimed victory because they had gotten more than Ms. Pelosi’s zero dollars, and they noted that the agreement also included $23 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, an increase from $21 billion last year. But Democrats said much of the increase would go to their priorities, like more customs agents and humanitarian aid, not to Mr. Trump’s.Either way, his aides are now focused on finding pots of money that, with the president’s traditional discretion, can be reprogrammed toward the wall. If that is not enough, he could still declare a national emergency to bypass Congress, although such a move is opposed by many Republicans and would invariably draw a court challenge.As a result, some supporters of tougher border security said Mr. Trump’s critics should not crow because the struggle is not over.“People say, ‘Well, the president lost,’” said James Jay Carafano, a national security analyst at the Heritage Foundation. “The analogy here is if it’s a 10-round fight, Trump’s fighting 10 rounds. If Pelosi wants to say at the end of Round 1, ‘I won that round,’ Trump’s like, ‘Yeah, maybe, but I’m fighting 10 rounds.’”Andy Surabian, a former Trump White House aide, said the details do not matter to the president’s base as much as his determination to fulfill his promise. “His supporters don’t care about how the rest of the wall is built,” he said. “They just care that the wall is ultimately built.”"
372,"Good morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)As consumers, workers and communities push back against the seemingly boundless power and wealth of big tech companies, they’re starting to find it may be harder than it sounds to quit corporations that provide now-crucial services.My colleague Kate Conger, who covers privacy, policy and labor for The Times’s Tech team, wrote about a Berkeley City Council proposal to boycott Amazon:Under state law, no city in California is allowed to share data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But city officials have been left to determine how they’ll comply with the law — and many cities are now scrutinizing the behavior of the tech companies they rely on for city services.Richmond approved an ordinance in June that will end its contract with Vigilant Solutions, a data analytics company that does business with ICE. Other Bay Area cities, including Oakland, Berkeley and Alameda are weighing similar proposals that, if enacted, could lead the cities to sever ties with tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft.Berkeley’s City Council is currently weighing a proposal to boycott Amazon in protest against the tech giant’s contracts with ICE and Customs and Border Protection. Given Amazon’s business relationships with these agencies, Berkeley should “commit to finding ethical alternatives,” two City Council members, Kriss Worthington and Cheryl Davila, wrote in a memo. The City Council is also scrutinizing its business with Microsoft and Thompson Reuters over the companies’ ICE contracts.“We’re subsidizing these deportation policies,” said Brian Hofer, a lawyer who has pushed cities to adopt legislation that limits their business relationships with tech firms that contract with ICE.The Berkeley City Council is expected to debate the proposed legislation this month. Berkeley, which was at the forefront of the sanctuary city movement, relies on Amazon for a range of web-hosting and infrastructure services. Now, the city is struggling to align its sanctuary traditions with its digital needs.Dee Williams-Ridley, the city manager, recommended against the boycott because it would be too costly for the city to move off Amazon. “Adoption of the proposed Amazon boycott would have a huge negative impact to the citywide operations,” Ms. Williams-Ridley wrote in a memo reviewed by The New York Times. The city uses Amazon to host housing and mental health programs, do cybersecurity, and to manage city documents. It also relies on other tech companies, such as Airbnb and Nextdoor, which in turn host their services on Amazon servers.“I sort of despair about what we can do at this local level, frankly,” said Kate Harrison, a member of the City Council. “If we identify a company involved in data brokerage for ICE, and we have an alternative, we should take the alternative. It’s a balancing act.”Mr. Hofer said that the impact would be stronger as more cities pass similar legislation and that he hoped to bring the initiative statewide. Starting in Silicon Valley is important because of the region’s connection to the technology industry, he added. “It’s symbolic that we’re doing it here; we’re the same people that are creating the technology that’s doing this,” Mr. Hofer said.“It’s ideological and not necessarily grounded in practicality,” said Susan Wengraf, a City Council member. “It’s Berkeley,” she added with a soft laugh. “What can I tell you?”(We often link to content on sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

373,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)The partial government shutdown is now in its fifth week, and some of the 800,000 federal workers who’ve been affected are turning to jobs like driving for Uber or substitute teaching. “It’s almost as if I’m starting over again from a teenager,” said a woman who began delivering takeout dinners and groceries after being furloughed at the Department of Agriculture.The shutdown is also hurting some of the most vulnerable, including the homeless and those who depend on federal rent subsidies.Catch up: Over the weekend, President Trump proposed restoring temporary protections for the undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall, an offer Speaker Nancy Pelosi immediately rejected. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, could propose legislation today that would wrap Mr. Trump’s proposal into a package to reopen the government. News analysis: People who have done business with Mr. Trump say his current stance is consistent with negotiating tactics he used in the private sector: focusing foremost on claiming victory.The Trump administration announced last month that it was lifting sanctions against several companies controlled by an influential oligarch, Oleg Deripaska. The government characterized the move as tough on both him and Russia.But a confidential document signed by both sides suggests that the agreement is less punishing than advertised, freeing Mr. Deripaska from hundreds of millions of dollars in debt.How we know: The Treasury Department described the agreement in a letter to Congress that was released publicly. But the confidential document, which was reviewed by The Times, includes greater detail.Background: Sanctions were announced in April against Mr. Deripaska, six other Russian oligarchs and their companies in retaliation for “a range of malign activity around the globe.”The island’s enormous ice sheet is melting so quickly that it could become a major factor in rising sea levels within two decades, scientists said on Monday.The research found that ice loss in 2012 was nearly four times as much as in 2003 and that, after a lull in 2013-14, losses have resumed.The impact: The study is the latest suggesting that estimates of the effects of a warming planet have been too conservative and highlighting what scientists say is the need for a sharp reduction in emissions of planet-warming gases.Go deeper: Times journalists traveled to Greenland’s ice sheet in 2015 to find out more about the effects of climate change. Hours after the militant group killed dozens at a base in Afghanistan on Monday, the Taliban said they had resumed talks with American diplomats in Qatar.An Afghan official said the attack had targeted a center where pro-government fighters were receiving training from the country’s intelligence agency.Background: Last month, President Trump ordered the U.S. military to begin plans to withdraw about 7,000 troops from Afghanistan. But the violence there shows no sign of abating.Video replay was supposed to fix mistakes by officials on the field, but a blown call in the Saints-Rams game on Sunday exposed a weakness in the rule book.At stake was a trip to the Super Bowl.

374,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. We look at President Xi Jinping’s quest to absorb Taiwan, the U.S. Congress’s first day back and a 300-mile human chain in India. Here’s the latest:The Chinese leader called Taiwan’s autonomy “a wound to the Chinese nation” and demanded greater progress in Beijing’s decades-long quest to win control of the disputed island.Details: Mr. Xi gave Taiwan two options: He could use military force if the self-ruled territory grasped for independence, or he could offer a “one country, two systems” deal, similar to the framework used in Hong Kong. But the president didn’t lay down a timetable for either path.Reaction: People in Taiwan are unlikely to be receptive to Mr. Xi’s offer, especially as they watch Beijing squeeze Hong Kong’s political freedoms.Context: China and Taiwan have been in conflict over the island’s status since 1949, when forces defeated by Mao Zedong retreated to the island. Tensions increased when the island moved to democratic elections in the 1990s. Today, only 3 percent of Taiwan’s population favors immediate unification with China, according to a recent survey.Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives when it reconvenes today, representing the first taste of a split government during the Trump era.Details: The U.S. government has been partly shut down for nearly two weeks after a legislative impasse over funding for a border wall.What to watch for: President Trump has invited congressional leaders of both parties to a briefing on border security. Representative Nancy Pelosi, who is likely to be elected speaker today, has said the wall can’t be part of any deal to reopen the government.Kim Jong-un said on Tuesday that he was willing to hold a second summit meeting with President Trump, but he added that if international sanctions weren’t lifted, the North would “have no choice” but to return to nuclear confrontation.“We will not make nuclear weapons and we will not proliferate nuclear weapons,” Mr. Kim said. But he added that it “won’t be good” if the U.S. didn’t make “corresponding measures.”Details: Progress between the U.S. and North Korea hinges on the definition of “denuclearization.” For the U.S., that means the North giving up its entire arsenal. For North Korea, it also includes a reciprocal pullback of America’s ability to threaten the country with nuclear weapons.Analysis: Mr. Kim has essentially returned to where things stood when Mr. Trump took office, indicating that their meeting in Singapore in June altered the optics of their relationship more than the reality, writes our national security correspondent.Two women in the southern Indian state of Kerala sneaked into a centuries-old Hindu shrine that has long barred women of childbearing age.Context: In October, India’s Supreme Court ruled that the ban on women entering the temple was unconstitutional. Since then, women trying to set foot in the shrine have been pushed back by mobs shouting in their faces and hurling stones.Why it matters: This recent development in Kerala was part of a broader movement for equality in the country. Hours before the women entered the temple, an estimated five million people formed a 300-mile-long human chain protesting gender inequality.Reaction: The news was met with protests across the state. The police moved relatives of one of the women to a safe house, local news media reported. And a Hindu priest shut down the temple for “purification rituals.”But one officer stationed near the temple said the two women, whose names were given only as Bindu and Kanakadurga, were “real heroines.”U.S.-China trade talks: As negotiations seeking to reach a deal by March 2 begin, we take a look at the U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer, a China skeptic who wants to keep an anxious president from making a hasty compromise to calm the markets.Markets: The new year started on a down note, as shares on Wall Street tumbled at the start of trading, following declines in Europe and Asia, but rose later in the day.Tesla: The auto company reported a 15 percent increase in quarterly production but also announced a price cut for all models, which could suggest softer demand.Censorship factories: Our New New World columnist takes an inside look at Chinese companies whose thousands of low-wage workers help the government monitor and scrub content online.Birth tourism: Chinese mothers choosing to give birth in Canada to get citizenship for their babies are facing growing opposition in the country, with some Canadians calling the legal practice “unethical.”Cultural Revolution: The Chinese photographer Li Zhensheng has been on a decades-long mission to make his country remember the decade when up to 1.5 million died, according to some estimates.

Here’s how to eat a little better.Making changes in the new year? Use science to stick to your goals.How do you acknowledge a colleague’s message? After a recent digital exchange, this writer looked into the history of one of his favored responses: “Roger that.”In the days of Morse code, an R was sent to indicate that a message had been received.That system evolved with the introduction of radio communications. Early transmissions were often of poor quality, so, to avoid misunderstandings, spelling alphabets were developed. Also called phonetic alphabets, they replaced letters with words that started with the corresponding letter.By World War II, the U.S. and British militaries had settled on a standard: Able for A, Baker for B … and Roger for R. (Previously, the British had used Robert.)In the 1950s, a new alphabet — commonly referred to as the NATO phonetic alphabet — was adopted, and is now the most widely used. It replaced Roger with Romeo. (I’m planning to stick with Roger.)Chris Stanford, on the briefings team, wrote today’s Back Story.

375,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Huawei comes under the microscope in Europe, a rogue mascot creates trouble in a Japanese city and Netflix cracks the Academy Awards. Here’s the latest: Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, offered the first glimmers of a potential resolution to the government shutdown, scheduling procedural votes Thursday on two competing bills to reopen the government.Details: One measure includes funding for President Trump’s border wall; the other is a short-term spending bill that would fund shuttered agencies through Feb. 8. Although neither is likely to pass, the compromise gives each party a chance to press its proposal. And the votes could prompt the two sides to negotiate a bipartisan compromise.Context: At the same time, Mr. Trump and Speaker Nancy Pelosi remained in a private standoff about whether he should be allowed to deliver his State of the Union address next week. Ms. Pelosi has yet to issue Mr. Trump a formal invitation.Go deeper: The shutdown, now in its fifth week, has forced some of the unpaid 800,000 federal workers to enter the gig economy to make ends meet. Here’s a roundup of our other shutdown coverage.A proposed law making its way through the country’s Congress would reduce the minimum age for criminal liability to 9 from 15 — a measure drawing fierce criticism from rights activists.Context: President Rodrigo Duterte, who has waged a deadly antidrug campaign since he came to power in 2016, has long criticized the current law for restricting crackdowns on gangs that use children for their criminal activities.But critics have denounced the measure as misguided. “We urge the government to address conditions that push children to such circumstances,” said a spokeswoman for the country’s human rights commission, “rather than placing the burden on a child for failures of institutions meant to protect them.”What next? Since Mr. Duterte has allies in both houses of Congress, the proposed law will probably get the green light soon. It was quickly approved by a justice panel in the House of Representatives, and the Senate is likely to pass its own version of the bill.As Ms. Osaka, the half-Haitian, half-Japanese tennis champion, prepares for her quarterfinal match at the Australian Open today, an image of her is stirring up controversy in Japan.An anime-style ad for Nissin, the world’s largest instant-noodle brand, features Ms. Osaka with lighter skin and a different hair style — a depiction fans found deeply disappointing.Context: Ms. Osaka’s rise has challenged a longstanding sense of cultural and racial homogeneity in Japan and has been particularly exciting for biracial people in Japan, known as “hafus.” The ad revived discussions around the issue.In other Japan news: A rogue, mischievous mascot, which looks like a deceivingly cute otter but has been staging dangerous stunts, is causing headaches for officials in the southern city of Susaki. In Britain, the Chinese telecom giant Huawei donated to top schools, held parties for political leaders and sponsored a charity founded by Prince Charles. In Germany, it sponsored the recent convention of the country’s governing political party, the Christian Democratic Union.Europe is now Huawei’s biggest market outside of China, generating $20 billion in revenue in 2017 — about a quarter of its total business. And that’s the result of a 15-year campaign to cultivate closer ties with European governments.Why it matters: Europe, like the U.S., is now beginning to turn on Huawei over concerns that its technology is being used for espionage. Officials there are considering restrictions, companies are reassessing deals and organizations are returning donations.But untangling from Huawei may be difficult, as its equipment plays a crucial role in the continent’s wireless infrastructure. Severing ties could delay hyperfast 5G networks.Huawei’s response: The company has consistently denied wrongdoing. But as criticism mounts, it is working to ease concerns, including by allowing German officials to inspect its engineering and code.

376,"WASHINGTON — The federal courts are running out of money as the partial government shutdown continues with no end in sight, raising concerns that the legal system will be significantly hobbled if the standoff is not resolved soon.Judges and court officials around the country are bracing for the likelihood that the federal judiciary will be unable to maintain its current operations within the next two weeks, once it exhausts the money it has been relying on since the shutdown began last month.Already, courts have been cutting down on expenses like travel and new hiring. Court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants have been working without pay since late December, according to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, which provides support for the court system.There have been other disruptions. The Justice Department is among the executive branch agencies whose funding has lapsed, and at the department’s request, some federal courts have issued orders postponing civil cases in which the Justice Department is a party while the shutdown continues, according to the administrative office.If the judiciary runs out of money, courts around the country will pare down their work to “mission critical” operations, officials said. Thousands of court employees will stop receiving paychecks, some workers are expected to be furloughed and more civil cases could grind to a halt. Jurors may have to wait to be paid until the shutdown is over.“We’re already having to make what I call triage decisions as to what we can do versus what we cannot do,” said Chief Judge Rubén Castillo of Federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, which includes Chicago.The Trump administration has tried to blunt the effects of the shutdown on important government services by drawing up plans to recall thousands of employees in executive branch agencies like the Internal Revenue Service and the Agriculture Department.But the courts present an area in which the damage from the shutdown is expected to worsen considerably. A crippled judiciary, with all the consequences that would entail for businesses and citizens alike who come before its courts, would only add to the pressure on President Trump and lawmakers to find a way to reopen the government.With roughly 33,000 employees nationwide and annual federal funding of under $8 billion, the judiciary makes up a tiny part of the federal budget. In recent years, it has accounted for only about two-tenths of 1 percent of annual federal spending.But like other parts of the government, it relies on Congress to provide funding as part of the annual appropriations process, and it now stands as one of the many parts of the government whose funding lapsed in December after Mr. Trump demanded money for a border wall and congressional Democrats refused to go along.Unlike other parts of the government, the courts have been able to keep afloat over the past few weeks by relying on court fees as well as other funds that were available. The courts are now expected to be able to continue funded operations through at least Jan. 25, and possibly until Feb. 1, the administrative office said.When the courts run out of money, they will essentially have to react much the way that executive branch agencies did in December, limiting work to certain essential activities.For the courts, that includes “activities to support the exercise of the courts’ constitutional powers under Article III, specifically the resolution of cases and related services,” the administrative office said.The Supreme Court, federal appeals courts, district courts and bankruptcy courts around the country will have to decide on a court-by-court basis how they will change their operations and what staff will be needed to continue that work. Court employees, like executive branch employees affected by the shutdown, would work without pay or be furloughed.Under the Constitution, Supreme Court justices, appeals court judges and district judges would continue to be paid, according to the Congressional Research Service.Court officials are grappling with all sorts of complications that could arise, including the possible effects on court reporters and court interpreters, as well as on jurors who are supposed to be paid for their service and reimbursed for transportation expenses.In Brooklyn, the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York is planning to furlough some court employees, and groups that use courthouse facilities for occasions like bar association meetings or continuing legal education are being told to make other plans.“There’s a lot of angst, I can tell you that,” Eugene J. Corcoran, the district executive for the Eastern District, said of the sentiment among workers.In the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which covers much of the West, one idea being considered is to close the appellate courthouses to the public for one weekday per week and furlough employees that day.“My chief judge has no intention of canceling court,” said Molly Dwyer, the clerk of court for the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, noting that oral arguments had been scheduled for weeks to come.In Manhattan, the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York has already restricted the hours when initial appearances for criminal defendants can take place, because of staffing constraints with the United States Marshals Service.There are little things that cost money but might not normally get much thought, like providing lunch for jurors when they are deliberating. “I got to find a deli in town that’s going to continue to let us owe them thousands of dollars,” said Edward Friedland, the district executive for the Southern District.Then there is the issue of keeping the courthouse doors open.Mr. Friedland said it was unclear if contracted building workers who handle areas like fire safety as well as heating, ventilation and air conditioning would be paid beyond February, raising the possibility that the Southern District’s courthouses might not be able to stay open.That uncertainty has prompted the court to turn to its pandemic plan — which was prepared for a situation in which judges and other court personnel would not be able to leave their homes because of a disease outbreak, but essential work like determining bail for defendants still needed to take place.“That’s something we never thought we’d be testing for this purpose,” Mr. Friedland said.In Chicago, Judge Castillo worried that there would be longer-term ramifications, such as veteran employees deciding to call it quits, and young people being turned off from pursuing federal jobs.“It’s very self-defeating,” he said, adding: “It’s like you’re on the front lines and you’re being shot in the back by your own forces. That’s how it feels.”Given that his court is already understaffed, he said he was not planning furloughs. But he said that civil trials would be “shut down,” and his court would give priority to criminal cases in which defendants are detained awaiting trial and have the presumption of innocence.Still, for defendants who are not detained, he predicted that defense lawyers would not want to go to trial because of another complication: There would not be any money to pay jurors until after the shutdown.“The dilemma that creates is then you have jurors who are making big decisions and may be unhappy about the circumstances of their jury service,” Judge Castillo said. “I was a defense attorney. I would not want to proceed to trial under those circumstances because those circumstances can lead to rushed judgments on the part of jurors that just want to get this done and over with. That’s not fair.”"
377,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Mr. Trump said on Thursday that the U.S. should recognize Israel’s authority over the long disputed Golan Heights, overturning decades of American policy in the Middle East.Mr. Trump’s announcement on Twitter came after persistent pressure from the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, an ally who is fighting for his political life with an election scheduled for next month. While popular in Israel and among some U.S. lawmakers, Mr. Trump’s decision is likely to be condemned almost everywhere else. Catch up: The United Nations has rejected Israel’s occupation of the Golan Heights since 1967, when Israeli troops seized the 400 square miles from Syria during the Arab-Israeli War. Here’s a brief history of the dispute. What’s next: Practically speaking, Mr. Trump’s announcement doesn’t change much, as the status of the Golan Heights is not under negotiation, and there’s no expectation that Israel will withdraw. But symbolically, the decision shakes up a debate that has changed little since the 1970s.European Union officials agreed on Thursday to extend the deadline for Britain’s withdrawal from the bloc until May 22, as long as Prime Minister Theresa May can persuade Parliament to accept her plan for doing so. If she can’t — and lawmakers have already rejected her proposal twice — the deadline would be moved up to April 12.The agreement effectively averted a disorderly and chaotic departure at the end of next week, yet such a break remains a possibility.What’s next: Neither side wants Britain to leave without a deal. European Union officials said they remained open to a longer delay but that it would require Britain to participate in European Parliament elections — something that Mrs. May has said would be an absurdity.A week after the terrorist attack on two mosques that left 50 people dead, mourners from around the world gathered in Christchurch, New Zealand, today to share the Muslim call to prayer and two minutes of silence.“This terrorist sought to tear our nation apart with an evil ideology that has torn the world apart — but instead we have shown that New Zealand is unbreakable,” said Imam Gamal Fouda of Al Noor Mosque, one of the two attacked.Related: In addition to announcing a ban on the type of weapons used in the shooting, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has pledged to hold social media companies accountable for letting hateful speech thrive on their platforms. As of Thursday, at least two people have been charged in New Zealand with spreading the killer’s video of part of the attack.The Daily: Today’s episode is about the speed with which New Zealand planned changes to its gun laws after the attack.The country’s national airline said today that it had asked to cancel an order of 737 Max 8 jets. It is the first publicly confirmed attempt to stop a deal since the planes were involved in two deadly crashes. A spokesman for the carrier, Garuda Indonesia, said that its passengers had lost confidence in the model. But he acknowledged that it would be difficult to cancel a signed agreement.Garuda’s deal was for 49 planes, and estimated to be worth $4.9 billion. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment.Another angle: Relatives of those killed when another airline’s Max 8 crashed in Indonesia say the airline tried to buy their silence with a deal that would also protect Boeing.Small countries, corporations and wealthy individuals have a new weapon at their disposal: privatized spying through companies that hire former intelligence operatives. A monthslong Times investigation found that the firms have enabled governments to hack not only terrorist groups and drug cartels, but also activists and journalists.

But the phrase is also used metaphorically to refer to a character-defining political issue, and it has been popping up in coverage of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.The chemical test, in use since the Middle Ages, employs a dye derived from lichens to determine whether a solution is more acidic or alkaline.The political application of the phrase appeared in The Times at least as early as 1950, when it described NATO and the Marshall Plan as “the litmus test for distinguishing between Communists and supporters of the United States.”This year, “litmus test” has appeared in The Times to refer to marijuana legalization, the proposed border wall and universal health care."
378,"WASHINGTON — The partial government shutdown is inflicting far greater damage on the United States economy than previously estimated, the White House acknowledged on Tuesday, as President Trump’s economists doubled projections of how much economic growth is being lost each week the standoff with Democrats continues.The revised estimates from the Council of Economic Advisers show that the shutdown, now in its fourth week, is beginning to have real economic consequences. The analysis, and other projections from outside the White House, suggests that the shutdown has already weighed significantly on growth and could ultimately push the United States economy into a contraction.While Vice President Mike Pence previously played down the shutdown’s effects amid a “roaring” economy, White House officials are now cautioning Mr. Trump about the toll it could take on a sustained economic expansion. Mr. Trump, who has hitched his political success to the economy, also faces other economic headwinds, including slowing global growth, a trade war with China and the waning effects of a $1.5 trillion tax cut.To blunt the shutdown’s effects, the administration on Tuesday called tens of thousands of employees back to work, without pay, to process tax returns, ensure flight safety and inspect food and drugs. But some people involved in the shutdown discussions in the White House have privately said they anticipate that Mr. Trump will grow anxious about the economic impact in the coming days, accelerating an end to the stalemate. Others close to the president believe Mr. Trump has leverage and are encouraging him to stand by his demands.For now, the White House shows no signs of being ready to relent, and Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, continued to blame Democrats for the economic damage.“Congress needs to look at the harms that we’re talking about,” Mr. Hassett said, “and address them.”Mr. Hassett said on Tuesday that the administration now calculates that the shutdown reduces quarterly economic growth by 0.13 percentage points for every week that it lasts — the cumulative effect of lost work from contractors and furloughed federal employees who are not getting paid and who are investing and spending less as a result. That means that the economy has already lost nearly half a percentage point of growth from the four-week shutdown. (Last year, economic growth for the first quarter totaled 2.2 percent.)Mr. Hassett, attempting to illustrate the pain caused by the shutdown, said on Tuesday that one of his furloughed staff members had begun driving for Uber to make ends meet.Mr. Trump has demanded that Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, include $5.7 billion for a border wall in any measure to fund the government. Democrats have refused and, along with some Republicans, have tried to persuade the president to reopen the government and negotiate border security afterward. The House has passed several bills to fund parts of the government, including the Internal Revenue Service, that are not related to border security. Senate Republicans have declined to schedule votes on those bills.On Tuesday, in an effort to try to splinter the Democrats’ opposition, the White House invited several House Democrats from districts Mr. Trump won to discuss a path forward. None showed up.The impasse has left 800,000 federal employees furloughed or working without pay, along with throwing thousands of government contractors at least temporarily off the job.Mr. Hassett said it was possible that the damage could grow. He also said much of the damage should be repaired once the shutdown ends and workers get back pay. But he acknowledged that the shutdown could permanently reduce growth expectations if businesses and markets begin to expect that Congress and the president will repeat the experience again and again.Some economists have begun to warn that such a situation is likely and that economic confidence could be undermined as businesses, consumers and investors lose faith in the ability of political leaders to find agreement on issues like raising the federal debt limit and approving trade deals.That lack of confidence could snowball into a self-inflicted economic contraction on the heels of what appears to have been the nation’s strongest year of growth since the 2008 financial crisis. Financial markets are already highly volatile amid concerns about the trade fight with China, slowing global growth and signs of weakness in American housing and manufacturing sectors.“The economy could easily stall in the first quarter, and then the question is what happens in the second” if the shutdown persists, said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “The longer it goes on, the longer it takes to recover.”If the shutdown continues through the end of March, Mr. Shepherdson said in a research note, he would expect the economy to shrink in the first quarter. While federal workers are likely to receive back pay once the furlough ends, most government contractors will not, and the longer spending is depressed, the higher the risk that the businesses they run or patronize will fail, Mr. Shepherdson said.The shutdown “is threatening to derail this economic expansion,” Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist for the Economic Outlook Group, said in a research note on Tuesday. Its effect on federal workers’ spending plans is particularly worrisome for the automotive and housing markets, which were already showing signs of trouble before the shutdown, he said.On Tuesday, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey showed weakening manufacturing activity in the United States, the latest in a line of similar warnings. Economists at JPMorgan Chase called the data an early indication of additional slowing in the sector, adding that the shutdown was probably hurting business sentiment.Michael L. Corbat, the chief executive of Citigroup, told analysts on Monday that “right now, we see the biggest risk in the global economy as one of talking ourselves into a recession.”With no end in sight, federal workers appear ready to seek alternate employment before things get worse.The online jobs site Indeed analyzed job search behavior from mid-December through mid-January for workers at some affected federal agencies, including the I.R.S. and Transportation Security Administration. It found clicks on job listings rose at least 17 percent for each of those worker groups over that period, a sign that employees affected by the shutdown “are searching for jobs more right now than they usually do at this time of year,” said Martha Gimbel, Indeed’s director of economic research.“With the shutdown occurring in a tight labor market, many workers have other options, and they seem to be trying to take advantage of them,” Ms. Gimbel said. “If the shutdown leads to a loss of talent for the federal government, it could be harder for it to compete for new hires in a labor market this tight.”That might already be happening inside the White House. Mr. Hassett said on Tuesday that a prospective new hire had told the council that he might turn down the job he had been offered out of graduate school because the government is unable to bring him onto the payroll."

President Trump struck some unifying notes in his second State of the Union address, and he also made an extended argument for his border wall.Our coverage includes video of the speech, and analysis, takeaways and fact-checks by our correspondents.The chamber’s Republicans broke out into chants of “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” more than once. The many newly elected Democratic lawmakers also listening were less enthusiastic.Stacey Abrams, who drew wide attention in her narrow loss for Georgia governor, delivered the Democrats’ rebuttal, framed in terms of values and contextualized with her own biography._____2. President Trump’s inaugural committee was ordered to turn over documents about its donors, finances and activities to federal prosecutors, meaning the investigations surrounding him have spread to virtually all aspects of his adult life: his business, his campaign, his inauguration (above) and his presidency.The subpoena shows interest in possible money laundering and whether foreigners illegally donated to the inaugural committee, which would constitute election fraud. But it is possible that the prosecutors do not suspect the inaugural committee itself of such violations.Separately, prosecutors are looking at foreign payments to three major law and lobbying firms — Mercury Public Affairs; the Podesta Group; and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom — that Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, recruited to improve the image of a Ukrainian leader._____3. Pope Francis acknowledged for the first time that the Roman Catholic Church had a persistent problem of sexual abuse of nuns by priests and even bishops.He spoke at the end of a 40-hour visit to the United Arab Emirates, where he celebrated Mass with about 135,000 Catholics, above, in the largest public Christian rite in the history of the U.A.E.Nuns have accused priests in India, Africa and Italy in recent years, and a Vatican magazine recently reported that nuns were having abortions or giving birth to the children of priests. Asked about the issue on the papal plane as it returned to Rome, Francis said: “It’s true. There are priests and bishops who have done that.”He said the Vatican had suspended some priests. “Should more be done? Yes,” he said. “Do we have the will? Yes. But it is a path that we have already begun.”_____4. Call it a relief rally: Stocks are rising on earnings, and earnings aren’t even that good.Many companies that have reported have missed Wall Street forecasts, but over all, their stocks have risen by an average of 1.1 percent, the largest post-earnings jump in a decade. “The market is being unbelievably kind,” an equity strategist said.Analysts say the improved mood could propel stocks yet higher. Above, traders at the New York Stock Exchange today.Separately, Qatar and Exxon Mobil are planning a $10 billion natural gas investment in Texas, which will give Qatar greater access to Latin America. The move would also strengthen the relationship between Qatar, which is two years into a dispute with Saudi Arabia, and the Trump administration._____5. Four of America’s largest cities are under the dark clouds of major federal corruption investigations: Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and Atlanta.“The investigations,” three of our national correspondents write, “raise questions not just about who else might be caught up in them, but also about whether there can be any lasting cure for the chronic corruption problems that seem to dog big cities, so often dominated by a single party or political machine.”Based on the number of federal public corruption convictions in the last 30 years, the Chicago and Los Angeles metropolitan areas are the two most corrupt in America (above, F.B.I. agents raided the home of a Los Angeles City Council member in November). Philadelphia is eighth. Atlanta did not make the top 10, but the 2006 conviction of a former mayor still ripples._____6. The police officer who fatally shot a young black man in an Alabama shopping mall, mistaking the do-gooder for a gunman, will not be charged.The death of Emantic Bradford Jr. incited protests and raised questions about whether police officers are too quick to assume that a nonwhite person who is armed is a wrongdoer. The state’s attorney general found that the officer had “reasonably exercised” his duties.“Officer 1’s actions were reasonable under the circumstances and were consistent with his training and nationally accepted standards for ‘active shooter’ scenarios,” the report stated._____7. Global warming is melting glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica. On Monday, a report found that one- to two-thirds of Himalayan glaciers could melt by 2100, disrupting food and water supplies for two billion people.But ice is also vanishing a little closer to home — in lakes.Thousands of lakes in the Northern Hemisphere that used to freeze every winter are already seeing some years without ice, a new study found. Without a winter cover, lakes begin warming earlier in the year, affecting algae blooms and putting increased stress on fish and other organisms._____8. Our Rocky Mountains-based reporter took a photographer with her to the National Western Stock Show in Denver, a 16-day celebration of western heritage.They came away with a powerful look at how western wear helps modern-day cowboys maintain their identity, even as economic pressures make living off the land more difficult.“We’re not only ambassadors for the rodeo,” said one cowgirl whose parents sold most of their cattle a few months ago because of soaring business costs, “but of the western way of life.”_____9. “If the hunting world wants to grow in America, it’s going to be up to the millennials.”That’s Wade Truong, a 33-year-old chef in Virginia, who’s part of a new generation of hunters seeking a direct connection with what they eat — and helping boost the number of the country’s hunting licenses to 15.6 million last year, up from 14.4 million in 2010.In other food news, our chief restaurant critic explains why complaining about your food to management (rather than online) is a good thing, and how to do it. “The more specific your complaint, the more likely it is to be understood,” he writes._____10. Finally, happy Lunar New Year.The holiday, one of the most important in many Asian countries, typically begins on the second new moon after winter solstice. But in the many countries that use the Gregorian calendar, including the U.S., the date changes every year. Above, celebrations in Hong Kong.That’s just one example of how calendars reveal the history and cultural values of the societies that created them. Most time-keeping traditions track the movement of the sun, moon and the stars, but some consider fortune telling and seasonal events. The Trobriand Islands off New Guinea, for example, use the autumnal swarming of sea worms to orient each year.Have a lucky night, and a great new year._____Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

382,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. Surprises from Jeremy Corbyn in Britain, the foreign minister in Iran and astrophysicists all over. Here’s the latest: Facing a rash of resignations from Labour and the prospect of more, the party’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, dropped his resistance to a second referendum on whether the country should withdraw from the E.U.The amendment is unlikely to be approved in Parliament anytime soon, but it will cheer those in the country who have been fighting to reverse the outcome of the 2016 referendum.What’s next: On Wednesday, Parliament is expected to vote to eliminate the chaotic option of leaving the E.U. without a transition plan in place. That would leave Prime Minister Theresa May, who met with European leaders in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on Monday, with few options to complete Brexit by the March 29 deadline.A summit meeting between European and Arab leaders was never going to be easy. And indeed, it wasn’t. “You are not going to teach us about humanity,” the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, told Europeans who questioned his human rights record in talks at the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, even as they sought closer ties on issues like migration and terrorism. Europeans and Arabs have a different “sense of humanity, values and ethics,” Mr. Sisi said. “Respect our values and ethics, as we do yours.”Mohammad Javad Zarif, an American-educated diplomat who was an architect of the Iranian nuclear deal, announced his resignation on Instagram. He is one of the Islamic Republic’s best-known figures abroad.In his post, he said he apologized “for my inability to continue serving and for all the shortcomings during my service.” What we don’t know: It was not immediately clear why he was quitting or whether his resignation would be accepted. Analysis: Mr. Zarif was the only top Iranian official with a deep understanding of Western diplomacy and the ability to interact directly with the West. His public resignation, in a country where governance is usually conducted behind closed doors, seemed to indicate escalating tensions between the country’s hard-liners and President Hassan Rouhani. Context: Iran is in the midst of a dire economic crisis, worsened by American sanctions, which has increased pressure on Mr. Rouhani. The U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal made Mr. Zarif vulnerable to attacks from hard-liners who never supported it. The universe seems to be expanding far more rapidly than it should be. Astrophysicists have struggled to account for the discrepancy. They’ve been coming up with new ideas, which, if borne out, could mean rewriting the story of the origin of the cosmos, and its ultimate fate. The problem: New precision in measuring the Hubble constant — the acceleration of galaxies away from one another in the expanding universe — suggests that the expansion is about 9 percent faster than expected. Possible explanations: Theories involve dark energy, new particles and a mysterious force that appeared near the Big Bang and then disappeared. We’d really like to just direct you to the explanation by our science reporter Dennis Overbye, who has a degree in physics from M.I.T. and a way with words. Australia: The lifting of a gag order allowed news organizations to finally report that in December, Cardinal George Pell became the highest-ranking Roman Catholic leader to be convicted of sexual abuse. This is the story The Times was able to print at the time, but not distribute online. Vietnam: North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has arrived in Hanoi for a summit meeting with President Trump, who is en route. For Mr. Kim, the visit has many layers of symbolism that go beyond the American president. Venezuela: Adding pressure on President Nicolás Maduro to step down, the U.S. vice president, Mike Pence, announced new sanctions while meeting with the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, in neighboring Colombia. Kashmir: The Pakistani military said India had conducted airstrikes in territory controlled by Pakistan, which the Indian government blames for a recent suicide attack in the disputed Kashmir region that killed at least 40 Indian soldiers.Germany: A government manifesto effectively endorsed the merger of two troubled banks, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, aiming to create an institution able to stand up to global competitors. Neither the banks nor officials have commented.Belgium: An exaggerated story about “Nazi pensions” — paid by Germany to Belgians for Nazi collaboration — caused a stir, but many of its claims were false or misleading. The truth of the matter is complicated.Brazil: A young humpback whale washed ashore on a remote, forested island in the Amazon River, at a time of year when it should have already migrated thousands of miles to Antarctica. The border wall: The U.S. House of Representatives will vote today on a resolution against President Trump’s national emergency declaration, which allows him to divert funds to build the wall. Republican leaders are scrambling to keep lawmakers in their party from voting for it. Ireland: Ireland had a record-high number of new H.I.V. infections in 2018, a trend that some activists attribute to poor sex health education and insufficient access to preventive drugs. Mauritius: In a nonbinding judgment, the U.N.’s highest court said that Britain was wrong to detach a group of Indian Ocean islands from Mauritius, at the time a British colony, and evict their inhabitants to facilitate an American air base on the island of Diego Garcia. The court said Britain should end its control of the archipelago “as rapidly as possible.”Afghanistan: The U.S. and the Taliban have begun their highest-level negotiations yet on ending the war. The Oscars: Here’s a roundup of the best and worst moments from the ceremony. There’s some controversy over the award for best picture, which went to “Green Book,” a film about an interracial friendship that some critics find clichéd and retrograde. Chefs’ pick: When they’re in Hong Kong, culinary experts from all over like to eat at Yardbird, which mixes the polish of Tokyo’s favorite restaurants, the warmth of Sydney’s and the glamour of New York’s.

Susanne Fischer of New York suggested the Oxford comma, which was traditionally used at Oxford University Press.“I’m a big fan, use it often, and think it’s really important for clarification,” she wrote.The Times, like most other news organizations, does not usually use the comma, which is also known as the serial comma. “In general, do not use a comma before and or or in a series: The snow stalled cars, buses and trains,” our stylebook says.“A goal of punctuation is to make a sentence as clear as possible, and in most cases that final comma isn’t necessary for understanding the relationship of all the items in a series,” said Susan Wessling, The Times’s senior editor for editing standards.There are exceptions. Around this time last year, a Maine dairy company agreed to pay its drivers $5 million after a dispute that hinged entirely on the lack of an Oxford comma — in a list of activities that did not require overtime payments.Inyoung Kang, a home screen editor based in London, wrote today’s Back Story.Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.Check out this page to find a Morning Briefing for your region.

383,"President Trump has shut down the government to get money for a border wall that he says will stop illegal immigration. But the fact of the matter is that that’s not all he wants to stop. During the three-day shutdown last January, he demanded a 40 percent reduction in legal immigration, arguing that America has been swamped by immigrants. “There’s a limit to how many people a nation can responsibly absorb into their societies, ” he has declared.He is not alone in invoking this boogeyman. That America is being overwhelmed by a flood of immigrants has become conventional wisdom across the political spectrum, presented in books from, on the right, Reihan Salam of National Review, the son of Bangladeshi immigrants; in the center, Francis Fukuyama of Stanford, whose mother immigrated from Japan; and on the left, Jefferson Cowie of Vanderbilt University, who actually counsels his fellow progressives not to fear more immigration.But by any reasonable metric, the idea that America is experiencing mass immigration is a myth. The reality is that we desperately need to pick up the pace of immigration to maintain our work force and economic health.You could argue that mass immigration — a vague term with no set definition — is happening in Lebanon and Jordan, primary destinations for refugees escaping Syria’s civil war. Lebanon, which had about 4.4 million people in 2010, has admitted in just a few years around one million Syrian refugees, which works out to around 23 percent increase in its population.In America, by contrast, there are about 44 million foreign-born people who now constitute about 13.7 percent of the population, according to the Pew Research Foundation. This is close to the historic high of 15 percent at the turn of the 20th century. Why is that considered a meaningful benchmark? Because at that time the United States, responding to nativist and union pressure, embraced strict border controls, essentially ending what had until then been an open borders policy.Literacy tests were instituted in 1917, and the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act imposed national-origins quotas limiting visas to 2 percent of the total number of people of each nationality in the United States as of the 1890 census. The purpose of this legislation was to cut back immigration overall, especially from Eastern Europe and Asia — and it succeeded spectacularly.Congress finally eliminated these quotas, which had widely come to be regarded as racist, in 1965, and immigration subsequently picked up. But immigration opponents have made the 15 percent foreign-born figure a tipping point, as if it were based on science instead of being an arbitrary historical event. If it were indeed a tipping point, countries would regularly experience a backlash once the immigrant population approached that level. That is far from the case.America’s share of the foreign born ranks 34th among 50 wealthy countries with a per capita gross domestic product of over $20,000. The United States netted five new immigrants — authorized and unauthorized — per 1,000 people from 2015 to 2017, United Nations figures show. Compare that to the figures in two other English-speaking liberal democracies: Canada let in eight (and just announced that it’s going to admit over a million new immigrants over three years), and Australia 14. All in all, the foreign-born are now over 20 percent of Canada’s population and 28.2 percent of Australia’s (more than double America’s figure). And yet they haven’t inspired the sort of public condemnation of immigration that often occurs in the United States. America has also taken in a relatively modest numbers of immigrants over the last half-century. In 1965, when Congress got rid of national-origin quotas, America’s foreign-born made up around 5 percent of the population. Over two decades from 1980 to 2000, this proportion rose to 11.1 percent, from 6.2 percent, not insignificant but not particularly noteworthy.But then the rate of increase slowed to a crawl, rising from 11.1 percent in 2000 to 12.9 percent in 2010 and then barely inching to 13.5 percent in 2016. In other words, in six years, America’s foreign-born population inched up 0.6 percent. Yet the more America’s (modest) immigration decelerates, the more the mass immigration trope accelerates.A good yardstick for whether a country is admitting too many or too few immigrants — beyond the political mood of the moment — is its economic needs. If America were admitting too many immigrants, the economy would have trouble absorbing them. In fact, the unemployment rate among immigrants, including the 11 million undocumented, in 2016, when the economy was considered to be at full employment, was almost three-quarters of a point lower than that of natives. How can that be evidence of mass immigration?The truth is that America is a low-immigration nation. Demographic trends in America point to a severe labor crunch that’ll become a huge bottleneck for growth unless the country opens its doors wider.It has long been clear that the dropping fertility rates of native-born white Americans meant that the generations coming after the millennials were on track to be much smaller. From 2015 to 2035, the number of working-age Americans with domestic-born parents is expected to fall by eight million. Furthermore, the Census Bureau in 2017 quietly revised downward its population forecast for 2050 by a whopping 50 million people from its 2008 estimates, as Jack Goldstone, a political demographer at George Mason University, pointed out. Why? Because immigration from Mexico dwindled after the Great Recession at the same time that Hispanic fertility rates dropped by a quarter as well. At the current rate that America is admitting immigrants, this means that the total work force will grow only 0.3 percent per year. Unless American birthrates pick up suddenly and expand the work force — an unrealistic assumption given that the country just set a record for low fertility — or the productivity of its dwindling work force quickly doubled, only slightly less unrealistic, says Mr. Goldstone, the United States will be staring at real G.D.P. growth of less than 1.6 percent per year in less than a decade, all else remaining equal.America should be admitting a million more immigrants per year — more than double the current number from now until 2050. This still won’t add up to mass immigration because it would put America’s foreign-born population that year at around 26 percent, less than Australia’s is today.Fifteen years ago when I was writing about immigration for the conservative editorial page of The Detroit News, the myth that America was being overwhelmed by immigrants had retreated mostly to nativist activist circles. Just because it has spread now does not mean it’s true. It’s a myth that should be killed before it kills the American dream."
384,"President Trump will deliver his second State of the Union address at 9 p.m. Eastern Time Tuesday night. The speech was originally scheduled for last month, but was postponed because of the partial government shutdown, prompted by Mr. Trump’s demand that Congress pay for a wall along the southern border with Mexico.Presidents use the address, in a favorable setting and commanding national attention, to gain both political and policy advantage. This year, for example, Mr. Trump is expected to announce a plan to stop transmission of H.I.V. by 2030.White House officials said that the president will also make calls for unity in a polarized age. If that has a familiar ring, it is because he made similar exhortations last year.[Follow our Live Briefing for updates on the 2019 State of the Union.]But his audience in the House chamber will be markedly different, starting with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who will be sitting over his shoulder, and dozens of newly elected Democratic women, many of whom have been deeply critical of the president, who will be seated in front of him. The Democratic response will be delivered by Stacey Abrams, who ran unsuccessfully for governor in Georgia last year but emerged as one of the party’s rising stars.The chamber will also be flush with declared and potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, including Senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand. Whether or not Mr. Trump mentions the 2020 campaign, it will be an important backdrop for his address.It will be aired by all major broadcast and cable networks and streamed live at www.nytimes.com, where reporters will also be providing real-time fact-checking and analysis.On Tuesday morning, the president’s top surrogates received a memo from the White House with talking points to emphasize as they try to shape opinion even before the speech starts. The memo said a theme of the address will be “Choosing Greatness” and adds that the president will appeal to Americans’ aspirations. The memo also said Mr. Trump will try to offer a policy agenda that can appeal to both parties, an approach that so far has eluded him during his time in office. Immigration policy dominated the president’s agenda during his second year in office, and most likely will again during the third. Mr. Trump has consistently tried to make the case that there is a “crisis” — of crime, drugs and human trafficking — at the border with Mexico, an emergency that can be dealt with only by building a border wall.The president is also likely to call for a legislative solution to address the so-called Dreamers, younger immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children and have no criminal record. This is one area of possible cooperation with Democrats, but there are significant disagreements about details.Mr. Trump is not expected to veer from his demands for billions of dollars in funding for border security, including some kind of barrier. Congressional negotiators from both parties are trying to hammer out a deal on border security, but Democrats have been adamant that they will not agree to money for Mr. Trump’s wall, and the president has been pessimistic about the chances of Capitol Hill coming up with an agreement that meets his approval.Still, he is not expected to use the address on Tuesday to declare a national emergency, which potentially would enable him to construct additional barriers along the border using presidential authority.White House officials said the president is also likely to talk about abortion and the “fundamental importance and respect for human life.” Mr. Trump’s evangelical supporters, who fervently oppose abortion, have been the bulwark of his political base.He might also talk about China’s program of forced abortion and sterilization, and perhaps even efforts in the United States to ease some abortion restrictions, such as a contentious amendment regarding late-term abortions being considered by the legislature in Virginia.Mr. Trump has called for a substantial withdrawal of troops from the war in Afghanistan, where the United States military has been fighting for more than 17 years. But he has encountered uncharacteristic pushback from Republicans about taking troops out of Syria. In recent days, he has talked about keeping American troops in Iraq to maintain pressure on Iran, despite political opposition to the idea in Baghdad. He has also faced resistance from military leaders about drawing down troops too rapidly in Afghanistan, so the speech offers an opportunity to lay out his thinking to the American people.The president, as he did last year, will almost certainly make an appeal for an infrastructure program, and is likely to emphasize its effect in rural America, the home of his political base. Programs to repair roads and bridges have strong bipartisan appeal, but so far, Republicans and Democrats have not found a middle ground. Presidents typically use the State of the Union speech to take credit for successes in the previous year. Mr. Trump will most likely talk about a robust economy, a low rate of unemployment, a tax cut he credits with spurring growth and his push to roll back federal regulations on business. Many economists say that the tax cut provided only a temporary stimulus, but few can argue with the continued growth in jobs, now at 100 straight months, or the unemployment rate, which was 4 percent in January.Mr. Trump is also likely to say that the new trade agreements with Canada and Mexico, combined with his aggressive use of tariffs against China, have made the trade environment far more favorable to the United States. Congress has yet to ratify the trade pact with Canada and Mexico.Last year, Mr. Trump gave a speech in largely measured tones and sounded a call for common purpose. “Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek common ground and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people,” he said, adding, “So let us begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our union is strong because our people are strong. And together, we are building a safe, strong and proud America.”But his presidency became no less polarizing in the subsequent 12 months, and with the 2020 campaign getting underway and the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the last election still incomplete, the chances that partisanship will ebb in the next year do not seem especially promising.The Constitution says that the president “shall from time to time give Congress information on the State of the Union.” From the days of Thomas Jefferson until Woodrow Wilson, presidents gave the address in writing. Wilson changed that tradition by delivering it in person, and it has evolved into a largely political evening. Members of the president’s party cheer lustily, while members of the other party often sit stone-faced. This has led some — like Mitch Daniels, the president of Purdue University and a former two-term Republican governor of Indiana, and Steve Israel, a former Democratic congressman from New York — to say that the State of the Union speech has outlived its usefulness and should be discontinued.Last year’s speech clocked in at 80 minutes, the longest since President Bill Clinton’s in 2000."
385,"The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau chief. Sign up to get it by email.___Every year, The New York Times publishes a list of 52 Places to Go — a massive guide to great getaways all over the world.Last year’s edition included Tasmania, the area around Darwin, and Fiji.This year’s 52 also includes a few places in the region — Paparoa Track, New Zealand, and Tahiti — and two locations in Australia: The Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, and Perth.Many of you may be wondering how these places get chosen. Anyone who lives near Perth and the Northern Rivers (where officials were thrilled to have been picked) are no doubt curious as well.So here’s a bit of the back story.Every year, in September or October, editors for the Travel section email correspondents and trusted writers, asking for suggestions. Many of us send along more ideas than they’ll ever choose — a mix of places we’ve grown to love, and those that might have something new or interesting to offer.And sometimes, we also send the editors to people who might know more than we do.That’s what happened this year. Both Australian selections came to us through Besha Rodell, our Australian food columnist, who travels the country looking for great food and hidden gems.They are far from the only places worth recommending (I’m partial to South Australia’s remote coastline) but they were clearly places that piqued the interest of our Travel editors in New York.They had to beat out quite a few others.Our ideas joined dozens of others for a marathon set of meetings in which the winning locations were chosen by a team of editors led by Amy Virshup, who became the Travel editor in October.Along the way, there were arguments. There were changes. There are still some selections that just missed the cut and may never get another shot.What the editors looked for varies.As Amy explained in a recent Times Insider piece, there is always an effort to find places that have a reason to go NOW, in 2019.But there are other criteria, too. This year, for example, Amy said she prioritized places that were being threatened by climate change, to make a point that the world is changing and you better get going before some of these wonders disappear.Also, she added, “History matters, and there are places that earned spots on our list because they are marking major milestones in interesting ways.”Other key factors included what’s happening culturally or in nature that might make a destination particularly interesting this year, and the editors also looked for spots that might offer new alternatives to old favorites.Perth and the Northern Rivers match a few of these qualifications. Perth has new attractions; Northern Rivers has a new, boho food scene — and both are alternatives to Sydney and Melbourne.They are also simply beautiful and unique places that the rest of the world should know more about.This year’s 52 Places ought to help.And one more thing. In case you’re wondering, Perth is no less beloved because it shows up at 43 while Northern Rivers landed at 29. I sent Amy an email asking about that and she assured me that the order wasn’t a ranking of quality.“Other than #1, it is not meant to be in rank of favorite to least favorite,” she said. “It’s about getting a good mix of visuals, themes and geography. We like #5 and #50 equally!”Now for this week’s news and help-me-understand-the-world roundup.

386,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Britain asks Europe for more time, China’s slowing economy reaches new industries and Japan’s so-called snow monsters feel the effects of climate change. Here’s the latest: After two long years of negotiations, lawmakers voted to delay the country’s departure from the E.U. beyond the original March 29 deadline. In a flurry of votes on several amendments, Parliament also rejected holding a second referendum on Brexit, effectively bringing the country back to square one, and turned down an attempt to seize control of the process from Prime Minister Theresa May.What next? Mrs. May must get permission to postpone Brexit from European Union officials next week but that might only create new problems.Without an approved deal, it’s unclear how long the extension should be and what can be achieved in the extra time. Too short, and it’d be impractical. Too long, and Britain would have to take part in European Parliament elections in May, which neither of the main political parties want.Another angle: The slow-moving, painstaking Brexit process has diminished the executive authority that has historically been the linchpin of a streamlined, predictable “Westminster model,” writes our London-based correspondent Ellen Barry. Follow her on Twitter for all of Brexit’s twists and turns. With all of its 737 Max 8 planes now grounded around the world, the aircraft manufacturer has a difficult task ahead: navigating the unknown costs of damage to its reputation.The short-term costs of a software fix for the jet will probably be manageable. The bigger concern is whether Boeing can salvage confidence in the Max 8 model, the company’s best-selling jet that accounts for around $550 billion in future revenue.Details: Since the second crash of a Max 8 plane, in Ethiopia on Sunday, shares of Boeing have dropped nearly 11 percent.Airlines that were using the planes have started demanding compensation for losses while the jets are out of service. It costs an estimated $1 million to lease a replacement jet for three months.Passenger backlash might also force some airlines to turn to Boeing’s main rival, Airbus.The latest: The so-called black box from the flight that crashed was sent to France for analysis.Explainer: Here’s a visual guide to why regulators are concerned about the Max 8 plane. The country’s slowing economic growth, which has already rippled through factory floors and construction sites, is expanding into other once-thriving sectors, such as the tech industry.Educated, middle-class workers are now faced with job cuts and shrinking paychecks, indicating that the slump is broader than official numbers suggest and might be harder for the government to reverse.Impact: As white-collar workers start to feel the pinch, they’re tightening their belts and spending less money, which will have a trickle-down effect across other parts of the economy.The government’s usual tactics to resuscitate growth — unleashing a wave of loans or spending on infrastructure — won’t be much help for the service, financial and tech industries. Experts say the government will need to think of long-term policy reforms to get over this bump.Related: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, as one of the lead negotiators in U.S. trade talks with Beijing, has been pushing China to open up its film industry to give Hollywood greater access to the local market. But ethics officials are raising questions about conflicts of interest given Mr. Mnuchin’s stakes in a film-production company. Federal prosecutors are looking into the social media company’s data-sharing deals with some of the world’s largest technology companies, which gave them access to the personal information of hundreds of millions of its users, sometimes without their consent.According to two people familiar with the matter, a grand jury subpoenaed records from at least two of more than 150 companies, including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Sony, that had deals with Facebook.Reminder: Facebook has spent the last year under scrutiny, with investigations by the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the Justice Department, which is specifically looking into reports that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica used the platform to help President Trump’s election campaign.One sticking point: The data-sharing partnerships could be a violation of a 2011 consent agreement between Facebook and the F.T.C. to protect user privacy. The F.T.C. is currently weighing a possible multibillion-dollar fine against Facebook, which would be the largest such penalty by a trade regulator. Border Wall: The U.S. Senate, in a bipartisan rebuke, voted to overturn President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the border to fund his wall. The Senate vote was the first time Congress has blocked a presidential emergency declaration and almost certainly sets up Mr. Trump’s first veto.Malaysia: Prosecutors refused to dismiss the case of a Vietnamese woman accused of assassinating Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, in Kuala Lumpur in 2017 by smearing him with a nerve agent. Her co-defendant was released days ago without any charges or any explanation.Pakistan: China, which has close military and economic ties with Pakistan, blocked a U.N. Security Council vote that would have blacklisted the founder of Jaish-e-Mohammed, Masood Azhar, derailing a yearslong effort by India to designate the group as a terrorist organization. The group recently claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on Indian soldiers in Kashmir that dragged India and Pakistan to the brink of war.New Zealand: An attack on a government minister on Thursday rattled the country, where politicians are often seen in public unencumbered by security guards, leading Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to warn people not to take a high level of access to lawmakers for granted.Snow monsters: Every year, in a village in the Yamagata Prefecture, snow and ice draped over conifer trees create sculptural Godzilla-like figures, known as “juhyo,” that draw tourists from across the world. But climate change is beginning to diminish the phenomenon.Climate change: Students in more than 100 countries will be protesting climate change today in what could be one of the largest challenges yet against global environmental policies. And it all started with a shy 16-year-old in Sweden.U.S.: Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman and Democrat who came close to unseating Senator Ted Cruz in the midterm elections last year, announced he was jumping into the 2020 presidential race, entering an already-crowded field of diverse candidates and big-ticket proposals.Tips for a more fulfilling life.Recipe of the day: This Guinness pie recipe is worthy of a celebration.

Barrett Prettyman, whose name is on the courthouse described in Wednesday’s Back Story, where Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, was sentenced.The Virginia-born Elijah Barrett Prettyman was a lawyer, professor and journalist before President Harry Truman nominated him to the prestigious U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He served from 1945 to 1962. From 1958 to 1960, he was chief judge.He was admired in judicial and governmental circles. Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy turned to him to resolve difficult legal issues. He overcame years of congressional resistance to effect changes in the D.C. court system.The U.S. Courthouse, home to the court he served on, was named for him in 1997, 16 years after his death.P.S. His son, E. Barrett Prettyman Jr., also had an illustrious legal career, including playing a crucial backstage role in the Supreme Court’s unanimous school-desegregation decision.Andrea Kannapell, Briefings editor, wrote today’s Back Story.

387,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. President Trump abruptly walked out of a meeting on the government shutdown with Democratic leaders at the White House.“Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time,” the president tweeted. “I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!”Democrats said that the president had thrown a “temper tantrum.” Above, Senator Chuck Schumer after the meeting.For now, at least, the president’s forceful response has papered over cracks in Republican support that threatened to upend his negotiating position. And as a last resort, Mr. Trump has said he could declare a national emergency to build a border wall._____2. Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general overseeing the special counsel’s Russia investigation, is expected to leave his post after President Trump’s pick to lead the Justice Department is confirmed.Mr. Rosenstein has been a central figure in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and any ties to the Trump campaign — both for appointing Robert Mueller to lead it and for becoming a target of the president’s rage.Mr. Trump nominated William Barr to be attorney general after he fired Jeff Sessions. Confirmation hearings are scheduled to begin on Jan. 15.Separately, House Democrats now have the power to investigate Mr. Trump and his administration, but they’re moving in a slow, orderly manner. So don’t expect blockbuster findings anytime soon._____3. The British Parliament resumed debate on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan. It’s virtually certain to be rejected in a crucial vote next week — and that could mean weeks of perilous political brinkmanship.In the past two days, Parliament has already delivered Mrs. May two setbacks. First, lawmakers passed an amendment requiring the prime minister to return within days of a losing vote with plans for proceeding. What kind of plan is unclear.Parliament also passed a measure making it difficult for Britain to leave the European Union without a deal. The prospects of a second public referendum on Brexit are rising, and there is even talk of delaying the March 29 departure date._____4. A group of 49 migrants who had been stranded at sea after being refused entry to European ports was finally allowed to dock in Malta.The asylum seekers, who had been living on a pair of rescue boats, will be settled among nine member states of the E.U. The migrants had previously been denied safe harbor by every national government bordering the Mediterranean Sea since their rescue in December.Our reporter went aboard the rescue ships, where he discovered the human impact of Europe’s hard-line migration policy shift._____5. For decades, a Chinese government campaign has promoted exercise to combat alarming rates of childhood obesity.But the initiative was notable for what it didn’t mention: the importance of cutting back on junk food and sugary beverages.It turns out that China’s fitness-first message has largely been the handiwork of Coca-Cola and other Western food and beverage giants, according to two new studies.The findings show how the food and beverage giants worked with key Chinese officials, through a nonprofit they financed, to stave off the growing movement for food regulation and soda taxes._____6. Larry Antonsen, above, decided to report a priest who sexually abused him during high school, and he ended up in a maze of church bureaucracy.The priest he was accusing happened to be an Augustinian, one of dozens of religious orders in the Catholic clergy. And the Chicago archdiocese told him to take his complaint to the Augustinians.Victims and advocacy groups say their accusations are often mishandled because they are caught between separate institutions within the church: The dioceses say it is not their responsibility to investigate, and religious orders fail to handle the claims._____7. When the Knicks arrive in London for a much anticipated exhibition game against the Washington Wizards next week, their center will be watching from his couch in New York.That’s because Enes Kanter, who is from Turkey, fears Turkish spies might kill him if he goes.Mr. Kanter is an outspoken critic of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and has a close relationship with a cleric the Turkish government has accused of masterminding a bloody coup in 2016. Still, his latest statements are an escalation.Turkish officials have dismissed his comments as baseless. But Mr. Kanter said the fear was real — and personal: “I was scared. I’m not going to lie.”_____8. Televisions that roll up like yoga mats. 5G chips that can download an entire movie in seconds. Autonomous vehicles powered by artificial intelligence.Here’s a visual tour of CES, the world’s most important tech conference, with the hottest tech trends on display — and the abysmal stock market pushed firmly out of mind.Indeed, the Las Vegas consumer electronics conference underscored what the tech industry is best at, our columnist writes: being optimistic about itself._____9. A demographic revolution is quietly rippling across America: More older women are working, and loving it.Last week, Nancy Pelosi, 78, above, became the most powerful elected woman in U.S. history. Glenn Close, 71, won a best actress award at the Golden Globes. And when Susan Zirinsky, 66, takes over CBS News in March, she’ll be the first woman to hold the job (and the oldest person).In fact, nearly 30 percent of women 65 to 69 are working, up from 15 percent in the late 1980s, according to a recent Harvard study. And 18 percent of women 70 to 74 work, up from 8 percent. And it’s not that they have to work — they want to._____10. Finally, we end today daydreaming about where to travel next.The Times’s annual 52 Places to Go in 2019 includes Hampi in India, Eilat in Israel, above, and Japan’s Setouchi Islands. We also announced the lucky traveler who gets to see them all: Sebastian Modak, a veteran travel journalist who has lived all around the world.Our No. 1 place to visit this year is Puerto Rico.

388,"Tom Steyer, the California billionaire who has crusaded for President Trump’s impeachment, said on Wednesday that he would not join the pack of Democrats running for president in 2020 and would instead redouble his efforts to topple Mr. Trump before the election.Mr. Steyer’s decision came as a surprise even to some of his political confidants. He had made deliberate preparations in recent months to seek the White House, running television ads in the early primary states, recruiting potential staff members and even designating a campaign manager for a possible run.But Mr. Steyer began informing aides early this week that he would not be a candidate after all, after concluding that he could have a greater political impact through his impeachment activism, several advisers to Mr. Steyer said. Mr. Steyer intends to spend at least $40 million on impeachment efforts in the coming year — money that might otherwise have been directed toward a campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.“Most people come to Iowa around this time to announce a campaign for president,” Mr. Steyer said in prepared remarks, which were obtained by The New York Times. “But I am proud to be here to announce that I will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to remove a president.”Alluding to Mr. Trump’s Oval Office address on Tuesday night, in which he demanded the construction of a border wall, Mr. Steyer said the president had “once again lied to the American people, repeatedly, for his own political skin.” He described Mr. Trump as having already committed numerous offenses warranting his removal from office, and warned Democrats that shying away from an impeachment battle would serve to “enable” the president.Mr. Steyer, 61, left himself some wiggle room to change his mind on 2020, saying in prepared remarks that he had decided against running “at this time.” But his announcement ended — at least for now — the latest of several flirtations with seeking high office, which have also included abortive candidacies for the United States Senate and for governor of California. He considered running for president in 2016 before ultimately endorsing Hillary Clinton.In some respects, the Democratic primary landscape appeared inviting for a candidate like Mr. Steyer, with his sterling credentials as a Trump antagonist and a virtually bottomless well of money to spend on advertising. He has been one of the Democratic Party’s most prolific donors over the last few elections, eclipsed in 2018 only by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who is considering a presidential campaign of his own.Anticipating a likely race, Mr. Steyer had settled on a close adviser, Heather Hargreaves, to serve as his eventual campaign manager. He had conducted research into his own political vulnerabilities, in anticipation of attacks from other Democrats in a rowdy primary, and had mapped out how to reorganize his advocacy groups to comply with the fund-raising regulations that apply to presidential candidates.Mr. Steyer also recently retained a new senior adviser, Doug Rubin, who previously advised former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts on a possible 2020 run. Mr. Patrick announced last month that he had closed the door on a presidential candidacy.Mr. Steyer and his advisers had conducted polling to test a campaign message focused on attacking corporate greed, confronting climate change — and, of course, denouncing Mr. Trump.Yet amid his preparations, there were warning signs for Mr. Steyer, too. As a candidate, he would have faced new levels of scrutiny of his business record: Mr. Steyer made his vast fortune as the founder of a hedge fund, and his portfolio of investments included considerable stakes in fossil fuel companies. As a wealthy white man, he could have been an awkward cultural match for a party increasingly defined by demands for racial and gender equality, and economic populism.And Mr. Steyer’s intention to use his personal fortune in fueling a presidential campaign would most likely have been divisive in a Democratic primary. His announcement in Iowa that he would not run comes days after the first major Democratic candidate to join the race, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, denounced self-funding candidates on a swing through the leadoff caucus state.An adviser to Mr. Steyer, who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations with him, said that he had been unruffled by Ms. Warren’s attacks on billionaire candidates. But, the adviser said, Mr. Steyer was impressed by Ms. Warren’s rollout as a candidate and suggested that her announcement video channeled the very themes he had been planning to campaign on.Mr. Steyer also disclosed to Vogue magazine in November that he and his wife of 32 years, Kat Taylor, were living separately.He is the second prominent Democrat to make preparations for a 2020 campaign before abandoning them, after Mr. Patrick.In stepping back from the presidential race, Mr. Steyer signaled he would further ramp up his impeachment drive, which has roiled Democratic politics over the last year, bringing him into direct conflict with elected party leaders and helping shove the idea of Mr. Trump’s early removal into the mainstream of debate on the left.Underwritten by Mr. Steyer’s personal wealth, the impeachment campaign has bombarded television and computer screens around the country with ads demanding Mr. Trump’s ouster, and staged pro-impeachment events around the country.Mr. Steyer indicated on Wednesday that his pressure campaign would continue. One of his political committees, Need to Impeach, said it would aim a pressure campaign at House Democrats who lead committees relevant to impeachment, including Representatives Adam Schiff of California, who heads the House Intelligence Committee, and Jerrold Nadler of New York, who leads the House Judiciary Committee.And Mr. Steyer, a longtime donor to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, called on her by name to “select a bipartisan group of lawmakers to start immediately” with a process to remove Mr. Trump from office.“The longer they wait, the more they normalize Mr. Trump’s unacceptable acts,” Mr. Steyer said in his prepared speech. “And the more they enable him.”Democratic leaders remain wary of Mr. Steyer’s impeachment message, and the institutional obstacles to removing Mr. Trump from office still appear insurmountable. Ejecting a president requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate, and Republicans hold 53 seats in the chamber.Yet the idea of impeachment has moved steadily into the foreground of the Democratic imagination, despite the obvious practical impediments. When a high-profile freshman lawmaker, Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, vowed last week in coarse language to impeach Mr. Trump, she drew little censure from party leaders and numerous influential voices on the left leapt to her defense."
389,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)At least 49 people were dead and dozens more injured today after shootings at two mosques in Christchurch in a terrorist attack that Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called “an extraordinary and unprecedented act.” One man in his 20s was charged with murder. Here are the latest updates.The attacks occurred during Friday Prayer, and the authorities asked mosques across New Zealand to close. Two explosive devices were found attached to a vehicle that the police had stopped.The suspect: Shortly before the shooting, someone appearing to be the gunman posted links to a white nationalist manifesto online, including a link to a Facebook page where a live, 17-minute video of the assault was later broadcast. Here’s what we know so far about the suspect. President Trump promised a veto after senators voted 59-to-41 on Thursday to overturn his declaration of a national emergency, arguing that he had exceeded his powers in trying to build a border wall despite Congress’s objections.The details: Twelve Republicans joined the Democrats to overturn the emergency declaration. Here’s how every senator voted.What’s next: It’s unlikely that either the House or the Senate has enough votes to override a veto. But the actions in both chambers could bolster lawsuits contesting the emergency declaration.Yesterday: In a nonbinding resolution, the House voted 420-0 to demand that the Justice Department publicly release the full findings of the special counsel’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election.The captain of the Boeing 737 Max 8 that crashed on Sunday faced an emergency almost immediately after takeoff, requesting in a panicky voice to return after three minutes as the aircraft accelerated to abnormal speed.The account of air traffic communications involving the pilot, Yared Getachew, who had 8,000 hours of flying experience, provides far more detail about what was happening in the cockpit.How we know: A person who reviewed the communications shared the information with The Times, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the messages have not been publicly released.Related: After a similar crash in October, Boeing officials told American pilots’ unions that they planned to update the software for 737 Max jets by the end of the year. The carriers are still waiting for a fix.The University of Southern California was once snidely referred to as the “University of Spoiled Children,” but it began an extensive overhaul in the 1990s to become a top-tier school.That effort has been threatened by a series of corruption investigations, including this week’s revelation that the university is at the center of an admissions scandal involving federal charges of bribery and cheating.Closer look: The coaches charged, including some at U.S.C., are some of the most prominent in their fields.Column: The affluent have another advantage in gaining admission to many private colleges and universities: the capacity to pay four years of tuition, room and board — perhaps $300,000 — without financial aid. Our columnist explains. Frank Cali led the remnants of one of New York’s five Mafia families, the Gambinos, but he was, according to one law enforcement official, “the polar opposite of John Gotti,” one of his flashy predecessors. Despite his low profile, Mr. Cali met with a classic mob execution on Wednesday, shot outside his home on Staten Island. Two reporters  tell the tale. North Korean threat: The country is considering suspending negotiations over its nuclear arms program with the U.S., one of its senior diplomats said today. Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui also said the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, would soon decide whether to resume nuclear and missile tests.Facebook departures: Two top executives, including the head of the WhatsApp messaging service, are leaving after disagreements with Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive.Volkswagen accusations: The Securities and Exchange Commission accused the automaker on Thursday of “massive fraud” and lying to investors as part of a diesel emissions scandal.Brexit vote: Parliament has voted to postpone Britain’s departure from the European Union but, in a rare victory for Prime Minister Theresa May, narrowly failed to wrest control of the process from her. It remains unclear how long the delay will be.Rebuff to gun industry: The Connecticut Supreme Court has cleared the way for a lawsuit against the companies that manufactured and sold the semiautomatic rifle used  in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. Climate protest: Students in more than 100 countries are planning to skip school today to push for action against climate change. We looked at the roots of the demonstrations, which started with one teenager in Sweden.Snapshot: Above, snow-covered trees in the mountains of northern Japan.

390,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. The oceans are warming up faster than thought, the U.S. shutdown remained a logjam, and Norway disclosed the kidnapping of a tycoon’s wife. Here’s the latest: A new analysis reports that ocean temperatures are rising 40 percent faster on average than previously thought. The finding has dire implications.The oceans have been absorbing most of the heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions, offering a buffer against climate change. Their escalating temperatures are already killing off marine ecosystems, raising sea levels and making hurricanes more destructive.Continued heating will only make those effects more catastrophic, scientists say. “2018 is going to be the warmest year on record for the Earth’s oceans,” said Zeke Hausfather, an author of the study. “As 2017 was the warmest year, and 2016 was the warmest year.”The partial government shutdown entered its 21st day, tying it for the longest such one in American history. Developments: Senate Republicans tried to broker a compromise on Thursday, and their efforts swiftly disintegrated. Vice President Mike Pence insisted that the White House would settle for nothing less than a border wall, and Democrats, as ever, rejected one. The White House was considering diverting relief money from storm- and fire-ravaged Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California to pay for a wall.Impact: Many farmers are near or at a financial breaking point. “I may lose the farm, but I strongly feel we need some border security,” one farmer in Mississippi said.More: President Trump canceled a trip to the Davos economic conference in Switzerland later this month and visited the U.S. southern border near McAllen, Tex., where crime is near a 30-year low despite his portrayal of a border “crisis.” Two of our reporters are traveling the border’s length.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a speech in Cairo, declared that the U.S. would take a more activist role in the region. He also rejected much of President Barack Obama’s human-rights-based approach there, outlining an approach that is based on a close alliance with authoritarian rulers.Mr. Pompeo — whose remarks came almost exactly a decade after Mr. Obama delivered a landmark speech in the same city — denounced the former president for, he said, underestimating “the tenacity and viciousness of radical Islam” and for his policies on Iran. Here are the many ways Mr. Pompeo departed from Mr. Obama. We also fact-checked the speech. Confusion: Mr. Pompeo apparently sought to reassure jittery nations with his declaration that “when America retreats, chaos follows” and that the U.S. would “expel every last Iranian boot from Syria,” but the effect was confounding to many, coming weeks after President Trump’s impulsive announcement that U.S. forces would leave Syria.Go deeper: The U.S. has spent $8 billion to build a strong Afghan air force but it is still struggling, which could complicate Mr. Trump’s efforts to pull out of the country.The wife of a wealthy Norwegian businessman has been kidnapped, and demands have been made for a large ransom paid in cryptocurrency, the police revealed this week. Details: Anne-Elisabeth Falkevik Hagen went missing from the couple’s home on Oct. 31, but the drama had played out in secret until the police made it public. They said that they have a line of communication with people claiming to be her captors who are demanding a ransom — said to be as high as 9 million euros — in a cryptocurrency called Monero. Whether she is still alive is unclear, and three men are being sought for questioning.Effects: The case is dominating headlines in Norway. It has highlighted worries that the egalitarian-minded country’s practice of publishing people’s tax returns could be handy to kidnappers. And it has led to calls for cryptocurrencies, which are favored in criminal activities, to be banned or regulated. Michael Cohen: President Trump’s former personal lawyer, who implicated the president in a scheme to pay hush money to two women who say they had affairs with Mr. Trump, has agreed to testify publicly before Congress on Feb. 7, setting up a blockbuster airing of scandal.Russia investigation: The presence of a dozen Ukrainian political and business figures in Washington for the celebrations surrounding President Trump’s inauguration has been under investigation by federal prosecutors interested in potential influence-peddling. Snow: Once-in-a-generation heavy snowfall has left at least six people dead and brought travel and tourism to a halt in parts of the Alps. Cristiano Ronaldo: Law enforcement officials in Nevada investigating a sexual-assault accusation against the soccer star have obtained a warrant for a sample of his DNA. Brexit: Prime Minister Theresa May does not appear to have a Plan B if lawmakers in Parliament vote against her unloved plan for withdrawal, as seems likely. Underlining the country’s tensions, a TV movie about the Brexit campaign starring Benedict Cumberbatch has set off anger and angst. Democratic Republic of Congo: The U.N. Security Council is set to meet to discuss the disputed outcome of the country’s presidential election. The victory of the president-elect, Felix Tshisekedi, been called into question by, among others, Belgium and France. Ford: The automaker said it would lay off “thousands” of the 68,000 workers it employs in Europe and close a factory in France. Tougher emissions rules and declining demand have been hurting profits.Forced marriages: After public outrage, the British government announced that it will no longer require British women forced into marriages abroad to pay the government for the cost of helping them escape, acknowledging that they “may have endured particular suffering.”Venezuela: President Nicolás Maduro was inaugurated for a second term after an election last year that was widely considered illegitimate — and despite a plummeting economy and skyrocketing violence, hunger and migration. Our team explains how he has clung to power.Vintage tanks: As President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia promotes the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany as a cornerstone of nationalist fervor, he has a pressing need for T-34 tanks for military parades, museum shows and film shoots. So it was with great fanfare that Russia took in a consignment of old tanks from the Lao People’s Army.

391,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s repeated threat to declare a national emergency so he can build his border wall without congressional approval has been denounced by Democrats as extreme and an overreach. But it could be the only politically realistic way out of the shutdown crisis in the nation’s capital.“I think we might work a deal, and if we don’t, I may go that route. I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Wednesday. “My threshold will be if I can’t make a deal with people that are unreasonable.”If the president does invoke emergency powers to circumvent Congress, it would be an extraordinary violation of constitutional norms — and establish a precedent for presidents who fail to win approval for funding a policy goal.But Mr. Trump’s threatened move offers both sides a face-saving solution in the budget standoff between the president and congressional Democrats that has prompted a partial government shutdown, which, if it lasts to Saturday, will be at 22 days the longest in American history.Both sides have taken absolutist positions that leave no room for the kind of split-the-difference compromise that usually ends budget impasses. Mr. Trump refuses to accept anything less than his demand for about $5 billion in wall spending, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said his wall along the southern border would be immoral.But Mr. Trump’s claim that he can and may attempt to build his wall another way opens the door for him to sign a spending bill with no wall funding, reopening the government without capitulation by either side.While any such move by Mr. Trump is certain to prompt outrage from his critics and wild approval from his supporters, there is good reason to believe that it is unlikely to result in much immediate change. His push for a wall would be channeled into a lengthy court fight, keeping lawyers far busier than construction workers, at least initially, as his term ticks away.“We’re going to be in 2020 before this gets resolved,” said Walter E. Dellinger III, a former solicitor general in the Clinton administration, adding: “If they are just planning where to build slats, judges are unlikely to decide that requires expedition in the Supreme Court. I think they would recognize the wisdom of going slow.”If, in the end, the Supreme Court were to rule that emergency-power laws give Mr. Trump authority to proceed, he would probably face still more litigation with property owners over whether the government may use eminent domain to force them to sell their border lands. There may be little time left in his term after all that to add more than a few miles, if any, of barriers to the 1,954-mile border, which already has 654 miles of fencing.And if the court instead eventually ruled against him, Mr. Trump could honestly tell his supporters that he tried, and then vow to renew the push if he is re-elected. Indeed, he has suggested that he would relish still having the issue of wall to once again rev up supporters in the campaign. He wrote on Twitter late last month that Democrats may have enough votes to stop his wall, “but we have the issue, Border Security. 2020!”In the meantime, the shutdown that is threatening to last for months could end. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors could once again receive their wages and pay household bills. National parks could reopen and be cleaned. Needy families could keep receiving food assistance. Across the economy, farmers and businesses that depend on government actions could proceed with work they need to be handled.“It’s a way to get past an ugly fight in a way that allows the dust to settle and passions to cool while moving on,” said Bruce Buchanan, an emeritus professor of political science at the University of Texas at Austin.If Mr. Trump does invoke emergency powers, fierce criticism would follow. Of the 58 times presidents have declared emergencies since Congress reformed emergency-powers laws in 1976, none involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval. Chris Edelson, an American University government professor and author of a 2013 book, “Emergency Presidential Power: From the Drafting of the Constitution to the War on Terror,” said he could recall no such instance in the first two centuries of American history, either.The precedent Mr. Trump would establish raises the risk of longer-term damage to the American constitutional system, undermining people’s confidence in the country’s democracy, said Elizabeth Goitein, who oversaw a recent study of presidential emergency powers for the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.“It is a crisis when the president of the United States flouts the role of Congress and abuses his powers in order to get around the will of Congress and to undermine the democratic process for lawmaking set forth in the Constitution,” she said.Ms. Goitein and other experts who have studied emergency-powers laws have said there are serious — if not dispositive — arguments that Mr. Trump’s legal team can make that at least two such statutes could be used to erect border barriers by redirecting military construction funds that can be freed up, in a presidentially declared emergency, to build something Congress has not approved.But she and others maintain that it would be an abuse of power for Mr. Trump to proclaim that there is a national emergency along the southern border that justifies a wall. The number of people illegally crossing the border is far lower than it was a generation ago. The recent phenomenon of caravans of Central American migrants largely consists of people who present themselves to border officials and request asylum.And despite repeated false claims by Trump officials that terrorists are infiltrating the country across the border, including by the thousands, no one in the modern era who committed a terrorist attack on domestic soil has turned out to have sneaked in via Mexico.Many legal experts nevertheless expect that in the inevitable litigation, the Justice Department would pressure judges not to even consider the facts, arguing that courts must defer to the president’s judgment about whether an emergency exists rather than substituting their own thinking.But even though courts have traditionally given substantial deference to the president’s determinations in security matters, Mr. Dellinger said that should not be true within the executive branch. He said it was the obligation of senior Justice Department officials who review the legality of proposed government actions — the head of the Office of Legal Counsel, Steven A. Engel, and the acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker — to independently assess whether there really is a justifiable basis to declare an emergency, and if there is not, to tell Mr. Trump no, or resign.“If there is not, in fact, a persuasive basis for this being the kind of national emergency that was contemplated by Congress, and it is nevertheless approved by the Department of Justice, what is the rule-of-law cost? What kind of slope does that start us down?” Mr. Dellinger said. “One question is whether there is some other way out of this current mess that doesn’t involve such a cost to the rule of law.”"
392,"“Alternative facts”: The term manages to be tedious, ridiculous and perilous at once — a real sign of the times. For anyone who doesn’t remember, Kellyanne Conway introduced it in early 2017 to defend the White House’s falsehoods about attendance numbers at Donald Trump’s inauguration the week before. There she was on “Meet the Press,” serenely chiding an exasperated Chuck Todd for being “overly dramatic” as he repeatedly tried to get her to concede that lying to the American public was bad.Her phrasing may have been new, but Conway was taking part in what has apparently become a conservative tradition — performing a skepticism so extreme that it makes the ancient Greek skeptics look like babes in the woods. Recall a high-ranking aide in the Bush administration needling a journalist for belonging to “the reality-based community.” A respect for facts, the aide suggested, was ultimately for suckers: “We’re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality.”You might think this kind of postmodernism would appeal to the French anthropologist and philosopher Bruno Latour, who has spent a career studying how knowledge is socially constructed. You would be wrong. Such pretensions to reality-creating grandeur, Latour suggests, amount to little more than a vulgar, self-defeating cynicism.In “Down to Earth: Politics in the New Climatic Regime,” Latour argues that climate change is forcing all of us to confront truths that seem hard to reconcile but turn out to be two sides of the same thing: 1) reality exists, whether we like it or not; and 2) our attempts to apprehend it are contingent on our social context. Along with Cailin O’Connor and James Owen Weatherall’s “The Misinformation Age: How False Beliefs Spread,” Latour’s new book offers a way to think through the seemingly insurmountable impasse carved out by political polarization and fake news.Of the two volumes, “The Misinformation Age” takes the more methodical and earnest approach. O’Connor and Weatherall are professors of logic, and they break down the mechanics of misinformation accordingly. They introduce their subject with the Vegetable Lamb of Tartary — a tree that reportedly grew gourd-like fruit filled with tiny lambs. The claim was propagated during medieval times by so many respected naturalists and scholars that it took nearly four centuries before it was satisfactorily debunked.Those medieval scholars kept citing one another rather than verifying (or disproving) the Vegetable Lamb for themselves. “Social factors are essential to understanding the spread of beliefs,” O’Connor and Weatherall write, “including — especially — false beliefs.” Similar to the network of right-wing sites that nurtured elaborate conspiracy theories about a Hillary Clinton-sponsored pedophilia ring in a Washington pizzeria (a notion only slightly less outlandish than lambs growing on trees), the medieval scholars had created their own ecosystem for fake news.O’Connor and Weatherall include contemporary examples of misinformation like Pizzagate, but they focus mainly on ideas held by scientists, highlighting how even the most well-intentioned beliefs can get deployed and distorted. After all, they say, “most scientists, most of the time, are doing their best to learn about the world, using the best methods available and paying careful attention to the available evidence.” Scientists are “the closest we have to ideal inquirers,” even if, as the authors make clear, there’s an unavoidable element of uncertainty in the scientific enterprise.This uncertainty, it turns out, is central to how so much contemporary misinformation works. O’Connor and Weatherall make a distinction between absolute certainty and the confidence necessary to make informed decisions. “The worry that we can never gain complete certainty about matters of fact is irrelevant,” they write — though it comes up again and again in “The Misinformation Age,” as they show how industrial interests have repeatedly exploited any whiff of uncertainty to argue against government regulation.The book contains useful summaries of the debates in the 1980s around the ozone layer and acid rain. Drawing from the research of Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway in “Merchants of Doubt” (2010), O’Connor and Weatherall compare industry-sponsored campaigns questioning environmental damage to the strategic skepticism of tobacco companies, which disputed the link between smoking and lung cancer by insisting that the link wasn’t utterly definitive. As one tobacco executive put it, “Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the ‘body of fact’ that exists in the mind of the public.”The debate — or as the authors might put it, “debate” — around climate change has followed a similar narrative. O’Connor and Weatherall point out that the scientific consensus has long coalesced around human-caused climate change, even if denialists insist that the science is still unsettled.The one thing you begin to notice in this book is that propagating a reflexive skepticism and sowing discord aren’t terribly difficult, especially when there’s a vested interest willing to pay for it; “merely creating the appearance of controversy” is often all that needs to be done.Latour’s “Down to Earth” is a wilder, more playful book — even if, like “The Misinformation Age,” it covers big subjects like truth and the fate of the species. The election of Donald Trump, Latour says, was a clarifying event, not only for Americans but for the world. Here, finally, was a political figure whose brazen repudiations of reality laid bare what Latour has been saying all along — that a complacent faith in the ability of facts to speak for themselves was what rendered them vulnerable to Trumpian renunciation in the first place.Latour’s talk about how facts derive their authority from trust might sound squishy and abstract, but he considers himself a realist. He says that climate change renders the old dichotomy of the global versus the local completely futile. Trump and the “obscurantist elites” who enable him are nurturing an “Out-of-This-World” fantasy by unleashing an aggressive despoliation of the earth that ultimately rejects the world they claim to inhabit. At the same time, Trump pacifies his base with panicky nationalism and border walls, delineating a “rump territory” that is “no more plausible, no more livable” than the globalized world they rail against.“It is quite useless to become outraged on the pretext that Trump voters ‘don’t believe in facts,’” Latour writes. Rather than get tangled in shouting matches over fake news, Latour calls for an entirely new way of understanding the world. He says he wrote “Down to Earth” with a “deliberate bluntness.” He vests a surprising hope in Europe, whose colonial past — or “crimes,” as he puts it — he depicts as inextricable from the migrations it tries to keep out. “Europe has invaded all peoples; all peoples are coming to Europe in their turn,” he writes. “Give and take. There is no way out of this.”Latour also describes migration as the human embodiment of our “new climatic regime.” Under the old way of thinking, exploited peoples and places were ignored, silenced and stripped of agency; now migrants and the earth itself are both setting out “to recover what belongs to them.”No doubt some readers will find this to be too much, too philosophical and too French. But maybe it takes a brilliantly mind-bending book like Latour’s to show that so much reality can’t be denied."
393,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. Boeing on the defensive, hours until a crucial Brexit vote and Venezuela’s blackout threatens social implosion. Here’s the latest: What exactly brought down an Ethiopian Airlines jetliner just minutes after takeoff on Sunday has not been determined, but both the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder have been recovered. Here’s what we know, and our live coverage. The crash of Flight 302 killed 157 people from around the world, including professors from Kenya, aid workers from Ethiopia, a career ambassador from Nigeria and a fisheries consultant from Britain. One scheduled passenger from Greece missed the flight by minutes.The plane: Boeing is faced with crisis. At least 23 airlines, largely in China, removed from service the Boeing model, the 737 Max 8, involved in this crash and a similar one five months ago, of a Lion Air flight in Indonesia that killed 189 people. In the U.S., the Association of Flight Attendants urged the Federal Aviation Administration to review the model, 350 of which have been delivered around the world.Max 8 jets typically make more than 8,500 flights per week. These are the airlines that fly them.Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain flew to Strasbourg, France, to try to rescue her unpopular withdrawal plan from the E.U. She secured new legal pledges, but it was unclear whether the concessions from the E.U. would be enough to prevent another defeat of her deal in Parliament today. What next? If her plan is again defeated, Mrs. May has promised to offer a vote on whether Britain should leave the E.U. without a deal — a situation that could brutally upend Britain’s economy and one that a majority of lawmakers oppose. If they decide against that, they would then be allowed a vote on whether Britain should request an extension of its negotiations with Brussels.If Mrs. May can limit the size of any defeat today, she might even be able to hold a third, final vote on her plan just before the scheduled departure from the E.U. on March 29. Related: A protest by customs officers in France has delayed Eurostar trains and backed up trucks for miles, providing Britain with a taste of a post-Brexit world.  Labour Party: The British opposition party, which is losing both Remain and Leave voters while facing serious accusations of institutional anti-Semitism, is in crisis.The country’s electric system has been down for five days, plunging most of Venezuela into sporadic darkness and threatening social collapse.Food is spoiling in a country with not enough of it. Looting and protests have broken out, and desperate patients have been begging doctors to be kept alive. Since Venezuela’s largest power producer went down on Thursday, no date has been set to restart the plant — the source of 80 percent of the country’s electricity. Finger-pointing: President Nicolás Maduro blames U.S. sabotage and cyberattacks for the blackout, without providing evidence. Energy experts and Venezuelan power sector contractors dismissed that explanation, instead citing mismanagement and corruption.Other developments: The Treasury Department penalized a Moscow-based bank that it accused of helping Mr. Maduro’s government evade American sanctions. A few hours later, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a sarcasm-laced speech accusing Cuba and Russia of propping up Mr. Maduro. On Tuesday, he announced the removal of all American diplomatic personnel from the U.S. Embassy in Caracas because of worsening conditions in the country. Raheem Sterling, one of the finest English players of his generation, has become part of the global conversation about racial equality led by athletes like Colin Kaepernick and LeBron James. After a fan screamed a racial obscenity at him at a Premier League match in December, Sterling responded with a pointed Instagram post. In an interview with our reporter, he expanded on themes of racial abuse and racist tropes the British news media uses to describe him.“It is a stereotype of black people: chains and jewelry, bling and money,” he said. “I just wanted people to pause and think.”Afghanistan: As the Taliban’s peace talks with the U.S. in Doha, Qatar, entered an extraordinary third week, the group pressed its offensive in a western province, killing 16 Afghan National Army soldiers and capturing 40 — an entire company.U.S.-China trade war: In high-stakes negotiations with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, President Trump’s strategy of relying heavily on his own personality and ability to read people failed. The same strategy faces a serious test with China’s president, Xi Jinping.Turkey: The country is officially entering a recession, with government figures showing two consecutive quarters of falling economic growth. The currency has tumbled and investor concerns are rising, a damaging combination for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ahead of crucial elections at the end of the month.Algeria: Yielding to weeks of protest in the tightly controlled country, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the 82-year-old ailing president who has ruled for 20 years, announced that he would not seek a fifth term in office — but he also canceled the election scheduled for April, raising questions about how long he would remain in power.U.S. budget: The record $4.75 trillion proposal President Trump sent to lawmakers has no chance of passage. Instead, our Washington reporters write, it serves as a declaration of Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign priorities: $8.6 billion for the construction of a border wall, a 5 percent increase in military spending and deep cuts to domestic programs.Tesla: Days after its chief executive, Elon Musk, announced that the carmaker would shut most of its dealerships, Tesla reversed course, saying it would keep “significantly more stores open” and raise most of its vehicle prices about 3 percent worldwide.Super bloom: Forest fires followed by heavy rains in California this year have spurred colorful wildflowers to blossom across the state, turning arid landscapes into explosions of purples, yellows and greens.The internet: The memes, Wikipedia pages and emails that you look at every day travel to your device via nearly 750,000 miles of extremely thin cables strung across the ocean floor.

Boycott, the land agent for a wealthy nobleman, was responsible for evicting those on his employer’s 40,000 acres. When he tried, the Irish National Land League suggested nonviolent protest. Boycott’s neighbors shunned him. Stores declined to serve him, his laborers quit and jeering mobs followed him.Boycott’s plight attracted international attention, including front-page articles in The New York Times.Boycott left Ireland, but his name remained, reportedly popularized by a priest who thought “ostracize” would confuse common people.Within months, The Times was using it to describe events elsewhere in the world.Aodhan Beirne wrote today’s Back Story.Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.Check out this page to find a Morning Briefing for your region.

394,"Good morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)Today’s the big day for Gavin Newsom. At about noon, he’s set to be sworn in as the 40th governor of California, following Jerry Brown’s historic tenure.The ceremony will cap a series of inauguration festivities the likes of which haven’t been seen for a couple of decades, The Sacramento Bee reported. (As if you needed another point of contrast between the two, Mr. Brown’s 2011 inauguration featured a choir from one of the charter schools in Oakland that he started, while Mr. Newsom’s pre-inauguration benefit concert Sunday night featured Pitbull.)Of course, that’s all secondary to the bigger question: How will Mr. Newsom run the state? Adam Nagourney, our Los Angeles bureau chief, is back today with context.What should we be listening for in Mr. Newsom’s speech?Adam Nagourney: The governor-elect was relatively vague during the campaign, but he said a few things: He promised a major investment in early childhood education, and expanding parental leave. We can count on those being in the speech.Are there potential surprises in store?I’m going to be listening for him to talk about the epidemic of wildfires that ravaged the state last year. Will he propose something to mitigate future blazes, protect homeowners or insurance companies? I’m also interested to see if he says anything about Mr. Brown’s troubled high-speed train between San Francisco and Los Angeles. He has expressed general support, but it’s going to need his active backing to be necessary to keep it moving down the tracks (sorry, I couldn’t resist).What about California’s other big issue — water?Mr. Brown left office without winning final approval for the twin water tunnels he wanted to build under the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, to assure water flows to Southern California and farmland. Mr. Newsom has been decidedly unsupportive of something that big — but he very well might come out in favor of a less ambitious single tunnel.Is he likely to hit any overarching themes?California has been very much defined by Jerry Brown these past eight years, a tenure marked by frugality and a head-on approach to issues like global warming. Mr. Newsom, during the campaign, tried to at once tie himself to the popular governor, and present himself as the face of change. This will be a day for him to show how much this is going to be a new chapter in the story of California — and how much he wants to leave the Brown era behind.(A note: We often link to content on sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

395,"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.Hi, everybody! If you are in the areas of the United States affected by the polar vortex (and do click that link for a dazzling visual explanation of the phenomenon), we hope you’re bundling up. LAYERS, PEOPLE.Some of the temperatures we’re seeing in the Midwest are the frostiest in decades, a reminder of colder times. But let’s all please put one much-discussed line to rest: Yes, it’s colder in Chicago or Des Moines than in some parts of Antarctica. But it’s summer in the Southern Hemisphere, so it’s not that shocking. (Yes, The New York Times used this factoid, too.)If you are chilling out in the United States, you might be asking what this deep freeze could have to do with climate change. (Or you might want to know how to respond to an argumentative friend or relative.) We’re here for you. Kendra Pierre-Louis has the answer in a story that explains that, while climate can affect weather extremes, climate is not weather.As Kendra put it: “A billionaire who has forgotten his wallet one day is not poor, any more than a poor person who lands a windfall of several hundred dollars is suddenly rich. What matters is what happens over the long term.”Not only that, but there’s also evidence to suggest that climate change plays a role in the plunging of the polar vortex.Australia, by the way, has been dangerously hot. In an article on the front page of Wednesday’s print edition, our colleague Somini Sengupta took the global view, telling us to get used to “weather in the age of extremes.”We also looked at a new study suggesting that plants under the stress of climate change might absorb less carbon dioxide. That’s bad news: We’ll need all the help from plants that we can get. “We have this image of the planet getting very, very green as we move into the future,” an author of the study told Kendra, “but it may be the opposite.”And while China has said it will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, Somini tells us about a new study showing that the country, the planet’s coal juggernaut, is not meeting its own regulations to reduce methane emissions from its many coal plants.Back in the United States, the government shutdown is over, but President Trump insists that the fight for a border wall is not. If he does find a way to extend the physical barrier farther across the southern border, experts warn, the result could be disastrous for wildlife.Now, here’s something to think about if you’re staying home, bundling up and watching TV today:Noah Horowitz never thought much about his cable boxes. “If you have service and it’s working, you don’t think about the box top,” he said. But he noticed that the boxes generated heat constantly and that the lights stayed on even when he turned the boxes off. He wondered how much power that was drawing.Mr. Horowitz is a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, who specializes in energy efficiency. So, he looked into these set-top boxes and found out that they’re enormous power drains.That was in 2011. At the time, a single DVR unit chewed through as much as 275 kilowatt-hours per year, more than half as much as some Energy Star refrigerators. And many homes had more than one box. In total, the defense council estimated that set-top boxes in the United States were consuming about $3 billion worth of electricity each year.Those numbers drew attention in the news media, and TV providers promised to make their equipment more efficient. According to Mr. Horowitz, there has been some improvement; power consumption on newer units is about two-thirds of what it used to be.One of the most significant recent changes benefits homes with multiple TVs. In the past, each TV might have had its own DVR (the most power-consuming set-top box). Today, though, you can use just one DVR with side units that require much less power.“The best thing people can do is, if they’ve got multiple DVRs, trade them in for the new upgraded system,” Mr. Horowitz said. “You’ll cut the energy use from the equipment by about a half.” He also suggested unplugging units that you don’t use very often.Still, as of 2017, set-top boxes in the United States were using about seven large power plants’ worth of electricity each year, Mr. Horowitz said.He’d like to see more app-based services instead of boxes. And there has already been some movement in that direction. Sling and YouTube TV, for example, provide television over the internet. These apps are delivered either directly through a smart TV or via devices like Apple TV, Roku and Amazon Fire, which use under 25 kW-h per year. That’s an eighth of what a modern DVR box uses.“This is where the technology is going,” and it will be good for the environment, Mr. Horowitz said.The #10YearChallenge has shown us that some celebrities have barely aged a day over the past decade. Unfortunately, one can’t say the same for coral reefs, forests or Arctic ice.Scientists, environmental activists and others have taken advantage of the trend on social media to create moments of reflection about the planet. “The only 10-year challenge we should care about” is perhaps the most common climate-related refrain right now.Many posts, like the one below from the German soccer star Mesut Özil, have included side-by-side photographs of an unidentified iceberg, supposedly taken a decade apart. Though the origin of those photos isn’t clear, it’s true that near-record sea ice minimums have now occurred every year for the past 12 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s most recent Arctic Report Card.“What will the Arctic look like in 10 more years?” Leonardo DiCaprio wrote on Instagram alongside photos of melting ice caps from 100 years ago and today. Manish Bapna, executive vice president of the World Resources Institute, a think tank in Washington, tweeted side-by-side global temperature maps from the 19th and 21st centuries, calling climate change “the biggest #10YearChallenge.”And the Kenya office of the environmental group World Wildlife Fund used the meme to tweet some good news: the ongoing restoration of Lake Naivasha, a freshwater lake northwest of Nairobi that a decade ago was hard-hit by problems including deforestation and soil erosion.Edward Maibach, director of the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University, said social media discussions were probably not as conducive as in-person conversations to shaping opinions about the warming of the planet. But, he wrote in an email, “The notion of a #10YearChallenge is a particularly interesting conversation to start, because it easily brings both urgency and opportunity into the conversation.”Here are a few more climate takes on the #10YearChallenge:We’d love your feedback on this newsletter.

396,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]New York City will spend at least $100 million to ensure that undocumented immigrants and others who cannot qualify for insurance can receive medical treatment, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Tuesday, seeking to insert a city policy into two contentious national debates.The mayor has styled himself, in his 2017 re-election campaign and during his second term, as a progressive leader on issues like education and health care, and as a bulwark against the policies of President Trump, particularly on immigration.In making the announcement, first on national television, Mr. de Blasio appeared to be trying to heighten that contrast and thrust his efforts on behalf of undocumented New Yorkers into the national debate over immigration, hours before Mr. Trump was to go on television Tuesday night to make his case for a border wall.“Everyone is guaranteed the right to health care, everyone,” Mr. de Blasio said during a news conference at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. “We are saying the word guarantee because we can make it happen.”New York City already provides health care to the uninsured and the undocumented through its hospital system, a roughly $8 billion behemoth whose history of service to the poor, regardless of an ability to pay, can be traced to the founding of Bellevue Hospital in the 18th century. A person without medical insurance has long been able to go to a city emergency room and get care, free of charge, or to seek a primary-care physician.But the financially challenged system did not work well to connect patients to doctors, Mr. de Blasio said. He promised a streamlined approach — complete with a hotline and dedicated membership card — and one that would be focused on the primary-care doctor, rather than the emergency room.“We were only covering them in the sense that they could go to the emergency room,” the mayor said. “It was not a way to live.”The announcement came as proponents of universal health care coverage have increasingly looked to local governments, rather than Congress, to make meaningful progress in the short term. Also on Tuesday, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington said he would seek to create a public option in the state.A day before, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, on his first day in office, announced his plan to move toward a single-payer system for that state. As mayor of San Francisco, Mr. Newsom oversaw the creation of a health care system in that city in 2007.The top health official who created the San Francisco program, Mitchell H. Katz, is now the head of New York City’s hospital system and will oversee the city’s effort, branded as NYC Care. “It’s a much bigger and more compassionate vision,” said Mr. Katz, comparing New York’s proposed program to the much smaller one in San Francisco.The mayor was quick to say that the plan would not be a substitute for any universal health care at the state level or a national single-payer plan. But, aides said, it was something the city could do immediately and on its own, without approval from the State Legislature, which is weighing some form of universal health insurance for New York State.Indeed, the mayor’s proposal is a mix of insurance and direct spending, and Mr. de Blasio said it would take about two years to get it fully running. The city already has a kind of public option for health insurance for low-income New Yorkers, through an insurance plan run by city hospitals known as MetroPlus.The new proposal would improve that coverage, which already insures some 516,000 people, and aim to reach more of those who are eligible, such as the young and uninsured, and others who qualify but have not applied.It would also provide additional direct city spending, at least $100 million per year when fully implemented, officials said, for the city’s hospital system to support care for those without insurance. The city estimates the uninsured population to be about 600,000 people, including as many as 300,000 undocumented residents. A major component of that effort would be improving customer service, including the phone line, to help those with questions about their care.Part of the goal of NYC Care, aides to the mayor said, was to direct people to medical care earlier — before they seek more expensive services in an emergency room — while providing them with better health care.The effort is also aimed at getting some of the so-called young-and-invincible uninsured population into the health care system, either through the city’s insurance plan or through its hospital system.“It appears that the mayor is ramping up outreach so that more people can avail themselves of services, regardless of ability to pay, that have been made available to them by Health and Hospitals for decades,” said Andrew Rein, the president of the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission. “The details are critical,” he added. “We still need to learn more.”The $100 million would go to both establishing the customer service component and hiring additional doctors and nurses, but officials could not provide a breakdown of how much would be spent on each. Indeed, details of how those seeking care could do so under the new plan were not immediately clear, nor was an exact start date.Mr. Katz said that the rollout would begin in the Bronx and that the city would start enrolling people in the NYC Care program this summer. The borough was chosen because the health care needs were greatest, he said.Such endeavors can be difficult for the city to implement quickly. Mr. de Blasio oversaw the creation of a municipal identification card for undocumented immigrants in his first term. But last week, he said that an ambitious goal of providing MetroCards to about 800,000 residents whose incomes are below the federal poverty line would fall far short of that goal initially, starting this month with cards for only about 30,000 people, or about 4 percent of the total.Mr. de Blasio said that the NYC Care system will also employ what amounted to a membership card in the city program. “They will have a card that will empower them to go to that doctor whenever they need,” he said.The city’s hospital system has been under severe financial strain and running deficits for years. The current financial plan for city hospitals anticipates budget shortfalls of more than $156 million in 2018, increasing to $1.8 billion in 2022, according to the city’s Independent Budget Office.Melanie Hartzog, the city’s budget director, took issue with those figures during the news conference. She said that the hospital system — which has received significant infusions of city money during the de Blasio administration — was now in “a very cash-strong position.” She said more details would be provided during a forthcoming budget briefing.Advocates for immigrants and health care analysts were encouraged by the plan, even if many were still looking to Albany, where debate over health care is likely to consume the coming months.“We hope it is a step toward making larger changes at the state level,” said Rebecca Telzak, director of health programs at Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy group supportive of the mayor’s plan. “Ending here is not enough.”"
397,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. The deteriorating situation inside Philippine jails, the pleas of a Saudi asylum seeker in Thailand and the mysteries of whale song. Here’s the latest:Since President Rodrigo Duterte launched a violent antidrug campaign in 2016, Philippine jails have become increasingly packed, ranking among the most crowded in the world.In Manila City Jail, more than 500 men sleep in a space meant for just 170. The guards are so outnumbered — one officer for every 528 inmates on a recent shift — that gangs help maintain order.“When you are detained in Philippine jails, you are being tortured,” said one member of the government’s Commission on Human Rights.Go deeper: Here’s a closer look at Mr. Duterte’s drug crackdown, in which the police have killed thousands of people.At negotiations over the U.S. government shutdown on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence insisted on beginning with a prayer. So Republicans asked God to “bring us together.”On Sunday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s staff members began with another prayer — noting that Jesus and Mary were both refugees.The two prayers underscored the stalemate lawmakers find themselves in over President Trump’s demand for border wall funding. But some small advances were made, White House officials claimed. Republicans agreed that a concrete wall was a non-starter, and that any text of a bill would refer to steel instead.What’s next: President Trump wants to deliver a prime time address about the shutdown on Tuesday night and plans to travel to the border later in the week in an effort to convince Americans of the need for a wall.An 18-year-old woman who spent 48 hours at Bangkok’s main international airport has been allowed to enter the city with officials from the U.N. refugee agency. Earlier, she was on the verge of being deported.Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun said that her family was abusive and that she feared for her life if she were returned to Saudi Arabia.“They will kill me because I fled and because I announced my atheism,” she said. “They wanted me to pray and to wear a veil, and I didn’t want to.”Background: Women in Saudi Arabia are subject to guardianship laws and need a man’s consent for basic needs from education to travel. Ms. Alqunun managed to slip away from her family during a trip to Kuwait.What’s next: Ms. Alqunun said she planned to continue on to Australia and request asylum there.In case you missed it, Hollywood suited up yesterday for an awards ceremony that delivered many upsets. Most notably, “Bohemian Rhapsody” won best drama — beating out the favored “A Star Is Born.”The good: Sandra Oh became the first Asian woman to host a major American awards show and made surprisingly emotional comments about representation. Glenn Close, who won best actress in a drama for “The Wife,” gave a crowd-pleasing speech. And the winners list included many artists of color.The bad: Co-host Andy Samberg’s opening speech, “roasting” stars with aggressive niceness, fell flat, write our TV critics.The fashion: Last year, women dressed in black to honor the Times Up movement. But this year, the red carpet retreated, writes our chief fashion critic.SoftBank: The Japanese telecom company will inject another $2 billion into WeWork, the co-working start-up, according to people familiar with the deal. The latest commitment brings SoftBank’s total investment in the company to about $10.5 billion and values WeWork at $47 billion.Silicon Valley: Some venture capitalists are rooting for a market dip this year, hoping that a downturn would calm an overheating start-up scene and make companies cheaper to invest in.North Korea: A train possibly carrying the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, entered China, South Korean news media reported, raising speculation that he could be meeting with President Xi Jinping before a planned second summit meeting with President Trump.Nigeria: Soldiers stormed the offices of one of the country’s largest newspapers, detaining two journalists, over an article that the military said divulged classified information. The raid came amid struggles to combat Boko Haram and less than two months before presidential elections.Asylum seekers: As the U.S. tightens its policies at the southern border, many asylum seekers are contemplating hiring smugglers in Mexico, despite the dangers and increasing costs.Nuclear energy: A plan to build a new nuclear power plant in northern Wales could lift the local economy while expanding Britain’s non-carbon-based fuel options. But some worry the project could damage an island’s rural charm and environment.Whale song: Scientists have found that whales often string together repeated sound patterns to create complex tunes and jingles. Some even change up their playlists. Pope Francis: In a major address to the Vatican, the pope lamented the rise of “nationalistic tendencies” in the U.S. and Europe. His remarks hit a nerve in Italy, where the populist government has cracked down on immigration and denied entry to ships that rescued migrants.Tips for a more fulfilling life.Recipe of the day: Salmon in parsley sauce is zingy and herby — and very easy to make.

The “longlist” of contenders for the 2019 prize were announced this week.Arabic is an ancient language and has a rich tradition of oral storytelling and poetry, but the adoption of the novel is relatively recent. Few Arabic novels are translated, and fewer still are distributed in the West.The prize is funded by the Department of Culture and Tourism of Abu Dhabi. Some call it the “Arabic Booker” because the Booker Prize Foundation in London supports the award.

Many airlines take their Boeing 737 Max 8 models out of service, Indians rally behind Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkey enters an economic recession. Here’s the latest: What brought an Ethiopian Airlines flight down just minutes after takeoff on Sunday, killing all 157 aboard, has not been determined. But while the investigation proceeds, at least 22 carriers have taken the Boeing model involved out of service, including all those operating in China and Indonesia.Follow our live coverage of the latest developments here.The accident was the second in recent months involving Boeing’s new 737 Max 8. In October, a Lion Air flight crashed into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff. Aviation authorities have been looking into the possibility that incorrect data might have activated new anti-stall software that kept pushing the nose downward — and that pilots may not have been made fully aware of.On the ground: The plane’s flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder have been recovered, Ethiopian Airlines said. The pilot sent out a distress call and was cleared to return to the airport shortly before the crash.Victims: The passengers on the plane were from all parts of the world, including professors from Kenya, an underwater archaeologist and U.N. workers from a variety of countries.Traveling soon? Here’s how to find out if your next flight is on a Max 737. And you can send your questions about the plane to our reporters. A month ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s chances of winning a second term seemed weakened. But after a suicide bombing in Kashmir set off weeks of military brinkmanship with Pakistan, even once-critical Indians have started rallying behind him.That India’s airstrikes probably missed their targets, and that a fighter jet was shot down by Pakistan, don’t seem to matter.“Whatever our criticisms about him regarding the economy and jobs, at the end of the day he has done an incredible job of delivering justice for the martyrs,” said a law student and first-time voter.Context: India has a Westminster-style parliamentary system. For Mr. Modi to return to power in the coming general elections, which start on April 11, he and his Bharatiya Janata Party need to win a majority of the 543 electable seats in the lower house, the Lok Sabha.The opposition Congress Party is trying to sway the conversation back toward domestic issues, like the sputtering economy and a spike in hate crimes against minority groups.The country’s electric system has been down for more than four days, plunging most of the country into sporadic darkness and adding further uncertainty to the country’s economic and political crises.The country’s largest power producer went down on Thursday, and no date has been set to restart the plant. Looting and protests have broken out, and desperate patients have been begging doctors to be kept alive.Finger-pointing: President Nicolás Maduro blames U.S. sabotage and cyberattacks for the blackout, without providing evidence. Energy experts and Venezuelan power sector contractors dismiss that explanation, instead pointing to mismanagement and corruption.Related: The U.S. claimed that Mr. Maduro’s supporters had set fire to a convoy of humanitarian aid, but an investigation by The Times found that the actual cause was more likely a Molotov cocktail thrown by an anti-government protester.Prime Minister Theresa May flew to Strasbourg, France, to attempt to rescue her unpopular withdrawal plan.It’s unclear what kind of concessions she can win in the 11th hour meeting that would prevent Parliament from voting the plan down today.What next? If she loses, Mrs. May has promised to offer a vote on whether Britain should leave the E.U. without a deal — a scenario that could brutally upend the country’s economy and one that a majority of lawmakers oppose.Related: A protest by customs officers in France has delayed Eurostar trains and backed up trucks for miles, providing Britain with a cautionary tale of a post-Brexit world. Afghanistan: As its peace talks with the U.S. in Doha, Qatar, entered an extraordinary third week, the Taliban pressed its offensive in the western Badghis Province, killing 16 Afghan National Army soldiers and capturing 40 — an entire company — in a large-scale attack.U.S.-China trade war: In a high-stakes diplomatic negotiations with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un, President Trump’s strategy of relying heavily on his own personality and ability to read people failed. The same strategy faces a serious test with Mr. Xi.Malaysia: An Indonesian woman who was accused two years ago of smearing a lethal nerve agent on Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, at Kuala Lumpur International Airport was released without explanation. The fate of a second suspect in the killing remains uncertain.Turkey: The country is officially entering a recession, with government figures showing two consecutive quarters of falling economic growth. The currency has tumbled and investor concerns are rising, a damaging combination for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ahead of crucial elections at the end of the month.U.S. budget: President Trump sent Congress the largest spending plan in federal history, requesting $4.75 trillion for the next fiscal year. His proposal — which would increase military spending and fund a border wall with Mexico while sharply cutting domestic programs, like education and environmental protection — was declared dead on arrival by Democrats in the House and Senate.Tesla: Days after its chief executive, Elon Musk, announced that the carmaker would shut most of its dealerships, the company reversed course, saying that it would keep “significantly more stores open” and that it would raise prices for most of its cars worldwide by 3 percent.Super bloom: Forest fires followed by heavy rains in California this year have spurred colorful wildflowers to blossom across the state, turning arid landscapes into explosions of purples, yellows and greens.The internet: The memes, Wikipedia pages and emails that you look at every day travel to your device via nearly 750,000 miles of extremely thin cables strung across the ocean floor.

Boycott, the land agent for a wealthy nobleman, was responsible for evicting those on his employer’s 40,000 acres. When he tried, the Irish National Land League suggested nonviolent protest.

399,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. Britain’s Parliament is set to hash out Brexit, the U.S. and the Taliban agree in principle to a peace framework, and France is debating the conduct of its police officers. Here’s the latest: The British Parliament is expected to vote today on a number of amendments to Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan that could end up shaping how the country departs from the E.U.How it works: Various lawmakers, including those in opposition parties, have proposed more than a dozen changes to the wording of Mrs. May’s exit plan. Only the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, can decide which will be voted on. The voting is for the most part not binding, but Mrs. May will be under political pressure to adopt popular measures.What are the amendments? There is a broad range. The most hyped could delay Britain’s departure from the bloc for a few months or even until the end of the year if there is no deal. That would blunt Mrs. May’s best cudgel: the clock. What does it all mean? At the very least, the competing proposals should give Parliament a better idea of the kind of Brexit that would get wide support and perhaps even work.Tesco: Contending with competition from discount retailers and bracing for a possible Brexit shock, the largest grocer in Britain by market share said it was planning to cut thousands of jobs.Officials from both parties agreed in principle to the outlines of a preliminary peace deal, the chief U.S. negotiator, Zalmay Khalilzad, told our reporter in Kabul. The agreement is the biggest step yet toward ending the 17-year Afghan conflict.Terms: U.S. negotiators said the deal would include a Taliban guarantee that Afghan territory would not be used for terrorist activity. The withdrawal of American troops would be contingent on larger concessions from the Taliban, including a cease-fire and direct talks with the Afghan government — concessions the insurgent group has rejected in the past.Behind the scenes: President Trump is eager to leave Afghanistan, but Defense Department officials, convinced he does not grasp the complexities of the war, are warning that a full withdrawal could lead to a terrorist attack on the U.S. within two years. And Afghan officials are increasingly suspicious that Mr. Trump will make a deal with the Taliban behind their backs. Dismay and rage are rising in France about the police response to months of protests by the Yellow Vest movement. Protesters’ grievous wounds have been making headlines for weeks, and critics say the government has become downright repressive.Developments: On Saturday, Jérôme Rodrigues, a well-known figure in the Yellow Vests, suffered an eye injury, apparently from a rubber projectile and a so-called dispersal grenade, as he was streaming live video on Facebook of a protest in Paris. “He will be handicapped for life,” his lawyer said. Context: Yellow Vest protests have mixed peaceful demonstration with violent looting, fire-setting and attacks on the police. But in Western Europe, only France, Northern Ireland and Spain use projectile guns loaded with rubber balls that can seriously maim. President Emmanuel Macron’s government has ignored calls to stop using them, arguing that the police response is justified by the level of chaos. In numbers: Since the revolt began in November, 11 people have died and 1,200 law enforcement officers have been injured. Among protesters there have been 1,900 injuries, 109 of them serious — including 18 who were blinded in one eye and four who lost a hand. An internal police group has opened 101 inquiries into use of force.

Pope Francis: The pope tried to tamp down expectations for a global meeting at the Vatican next month on child sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church, saying it was mainly intended to educate bishops and other church leaders. Huawei: The U.S. Justice Department unveiled sweeping charges against the Chinese telecom firm Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, outlining a decade-long attempt by the company to steal trade secrets, obstruct a criminal investigation and evade economic sanctions on Iran. The U.S. also said it would seek to have Ms. Meng extradited from Canada, where she was detained last year at its request.Venezuela: The Trump administration imposed sanctions against Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, cutting off the main source of cash for the government of the embattled president, Nicolás Maduro.

402,"CIUDAD HIDALGO, Mexico — Mexico’s new president has moved decisively to encourage migrants fleeing poverty and violence in Central America to stay and work in Mexico, making it easier for them to get visas and work permits and promoting investments and ambitious public works projects to create jobs.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s policies are already proving to be a magnet for migrants, who are finding it harder to enter the United States given President Trump’s antipathy toward immigration. A migrant caravan heading to Mexico from Central America — the largest ever — has already swollen to over 12,000 people, with many saying they intend to remain in Mexico, at least for the time being. The new Mexican president’s generosity toward immigrants, officials say, dovetails with his broader commitment to protect human rights, reduce inequality and prioritize the poor.Mr. López Obrador’s pro-immigrant stance also serves as a dramatic counterpoint to the White House, without directly challenging Mr. Trump. But these policies could ultimately put pressure on the Mexico-United States border, as most in the caravan eventually hope to cross into the United States.Many in the caravan said they decided to migrate after a decision by the Mexican government to drastically speed up the process for securing a yearlong humanitarian visa that allows migrants to legally travel and work in Mexico.“The humanitarian visa that they’re giving now is the reason we are here,” said Carlos del Valle, a Guatemalan teacher who was standing in line with his family this week to apply for the visa on the bridge connecting Guatemala with Mexico.“Later, if possible, we can get to the United States,” he said.Under the streamlined process, which began last week, the government is seeking to issue the humanitarian visa in an average of five days rather than a month. Migration officials said the policy would be permanent.The initiative, officials say, is part of the president’s strategy to make Mexico’s immigration policy more humane, after years of stepped-up deportations under pressure from the United States. But it could also draw even more migrants to trek north to the border with the United States, inflaming tensions with a Trump administration determined to build a border wall and lower immigration numbers.On Thursday, the Trump administration said it would institute a new policy to return most asylum-seekers to Mexico if they had arrived at the southwest border by land. Under the policy, which is intended to discourage Central Americans from migrating to the United States and to ease pressure on the asylum system, the petitioners would be required to remain in Mexico while they await the outcome of their cases.The current migrant caravan left San Pedro Sula in Honduras on Jan. 14 and, in the following days, began arriving at the Guatemala-Mexico border. Mexican officials encouraged the migrants to apply for the humanitarian visa, and since then over 12,000 people, mostly Hondurans, have done so in this border town in southern Mexico.But while some in the caravan say they intend to remain in Mexico and avail themselves of government-sponsored jobs programs, many plan to use the visas as safe-passage permits to ease their journey to Mexico’s northern border, where they hope to figure out a way to cross into the United States.Mr. Trump has excoriated the governments of Central America and Mexico for, he says, not doing enough to stop the caravans. He has portrayed the migrants as invaders threatening Americans’ security and jobs.Mr. Trump’s demand that Congress approve funding for a wall across the border resulted in a weekslong stalemate with Democrats and a partial shutdown of the American government that ended, at least for now, on Friday. To bolster his case, he has recently taken to Twitter to warn about the current caravan.“Mexico is doing NOTHING to stop the Caravan which is now fully formed and heading to the United States,” he wrote on Saturday.In an earlier tweet, he said: “Another big Caravan heading our way. Very hard to stop without a Wall!”The Mexican government initially said it was speeding up the application process for humanitarian visas as an “exception” for the current migrant caravan only. But on Thursday, a spokeswoman with Mexico’s national migration agency said the expedited process would be permanent.“This is like a light in the road for migrants because they know they can enter Mexico without difficulty,” said Karen Valladares, director of the National Forum for Migration in Honduras, an advocacy group. “Now we’re seeing a different Mexico, a Mexico that opens its borders, a Mexico that is providing opportunities, a Mexico that is giving — one way or another — hope.”The government’s motives, however, are not just humanitarian. The Mexican government has said it has a labor shortage and is trying to fill tens of thousands of low-skilled jobs around the country.Most migrants in the current caravan have chosen to apply for the humanitarian visa. But on Jan. 18, a group of about 1,500 crossed at the official border checkpoint here in Ciudad Hidalgo, walking right by Mexican border officials who did not move to stop them. Hundreds of members of that group have since continued to travel north through Mexico, unimpeded by Mexican authorities.Except for that incident, the process has been orderly, in sharp contrast to an incident in October when members of another large migrant caravan clashed with Mexican police officers at the same crossing. Many members of that caravan, and several smaller ones that followed in quick succession, eventually made it to the northern Mexican state of Baja California, putting extraordinary strain on local government and the resources of civil society.An increasing number of participants in the current caravan, it seems, have been drawn to the idea of staying in Mexico.“What I want is to cross in order to work, no more than that,” said Yanina Vargas, 27, a Honduran migrant who was standing in a line of more than one thousand people on the border bridge that connects Guatemala with Mexico.To address the root causes of migration, Mr. López Obrador has vowed to promote job creation in southern Mexico and Central America, and has been pushing a $30 billion regional development plan. He has also ordered tax cuts in dozens of municipalities along the northern border to spur economic development and job creation. His administration joined with business sector and labor leaders in December to raise the minimum wage by about 16 percent, to boost the fortunes of the nation’s working class.But despite these enticements, and Mr. Trump’s unwelcoming posture toward migrants, many participants in the current caravan were still intent on making it to the United States.Franklin Caballero, 30, from Honduras, said he lived in the United States as an undocumented immigrant for six years but was deported for driving without a license. Traveling with the caravan, he hoped to make it back.“Even though I have to wait five days for the pass to get into Mexico, later I will see how to get to the United States,” he said, standing in line to apply for the humanitarian visa. His tentative plan was to pay a smuggler in northern Mexico to sneak him across the border into the United States.Still others were keeping their options open, prepared to live and work in Mexico until they saw an opportunity to cross into the United States.“Our aim is to find work,” said Anabella López, 50, a Guatemalan migrant, who was traveling with seven relatives covering three generations. “The United States is difficult now.”Ms. López said that she had followed the news about the caravans that arrived in northern Mexico in the fall and knew they had “suffered a lot.”But she also wondered how Mexico was going to support so many new arrivals from Central America.“What is this country going to do with so many people?” she asked."
403,"Some cried with relief. Their 35-day nightmare of missing bill payments, working without paychecks, asking strangers for money and visiting food pantries was finally ending.But many of the federal workers who have been furloughed or working for free since December were leery of the three-week deal reached on Friday to reopen the government. New worries gnawed: How long before they got paid? Would federal contractors see even a dime of back pay?And most of all, after the longest shutdown in American history, would they and 800,000 other federal workers be back in the same mess in three weeks if President Trump and Democrats do not reach an accord on whether to fund his proposed border wall?“This was all for nothing, basically,” said Angela Kelley, 51, a furloughed worker for the Bureau of Land Management in Milwaukee who picked up shifts as an Uber driver to earn money to buy gas and groceries as the shutdown dragged on.On Friday, Mr. Trump praised federal workers as “fantastic people” and “incredible patriots” and acknowledged the toll they had suffered. But several federal employees said they still felt angry after being treated like pawns, they said, in a five-week-long Washington standoff. They said the shutdown had left deep scars on their families and finances and undermined their faith in elected leaders, and in the careers they had chosen.The New York Times talked with more than a dozen federal workers and contractors — from wildland firefighters to Coast Guard families to museum security guards — about how they had survived the shutdown, and the uncertainty they now face.John Hare, 42, is one of thousands of Coast Guard employees and retirees worried that they may find themselves in the same precarious position a few weeks from now.Because the Coast Guard is the only branch of the military that is part of the Department of Homeland Security, it was affected by the shutdown. About 55,000 active-duty, reserve and civilian employees had already missed either one or two paychecks, while another 50,000 military retirees would have gone without a pension payment for the first time on Feb. 1.After 22 years of service, Mr. Hare was forced to retire from the Coast Guard last August after learning he had a rare form of cancer that spread from his appendix. His wife had to stop working to care for him, and missing Mr. Hare’s pension check of $2,698 would have put a significant dent into the family budget.“The faith in our leadership to be able to negotiate with each other has been broken,” Mr. Hare, of Rolesville, N.C., said on Friday. “And they chose to break faith with the U.S. military.”“I certainly question the hostage-taking of government employees’ paychecks,” he said. “And nobody that was in power who had the power to stop this, none of them were injured” by the shutdown.“It is less a sense of relief because nothing has been solved.”Yvette Hicks, 40, a security guard at the Smithsonian museums, said she woke up on Friday and prayed, once again, for the shutdown to end. As a single mother, she said the shutdown had taken a toll on her family’s budget and her own mental health.When she learned on Friday she might be returning to work, Ms. Hicks said she had been crying. Her 14-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son were due home from school soon, and she was trying to put up a brave face for them. She said her son, Kaden, had nevertheless told his teachers that his mother was now sad all the time.Ms. Hicks said her family had once been homeless, and that she believed her job at the Smithsonian was a path to stability. She even saved up enough to book a spring-break vacation for her children to an indoor water park in Virginia. But as the bills piled up and her paychecks stopped, she said she canceled the trip and lost the $350 deposit she had paid for a room.“It’s just a hurting thing,” she said. “This has damaged my family.”Anthony Powers, 35, had begun thinking about leaving his 15-year career as part of an elite team of wildland firefighters with the United States Forest Service in Southern California. He was that frustrated with his nation’s leaders.“Our country is being run by children,” he said.On Friday, he was relieved but not elated, noting that everything could shut down again soon.Mr. Powers and his colleagues typically spend this time of year clearing away brush to help lessen fire danger in the coming year. None of that has been happening for the last month or so, and his team needs more than three weeks to get the job done. He also has a national conference set for the end of February, and the short-term opening leaves him in limbo. Is it going to happen? Should he plan for it? Not plan for it?“There’s been so much planning for this to go into the long-term,” he said. “Now it’s like, where do you reset?”Nic Trujillo, 34, a single father and collections representative for the Internal Revenue Service in Ogden, Utah, said the shutdown had done financial and emotional damage.He had not paid rent in January because he needed to pay other expenses. On Friday, he and his 6-year-old son were just one week away from being evicted and having to move in with extended family.Staying at home had also left him depressed. Before he was ordered to return to work without pay on Jan. 18, his natural night-owl tendencies had taken over. He would stay up late, get up to get his son off to school, then sleep for much of the day.“I haven’t really done anything. I haven’t really gone anywhere,” he said, explaining that he didn’t want to waste gas. “It’s just been a very depressive time.”He said he blamed both the president and Congress for the shutdown, saying that none of them knew what it was like to live paycheck to paycheck.“They are so out of touch with the American people that it’s unacceptable.”Kim Howell, 34, whose husband is in the Coast Guard in Boston and has been working 12-hour night shifts throughout the shutdown, said she didn’t feel much relief on Friday. She said she didn’t expect that her husband would get any back pay for a week or two. And then there was the possibility that the government would shut down again in three weeks.Ms. Howell said her family had been fortunate because she works for a tech startup. But the loss of her husband’s income strained them. They had to put off rent payments, utility bills, and cellphone, cable and internet bills.She had visited a food pantry that had been set up in Boston for Coast Guard families. She worried about the impact on her three children, who are 9, 13 and 14. Her oldest child told her he felt helpless and anxious watching his parents try to navigate the crisis. She did not blame any particular party, but said she felt betrayed. And she worried the dysfunction was far from over.“I’m staying in shutdown mode,” she said. “That’s the only responsible thing to do right now.”"
404,"WASHINGTON — Standing in the Rose Garden on Friday morning, President Trump heaped praise on Rush Limbaugh, the right-wing radio show host, who earlier in the week gave his blessing to a bipartisan spending bill that did not include the money Mr. Trump had demanded for a wall.“This guy is unbelievable,” Mr. Trump said. “Try speaking for three hours without taking calls.”During Mr. Trump’s 50 minutes of discursive remarks, which were ostensibly to announce a national emergency to build a wall along the southern border, the president appeared to be taking that challenge himself.Forced to confront arguably the biggest surrender of his presidency, Mr. Trump did what he often does after a loss: respond with distraction, digression and entertainment, through a fog of words.There was no teleprompter. He hardly looked at his notes. There was just Mr. Trump, dressed in a dark overcoat and bright blue tie, free-associating in tweetable sound bites, and setting off the furious clicks of cameras every time he gesticulated with his arms.The president’s public schedule said nothing about an attempt to get around Congress’s rejection of his plan for a border wall — a White House handout was titled, “President Donald J. Trump’s Border Security Victory.” His Rose Garden event was billed as “remarks on the national security and humanitarian crisis on our southern border,” and he was about 40 minutes late.When he finally emerged from the Oval Office, Mr. Trump spent another 10 minutes riffing about his administration’s successes before getting to the point of the gathering, which included his new attorney general, William P. Barr, and the secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen, sitting shoulder to shoulder with a group of “angel moms” hugging photographs of their slain relatives.First, Mr. Trump praised his trade negotiations with China. “It’s going extremely well,” he said. But then he added, “Who knows what that means, because it only matters if we get it done.” He moved on to North Korea, expressing his excitement about a second summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, scheduled for this month in Vietnam. “We think that North Korea and Chairman Kim have a tremendous potential as an economic force and economic power,” Mr. Trump said.After his burying-the-news preamble, Mr. Trump finally got to the point.“So, I’m going to be signing a national emergency,” Mr. Trump said, almost as an afterthought. Anticipating blowback to a measure that he was strongly warned against by Republican lawmakers and members of his own administration, Mr. Trump immediately explained that his predecessors had made national emergency declarations for “far less important things in some cases.”Employing a singsong voice that seemed meant to play down the significance of the separation of powers he will be testing, Mr. Trump walked through what he anticipated would be the legal ramifications of his order.“They will sue us in the Ninth Circuit even though it shouldn’t be there,” he said. “And we will possibly get a bad ruling. And then we will get another bad ruling. And then we will end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we will get a fair shake and win in the Supreme Court just like the ban.”The Rose Garden has become Mr. Trump’s chosen backdrop for pitching defeats as victories. After the House voted to repeal most of the Affordable Care Act in May 2017, Mr. Trump celebrated in the Rose Garden, with about 100 Republican lawmakers, taking a victory lap. Two months later, the measure failed in the Senate.Then in January, Mr. Trump stepped into the Rose Garden after meeting with Republican and Democratic leadership, declaring that he was willing to let a partial government shutdown last months, or even years, if that was what it took to obtain his requested $5.7 billion for a wall. And a few weeks later, he was back in the same spot, announcing that he was reopening the government for three weeks after caving to the Democrats on his previously nonnegotiable demand for wall money.Friday’s Rose Garden performance followed a similar script: defense by distraction.The bill Mr. Trump signed gave him just $1.375 billion for fencing and border security, but he claimed victory over Democrats because of other funds in the measure. “They didn’t even fight us on most of the stuff,” he said. “I don’t know what to do with all the money they are giving us. It’s crazy.” But Mr. Trump did acknowledge that “on the wall, they skimped.”He took not-at-all-veiled shots at Paul D. Ryan, the former House speaker, for failing to pass a bill when Republicans still controlled the House. “People that should have stepped up did not step up,” he said. When asked by a reporter if he was specifically referring to Mr. Ryan, the president responded: “Let’s not talk about it. What difference does it make?”Mr. Trump waffled on whether he knew Ann Coulter, the conservative commentator, who has been harshly critical of what she regards as his lack of commitment to building the wall, or whether he liked her.“I hardly know her,” he said, when asked if a cadre of right-wing personalities was influencing him on policy. “She is probably really nice. I just don’t have the time to speak to her.”Mr. Trump did say he had spoken to her, just not this year. He then added that Ms. Coulter, whom he unfollowed on Twitter in December, after months of criticism, “is off the reservation.”“Anybody that knows her understands that,” he continued. “I haven’t spoken to her. I don’t follow her.”Mr. Trump’s own advisers have admitted that the White House lost the public relations war surrounding the 35-day partial government shutdown, but he insisted that he had, in fact, won the messaging battle. He cited a 52 percent approval rating in a recent Rasmussen poll as an example that “people get what we are doing,” even though it was an outlier from other polls, in which he averages 40.8 percent, according to the RealClearPolitics website.“They really get it and I’m honored by it,” he added.Mr. Trump said President Barack Obama “told me he was so close to starting a big war with North Korea.” And he said that Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan, had nominated him for a Nobel Prize, although he admitted, “I’ll probably never get it but that’s O.K.”He called on his favorite “fake news” nemesis, Jim Acosta, CNN’s White House correspondent, who pressed the president on his claim that there is a security crisis at the southern border, despite the fact that illegal border crossings have fallen in recent years, and asked him to respond to critics who said he had “concocted” an emergency.In response, Mr. Trump pointed to the “angel moms,” as conservatives call the mothers of children who were killed by undocumented immigrants, in the front row.“I ask the angel moms, what do you think? Do you think I’m creating something? Ask these incredible women who lost their daughters and their sons,” Mr. Trump said.Throughout, Mr. Trump focused on grisly, specific stories while ignoring questions about why there needed to be a national emergency now, as opposed to two years ago. “That young wiseguy drove over and killed eight people,” he said of a terrorist attack in Manhattan in October 2017. “He had many people brought in because he was in the United States. It’s called chain migration.”All in all, it was a typical Trumpian performance that had too many tangents to focus on any one thing he said.“No notes and no net — it’s pure President Trump,” said one senior administration official describing the spectacle.Mr. Trump ended the news conference with a personal send-off to Mr. Barr, who was sworn in on Thursday. “I want to wish our new attorney general great luck and speed,” Mr. Trump said. “Enjoy your life.”"
405,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)The president announced on Wednesday that he would deliver his annual address after the government shutdown ends, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi said he wasn’t welcome to do so in the House while the government was partly closed.House Democrats have said they are prepared to roughly double the amount of money they had previously offered for border security, but not for a border wall and not until the government reopens.Explainer: We answered some common questions about the State of the Union address, including when and where it’s usually delivered.What’s next: The Senate plans to vote today on two competing proposals to end the shutdown, although neither is expected to pass. It now seems all but certain that 800,000 federal employees will miss another paycheck on Friday.Another angle: The unions representing 130,000 aviation workers called the shutdown an “unprecedented” and “unconscionable” safety threat.Juan Guaidó, cheered on by tens of thousands of demonstrators, declared himself Venezuela’s legitimate president on Wednesday, and the U.S., Canada and many Latin American nations recognized his leadership. It’s the biggest direct challenge yet to the authoritarian government of President Nicolás Maduro, whose re-election last year was widely regarded as rigged. Mr. Maduro has given American diplomats 72 hours to leave the country, but Washington said it would ignore the deadline.Looking ahead: The challenge to Mr. Maduro’s authority could lead to violent confrontations, and much will depend on how the military responds.Catch up: The crisis in Venezuela was years in the making. Here’s a guide to our coverage.Almost two months after a Chinese researcher announced that he had created the first genetically edited babies, scientists are trying to devise international standards that would prevent such experiments in the future.While most researchers agree that major health and science institutions should act quickly, they differ on the best approach.Background: The type of experiment Dr. He Jiankui conducted had never been done before and is illegal in many countries. Some U.S. researchers knew about the project but said they had been unable to stop Dr. He. Why it matters: Scientists fear that genetically edited babies could develop health problems that could be inherited by subsequent generations. They also worry about attempts to alter genes for physical features, intelligence or athletic prowess.President Trump’s former lawyer has indefinitely postponed an appearance before Congress next month because of verbal attacks on his family, his lawyer said. Mr. Cohen, who was sentenced last month to three years in prison for lying to Congress and other crimes, had originally pledged to give “a full and credible account” of his work for Mr. Trump.

Only in 2011, during the Arab Spring, was it canceled outright. This year is its 50th edition.As the oldest and largest book fair in the Middle East, it usually attracts at least a million visitors. Many go to snap up popular books at discounted prices.This year’s fair features 748 publishers from 35 countries. “I know kids who save up to buy bags’ worth of books,” said the Egyptian author Ahdaf Soueif.But the organizers have been criticized for moving the fair from the city center to a cavernous convention center in the suburbs. Some Egyptians say they can’t afford to reach the new site.Booksellers from a famous secondhand market in central Cairo are boycotting the event. They’ve come up with their own solution: a rival book fair."
406,"Only a handful of Democrats in Congress (and just one Democrat-adjacent presidential contender) identify as “socialist,” but they appear to be the chief targets of President Trump as he faces a confident Democratic opposition in the House of Representatives. “We are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” he said in his State of the Union address two weeks ago, declaring that “America will never be a socialist country.”The White House actually presaged this strategy last October, just before the midterm elections, in a report from its Council of Economic Advisers. They cite calls for single-payer health care and higher tax rates as evidence that “socialism is making a comeback in American political discourse,” with, they argue, dire consequences for the American economy. Next came the president’s address to Congress. And this week at a rally in El Paso, Tex., Trump went after the “radical left,” blasting a caricature of progressive climate policies. “I really don’t like their policy of taking away your car, of taking away your airplane flights, of ‘Let’s hop a train to California,’” he said, bizarrely adding that under the Green New Deal resolution introduced by liberal Democrats, “You’re not allowed to own cows anymore.”The clear expectation is that many or most Americans will recoil at any hint of “socialism,” either on principle or because of its association with Venezuela, which the administration has tried to elevate as a major adversary. That might have been true in Trump’s cultural and political touchstone, the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan’s hard-line anti-Communism defined American foreign and domestic policy. But in 2019, the Cold War is long over. The Soviet Union is a memory. And there is no comparable global ideological struggle over economic systems that might give weight to Trump’s rhetoric. There’s not much fear to monger. Instead, the president’s decision to make “socialism” his opponent might have the opposite effect, potentially bolstering the movement and its ideals.Because the Cold War is well in the rearview mirror of history, the United States also has a growing cohort of voters with no experience of its political environment. Thirty-five percent of voters in the 2018 elections were born in November 1973 or later, according to exit polls from CNN. The oldest in that group would have been teenagers during the fall of the Berlin Wall; the youngest were born nearly 10 years afterward. Making the ground even less fertile for the “socialist” charge is the fact of the 2008 recession, which produced worsening views of capitalism, especially among young Americans, who showed growing receptivity to views such as “basic health insurance is a right for all people” and “basic necessities, such as food and shelter, are a right that the government should provide to those unable to afford them.” In truth, these ideas fit well into the modern history of capitalist governance. But the politics of the past 10 years have given them a left-wing tinge.Specifically, in their vehement opposition to the Obama administration, conservatives narrowed “socialism” down to virtually any attempt to intervene in the economy on behalf of the broad public. The effort to save the American car industry? Socialist. Regulated markets to purchase health insurance? Socialist. Market-based measures for reducing carbon emissions? Also socialist.This aggressive labeling coincided with a rise in favorable attitudes toward socialism among Democrats. In 2010, according to Gallup, 53 percent said they had a positive view of socialism. In 2016, it was 58 percent. Some of this is the effect of Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign, which brought “socialism” back into mainstream political conversation. But conservative demonization of liberal Democratic policies as socialist played a major part as well.It’s worth comparing what conservatives call “socialism” to actual models for it, like this one proffered by the Czech thinker Radoslav Selucky and quoted by the American social critic Irving Howe in his 1985 book “Socialism and America:”No one in or around the Democratic Party has proposed the radical changes that might lead to such a state. No one has called for nationalization of major industries or creation of what the American democratic socialist Michael Harrington called “social property” — worker-owned firms and cooperatives governed by “the direct participation of the actual producers.”What we actually have are ideas like the “co-determination” plan proposed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, which would give workers a significant say in corporate governance — a major change from the status quo of shareholder-driven capitalism but a far cry from abolishing capitalist ownership itself. Similarly, the Medicare for All Act introduced by Bernie Sanders would move every American onto a new government plan but would also permit supplemental private insurance and retain the present system of privately owned hospitals and other medical providers.Even the Green New Deal falls within the tradition established by its namesake, which itself was attacked as a harbinger of socialism. It provides new economic guarantees to Americans while substantially altering, but not fundamentally rearranging, power relationships within the economy. Reform, not revolution.Having said that, profound changes in American society since the 1930s may give the Green New Deal less transformative potential than its predecessor. The social base of the original New Deal was a large and powerful labor movement with the capacity to, as the historian Ira Katznelson wrote in a 1989 essay, “disrupt capitalism at the point of production” and potentially “lead a social democratic breakthrough in American politics.” The egalitarian vistas of the Green New Deal may ultimately be compromised by the absence of such a movement, although its ambition could galvanize the constituencies that might make such a movement possible.But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. At this moment, the proposed policies of the Democratic Party — from modest initiatives to incentivize savings to expansive programs for guaranteed employment — aren’t socialism. Even if they were, Americans are less afraid of the label than one might think: 37 percent say they have a positive image of socialism, a two-point increase from 2016. Given the continued popularity of Bernie Sanders and the rise of politicians like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, these numbers have room to grow. And those who hope to see them grow almost certainly got an assist from Trump when he elevated the term in his State of the Union address.The mechanism is simple: Trump is unpopular and drives Americans away from his positions. According to a Gallup survey last summer, after almost a year and a half of anti-immigration rhetoric from the president, 75 percent of Americans said immigration was a “good thing” and 29 percent said immigration levels should “decrease.” Most wanted either stasis or an increase in the number of immigrants. Just this January, in a poll taken during the partial government shutdown, 58 percent of Americans said they opposed “substantial expansion” of a border wall between the United States and Mexico, a direct rebuke to the president.If anything can put socialism in a more positive light, it is Trump raging against it. Which means conservatives and Republicans may want to think a little harder before they embrace a campaign strategy that relies on him for messaging. If “socialism” is like every other idea Trump has attacked and disdained, then the Republican Party should prepare for even more Americans embracing the term — and the ideas that come with it."
407,"PINE RIDGE, S.D. — Ella Red Cloud-Yellow Horse, marooned for days by a blizzard and then a flood, needed to get out. Supplies at her house were running low. She had come down with pneumonia. She had a chemotherapy appointment to keep.But her long driveway was blocked by mountains of mud — impassable even for an ambulance or a tractor.So Ms. Red Cloud-Yellow Horse, 59, set off toward the road on foot. She fell repeatedly, almost got swept away in the current of a creek, and became stuck in the mud. Finally, more than an hour later, she made it the half-mile to the highway where she was picked up.“I couldn’t breathe,” she said, “but I knew I needed to get to the hospital.”Such stories are startlingly common these days on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota — a stunning stretch of land larger than Delaware — as an overwhelming bout of snow and flooding has set off a humanitarian disaster that seems unlikely to abate soon.With some residents approaching two weeks stranded in their homes, and with emergency rations able to reach parts of the back country only by horse, boat and helicopter, Pine Ridge remains in a state of shock and triage.Officials with the Oglala Sioux Tribe, which administers the reservation, say they lack the training, manpower and equipment needed to deal with such a large-scale crisis. And there’s a pervasive sense on Pine Ridge, a place of long-strained relations with the state and federal governments, that help has been woefully slow to arrive, and that few people beyond the reservation know or care much about its plight.“This is a state of emergency right now,” said Henry Red Cloud, whose family’s losses in the flooding include five homes, a forklift, a truck, a van and the building where his solar energy business was based.Mr. Red Cloud now rides a flat-bottomed boat each night to the one home on his family’s property that is not a total loss. “What we need to be doing is building sandbag walls — not a southern border wall,” he said.Pine Ridge was far from alone in being hit with damaging quantities of snow and water this month. Huge portions of the Midwest were swallowed by rivers in the last 10 days, with devastating consequences for farms, roads and small riverfront towns. So far, at least three people are confirmed to have died, and the affected states have estimated that they have suffered more than a billion dollars in damage and economic harm.But while conversations about recovery were already underway in the hardest-hit portions of Nebraska and Iowa, where most roads have reopened and many rivers have started to recede, Pine Ridge, with a population of about 20,000, remained in a state of hour-to-hour chaos. Some of the tribe’s scarce heavy equipment was lost in the mud. Jail inmates were enlisted to fill sandbags. New parents worried as they ran low on infant formula.Unlike in Nebraska, where the National Guard rescued 111 people, including some by helicopter and boat, outside help for Pine Ridge was conspicuously scarce at first. South Dakota’s governor, Kristi Noem, has been seen by many Pine Ridge officials and residents as slow to respond. But Ms. Noem, who visited the reservation on Saturday, said that the tribe had only made formal requests for help in recent days, which she quickly approved. Since then, Ms. Noem said, the state had sent ATVs, a boat rescue team and a small group of National Guard soldiers to distribute drinking water.“When we became aware is when we responded,” Ms. Noem said in an interview after her visit.The reservation, in the southwestern part of the state, is among the most scenic places in the Great Plains states. Pine-crested buttes punctuate the skyline, open prairie stretches for miles, and creeks wind through pastures and yards. But the vast distances, scattered population and relatively untamed terrain can make it difficult to reach people in blizzards or floods.The tribal-led relief effort on Pine Ridge has been mired in challenges. Though employees pulled marathon shifts and slept in their work vehicles, there were simply not enough people or equipment to reach everyone needing help, residents said. Julian Bear Runner, the Oglala Sioux Tribe’s newly elected president, said many had voiced frustration with the tribal government’s response.“People are getting angry,” Mr. Bear Runner said, “and that’s understandable.” But he added, “We’re doing the best we can with what little we have.”He said resources had been stretched so thin that he had slept on his office floor most nights since the storm, and had driven his own pickup truck to respond to calls for help because there were too few tribal workers.“If we would have had state-of-the-art equipment, if we would have had adequate manpower, we could have gotten a lot done,” said Mr. Bear Runner, who said the state assistance, though late to arrive, was greatly appreciated.Tribal officials said the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs had also provided equipment and manpower to help.The crisis on Pine Ridge is a collision of nature, poverty and inadequate infrastructure. No sooner were Pine Ridge’s highways mostly cleared of snow than temperatures shot up, and the rush of newly melted water overflowed from creeks and rivers. The flooding — the worst in at least a generation, several residents said — turned the rugged dirt roads that many people live along into a liquefied mud soup.Adding to the urgency, late last week about 8,000 residents lost drinking water.“It’s gotten worse,” Mr. Bear Runner, the tribal president, said on Friday.Pine Ridge is a place accustomed to struggle, and its people have had well-publicized battles with alcoholism and teen suicide. Half the reservation’s residents live in poverty, according to the Census Bureau, and the unemployment rate is 20 percent, compared with about 3 percent for South Dakota as a whole. Many people on Pine Ridge live in aging houses a mile or more from a highway, and some depend on wood-burning stoves to keep warm.“The lack of resources, the lack of water, lack of transportation and the lack of facilities — this really compounds all of the issues,” said Valentina Merdanian, a tribal council member who on Friday was fielding calls from stranded constituents and trying to organize rescue crews.In the few quiet moments, some people expressed worry that the treacherous conditions could become a new normal. “With climate change, it’s getting worse and worse,” said Robert Pille, who had to leave his home because of the floods. “This is going to be a regular thing.”Mr. Bear Runner said there had been no time to tally up how many buildings were destroyed, how many rescues had been made or how many people remained unreached.“We didn’t have the proper training for the E.M.S.; we didn’t know what to do,” said Garfield Steele, the president of the reservation’s Wounded Knee District, the site of the 1890 massacre of Native Americans by United States soldiers and the 1973 siege by members of the American Indian Movement.Governor Noem, who took office in January, has a strained relationship with her state’s Native American nations, some of which requested that their tribal flags not be displayed at the State Capitol after she introduced and lawmakers passed a set of bills this month that would restrict protests.Despite those tensions, several people on the reservation said they would have liked to see a more robust National Guard and state government presence during the storm response. As members of the tribe volunteered to cook meals and unload food delivery trucks on Friday, and as people checked on older neighbors who lived far from the highway, some of the biggest needs remained unmet.“We just need the technical skills,” said Mary Tobacco, who was helping lead recovery efforts, but who became stranded herself on Friday as rising water made it impossible to leave her home on a butte. (The water was moving too fast, she said, to make it out in her kayak.)Tribal officials were still working to determine whether as many as four more deaths in the past two weeks could be attributed to the storm, including some involving patients who needed medical help and could not be reached by ambulance. The tribe’s police chief, Robert Ecoffey, said on Friday that it was not known whether those people would have survived if an ambulance had reached them.In the meantime, some on Pine Ridge were hunkering down for what could be weeks more with little or no access to the outside world.Bernadine Rowland, stranded since March 12, said Saturday that she and her grandchildren had remained in good spirits and had passed the days by watching Netflix and YouTube videos. But her pantry had started to get bare — only two bags of beans left, plus some oatmeal and rice — and an attempted food delivery by horseback had to be aborted Friday afternoon because a creek that had to be crossed was running too high.Just before sunset Friday night, the horseback riders came back, this time by canoe, carrying big plastic bags full of macaroni and cheese, toilet paper, Hamburger Helper and canned pasta.“It was a relief,” Ms. Rowland said. “We’ll have something to last us for a while.”"

Early transmissions were often of poor quality, so, to avoid misunderstandings, spelling alphabets were developed. Also called phonetic alphabets, they replaced letters with words that started with the corresponding letter.By World War II, the U.S. and British militaries had settled on a standard: Able for A, Baker for B … and Roger for R. (Previously, the British had used Robert.)In the 1950s, a new alphabet — commonly referred to as the NATO phonetic alphabet — was adopted, and is now the most widely used. It replaced Roger with Romeo. (I’m planning to stick with Roger.)"
409,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. The U.S. Senate is set to rebuke President Trump, a step toward a possible H.I.V. cure, and a successful return in Venezuela. Here’s the latest: Senate Republicans are likely to contribute enough votes for approval of a House-passed measure that would undo President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency for allocating money to his promised border wall. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, conceded that he could not stop it. And Jerrold Nadler, a powerful House lawmaker, issued scores of demands for documents from Mr. Trump’s cabinet, aides, businesses and associates, revealing a broad Democratic investigation into possible obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power by Mr. Trump and his administration.  What’s next: The topics covered by the requests include the firing of James Comey as F.B.I. director and Mr. Trump’s apparent dangling of pardons and threatening of witnesses. Mr. Nadler could follow up with subpoenas to compel testimony, but those could be challenged in court. Though a Senate vote to overturn the state of national emergency is virtually certain to meet with a presidential veto, the stunning rebuke would signal that Mr. Trump’s grip on his own party was weakening. It could also strengthen court challenges to the emergency declaration.For just the second time since the global epidemic began, a patient appears to have been cured of infection with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Scientists had long tried to duplicate the procedure that led to the first long-term remission 12 years ago. And with the so-called London patient, they seem to have succeeded.This confirms that a cure for H.I.V. infection is possible, if difficult, researchers said. Both milestones resulted from bone-marrow transplants that were given to infected patients, but for treating cancer, not H.I.V.Prospects: Bone-marrow transplantation, a risky procedure, is unlikely to be a realistic treatment option in the near future. But researchers say they see a path opening to a possible cure. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of the company’s founder, has been staying at her luxurious six-bedroom house in Vancouver since being granted bail in December. And she has been allowed to go shopping or even travel to nearby Richmond, albeit while under surveillance.Her conditions contrast sharply with those of two Canadian men detained in China in apparent retaliation for Ms. Meng’s arrest, a disparity that has touched on a nerve among Vancouver residents.The Chinese authorities on Monday accused both men of espionage, ratcheting up tensions between the two countries, just days before a Canadian court is set to begin a hearing on whether Ms. Meng should be extradited to the U.S., where she is wanted on fraud charges.In other Huawei news: The company is set to file a lawsuit against the American government for banning federal agencies from using the company’s products, according to two people familiar with the matter.

Mr. Maduro’s government has said Mr. Guaidó violated restrictions on his travel and could face arrest. But it may hold back and hope that protests simply “peter out,” an analyst in Caracas said. Response: As Mr. Guaidó flew into the country, a number of European diplomats had come to Simón Bolívar Airport to offer their support.

For Saturnalia, a predecessor of Christmas, it was not a plastic baby but a fava bean. Whoever received the slice containing the bean ruled the day.But the Romans also associated fava beans with death. That might be because of a genetic disorder, most common in the Mediterranean, that creates an often lethal bean allergy.So perhaps eating a cake with a fava bean was a morbid joke, a moment on the edge, or what could be thought of as letting the good times roll.James K.

410,"WASHINGTON — House and Senate negotiators on Monday night agreed in principle to provide $1.375 billion for fencing and other physical barriers at the Mexican border, part of a broader agreement that would stave off another partial government shutdown without funding President Trump’s wall.The agreement would allow for 55 miles of new bollard fencing, with some restrictions on location based on community and environmental concerns, according to two congressional aides, who requested anonymity to disclose details of the private negotiations. That is a fraction of the more than 200 miles of steel-and-concrete wall that Mr. Trump demanded — and 10 miles less than negotiators agreed on last summer, before Democrats took control of the House.The deal, which must still pass the House and the Senate, and secure Mr. Trump’s signature, came together just before Mr. Trump, framed by banners emblazoned with “Finish the Wall” at an event in El Paso, doubled down on his demands.“We’re building the wall anyway,” he told the crowd, saying that aides had told him that the negotiators had made progress.The funding for 55 miles of new fencing is a figure far lower than the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump had demanded and marginally less than the $1.6 billion for 65 miles of pedestrian fencing in the bill that the Senate Appropriations Committee had passed last year.In December, the president, concerned about reneging on his signature campaign promise, refused to sign onto that legislation, forcing the nation’s longest government shutdown.The negotiators also agreed to reduce the number of migrants and undocumented immigrants who can be held in detention. Democrats’ demand for a limit on how much detention space could be used for unauthorized immigrants arrested within the United States had threatened to derail the negotiations over the weekend, but lawmakers agreed to waive the demand.Instead, lawmakers agreed to adhere to levels, set by a number of detention beds, established in the previous budget. That would fund 40,520 beds, a decrease of about 17 percent from current levels, which Immigration and Customs Enforcement reached in recent months only by surpassing its funding caps.Privately, Democratic aides admitted the provision could have no impact on the number of beds ICE assigned for detainees. There is nothing to prevent Trump administration officials from funding a greater number of slots in excess of the lower target number, and then securing congressional outlays to cover those expenses, as ICE officials have done routinely in recent years, the aides said.Beyond the border barriers, the agreement, which primarily funds the Department of Homeland Security, would provide $1.7 billion more for border security, including technology at ports of entry, more officers and humanitarian aid.[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]The Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees announced the agreement, which includes seven unfinished spending bills, after three private meetings on Monday. Disaster relief for areas affected by storms and natural disasters last year will not be included, and lawmakers said they would address it separately.It is expected to be finalized as early as Tuesday, well before the Friday deadline when funding would again lapse for a number of federal agencies. With fears of another damaging shutdown, lawmakers seemed confident that they had the support of party leadership and that Mr. Trump would be willing to sign the agreement.“We think so,” Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told reporters when asked about the likelihood of the president’s signature. “We hope so.”“The specter of another government shutdown this close, I thought tonight we didn’t want that to happen,” he added later.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, had urged him to “get it done” in negotiations, Mr. Shelby said. Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York and the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, said she had been in close communication with Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and expected her support.“She has confidence that I made the right decision,” Ms. Lowey told reporters.White House officials did not respond to requests for comment about the terms of the agreement, and the president’s conservative allies on Monday night were already denouncing the deal. Sean Hannity, a Fox News commentator and a confidant of the president’s, called it “a garbage compromise.”Pentagon officials spent the weekend readying for the possibility that Mr. Trump would declare a national emergency, something that his allies said he is still considering as a means to secure border wall funding.But Republican lawmakers remained optimistic that their agreement would hold.“This has been a difficult one,” said Representative Kay Granger of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee. “I think everyone will say, ‘Good work.’”A specific point of contention had been the number of detention beds under the control of ICE, which had stalled talks over the weekend.House Democrats, urged on by immigration rights groups, had pushed hard, hoping to leverage White House fears of another damaging shutdown into a softening of the president’s hard-line immigration policies that they say have torn apart families, wrenched productive workers from the communities they have lived in for years and infused a heartlessness into official American immigration policy.The Democrats’ goal was to cut the overall number of detention beds, including those occupied by asylum seekers and people caught at the border, from its current level of around 49,000 to 34,000, the number funded during the Obama administration, Democratic aides said. That, they say, would end sweeps and roundups, and force ICE to focus on pursuing hardened criminals.“We started at zero on the wall, and we compromised a lot after that, and we are now asking them to change, too,” said Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, Democrat of California and a member of the 17-member House and Senate conference committee tasked with hammering out a compromise.Mr. Trump caught on. When Mr. Shelby presented him with the Democrats’ demand, he rejected it quickly, according to two people briefed on the exchange.“These are the people coming into our country that we are holding and we don’t want in our country,” the president told reporters at the White House on Monday. “That’s why they don’t want to give us what we call ‘the beds.’ It’s much more complicated than beds, but we call them ‘the beds.’”In private, Republicans responded with a plan that would exempt many detained immigrants from the cap, including those people either charged with or convicted of crimes, including misdemeanor drug offenses and violent felonies. That, in turn, was rejected by Democrats.“You have ICE agents picking up mothers and fathers and children in their own neighborhoods. That’s why the beds issue is so much more important than the wall,” said Ms. Roybal-Allard, whose Los Angeles-area district is 85 percent Hispanic, the highest percentage of any district in the country.The number of beds occupied by detainees fluctuates over time, influenced by a variety of factors, including ICE enforcement policies and the flow of migrants at the border with Mexico. The rate of that flow is unpredictable and determined by factors such as the performance of the economies north and south of the border, crime, gang activity and the business practices of coyotes paid to transport migrants from Mexico and Central America to California and the Southwest.The number of monthly apprehensions of migrants at the border has averaged 25,000 to 40,000 for most of the past decade, but has risen to about 50,000 over the past several months, according to statistics compiled by the Department of Homeland Security.If ICE does not have enough room to place individuals and family members they detain, they must loosen their enforcement actions, creating a powerful motive for new migrants to enter the country illegally, Trump administration officials say.“You cannot have border security, without strong interior enforcement, whether there is a wall there or not,” said Matt Albence, the deputy director of ICE, on Monday in a conference call with reporters.Republicans closed ranks to blast the plan.“This is a poison pill that no administration, not this one, not the previous one, should ever accept,” Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor. “Imagine the absurdity of this: House Democrats want to set a limit on how many criminal aliens our government can detain.”"
411,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. The E.U. gives its terms for postponing Brexit, digital mercenaries are open for business, and waters recede in Mozambique. Here’s the latest: Turning down terms requested by Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, E.U. leaders on Thursday agreed to extend the deadline for Britain’s looming March 29 exit from the bloc to May 22 if next week Mrs. May can persuade lawmakers in Parliament to come around to her plan for leaving, which they have roundly rejected twice. If she cannot persuade lawmakers to accept her plan, Mrs. May will get a shorter delay in exiting the E.U. — until April 12. Mrs. May accepted the terms. And Britain could stay in the bloc much longer if it decided it needs more time for a bigger rethink. If Britain were to get the longer delay, it would have to take part in European Parliament elections in May. What’s next? In a news conference after the E.U.’s decision, Mrs. May seemed to rule out a long delay, arguing that it would be “absurd” for British voters to participate in E.U. elections. She also said she would not consider revoking Brexit. The options seemed to be dwindling to Mrs. May’s plan; a vote on a so-called soft Brexit that would retain close ties to the E.U.; or crashing out of the bloc without a deal. Follow our correspondent Stephen Castle on Twitter for the latest updates.Word of warning: In a rare joint statement, the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress said that a no-deal Brexit “would be felt by generations to come” and called the current situation “a national emergency,” with the risk of that outcome soaring.While families were still mourning their loved ones killed off Indonesia in the Lion Air plane crash in October, they were herded into a hotel conference room and told to sign a document to receive a government-mandated compensation of 1.3 billion rupiah, about $91,600, for loss of life.But the payment came with conditions. Many say they weren’t allowed time to study the document and didn’t know it included a clause prohibiting them from suing the carrier, its financial backers or Boeing.Those conditions are now being questioned by legal experts. An Indonesian aviation act from 2011 specifies that heirs who receive government-mandated payments shouldn’t have limits on their right to sue the carrier or other entities involved.Boeing: The Boeing model, a 737 Max 8, also crashed in Ethiopia this month. The two doomed jets lacked optional safety features that Boeing sold separately at an additional cost. Now the aircraft manufacturer is making one of those features standard as part of a fix to get the planes into the air again.Small countries, corporations and even wealthy individuals all have a new weapon at their disposal: privatized spying through companies that hire former intelligence operatives from around the world.This growing and barely governed world of digital combat has enabled governments to hack terrorist groups and drug cartels, but is also being used for more sinister impulses, like targeting activists and journalists, with the sophistication that was once the preserve of major world powers.The F.B.I. is now investigating one of these firms, DarkMatter, after a former N.S.A. hacker working there grew concerned about its activities, a twist that reflects the murky new industry.Takeaway: The rapid expansion of these private spying companies has prompted concerns about a dangerous and chaotic future in which even governments with small budgets can inflict immense damage.How we know: Our monthslong investigation into the secret world of this high-tech battleground was based on interviews with current and former hackers for governments and private companies, as well as a review of documents.With the waters from Cyclone Idai starting to recede, those staggered in its wake were trying to take full stock of its effects. Mozambique’s death toll had risen to more than 200; 139 were reportedly killed in Zimbabwe, and another 56 in Malawi. Hundreds of thousands of people in areas that were already very poor have been displaced. But there was good news. Waters were said to be retreating “quickly,” allowing recovery workers to reach communities that had been cut off. Impact: Many villagers in Mozambique work in machambas — farm fields handed down from the nation’s former colonial power, Portugal — and many are subsistence farmers. Homes, clothes and crops crucial to livelihoods have vanished. Aid groups estimate that 90 percent of Beira, a port city with about a half-million people, was destroyed.How to help: Here are some of the aid organizations delivering relief.Israel: President Trump said the U.S. should recognize Israel’s authority over the Golan Heights, which the country seized from Syria in 1967 and has since become one of the world’s most disputed territories. The president’s announcement on Twitter points to a significant shift in decades-long American policy.Asylum dispute: The Home Office in Britain, which is responsible for handling immigration, cited biblical verses about vengeance to deny asylum to an Iranian man who said he had converted from Islam to Christianity because it was a “peaceful” religion.Netherlands: Dutch prosecutors said they would bring terrorism charges against a man suspected of killing three people on a tram in Utrecht, in addition to multiple counts of murder or manslaughter. The police said they were still investigating the motives. One other man remained in custody in connection with the attack. U.S. flooding: Twenty-five states are at serious risk of flooding this spring, federal scientists said, with Nebraska and other Midwestern states already reeling from record-breaking late-winter floods.Britain: The police and counterterrorism officials are investigating vandalism at five mosques in Birmingham, home to one of the country’s biggest Muslim populations. New Zealand: At least two people have been charged with sharing video of the Christchurch mosque attacks that the gunman broadcast via social media; a law forbids dissemination or possession of material depicting extreme violence and terrorism. Others could face related charges under a human rights law that forbids incitement of racial disharmony. Nirav Modi: The Indian jewelry designer to the stars was arrested in London in connection with a nearly $3 billion bank fraud in India. India’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party immediately turned the news into campaign fodder, claiming credit for the arrest.Kurt Vonnegut: Published 50 years ago this month, Vonnegut’s “Slaughterhouse-Five” made the 47-year-old writer a star, but it was also an act of self-therapy by a man who had what now would probably be considered PTSD after the bombing of Dresden, Germany.

But the phrase is also used metaphorically to refer to a character-defining political issue, and it has been popping up in coverage of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.The chemical test, in use since the Middle Ages, employs a dye derived from lichens to determine whether a solution is more acidic or alkaline.The phrase, which developed its political connotation in the 20th century, appeared in The New York Times at least as early as 1950, when it described NATO and the Marshall Plan as “the litmus test for distinguishing between Communists and supporters of the United States.”This year, “litmus test” has appeared in The Times to refer to marijuana legalization, the proposed border wall and universal health care.Chris Stanford, on the briefings team, wrote today’s Back Story.Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.Check out this page to find a Morning Briefing for your region.

President Trump and Democratic leaders held a contentious meeting on Wednesday over the partial government shutdown, which is nearing the two-week mark and has affected 800,000 federal employees. Mr. Trump was adamant in his demands for $5.6 billion in funding for a border wall, and he rejected Democrats’ proposals to fund the government while the two sides negotiated further. The Democrats refused to increase their offer of $1.3 billion for border security.Mr. Trump asked congressional leaders to return to the White House on Friday to resume talks, an official said.Go deeper: Nancy Pelosi is poised to reclaim the title of speaker of the House today. How she deals with Mr. Trump will define her tenure.The Daily: In today’s episode, Senator Chuck Schumer discusses the shutdown and the era of divided government. Women who worked for Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign in 2016 say that complaints of sexual harassment, demeaning treatment and pay disparities went unaddressed. One former staffer said she was marginalized after refusing a manager’s invitation to his hotel room. Asked if he knew about the staff complaints, Mr. Sanders told CNN, “I was a little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case.” He added: “I certainly apologize to any woman who felt she was not treated appropriately, and of course if I run we will do better the next time.”Why it matters: The Vermont senator’s perceived failure to address the issues could hinder any potential plans for another run in 2020.China has reached a milestone in space exploration, landing a vehicle on the far side of the moon for the first time in history, the country’s space agency announced this morning. The probe, called Chang’e-4 after the moon goddess in Chinese mythology, made the first in a series of planned missions to make China a contender in the space race. Experts say the country is quickly catching up in its capacity for space exploration, and could soon challenge the U.S. for supremacy in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and other fields.Looking ahead: The side of the moon we never see from Earth contains secrets about our solar system’s early days. Here’s what China and the world hope to find.The Silicon Valley giant cut its revenue forecast for the first time in 16 years on Wednesday, citing poor iPhone sales in China. The company said it expected revenue of about $84 billion in the quarter that ended Saturday, down from a previous estimate of $89 billion to $93 billion. That would be a decline of nearly 5 percent from the same quarter a year earlier.Reaction: The surprise announcement set off a broad retreat in global markets today.

How do you acknowledge a colleague’s message? After a recent digital exchange, this writer looked into the history of one of his favored responses: “Roger that.”In the days of Morse code, an R was sent to indicate that a message had been received.That system evolved with the introduction of radio communications. Early transmissions were often of poor quality, so, to avoid misunderstandings, spelling alphabets were developed. Also called phonetic alphabets, they replaced letters with words that started with the corresponding letter.By World War II, the U.S. and British militaries had settled on a standard: Able for A, Baker for B … and Roger for R. (Previously, the British had used Robert.)In the 1950s, a new alphabet — commonly referred to as the NATO phonetic alphabet — was adopted, and is now the most widely used. It replaced Roger with Romeo. (I’m planning to stick with Roger.)"
413,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest._____1. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked President Trump to reschedule the State of the Union address or deliver it in writing, citing security concerns from the government shutdown.The president’s State of the Union address is one of the highest-stakes events for federal law enforcement each year, with the leadership of all three branches of government gathering in one place. The Secret Service, which leads security, has been affected by the shutdown.The speech is scheduled for Jan. 29, and the invitation to deliver the address is traditionally at the speaker’s discretion. Above, Ms. Pelosi on Capitol Hill today.Democrats stood firm at a White House meeting aimed at resolving the shutdown impasse, telling Mr. Trump that he must abandon his demand for funding for a border wall in exchange for reopening the government._____2. Prime Minister Theresa May narrowly survived a vote of no confidence in Parliament a day after it rejected her Brexit plan.The vote was 325 to 306. Many lawmakers from her own party who had opposed her plan nonetheless voted to support her government, underscoring the complex politics around Britain’s split from the E.U.Mrs. May’s failure to corral her own party has upended Britain’s political system, where prime ministers typically exercise iron-fisted control over Parliament.There is growing speculation Mrs. May could ask to postpone Britain’s divorce from the bloc. And the opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, faces mounting calls for a second Brexit referendum._____3. An Islamic State attack in Syria killed four Americans. Two troops, a contractor and a civilian were among 15 people killed in the suicide bombing. Three American troops also were injured.The attack targeted a restaurant in the northern city of Manbij where American soldiers would sometimes stop to eat during patrols, residents said. Above, U.S. troops gathered at the scene of the attack.The bombing came just weeks after President Trump ordered a U.S. withdrawal from Syria and declared the Islamic State defeated. Before the attack, two American troops had been killed in the country since the U.S. sent forces there in 2015._____4. The death toll rose to 21 in the terrorist attack at a luxury hotel and office complex in Nairobi, Kenya’s capital. The victims included an American and a British national.Gunfire could still be heard early Wednesday, a day after Shabab militants first stormed the complex, above. The attack began Tuesday when four men reportedly jumped out of a white car, opened fire at a security checkpoint and blasted their way in.Kenya’s president said in a speech to the nation that all the attackers had been “eliminated” and that the security operation was complete. The siege underscored the persistence of the Shabab, an offshoot of Al Qaeda based in Somalia._____5. Senate Democrats fell short in an effort to rebuke the Trump administration on its Russia sanctions policy — but picked up significant Republican support along the way.Eleven Republicans joined Democrats voting to enforce sanctions against the corporate empire of an influential ally of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, but the effort needed three more votes to clear the 60-vote threshold required to advance.The sanctions will most likely be lifted this week as part of a deal negotiated by the Treasury Department. Democrats had argued the agreement let Moscow off easy at a moment when serious questions remained about the relationship between Mr. Trump and Russia.We also looked back at the five meetings the president had with Mr. Putin since taking office. Each has fueled suspicions about their relationship because of the secretive way they were conducted. Above, Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin in Helsinki._____6. For years, the company that makes OxyContin has tried to depict its owners, the Sackler family, as removed from day-to-day operations.But a new court filing contends that family members actually directed years of efforts to mislead doctors and patients about the dangers of the powerful opioid painkiller.When evidence of growing OxyContin abuse became clear in the early 2000s, one of them advised pushing blame onto people who had become addicted.“We have to hammer on abusers in every way possible,” Richard Sackler wrote in an email in 2001, when he was president of the company, Purdue Pharma. “They are the culprits and the problem. They are reckless criminals.”_____7. No New York culinary experience is shared more widely than the slice of pizza.The origins of New York-style pizza date to the early 20th century, when large waves of Italian immigrants settled in the city. We went back into our archives to see how the slice made pizza the perfect New York City food.In another ode to New York, our chief fashion critic bids farewell to the city’s shuttered department stores. “Losing them, we lose a piece of our own past too,” Vanessa Friedman writes._____8. And here’s some food for thought on the history of America’s relationship with immigration.A giant outpouring of anti-immigrant sentiment — in reaction to the mass arrival of Europeans at the start of the 20th century — drove Prohibition, Lisa McGirr, a professor of history at Harvard, argues in our Op-Ed pages. Above, a barrel of confiscated illegal beer is poured down a drain in 1921.And perceived failures in enforcing the law helped empower the so-called second Ku Klux Klan, which, she says, “drew in a bumper crop of new recruits with their anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant, white supremacist message.”But the heightened nativism, she concludes, also made American immigrants, their children and their allies reach out “for a fuller place in national political life to forge a more pluralist, tolerant, equitable country.”_____9. What do the Oscars gain by losing a host?Kevin Hart was going to M.C. the show, but he stepped down after old tweets surfaced that used homophobic slurs, and now the Oscars are likely forgo a host entirely.Our Carpetbagger columnist weighs the pros and cons — including the promise of a shorter program — of what he calls “the most overrated and underrated part of any Oscar telecast.”Separately, “Project Blue Book” is a popular new series on History about an Air Force program to investigate and debunk U.F.O.s. Two reporters who have long worked on the serious side of U.F.O.s. watched the first six episodes for us._____10. Finally, when the college gymnast Katelyn Ohashi’s floor routine went viral this week, it wasn’t just because of her flawless technique.It was also her unabashed joy — helped by music from Michael Jackson — that drew in millions of viewers.Injuries and unhappiness with gymnastics once derailed Ms. Ohashi’s career. But going to U.C.L.A. made all the difference, she said: “My teammates and my coaches have all allowed me to step into my individuality, and not be defined by just being a gymnast.”We hope you stick your landing tonight._____Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

414,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. British lawmakers dealt a crushing defeat to Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan for leaving the European Union.The 432-to-202 vote was the biggest loss in the House of Commons in recent history for a prime minister. The turn of events thrusts Britain into further political chaos just 10 weeks before the country’s scheduled exit from the E.U. Mrs. May above center.The opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn put forward a motion of no confidence in Mrs. May, which Parliament will debate and vote on Wednesday. As things stand, the prime minister must return to Parliament by Monday to present a backup withdrawal plan.If nothing is approved by March 29, Britain will make a “no-deal” exit from the E.U., which lawmakers have warned could be chaotic and pose grave economic risks. Here are some other ways everything could shake out._____2. President Trump’s nominee for attorney general assured senators at his confirmation hearing that he would allow the special counsel, Robert Mueller, to finish the Russia investigation, and promised to withstand any political pressure from the White House.“It is in the best interest of everyone — the president, Congress and, most importantly, the American people — that this matter be resolved by allowing the special counsel to complete his work,” William Barr said of the inquiry, which is believed to be in its final stages.With Republicans firmly in control of the Senate, his confirmation to lead the Justice Department appears to be on track.Mr. Barr, who also served as attorney general under President George Bush, is known for his unusually expansive views of executive power. But during the hearing, he qualified some of his beliefs, emphasizing legal limits on the presidency and the independence of law enforcement._____3. House Democrats were a no-show at a White House lunch as both sides continue to search for a compromise to end the government shutdown.The Democrats’ absence was the latest indication that the party is still standing firm against Mr. Trump’s demand for $5.7 billion for a border wall. Above, demonstrators at a rally organized by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.With the shutdown in its 25th day, the Federal Aviation Administration recalled thousands of furloughed workers to address air safety concerns. (They will work without pay.) And the government closings are weighing heavily on young people caught up in the impasse.From the border, our journalists sent in their latest dispatch as they drive the length of the approximately 1,900-mile U.S.-Mexico frontier._____4. The House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a resolution condemning white supremacy, reflecting anger in both parties over comments by Representative Steve King of Iowa questioning why white supremacy is considered offensive.Mr. King, who has a history of making racist remarks and insulting immigrants, was stripped of two House committee seats Monday, after comments he made to The Times: “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?”Mr. King, above, took to the House floor to say he would vote in support of the resolution, which called out his remarks specifically. Only one representative voted against it, saying “anything short of a censure” was shallow.Separately, a federal judge blocked the Commerce Department from adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 census. The case will most likely reach the Supreme Court before the printing of census forms begins this summer._____5. Militants attacked a hotel and office complex in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, with a blast and heavy gunfire.At least one person was confirmed killed and 15 wounded in the assault, but the death toll was expected to rise, with some news outlets reporting seven dead. Above, after a blast at the hotel.The assailants were identified as members of the Shabab, an Islamist extremist group with ties to Al Qaeda. The attack came on the eve of a verdict in the trial of three men accused of helping the group in a deadly assault on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi more than five years ago._____6. The most incendiary accusation yet at the El Chapo trial: A witness said the former Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto had taken a $100 million bribe from the infamous crime lord.The stunning testimony was delivered in a New York courtroom by Alex Cifuentes Villa, a Colombian pictured above with El Chapo. The two worked closely together from 2007 to 2013, when they were hiding from the authorities in the Sierra Madre mountains. Mr. Cifuentes said Mr. Peña Nieto had reached out around 2012, asking for $250 million to call off the manhunt.There have been hints at high-level corruption since the start of the trial in November, including payoffs from traffickers to the Mexican police and public officials — but no accusations at this level before._____7. When Andy Murray announced he planned to retire from tennis this year, the most distinct voices in the chorus praising him were female.Over more than a decade as a top-10 player, Mr. Murray has used his position to be an advocate for women in tennis in ways large and small. He became the highest-profile men’s player to hire a female coach, and he has made a point of correcting reporters when they omit women from statistics.“Your greatest impact on the world may be yet to come,” the tennis great Billie Jean King wrote on Twitter. “Your voice for equality will inspire future generations.”_____8. When Sphen and Magic became a couple, Australia had just gone through a bitter battle to legalize gay marriage. Suddenly, the country’s biggest animal celebrities were two gay penguins.And after another couple in the colony started neglecting an egg, penguin keepers at the Sea Life Sydney Aquarium figured they would give it to Sphen and Magic.Their chick — called Sphengic — hatched in October and is now waddling around its ice enclosure near the harbor.Our reporter took a look at Sphen and Magic, their courtship, parenting skills and what they mean to Australia._____9.

415,"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.Hi, everybody! Things have been heating up around here, especially in the ocean. A new study suggests the oceans have been warming more rapidly than scientists previously thought. Zeke Hausfather, an author of the study, told our colleague Kendra Pierre-Louis that 2018 would turn out to be “the warmest year on record for the Earth’s oceans, as 2017 was the warmest year, and 2016 was the warmest year.”The news about the oceans makes you wonder how high 2018 will rank among the hottest years in recorded history. We’d love to tell you, but we can’t: The government shutdown has stalled that data, and a lot of other important science besides. Kendra has that story, too.That’s just one of the effects of the shutdown. Coral Davenport wrote about furloughed pollution inspectors at the Environmental Protection Agency who would normally be checking up on chemical factories, power plants, oil refineries, water treatment plants and thousands of other industrial sites for pollution violations.Still, not everything is idle for the Trump administration. It is bringing back at least 40 federal employees to work on plans to sell oil and gas drilling leases off the United States coastline. And the hearing over the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to head the Environmental Protection Agency went on as scheduled.In California, Pacific Gas and Electric will seek bankruptcy protection over the billions of dollars in liability it faces from two years of deadly wildfires. Climate change is a factor, helping to make wildfires more numerous and more destructive — and making the utility “one of the first major financial casualties from climate change.”And, if all of that is the sort of news that might have you reaching for a comforting cup of coffee, you guessed it: Climate change (and deforestation) is threatening many wild species of coffee. Somini Sengupta tells us that the loss of diversity means we could be losing options to adapt our morning cup to a changing world.As the impasse continues over President Trump’s demand for a border wall, Mr. Trump and his allies have floated the idea of his declaring a national emergency that they say might allow him to build it without congressional approval.Mr. Trump has already pulled back somewhat from his earlier threats of an emergency declaration. But the idea alone has caused consternation, and not just among Democrats. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said last week that the precedent of declaring an emergency to build the wall worried him. “We have to be careful about endorsing broad uses of executive power,” he said. “Tomorrow the national emergency might be climate change.“Hmm,” we thought here at Team Climate. Could a future president who accepts the seriousness of the climate threat declare an emergency to get things done? How would that work?There are 136 statutory provisions that grant powers to the president under an emergency declaration, according to a recent report from the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. These laws are very specific in their effects, said Elizabeth Goitein, a co-director of the center’s Liberty and National Security Program.Whether the laws would allow Mr. Trump to build a wall is questionable; whether they would allow action on climate change is even more so.Some of the laws do allow the president to act on environmental safeguards and energy production, but “they all cut the other way,” Ms. Goitein said. These are laws that allow the president to temporarily suspend environmental protections, for example, in the case of a national emergency that requires a quick surge in energy production. So, those laws could not be used to tighten environmental protections or to reduce energy production.“There are no emergency provisions to protect the Earth,” Ms. Goitein said.What’s more, the meaning of an emergency when invoking these powers is rooted in the idea of things that happen suddenly, without the kind of warning that gives Congress time to act — and one thing that isn’t sudden is knowledge about climate change.The intention of the provisions, Ms. Goitein said, is not to “get around the law” or to perform an end run around a Congress that disagrees with the president’s wishes.“We are in a climate emergency,” said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. “But just because you call something an emergency doesn’t mean that it fits under the president’s statutory authority.”When you turn on the shower, chances are that hot water (eventually) comes out. While we may wonder why it takes so long for the water to warm, that’s about as far as our minds probably wander on the subject. But here’s something to remember: Keeping water hot is one of the most energy-intensive components of our daily lives.According to the Energy Department, water heating accounts for about 18 percent of a home’s energy consumption. That’s usually second only to home heating (which we covered last month) and cooling. But it often goes overlooked, said Gary Klein, a consultant on hot water efficiency.For energy-conscious homeowners who have already gone through a standard checklist, “water heating is going to be the biggest one thing that’s left,” Mr. Klein said. “It’s like the next gold mine to go mining in.”There are a number of places to start, some easier than others.If you’re building a new home or doing major renovations, Mr. Klein suggests a design where the taps and hot water heater are as close to one another as possible. Another consideration is whether to go with a traditional hot water tank or a tankless system, which is more expensive to install but uses less energy because it heats water only on demand.High-efficiency appliances also go a long way, Mr. Klein said, mainly because they use less water, thus reducing the need to heat it in the first place.But there are also simple things that most anyone can do. Switching to low-flow fixtures, for example, reduces the demand for hot water, leading to significant savings.Another place to look is on the water heater itself, where the temperature is almost always adjustable. If your water is coming out of the tap scalding, the temperature is probably set too high, so go ahead and try inching it down until you feel comfortable. The Energy Department recommends 120 degrees.Mr. Klein recommends looking into other modifications as well. Demand-activated pumps, for example, can help bring your water up to temperature without wasting water down the drain. Pressure-compensating aerators better regulate the flow from fixtures and can be quite inexpensive.The technology, he said, is much better than it used to be. “If you tried this stuff some years ago,” he said, “it’s time to try it again.”Mr. Klein also recommends insulating your hot water pipes. Doing so keeps your unused hot water warmer for longer, meaning less energy is needed to heat it back up.“Poorly insulated pipes,” Mr. Klein said, “is sort of like having screen doors in submarines.”We’d love your feedback on this newsletter.

416,"Good morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)Refusing to change out of her turtleneck on a sweltering day in Pasadena and being captivated by swaying palm trees.That’s most of what Miriam Tellez Sorrosa remembers about arriving in the United States from Mexico when she was 7.“I had not seen palm trees in my life,” she said. “I thought they were going to fall.”Ms. Tellez Sorrosa is now 22 and a “Dreamer” — she’s among the roughly 700,000 young immigrants brought into the United States as children, who were shielded from deportation under the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.She’s getting ready to graduate from Cal State University Fullerton, where she’s worked extensively with other undocumented students through the school’s Titan Dreamers Resource Center.And on Tuesday, at the invitation of Representative Gil Cisneros, she was in the chambers of the U.S. House of Representatives as President Trump delivered his State of the Union address.Mr. Cisneros, who represents the 39th District, which includes parts of Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino Counties, said he wanted the president to see that students like Ms. Tellez Sorrosa are assets to the country.“This is her home; this is where she wants to make a difference and we need to be embracing that,” he said.While President Trump has consistently used dire language about immigrants who come into the country illegally, his position on DACA recipients has shifted.In 2017, he moved to end DACA, then last month, he offered to extend protections for DACA recipients in exchange for border wall funding.In the State of the Union, he returned to describing a crisis on the border.I talked to Ms. Tellez Sorrosa on Wednesday about visiting Washington and listening to the president. Here’s our conversation, edited for length and clarity.Jill Cowan: What did being at the State of the Union represent for you?I think the biggest thing for me was just understanding the history of it, to think the place where I was going to be was the place where generations of individuals were making laws that now affect me.What being undocumented means to me is my resilient identity. So for me, I feel like it’s almost like a responsibility and a necessity to share my experience.What was it like to be in Washington as the guest of a congressman?Yesterday there was a period of time where I was shadowing him in his meetings and that just blew my mind.What I love about it, too, was that everybody’s experience and narrative is unique and there’s not like, “This person’s guest is more important than this person’s guest.” It was just a handful of American people being present. That was one of the most magical things, to share the room. I feel like that’s what America always strives to be: With the people and for the people.Was there another guest that you really felt like you connected with? I was super excited to hear that there were going to be more DACA recipients attending and there was this moment where we were all in the same room. I was just like, “Yes.”What was it like listening to the speech? In a way, I was happy about where my seat was. I couldn’t really see him. It helped me just listen to what he was saying. There were things where I was like, “I believe this, too.”When he talked about immigration and immigrants, I paid a lot more attention. I think because I’ve known his rhetoric and how he talked about immigrants, that wasn’t a surprise. I was indifferent to it.But I’m learning research now as a sociologist, and I was like, there’s so many potential flaws in this. I want to know where your information is coming from.[Read The Times’s fact check of the State of the Union here.]Do you mind if I ask what you wore? I laugh because I was freaking out about what to wear. I was coming into a space where these people are people with power, economic status, everything. How do I fit in? I think I went the safe route, wearing business professional clothing. I did wear a white shirt in support of a lot of congresswomen.On campus, we have a Dreamers’ graduation and in our Dreamers’ graduation we have a sash. So I actually asked for my sash in advance as a statement piece. I was hoping it would spark dialogue.How are you going to use this experience going forward?I’m definitely not as afraid as I was before.I have until 2020 with my permit. And that’s kind of my safety net, so I’m going to try to do as much as possible while I have DACA and I’m going to continue to advocate for something bigger that will just benefit not only the Dreamers, quote-unquote.Last question: Do you think that you might want to run for office someday? One of my Lyft drivers, as I was telling him about why I’m here, he was like, “I like how you talk, you should run for office.” And I was like, “Would I have your vote?” He was like, “Yes!”Definitely, being here and being present and seeing people being passionate about moving forward the agendas that are important to them and making every single topic special and important has motivated me to get more involved.(A note: We often link to content on sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

417,"Good morning, and welcome to a special post-State of the Union edition of On Politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.A ritual of sorts has developed around the State of the Union address. President Trump arrives in the Capitol, basks in the pomp and ceremony, and delivers an uncharacteristically reserved speech that includes some passing appeals to compromise. “This is the day Trump became president,” official Washington crows, shocked by the apparent transformation.Early the next morning, the president fires off a tweet. And it’s back to the usual political chaos.So, this year we’ll let others break down the policy ideas and possibilities for bipartisan action. We’re going to view the speech as what it most centrally was: an opening salvo in Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.[Here’s video of the address, along with Times reporters’ analysis. You can read highlights here, and a fact check here.]With the largest audience he’s likely to have all year, Mr. Trump used the address to please his still-loyal base of conservatives, while trying to position the Democratic Party as too far to the left for the independents, women and suburbanites who have fallen away.Mr. Trump opened his address with the message Republicans desperately wanted him to push before the 2018 midterms: the strength of the economy.He said that it had improved under his watch, particularly for blue-collar workers, “who I promised to fight for.” He touted the campaign pledges he’s kept: passage of the tax bill, withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, increased oil drilling.For his supporters, he promised to build that wall across the southern border, warning in sinister tones of a “tremendous onslaught” of migrant caravans, as Democratic groans echoed in the chamber.For independents, Mr. Trump offered some universally popular ideas, like fighting childhood cancer and rebuilding crumbling infrastructure. He singled out two key 2020 battleground states, Michigan and Pennsylvania, as hurt by foreign trade.And he took digs at the ascendant left wing of the Democratic Party, including mounting a strong defense of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an agency that some Democrats have said should be abolished. The president also urged lawmakers to reject the politics of “resistance” and said he was “alarmed” by “calls to adopt socialism.”He also attacked the multiple investigations into his administration and his campaign’s possible ties to Russia, seeming to argue that Democrats’ congressional oversight threatened national security and economic growth.“An economic miracle is taking place in the United States — and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations,” he said, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi quietly scoffed behind him.But perhaps as telling as any of the topics he addressed was the one he did not: the government shutdown. During his nearly 90-minute speech, Mr. Trump didn’t even mention the shutdown, which dominated national news, dragged down his approval ratings and delayed this very event.Less than two years away from facing voters for a second time, Mr. Trump finds himself in a moment of political peril.He has not been able to get funding for his border wall and is flirting with declaring a national emergency to fulfill that major campaign promise. The special counsel investigation has ensnared some of his key allies. Aides are preparing for a blizzard of subpoenas from the Democratic-controlled House. And he’s still reeling from his political defeat over the longest government shutdown in history.The challenges are adding up: While his base has largely stuck with him, a majority of voters now say they’ve ruled out re-electing him.Of course, there are some positive signs for the president. The economy is strong. And he’s kept one of his core promises to supporters, sticking to his image as a fighter who punches back twice as hard.But that base is shrinking, as evidenced by his falling approval ratings among women and independents. Even congressional Republicans who have long feared a backlash if they break with the president are showing signs of autonomy, opposing him on foreign policy and expressing jitters about another shutdown.The hyperpolarization of the Trump era has pushed voters so far into their corners that it’s almost hard to imagine what Mr. Trump could do to shift that dynamic.During the Trump administration, Democrats have largely transformed into a party of fierce resistance, impossible to miss in the House chamber on Tuesday as their female members appeared in a sea of white outfits.The president never mentioned his re-election campaign on Tuesday, even with a number of potential opponents glaring at him from the audience. But it’s clear Mr. Trump is thinking about the 2020 race.He attacks Democratic candidates on Twitter as political aides work behind the scenes to stave off Republican primary threats. At a lunch on Tuesday previewing his remarks to news anchors, Mr. Trump offered scathing assessments of his possible Democratic opponents.The address underscored that Mr. Trump and his team may believe their best hope for re-election rests not with winning back independents and white women, but the selection of a Democratic nominee who moves too far to the left for those voters.Whether the president fully recognizes his own vulnerabilities is less certain.____________________Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers.

418,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s legislative path to a border wall has narrowed significantly on the eve of Tuesday’s State of the Union speech, and his fallback plan to circumvent Congress by declaring a state of emergency could create a major division in his own party.As he prepares to make his case to the largest national audience of the year, Mr. Trump appeared to be in an increasingly precarious position, unable to sway the wider public to his cause and unwilling, at least so far, to apply the persuasion and compromise that have gotten previous presidents out of political jams.Anxiety over the damage being inflicted on the party is growing. Last week, in a one-on-one meeting with the president, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, reportedly warned Mr. Trump that declaring a national emergency to build his wall would almost certainly spark a rebellion within his party — and a vote to overrule him. House and Senate negotiators have been moving toward a bipartisan agreement as early as Friday to keep the government funded after Feb. 15 — with or without the president’s support.But the president’s supporters continue to plead for unity.“This is the defining moment of his presidency,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is one of Mr. Trump’s biggest supporters on Capitol Hill, speaking at an event in Greenville on Monday.“To every Republican, if you don’t stand behind this president, we’re not going to stand behind you when it comes to the wall,” said Mr. Graham, adding that he feared “a war within the Republican Party” if Republicans did not support Mr. Trump’s plans, including an emergency declaration.The president’s advisers have said the speech will focus on unity. But he is also expected to double down on the wall. In an Oval Office interview last week, he cast doubt on a settlement being hashed out by a bipartisan committee of 17 House members and senators before the Feb. 15 deadline, saying that anything short of his full demand would be “a waste of time.”At the same time, Mr. Trump continued to brandish the threat of an emergency declaration that would allow him to divert existing federal funding to the wall, an idea that has sparked heated opposition among Senate Republicans, who have grown increasingly comfortable in their defiance. On Monday, the Senate formally adopted an amendment to a broader Middle East policy bill, 70 to 26, that rebuked the president for what Republicans saw as a precipitous withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and Syria.In December, Republican senators broke with him to call for the withdrawal of American support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, as they recoiled from his inaction in the face of the kingdom’s murder of a Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi.Mr. Trump is not expected to declare the state of emergency during Tuesday’s address. But he continues to threaten that he will divert funding for other military and infrastructure projects to build the wall, with or without congressional approval. He has told people close to him that he views the threat as his last remaining leverage in the fight.That has some Republicans openly fretting that such a declaration would embolden a Democratic president to declare a national emergency on climate change or gun violence.“It would be a bad precedent, I think, for the president to decide to invoke national security as a way to bypass a congressional logjam,” said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania. “And I can imagine future presidents using that for purposes I would find very objectionable.”That sentiment has been expressed by about a dozen Republican senators, publicly and privately, including Roy Blunt of Missouri, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Marco Rubio of Florida, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and John Cornyn of Texas, who is considered to be among the most influential members of his party on immigration.“The whole idea that a president — whether it’s President Trump or President Warren or President Sanders — can declare an emergency and then somehow usurp the separation of powers and get into the business of appropriating money for specific projects without Congress getting involved is a serious constitutional question,” Mr. Cornyn said on Monday.But the most important critic of the declaration is Mr. McConnell. “I don’t think much of that idea,” Mr. McConnell said last month when asked about the declaration. “I hope he doesn’t go down that path.”Mr. McConnell, according to three people familiar with his thinking, has grown increasingly frustrated with the White House in recent days, telling associates that he thinks members of the president’s staff have failed to adequately brief him on the legislative and political perils of moving ahead with a disaster declaration.During his White House meeting, disclosed by The Washington Post, Mr. McConnell predicted that Speaker Nancy Pelosi would have the House immediately pass a “resolution of disapproval” attempting to block him from using existing funding for the wall.Any senator from either party could then demand a vote, because the resolution would be deemed “privileged.” Mr. McConnell told Mr. Trump that he would have no choice but to schedule a floor vote on the measure within 15 days, and Republican aides have estimated that between three and 10 Republicans would side with the chamber’s Democrats against Mr. Trump.That would force the president into a politically costly effort to keep the Senate from overriding his veto of the resolution, even as Democrats moved to block him in the courts.“He’s been talking about all this for a month, in front of the cameras,” said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, who played down the exchange.The leader delivered a similar message to Vice President Mike Pence and the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, three weeks ago during negotiations to reopen the government. Since then, both men have counseled the president to move cautiously on the emergency declaration, according to a senior administration official.Democrats have begun drafting legislation that would remove the president’s ability to shift money from one project to another. Representative John Garamendi, Democrat of California, would repeal a line in the 1986 Water Resources Development Act that grants the president authority to use civil works money to respond to a national emergency.Administration officials struck a defiant note on Monday, saying the president needed the threat of a declaration to pressure Ms. Pelosi.“The Congress has failed to do its job — this Congress, last Congress and for quite a while to make sure that we have what we need at the southern border, which of course the centerpiece is a physical barrier, wall, steel slats,” Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president, told reporters.The House-Senate negotiating committee assigned to hammer out a border-security deal to keep the government funded is expected to work through the week and into the weekend. Lawmakers will begin working out some of the more tenuous aspects of the funding bill as early as Tuesday. Among the expected snags are a Democratic provision that would prohibit the use of funds to deny asylum applications from survivors of gang violence and domestic violence, whether to increase or decrease the number of detention beds used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and what constitutes a border “barrier.”Democrats prefer a “smart wall” made up of sensors, drones and other technology but no physical structure. Republicans say some physical barrier is necessary, though not a concrete wall from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico.House Republicans on the committee spent Sunday and Monday on the border in Texas in McAllen and El Paso, accompanied by Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas. Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, has also suggested bringing experts in to testify on what is needed in border security.But all of that work could be blown up by an emergency declaration, a move that would endear Mr. Trump to the Republican base while infuriating Democrats.“I think he’s going to do it,” said Jeff Roe, a veteran Republican consultant and longtime political adviser to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. “He’s responding to what too many Republicans ignore, which is the screaming and yelling from our base to do something. Let’s stop fighting ourselves and letting Democrats kick us in the face. We’ve been making these types of promises for ten to 15 years. Tax cuts and regulatory reform ain’t enough. We want the wall.”"
419,"The debate around a border wall and immigration has become so distorted by President Trump’s superheated nonsense — we must build a wall to keep out all these rapists and murderers, and Mexico will pay for it — that we’ve forgotten what it would sound like if we actually had a president framing the real border issue in a really honest way to come up with a real solution — not just one to energize his base.Unfortunately, we have a president who wants to spend $5.7 billion on a wall to fix his political problems with Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham. When what we need is a president who wants to spend $5.7 on a multipronged strategy that will address the actual immigration challenge we face.Here is how a real president would explain it: My fellow Americans, we face a global crisis: More people are on the move today seeking jobs, asylum from murderous governments, safety from environmental disasters or just looking for order than at any time since World War II — some 70 million people.Why now? Answer: During the late 19th and the 20th centuries the world shifted from being governed by large empires in many regions to being governed by independent nation-states. And the 50 years after World II were a great time to be a weak little nation-state — for several reasons.[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]First, because there were two superpowers competing for your affection by throwing foreign aid at you, building your army, buying your cheap goods and educating your kids at their universities. Second, climate change was moderate. Third, populations were still under control in the developing world. Fourth, no one had a cellphone to easily organize movements against your government or even see what Paris or Phoenix looked like. Fifth, China was not in the World Trade Organization, so every poor country could be in textiles and other low-wage industries.All of those advantages disappeared in the early 21st century. Climate-driven extreme weather — floods, droughts, record-setting heat and cold — on top of man-made deforestation began to hammer many countries, especially their small-scale farmers. Developing-world populations exploded thanks to improved health care. Africa went from 140 million people in 1900 to one billion in 2010 to a projected 2.5 billion by 2050. The same surge happened in Central America, in countries like Guatemala.Meanwhile, the smartphone enabled citizens to easily compare their living standards with Paris or Phoenix — and find a human trafficker app to take them there. Also, China joined the W.T.O., gobbling up low-wage industries, and the end of the Cold War meant no superpower wanted to touch your country, because all it would win was a bill.The result: It’s much harder to be a weak country today, and the weakest of them are starting to fail or fracture and hemorrhage their people. That’s Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Venezuela in our hemisphere and Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya and many countries in sub-Saharan Africa across the Atlantic.This is creating wide zones of “disorder” — and the biggest geopolitical trend in the world is all the people trying to get out of zones of disorder into the world of order. And that is what’s creating all the populist, nationalist, anti-immigrant backlashes in the world of order — particularly in America and Europe.That is the real context for this immigration crisis. What’s the answer? Well, if you look at what slowed the flood of single Mexican men illegally and legally coming to America in the last decade, it was the combination of greater economic opportunity in Mexico, thanks in part to Nafta, plus slower population growth in Mexico, plus improved governance in Mexico, plus better border security along the Mexico-U.S. border.That same formula has to be applied now to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. They have become the primary source of all those migrants and caravans coming to America today, including 187,000 minors without adult guardians, who were picked up by the U.S. Border Patrol between 2014 and 2018. Their parents sent them our way to connect with relatives already here or to be shielded from forced gang recruitment and violence.A report last June by the Council on Foreign Relations noted, “In 2015, the latest year for which data is available, as many as 3.4 million people born in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras were living in the United States, more than double the estimated 1.5 million people in 2000.” Because of rampant corruption and gang warfare, Salvadorans, Hondurans and Guatemalans each year pay an estimated total of $651 million in extortion to organized crime groups. These gangs, like MS-13, exploded in Central America in the mid-1990s “following large-scale deportations from the United States of undocumented immigrants with criminal records.”That’s why, among other things, a smart U.S. immigration policy would promote family planning in rural areas in Central America. Letting America’s religious right limit U.S. family planning assistance abroad is stupid. The only thing more stupid is not working to mitigate climate change, which Trump refuses to do. Extreme weather has been disrupting small-scale farming in Central America. And when small-scale farming weakens or collapses, people leave the countryside and flock to the city. And if they find high unemployment and high crime rates there, they head to America.At the same time, we need an investment shock by local and foreign companies and governments to build infrastructure, tourism and trade in Central America so more people can thrive there, especially when 61 percent of the population is under 29 years of age.Alas, though, investment rates average just 12 percent of G.D.P. in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, while in Mexico it’s 26 percent.Yes, both legal and illegal immigrants actually contribute, on balance, to American growth, but there is no question that border security, asylum courts, resettlement and absorption facilities put pressure on federal, state and local governments. But …The U.S. could spend millions of dollars to help stabilize Central American countries — so that more of their citizens could stay home, which most immigrants prefer — and we’d still save money and reduce illegal immigration. It costs us anywhere from $14,000 to $38,000 to detain and deport a single migrant.Finally, we also need fences, drones and sensors to strengthen the border in places. But rather than building a $5.7 billion wall against Mexico, what we need most is to help Mexico improve its capacity to intercept migrants at its southern border with Guatemala — where all Central American migrants headed north have to pass. It’s not that hard. There are only two main roads out of Guatemala to the north, with a mountain in the middle. It’s called Mexico’s “Tehuantepec isthmus bottleneck.”If we worked with Mexico to create better entry-point infrastructure there with biometric controls and improved ability to inspect vehicles, people and merchandise to stop smugglers — and even interview potential asylum seekers there — we would significantly reduce the numbers coming out of Central America, crossing Mexico and piling up at our border.In sum, we need a plan that creates a wall, not a wall that substitutes for a plan. That’s what a real president would offer. If only we had one.But have no illusions: More weak nation-states will be imploding under these pressures in the coming decade and no empire is going to impose order there; those days are long gone. But many of these states simply cannot effectively govern themselves any longer. (Heck, Britain can’t effectively govern itself any longer!)So how the world of order collaborates to bring order to more and more of these places — Italy has basically created and funded the Libyan Coast Guard to protect itself from migrants crossing the Mediterranean — is going to become one of the biggest governing challenges of this century."
420,"Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead.1. President Trump had invited the publisher of The New York Times to an off-the-record dinner. The publisher, A. G. Sulzberger, said he preferred an on-the-record interview with reporters in the room. Mr. Trump agreed.That led to a wide-ranging interview in the Oval Office on Thursday, during which Mr. Trump called negotiations with Congress over the border wall “a waste of time” and said the job of president was a “loser” financially.Mr. Trump spoke in a low voice, his arms folded tightly, during questions about the Russia inquiry. But he was more good-humored at other points and grew most animated when condemning news coverage he considered unfair. Here are five takeaways from our interview.The president’s State of the Union address is slated for Tuesday night. A senior administration official said immigration would be the main theme.Have you been keeping up with the headlines? Test your knowledge with our news quiz. And here’s the front page of our Sunday paper, the Sunday Review from Opinion and our crossword puzzles.____2. Ralph Northam, the Democratic governor of Virginia, is facing intense pressure from his own party to resign after a racist picture on his 1984 medical school yearbook page became public. The photo showed one person in blackface and one dressed as a Ku Klux Klan member.At first Mr. Northam, above, acknowledged that he was in the photo, but on Saturday he denied that he was either person pictured. He said he would not quit and asked Virginians to let him earn their forgiveness.“I cannot in good conscience choose the path that would be easier for me to duck the responsibility to reconcile,” Mr. Northam said.____3. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, above, entered the 2020 race for president, joining a Democratic primary field that is the most diverse in history. It remains to be seen how Mr. Booker’s relentless optimism will fare with a Democratic electorate energized by seething anger toward the president.A potential candidate, Howard Schultz, was greeted by protesters when he returned to his hometown, Seattle, on Thursday. Mr. Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks, is considering running as an independent, a move many believe would hurt the Democrats’ chances.And there’s a thorny question several liberal candidates will have to navigate: Will people lose the choices offered by private health insurance under a single-payer system? The 2020 race will be the first time many leading Democratic candidates will have to explain and defend “Medicare for all.”____4. As cities and towns in the Midwest began assessing deaths, injuries and damage after this week’s deep freeze, fast-warming weather is throwing the region into a temperature roller coaster.It could be 52 degrees in the Chicago region on Monday, up 73 degrees from Thursday morning, when the city saw a low of minus 21. “It’s fairly rare to see this much of a turnaround in temperature in this short of time,” a meteorologist with the National Weather Service said. Above, Lake Michigan’s shoreline in Chicago on Wednesday.We captured images of what life looked like in the frozen Midwest. Government officials said at least 21 deaths across the region were related to the bitter weather system.____5. The Trump administration is suspending the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, one of the last major nuclear arms control treaties with Russia.“We can no longer be restricted by the treaty while Russia shamelessly violates it,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, above, said Friday.President Vladimir Putin of Russia responded by also suspending his country’s observance of the treaty, and said Russia would build weapons previously banned under the pact and would no longer initiate talks with the United States on any matters related to nuclear arms control.Separately, President Trump seemed optimistic about reaching a landmark trade deal with China, but suggested he might leave some tariffs in place anyway.____6. The Senate delivered a bipartisan rebuke to President’s Trump foreign policy, voting overwhelmingly to advance legislation that expresses strong opposition to the withdrawal of United States military forces from Syria and Afghanistan. Above, U.S. Marines in Afghanistan last year.The amendment — written by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and backed by virtually every Senate Republican — will be added to a broader bipartisan Middle East policy bill expected to easily pass the Senate next week.The president of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, is also concerned about a hasty American exit, and sent a letter to Mr. Trump on Tuesday offering him reduced costs for keeping U.S. troops in the country.____7. Two tech giants had two different weeks.Apple announced Tuesday that profits were flat and revenues were down in its most recent quarter, which the company attributed to the economic slowdown in China and diminishing demand for new iPhones.Facebook, despite a string of scandals in 2018, said Wednesday that it had gained new users around the world in the fourth quarter and reported a record profit.And Apple cut off Facebook’s access to apps and updates that it was working on internally, saying the social network violated Apple’s rules. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, may be the only one who can fix Facebook’s privacy problem, our Business Day columnist writes.____8. Employers shrugged off both the monthlong partial government shutdown and fears of an economic slowdown to add 304,000 jobs in January. This marks the 100th consecutive month of job gains, more than double the previous record.But the economy did not escape the shutdown unscathed: The Congressional Budget Office estimated this week that the funding lapse shaved $11 billion off total output, $3 billion of which will never be recovered. Above, federal employees at a food kitchen in Washington, D.C., in mid-January.It was a tough week for digital media, with more than 1,000 employees laid off at BuzzFeed, AOL, Yahoo and HuffPost, and Vice Media starting the process of laying off some 250 workers. What went wrong? It’s complicated.____9. It’s Super Bowl Sunday. Follow our live coverage of Super Bowl LIII here.The road to the big game had plenty of twists and turns: mistakes, penalties, upsets — and a whole lot of fun. Here’s an illustrated look at how we got here.Tom Brady is now New England’s favorite adopted son. This has more to do with timing, some key lifestyle decisions and a certain fight with the N.F.L. over deflated footballs than with his collection of Super Bowl rings, our sports reporter writes.Hundreds of former N.F.L. athletes have said they started regularly taking painkillers when they entered the league. Their habits can persist in retirement, sending them on journeys into addiction.____10. And finally, don’t miss our Best Weekend Reads.We talk to the wife of El Chapo, Emma Coronel Aispuro, who has no regrets, and look at the full story of Lorena Bobbitt. We also write about the lives of remarkable black men and women who never received an obituary in The New York Times, including, clockwise from top left: Nina Mae McKinney, Alfred Hair, Oscar Micheaux, Gladys Bentley, Mary Ellen Pleasant, Major Taylor and Philip A.

421,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. The government shutdown will reach its 21st day tomorrow, and, if it lasts to Saturday, become the longest in 43 years. But first:1. Scientists say the world’s oceans are heating up far, far more rapidly — 40 percent faster on average — than previously thought. The finding, in a newly published analysis, has dire implications.The oceans have been absorbing most of the heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions, offering a buffer against climate change. Their escalating temperatures are already killing off marine ecosystems, raising sea levels and making hurricanes more destructive. Above, Hurricane Florence pummeling Atlantic Beach, N.C., this fall.Continued heating will only make those effects more catastrophic, the scientists say._____2. “No wall, no deal.”Vice President Mike Pence flatly declared there could be no agreement to reopen the government without funding for a border wall — terms that Democrats have already rejected.And a bipartisan plan developed in the Senate that would trade wall funding for legal status for undocumented immigrants facing deportation also seemed to be dead on arrival.The partial shutdown, now in its 20th day, will almost certainly become the longest in American history, surpassing a 21-day lapse that began in December 1995.That leaves 800,000 federal employees still furloughed or working without pay. One example of the impact: 600 pollution inspectors and other workers at the Environmental Protection Agency responsible for detecting violations that endanger human health are off the job.Here’s a state-by-state look at the shutdown’s impact. And here are stories from federal employees, describing their sacrifices and preparations._____3. Along the border in Texas, on a trip that he did not want to take, to discuss a crisis that Democrats say does not exist, President Trump repeated his demand for a wall.He reiterated an untrue claim that Mexico would indirectly pay for the wall through a revamped trade agreement, and heard from people who had loved ones killed by immigrants. Above, Mr. Trump in McAllen, Tex.“If we had a barrier of any kind, whether it’s steel or concrete,” Mr. Trump said of tragic stories involving violence and human trafficking, “they wouldn’t even bother trying. We could stop that cold.”The president continued to float the idea of declaring a state of national emergency that could allow him to bypass Congress to fund the wall.Separately, our journalists are driving the length of the approximately 1,900-mile U.S.-Mexico border. They just sent in their first dispatch._____4. Michael Cohen, President Trump’s former personal lawyer, said he would give a congressional panel “a full and credible account” of his work for Mr. Trump in public testimony on Feb. 7.Mr. Cohen has implicated the president in a scheme to pay hush money to two women claiming to have had affairs with him, for which he was sentenced to three years in prison in December, above. And as a consigliere to Mr. Trump, he was privy to workings of his inner circle under scrutiny by the special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors.He could soon share the details on national television under oath._____5. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared, in a speech in Cairo, that the United States would take a more activist role in the Middle East.Mr. Pompeo, above, apparently sought to reassure jittery nations with his declaration that the United States would “expel every last Iranian boot from Syria,” but the effect was confounding to many, coming weeks after President Trump’s impulsive announcement that American forces would leave Syria.He also rejected the Obama administration’s Middle East policy — referring to it as “the age of self-inflicted shame” — and outlined an approach based on alliances with authoritarian rulers.Mr. Pompeo denounced the former president for underestimating “the tenacity and viciousness of radical Islam” and for his policies on Iran. Here are the many ways Mr. Pompeo departed from Mr. Obama._____6. Tensions are high in Congo. Election officials awarded the presidency to a candidate who was not seen as the top vote-getter. That dashed hopes of an undisputed transfer of power as the longtime leader of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Joseph Kabila, steps down.Still, the pick — Felix Tshisekedi, pictured above in December — wasn’t Mr. Kabila’s first choice. That means Mr. Kabila’s candidate lost so badly that his government could not simply hand him the presidency without risking widespread violence and international condemnation.But it was unclear how the decision to pass over the leading opposition figure, Martin Fayulu, would sit with the population._____7. Female economists say sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying have pushed them to the sidelines — or out of the field entirely.“I spent all my time hoping that no one would remember I was female,” Susan Athey, an economist at Stanford, above, said of her first economics department job. The issues took center stage at the American Economic Association’s annual meeting last weekend, following substantiated allegations of harassment against one of the most prominent young economists in the country.The association faces a push for more aggressive action on codes of professional conduct. “There’s just a ton of anger and resentment around how the profession has been,” another economist said at the meeting.Separately, Lady Gaga became the latest musician to apologize for collaborating with R. Kelly, who is accused of sexual misconduct and preying on teenagers, after the broadcast of an explosive investigative documentary detailing the allegations against him._____8. The extravagant splendor of the animal kingdom can’t be explained by natural selection alone — so how did it come to be?A new generation of biologists is reviving a theory originally proposed by Charles Darwin 150 years ago. Beauty, they say, does not have to be a proxy for health or advantageous genes. Above, a male Indian peafowl.Sometimes, they argue, beauty is the glorious but meaningless flowering of arbitrary preference. Animals simply find certain features — a blush of red, a feathered flourish — to be appealing. And that innate sense of beauty itself can become an engine of evolution.The scientists’ thinking isn’t just rewriting the standard explanation for how beauty evolves — it’s changing the way we think about evolution itself._____9. Twenty years ago today, a mobster walked into a psychiatrist’s office and changed the course of television.“‘The Sopranos was as clear a marker of the beginning of an era as anything in TV,” our chief television critics writes.We also named the 20 best drama series since, including “The West Wing,” “The Wire,” “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Transparent.” (Remember, we said 20 — check out the full list before you email to tell us we missed your favorite.)A “Sopranos” rewatch may be in order: Here’s a complete guide to heading back to Jersey._____10. We close out the day with a nod to fitness trends past.In the 1960s, Face-o-Metrics, above, were all the rage. In 1971, The Times reviewed Hot Pants, an inflatable “reducing” garment (with a bit more flavor of the Michelin Man than you might expect). In the 1980s, kitchen calisthenics had participants shaking salad dressing and whirling furiously to “Flight of the Bumblebee.”Our writer took a look at how The Times has recorded fitness fads.Have a jazzy night._____Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

422,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Air travelers should be prepared for further delays today. President Trump grounded all Boeing 737 Max 8 and Max 9 aircraft, reversing a decision by aviation regulators after a deadly crash in Ethiopia. Here are the latest updates.The decision by the U.S. and Canada, two of the last countries to ground the jets, came after satellite-tracking data suggested similarities between the crash on Sunday and another involving a Boeing 737 Max 8 in October.What’s next: The short-term costs for Boeing are most likely manageable, but the bigger question is whether airlines will lose confidence in the aerospace giant’s best-selling jet. Q. and A.: Passengers who were to fly on the Boeing aircraft with U.S. carriers will be rebooked or scheduled on different planes. Here’s more information.The fallout from the college admissions scandal announced by federal prosecutors has exposed an array of corrupt and illegal practices. But it has also shed light on perfectly legal ways to game the admissions process.“Is that unfair? That the privileged can pay?” asked the managing director of an admissions consulting company in New York. “Yes. But that’s how the world works.”The details: The scandal involved lies about sports accomplishments that should have been simple to detect had anyone bothered to look. We have a list of everyone who has been charged.Another angle: For students of color, the case was a reminder of deep inequalities in admissions.The Daily: In today’s episode, two of our reporters discuss the scandal.Lawmakers want a plan to withdraw Britain from the European Union — but not the one offered by Prime Minister Theresa May.After twice rejecting Mrs. May’s Brexit proposal, Parliament on Wednesday voted to oppose the prospect of a disorderly “no-deal” exit from the bloc.What’s next: Lawmakers are scheduled to vote today on whether to postpone the March 29 deadline for withdrawal. If they support an extension, Mrs. May would have to seek permission to delay Brexit from European Union leaders. We’ll have live coverage.Go deeper: With the arrival of American-style political gridlock, Britain has seen the authority of its prime minister diminished to a point not seen in recent history.Catch up: “The maneuvering made clear that nearly three years after Britons voted to leave the European Union, the nation’s political system is splintering and there is no consensus on how to move ahead even as the critical deadline approaches,” our correspondent in London writes. Here’s a quick guide to what’s going on.A federal judge on Wednesday nearly doubled the prison sentence of President Trump’s former campaign chairman, to seven and a half years, saying that he “spent a significant portion of his career gaming the system.”In sentencing Mr. Manafort on two conspiracy counts, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of U.S. District Court in Washington closed out the highest-profile prosecution brought by the special counsel, Robert Mueller.Mr. Manafort, 69, received a 47-month sentence in a related case last week.Related: Prosecutors in New York have charged Mr. Manafort with mortgage fraud and more than a dozen other state felonies. The charges are part of an effort to ensure Mr. Manafort will face prison time even if President Trump pardons him for his federal crimes.On Sept. 15, 1942, a volley of Japanese torpedoes in the Pacific sank an American aircraft carrier, the U.S.S. Wasp. For decades, the families of those aboard could only wonder where the wreckage had landed. It took a billionaire backer, an epic hunt and a flash of insight to arrive at “There she is.”Facebook investigation: Federal prosecutors are conducting a criminal inquiry into deals that gave major tech companies broad access to users’ information. Separately, the social media company’s three main services — Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — went down intermittently around the world on Wednesday.Presidential rebukes: The Senate is likely to vote today to overturn President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to build a border wall. On Wednesday, lawmakers voted for a second time to end American military assistance for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen and to curtail presidential war powers. Curbing teenage vaping: The Food and Drug Administration has proposed requiring retailers to sequester flavored e-cigarettes to areas off limits to anyone under 18.Death of a reputed mob boss: Francesco Cali, 53, who was said to be the leader of the Gambino crime family, was fatally shot outside his home on Staten Island on Wednesday, the police said.The 2020 election: Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman whose close loss in a Senate race last year propelled him to Democratic stardom, announced today that he is running for president. Here’s where he stands on the issues.“The Argument” podcast: Our Opinion columnists interview Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democratic presidential candidate.Snapshot: Above, a memorial on Wednesday after eight people, including five students, were killed in a school shooting in Suzano, Brazil. The two assailants, both former students, killed themselves after the attack. Overlooked obituaries: In the early 1900s, Isabella Goodwin became New York City’s first female police detective after going undercover to expose a bank robber. She’s the latest entry in our series of people who didn’t receive obituaries in The Times when they died.Late-night comedy: President Trump came after the late-night TV hosts on Wednesday.

Taffy Brodesser-Akner, a features writer, appreciates Ms. Lippman’s take on “the dead girl phenomenon”: “If you look at the books that win the most prestigious prizes in my genre, and they’re very good books, but a lot of them can be summed up this way: a beautiful woman dies and a man feels bad about it.”Cook: This lemon snacking cake is a perfect afternoon pick-me-up.Watch: Here are five international crime series that recently arrived on American television and streaming services.Read: Lynne Olson’s “Madame Fourcade’s Secret War,” which tells the story of a Frenchwoman who led the fight against the Nazis, is new this week on our hardcover nonfiction and combined print and e-book nonfiction best-seller lists.Listen: Hip-hop fans in Britain and France have generally been indifferent to each other’s music. But musicians with links to Europe’s former colonies in Africa are bridging that gap.Smarter Living: If you only have a few minutes to work out, one option is high-intensity interval training. Spread three 20-second bursts of intense exercise across 10 minutes of running, cycling or rowing. That’s it. Optimal repeats: three times a week.Also, a new dating app tries connecting people through what’s inside their refrigerators.The Times recently published a story about a Central Park detective who is retiring, along with his horse, from the New York Police Department. Which got us wondering about how mounted units have managed to endure.One of the first on record is the Bow Street Horse Patrol in London, established in the mid-18th century to ward off petty crime on country roads. The idea soon spread across Britain and around the world.These days, mounted officers are often used for crowd control and easy navigation through traffic (mobility and sightlines from horseback are better than on foot or in a car). According to a study in 2015, the benefits include building public trust.In comparison to foot patrols, the report said, “Mounted police were observed to generate over six times as many instances of casual public engagements — such as greetings and brief exchanges — over equivalent time periods in neighborhood patrols.”"
423,"To the Editor:Re “The People vs. Donald J. Trump,” by David Leonhardt (Sunday Review, Jan. 6):When Richard Nixon resigned, we as a country were still capable of being shocked by corruption, obstruction of justice and abuse of power. During the Vietnam War, I remember how outraged we were when we discovered that the government had been lying to us about what was really happening, about the number of deaths. Now, even though President Trump’s abuses of power and lies are far worse than those of Nixon, I don’t see his support crumbling. Too many are now jaded and cynical. No matter what the investigations reveal, the reaction will be a shrug: “Well, what do you expect — all politicians are corrupt.”Impeachment cannot — and indeed, should not — go forward unless there is broad public support for it. But the capacity to be shocked and outraged, or even to understand the danger of leaving Mr. Trump in office, is just not there, either in voters, or in Congress. That’s what really worries me.Margrit McIntoshTucsonTo the Editor:David Leonhardt lays out a clear and compelling case for why President Trump is unfit for office. Unfortunately, fitness for office wasn’t what got him elected and isn’t what’s kept him in power. Corrupt politicians in other countries use any means necessary to remain in office because the alternative is jail or worse.Mr. Trump ran for president not to serve the public, but to serve himself. The power of executive privilege, freedom from prosecution and the possibility of self-pardon no doubt motivate him to cling to power under increasing financial and legal peril.So here’s a deal for a president who fashions himself as a deal maker: Republican and Democratic leaders offer a pardon to Mr. Trump and his family, allowing them to retain their freedom and wealth, in exchange for his resignation. As distasteful as a pardon may be, it pales in comparison to the harm Mr. Trump can do by remaining in office.Jay MarkowitzWilson, Wyo.To the Editor:I believe that a majority of the electorate agrees with David Leonhardt’s observations. However, I fear letting President Trump off the hook, either by impeachment, after which Mike Pence could likely pardon him, or by negotiating his resignation in return for some sort of leniency for his crimes. The notion of his walking free following his despicable presidency is revolting.So far, he’s made a lavish living by dodging the law and common decency, and should not be rewarded for his deviance. Better to vote him (and Mr. Pence) out of office in 2020 so that legal punishment is still available. That may mean we need to endure him for longer, but letting the Trump presidency off the hook by either of the above expedients would be profoundly unsatisfying and damaging to the country and the rule of law.Andrew NelsonBend, Ore.To the Editor:The problem with David Leonhardt’s analysis is that it suggests that the Republican leadership will return to a fact-based universe, instead of the fact-free one that now prevails. The one where climate science is ignored, where the economic inequities caused by trickle-down are treated as fiction, where every day President Trump takes us all on an excursion into a fantasy land concerning immigration. It is here that the Republican Party has willingly chosen to reside.Those who have shut their eyes, turned their backs and held their noses for the past two years will not go easily into battle with Mr. Trump. No matter the damage he has done to party or country, they have shown no discernible backbone. While Mr. Leonhardt’s heart is in the right place, I fear that his head may unfortunately be in the clouds.Robert S. NussbaumFort Lee, N.J. To the Editor:David Leonhardt has written the most articulate, well-documented and soundly crafted argument for the removal of Donald Trump from the presidency. This article should be printed and mass distributed all over America, much as Thomas Paine’s “Common Sense” once was. I wasted no time sending it to my members of Congress.Joyce GraterPittsburghTo the Editor:Should David Leonhardt’s powerful, comprehensive indictment of President Trump not be enough to persuade Republicans in Congress that he must be removed from office, I suggest they ask themselves these questions. Would they ever put their children on a plane piloted by someone with little previous flight experience, someone who had refused to read the plane’s instruction manuals, someone who had just locked his co-pilots out of the cockpit? Would they be comfortable if he had said in recent weeks that he felt at “war every day,” had seemed to be more and more suspicious of those around him, including, perhaps, even members of his own family, and had a history of hair-trigger rage against those who defied him? And how would they feel if he had begun to make increasingly rash and dangerous decisions?The terrifying truth is that all of our children, and all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, are already on that plane. And as Mr. Leonhardt urgently warns, Republicans had better figure out soon what they are going to do about it.Eric ChivianBostonThe writer, a physician, is a former assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.To the Editor:While I agreed with much of David Leonhardt’s article, it saddened me to read this part: “The biggest risk may be that an external emergency — a war, a terrorist attack, a financial crisis, an immense natural disaster — will arise. By then, it will be too late to pretend that he is anything other than manifestly unfit to lead.”Did Mr. Leonhardt miss the immense natural disaster that was Hurricane Maria? It took almost a year to restore power to all of Puerto Rico, and this certainly proved that President Trump was unfit to lead at a time of disaster.Jeff WilsonEnglewood, N.J.To the Editor:David Leonhardt’s article captured the essence of what are perceived as wrongful acts. What I think was missing is the serious issue of President Trump’s stability, mental balance and irrational behavior. This, I believe, is what presents the most clear and present danger in his presidency.A 2017 book by Dr. Bandy X. Lee and colleagues, “The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump,” outlines very clearly and persuasively the real threat of Mr. Trump’s power as our president.Donald H. SauvigneWilton, Conn.To the Editor:David Leonhardt makes a persuasive case that ample grounds exist for the impeachment of President Trump. But he is far less persuasive in suggesting that the impending impeachment and resignation of President Richard M. Nixon in 1974 is a “relevant precedent,” providing grounds for hope that Mr. Trump will be removed or resign.In 1974, unlike this year, the Democrats had 56 votes in the Senate, plus an independent who caucused with them. Accordingly, only 10 Republican votes were needed to remove Nixon from office. Among the senators likely to provide such votes were liberal Republicans (admittedly an extinct species) like Clifford Case, Jacob Javits and Lowell Weicker, as well as middle-of-the-road Republicans like Howard Baker, Robert Packwood and Bob Dole.Especially following the departures of Senators Jeff Flake and Bob Corker, one searches in vain among the Republicans now in the Senate for even a handful, much less the 20 whose votes would be required, who show any signs of measuring up to their 1974 predecessors.Steven B. RosenfeldNew YorkTo the Editor:One point that David Leonhardt didn’t mention in his cogent case for impeaching President Trump is that many Republicans in both houses of Congress might well prefer Mike Pence — who is, after all, one of them — to Donald Trump, who is decidedly not.Paul JellinekMercerville, N.J. To the Editor:Thanks to David Leonhardt for so neatly summing up the voluminous case against President Trump. My only quibble is that he actually understates the urgency for removal. When Mr. Trump says, as he did the other day, that the current government shutdown could last months if not years, I could not avoid the queasy feeling that his insistence on a demonstrably useless border wall is, in fact, a smokescreen — that the shutdown itself is his actual endgame.It is well known that Mr. Trump thrives on chaos, and the shutdown raises that chaos to a new and alarming level. Our systems of law, transportation, tax collection, health care and security (Homeland and otherwise) all risk severe disruption the longer the shutdown lasts. While this could ultimately leave the country vastly weaker and more vulnerable, it would seem to play into Mr. Trump’s — not to mention Vladimir Putin’s — hands. As we all wait to see when, or indeed if, spineless Republican lawmakers will finally respond to this clear and present danger, it will be interesting to see if long lines at the airport can succeed where principle, ethics and patriotism have so obviously failed.Andy EdelsteinBerkley, Mich."
424,"From foreign policy developments to the growing 2020 primary field, it’s been a busy week in American politics. Here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed (and some links if you’d like to read further).___________________A new American intelligence assessment of global threats released on Tuesday concluded that North Korea is unlikely to give up its nuclear stockpiles and Iran is not taking the steps needed to make a bomb — contradicting the assumptions behind two key Trump foreign policy initiatives. President Trump lashed out at his intelligence agencies on Wednesday, defending his North Korea stance and accusing them of being “passive and naïve” about Iran.In another challenge to Venezuela’s embattled president, Nicolás Maduro, the Trump administration on Monday announced sanctions on Venezuela’s state-owned oil monopoly. On Wednesday, Mr. Maduro warned Americans that intervening in his country “would lead to a Vietnam worse than they can imagine.”American and Taliban officials agreed in principle on Monday to the outlines of a deal for withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. A question is whether the United States can avoid handing over the country to the same militants it went to war to dislodge.The United States began trade talks with China on Wednesday that could prove critical to the trajectory of the world economy, but self-inflicted economic wounds from Mr. Trump’s trade policies could mean lost leverage.The Trump administration said on Friday that it was suspending one of the last major nuclear arms control treaties with Russia, after five years of heated talks that failed to resolve American accusations that Moscow is violating the agreement.Additional Reading•  U.S. Appears to Soften Timing for List of North Korea’s Nuclear Assets•  On Venezuela, Rubio Assumes U.S. Role of Ouster in Chief•  Huawei and Top Executive Face Criminal Charges in the U.S.Another Democrat joined what is looking like one of the most diverse and crowded primary fields in history.

425,"WASHINGTON — Officially, Republicans blame Democrats for what is now the longest government shutdown in the nation’s history. Privately, many concede, the stalemate over President Trump’s demand for a border wall has been made exponentially worse by White House ineptitude on Capitol Hill, where two years of contradictory statements and actions have built up a profound lack of trust.Republican lawmakers and aides worry that Mr. Trump has misunderstood Democrats’ incentives to stand firm and that he has deputized the wrong aides to press his case. And they question who — if anyone other than the president — has the authority to resolve the impasse. They describe a dysfunctional dynamic where even senior leaders in Mr. Trump’s own party never know quite what to expect from the president.“It’s always difficult when the person you’re negotiating with changes their mind — including my wife,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, when asked about the consequences of Mr. Trump’s penchant for doing so.Mr. Cornyn noted that in the days before the shutdown began on Dec. 22, he and every other senator had voted for a stopgap government spending measure that omitted wall funding, believing that the president supported it, only to learn later that Mr. Trump had no intention of doing so. The president’s about-face — and House Republicans’ decision to add $5.7 billion in wall funding to the Senate bill — precipitated the shutdown, which reached Day 22 on Saturday.“My understanding was that the president was going to sign that, but apparently he changed his mind,” Mr. Cornyn said.Such miscues and abrupt changes of course have become a staple of Mr. Trump’s dealings with Congress. The president has now repeatedly undercut Vice President Mike Pence, to whom he has delegated the task of negotiating an end to a seemingly intractable stalemate.Mr. Pence denied on Thursday that he had ever told lawmakers that Mr. Trump would sign the bill, pressed personally by the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, to keep the government open without funding for the wall.“I said the president hasn’t made up his mind,” Mr. Pence said.But that is not how Republicans remembered it. “He got off to a bad start; he kind of pulled the rug out from under McConnell’s feet there with that one,” said Representative Francis Rooney, Republican of Florida.It happened again on Thursday. A group of Republican senators were trying to forge a deal to pair wall funding with legal status for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, often known as Dreamers. Then Mr. Pence told them that their effort would not earn Mr. Trump’s support, effectively torpedoing the talks. Members of the group said they recognized that their proposal would rise and fall according to the whims of the president.“The president is the chief executive who is going to be a part of solving this problem,” said Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, “so I must trust him.”But hours later, the president contradicted Mr. Pence, saying in McAllen, Tex., that he would be open to a “broader” immigration deal that would “simultaneously” deal with the Dreamers and a wall — if senators would bring him one they could agree on.Again, Republicans were left baffled by a president who has pitched himself as an expert in the art of the deal.“I wouldn’t want to comment on his unique style of negotiation and communications,” Mr. Rooney said. “Sometimes it’s worked very effectively for him, and sometimes it has confused a lot of people.”The concern goes beyond Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence. Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, has also been asked to help resolve the wall impasse, but Mr. Kushner has no experience in crisis negotiations on Capitol Hill, and his attempts at intervention have borne little fruit. The day before Mr. Trump’s prime-time Oval Office address to the nation, Mr. Kushner called Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a centrist known for his enthusiasm for bipartisan deals, and said the president was firmly committed to his position on the wall and did not plan to budge, according to two people familiar with the conversation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the call was private.Mr. Kushner has little relationship with Mr. Manchin, but he left the senator with the impression that the White House believed public opinion would be on the president’s side after the speech, and that Democrats would simply have to relent. That did not go over well.Inside the White House, officials privately acknowledge that the president dove into this fight with no clear end game. In several recent discussions with allies, Mick Mulvaney, the president’s acting chief of staff, has signaled he wants to reach a deal soon. During staff meetings over the past week, Mr. Mulvaney has said there was only a limited window for the White House to win the public-relations war around the shutdown.But Mr. Mulvaney, who previously headed the Office of Management and Budget, has been in this new role for less than two weeks. Government shutdowns are difficult under the best of circumstances, and Mr. Trump is going through one in the midst of a protracted staff shake-up inside the West Wing and in his cabinet.His legislative affairs chief, Shahira Knight, a former senior congressional aide who played a central role in pushing through Mr. Trump’s tax cut, has also never had to manage a protracted battle for Mr. Trump. She is well liked and respected by members of both parties, but regarded with suspicion by some of the president’s staunchest allies on Capitol Hill, including members of the conservative Freedom Caucus, who urged him to dig in for a wall fight even as she was counseling avoiding a shutdown, according to people familiar with the talks.But his acting budget director, Russell T. Vought, earned the enmity of more moderate Republicans — and virtually every seasoned House Democrat — as a conservative warrior and favorite of the Freedom Caucus.On Thursday, Republican senators who had expected Mr. Vought to attend a weekly luncheon and brief them on the president’s current thinking were surprised when he did not show up, according to one senior aide.“He relies too much on the Freedom Caucus,” said Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, who broke this month with Mr. Trump and most members of his party to support Democrat-offered bills to reopen the government. “He thinks that they are speaking for all Republicans, and they’re not.”Mr. King received a phone call from Mr. Trump last week asking him to vote against the measures to reopen the government, he said, adding that he refused. “The president has to make real concessions,” Mr. King said, “and so do the Democrats.”But Mr. Trump’s assumptions about what Democrats will give in on, and what is motivating them, have also been almost comically wrong.Early this month, at a negotiating session in the White House Situation Room, Mr. Trump and his team said Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, at the time on the eve of her election to the top post, would be more willing to give in on the wall once the vote was behind her. But with the gavel in hand and an energized new class of liberal Democrats enthusiastically supporting her, Ms. Pelosi only dug in.More recently, that line of thinking has shifted to one Mr. Trump described to senators on Tuesday in a closed-door lunch at the Capitol: that Democrats would be ready to cut a deal with him once federal employees started missing paychecks.That milestone was reached on Friday, with no deal in sight."
426,"WASHINGTON — After two months spent scorching the earth in Washington and complaining about being cooped up in the White House, President Trump is planning to return this weekend to the one place where he knows he will receive a hero’s welcome for his troubles: Mar-a-Lago, his gilded club by the sea in Palm Beach.“You would have to be insensitive not to be touched by how he has stayed there working,” said Toni Holt Kramer, the founder of Trumpettes USA, a booster group that is planning to welcome him. “I think people will have tears in their eyes because they’re so grateful that he’s come back to his home away from home.”Mr. Trump made a point of staying in Washington over the Christmas holidays — waiting, he said, for Democrats to negotiate with him on funding for a border wall — so it will be the president’s first visit to Mar-a-Lago since Thanksgiving.It will not be a complete escape — he still has no deal on the wall and a State of the Union address to give on Tuesday. But after his arrival on Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump is expected to do many of the things he always does when he is at Mar-a-Lago: dining at the owner’s table on the patio; spending the afternoon at Trump International Golf Club, about a 15-minute motorcade drive away; and never venturing anywhere in Palm Beach outside his own two properties.The first lady, Melania Trump, will travel there with him this weekend, her spokeswoman said, though Mrs. Trump tends to keep a low profile while at the resort.In the Mar-a-Lago cocoon, the president is in his most comfortable mode, friends and allies say: playing the jocular host in front of an adoring crowd.On Saturday, P.J. Schrantz, who founded Veleve, a charity that provides support for veterans, is betting on Mr. Trump to make an appearance at a $600-a-plate fund-raiser his organization is hosting in one of the club’s ballrooms. And plans for Mr. Trump’s annual Super Bowl viewing party at his golf club on Sunday evening, complete with a steak and lobster buffet, are still on.“I chose to have it there because I’ve attended galas there,” Mr. Schrantz said of his event, which will feature a George Michael tribute artist donating his time, as well as honor the astronaut Buzz Aldrin. “The members are such giving people that we could raise a couple of million dollars in an evening.”Some Mar-a-Lago members say they are already wistful about the blissful weeks without tangled traffic and increased security — a seven-minute drive from home to the club takes at least 30 minutes when Mr. Trump is in town, one said — but many will brave the roads for the chance to participate in a presidential selfie or a similar show of support.Laurence Leamer, a longtime Palm Beach resident who has known Mr. Trump since the 1990s and is the author of “Mar-a-Lago: Inside the Gates of Power at Donald Trump’s Presidential Palace,” said in an interview that even if people had an issue with the president’s policymaking, the meatloaf recipe or anything in between, they tended to keep it to themselves.“People have been trained to have like a Pavlovian reaction or something,” Mr. Leamer said. “You’re supposed to say things are great. When he asks you, ‘How are things?’ you’re not supposed to complain.”Just as the Trump International Hotel in Washington has become a safe space for the president and his supporters, Mar-a-Lago is a 20-acre oasis for those who adore all things Trump, from his zero-tolerance immigration policies to the menu items named after his children.The focus on Mr. Trump has grown to the point where some Democratic members, who have loved the club’s amenities for decades, have recently rescinded their memberships because they do not feel comfortable there anymore.“There’s a political angle to being a member now,” said Cynthia Friedman, a Democratic fund-raiser who joined the club 24 years ago and recalls playing tennis on Saturdays with Marla Maples, Mr. Trump’s second wife. “There are a lot of people who I don’t recognize. They’re not the people I used to play tennis with. Things change, and it’s time to move on.”In December, instead of sending her $1,600 in monthly dues, she joined the Beach Club, a rival members-only club, on the other side of town.But Ms. Friedman is still in the minority. Many Mar-a-Lago members book reservations weeks in advance to be in the same room with the president. And Trumpworld celebrities, like Anthony Scaramucci, the former White House communications director; the president’s son Donald Trump Jr.; and Antonio Sabato Jr., the Trump-loving model-turned-politician, have been spotted at social events and fund-raisers in Palm Beach, serving as something of a warm-up act to the main event.Karyn Turk, a business owner and the 2016 winner of the Mrs. Florida beauty pageant, said if the walls looked like they were caving in on the president in Washington, there were only blue skies in Palm Beach.“It’s a lot of hype,” she said of the special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III. “I feel like in a lot of ways, it’s still just a witch hunt.”If the “Winter White House” is a boon for the members of Mr. Trump’s exclusive club, and a respite not only for the president but also for the staff members who relocate with him, the annual decampment still raises ethical concerns.The White House has refused to release a list of those who visit the president there. And elsewhere in the Trump Organization orbit, the company said it would introduce new procedures to screen for undocumented immigrants after The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump’s flagship New Jersey golf club employed people who had entered the country illegally.And ProPublica reported last summer that three Mar-a-Lago members had amassed an unusual amount of influence in the Department of Veterans Affairs, meddling in agency initiatives and participating in the review of a contract worth some $10 billion.“It certainly seems unprecedented,” said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of the ethics watchdog CREW, “and highly troubling for people to be given significant authority over government matters seemingly primarily on the basis of being paying customers of the president.”The White House has taken at least one informal step to block people who have access to the president’s properties from asking for anything that seems to go too far. Aides have long been on the alert to intercept any notes or policy proposals from overeager supporters — including one from a guest who once helpfully tried to show the president an executive order he had drafted. Mr. Trump has at times directed his aides to give those people ample listening time even if he cannot, according to someone familiar with the process and his thinking.Security around the president may have tightened since 2017, when Mr. Trump sat on the open patio, in front of hundreds of eyeballs and iPhones pointed in his direction, discussing a response to North Korea’s missile test with Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister. But in many ways, Mr. Trump himself has not changed from the involved club owner he has always been.He has always kept close watch over who comes and goes, and pays close attention to those in the latter category.Jeff Greene, the Palm Beach billionaire who ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for governor of Florida, joined the club when he moved to Palm Beach in 2010. But he quit because, he said, “I have my own tennis court. I never loved going there.”Mr. Trump, he said, took his resignation personally. Sitting next to him at a charity event at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Greene recalled being confronted. “He went right at me, saying, ‘I can’t believe you quit the club.’ He’s figuring someone with plenty of money, why would they care about paying dues for a club?”"
427,"WASHINGTON — They think pulling out of Syria and Afghanistan would be a debacle. They think North Korea cannot be trusted. They think the Islamic State is still a threat to America. They think Russia is bad and NATO is good.The trouble is their president does not agree.More than two years into his administration, the disconnect between President Trump and the Republican establishment on foreign policy has rarely been as stark. In recent days, the president’s own advisers and allies have been pushing back, challenging his view of the world and his prescription for its problems.The growing discontent among Republican national security hawks was most evident on Tuesday when Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader and perhaps Mr. Trump’s most important partner in Congress, effectively rebuked the president by introducing a measure denouncing “a precipitous withdrawal” of American troops from Syria and Afghanistan.The senator’s repudiation came on the same day that Mr. Trump’s own intelligence chiefs, led by Dan Coats, a former Republican senator, gave Congress a radically different assessment of international threats facing the United States from the president’s own. They warned about fresh Russian efforts to interfere in American elections, predicted that North Korea would never agree to give up its nuclear weapons and made clear that the Islamic State is still plotting attacks around the world. They made no mention of Mr. Trump’s top security priority of building a wall along the southwestern border.Nearly two weeks ago, more than two-thirds of House Republicans voted to overturn the Trump administration’s move to ease sanctions on Russian companies linked to a prominent oligarch, Oleg V. Deripaska. And last week even more House Republicans voted to bar Mr. Trump from withdrawing from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as he privately suggested to aides several times last year.“Perhaps as we now pivot to the presidential elections, the Republicans may finally be thinking, well, maybe we ought to recalibrate a little here and understand there are real risks and we have to provide a check and balance on the commander in chief in whatever ways we can,” said Wendy Sherman, an under secretary of state in the Obama administration.Many traditional Republicans have been uneasy about Mr. Trump’s foreign policy since the beginning and from time to time have pushed back, most notably in 2017 when Congress nearly unanimously passed sanctions on Russia over the president’s objections. But the rupture of recent days comes amid disgruntlement over the 35-day partial government shutdown that ultimately failed to achieve Mr. Trump’s goal of extracting money for his border wall.“We’ve had a couple of rapid-fire shocks to the system,” said Eric S. Edelman, under secretary of defense under President George W. Bush now at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.In addition to the shutdown, he cited Mr. Trump’s abruptly announced decision to pull American forces from Syria, resulting in the  resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and quickly followed by the president vowing to withdraw half of American troops from Afghanistan.“There’s no dearth of evidence of the disconnect between the president and Republican orthodoxy,” said Mr. Edelman, a longstanding critic of Mr. Trump. But Mr. Edelman noted that the disagreement has been rooted in Congress. “As you look at the Republican Party in the electorate, I think it’s lining up a little more with the president because I think he’s shifting Republican voters more on things like trade and Russia, maybe on Syria and Afghanistan.”Indeed, many of Mr. Trump’s supporters have cheered his more protectionist stance on trade and the tariff wars with China as well as American allies. Likewise, many Trump supporters have grown weary of overseas military ventures that never seem to end and therefore applaud his moves to bring home American troops. Polls have even detected a shift in Republican views on Russia, which throughout the Cold War was a unifying force in the party.In Republican circles in Washington, however, the unease coincides with a critical juncture in Mr. Trump’s foreign policy. His pullouts from Syria and Afghanistan come as trade talks with China head toward a climactic deadline and Mr. Trump prepares to get together next month with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, for their second summit meeting after an initial encounter in Singapore last year.Olivia Enos, a policy scholar on Asia at the Heritage Foundation, said doubts had grown about Mr. Trump’s negotiations with North Korea to eliminate its nuclear program.“Many initially welcomed the president’s pursuit of diplomacy in North Korea,” she said. “But after Singapore, many questioned whether North Korea was sincere in coming to the negotiating table. Since that time, North Korea has continued to play hard to get, calling its sincerity to denuclearize into further question.”Some analysts said it was the way Mr. Trump makes his decisions as much as the decisions themselves that rattle the foreign policy establishment. Announcing the Syria pullout by Twitter without preparing the allies or framing the public explanations left even some of the president’s strongest supporters in Washington unnerved.“I don’t think Leader McConnell or anyone else wants to take the wheel from the president or even give him rudder direction,” said Frederic C. Hof, a former State Department official who worked on Syria and is now diplomat in residence at Bard College. “They want to be sure he’s at the helm and he knows he has a crew. They want real deliberation to take place on these tough issues. They want the president to be part of it.”The administration has yet to even agree with itself on the state of affairs in Syria. At first, Mr. Trump declared the Islamic State defeated, then said it was not but could be finished off by others.Patrick M. Shanahan, the acting defense secretary who took over for Mr. Mattis, predicted on Tuesday that the terrorist group would lose its final stronghold in Syria by next month. “Ninety-nine-point-five percent plus of the ISIS-controlled territory has been returned to the Syrians,” he said. “Within a couple of weeks, it’ll be 100 percent.”Mr. McConnell seemed less than convinced. In a speech introducing his measure on Tuesday, he took on Mr. Trump’s approach to the Middle East. “Simply put, while it is tempting to retreat to the comfort and security of our shores, there is still a great deal of work to be done,” he said. “And we do know that left untended, these conflicts will reverberate in our own cities.”While not mentioning Mr. Trump by name, Mr. McConnell directly rebutted the president’s argument about the limits of American responsibility for patrolling the globe. “We are not the world’s policeman,” the senator said. “But we are the leader of the free world. And it is incumbent upon the United States to lead.”The White House declined to comment on Tuesday. Mr. McConnell attached the amendment to a bill intended to extend aid to Israel and offer protections to state and local governments that refuse to do business with companies that boycott Israel. The Senate advanced the main bill on Tuesday on a 76-to-22 vote, with all the negative votes coming from Democrats.About a half-dozen announced or possible Democratic presidential candidates voted against the bill, defying their party leaders, who favored it; just one of the potential candidates, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, voted for it.Mr. McConnell’s decision to offer his measure on Syria and Afghanistan, which has no binding force, was notable in part because he has sought to avoid open rifts with the president. Unlike current or former Republican senators like Jeff Flake of Arizona or Mitt Romney of Utah, Mr. McConnell rarely speaks out against Mr. Trump, preferring to keep focused on mutual priorities like judicial appointments.But from time to time, he has made a point of staking out the more traditional Republican position. “Look, Senator McConnell has a different worldview than the president does,” said Antonia Ferrier, a former adviser. “He’s a national security hawk who believes American strength in the world is critical.”“It’s pretty clear,” she added, “he wanted to send a message to both our enemies and our allies with this amendment that many in America continue to view ISIS and Al Qaeda as a threat in Syria and Afghanistan.”And pretty clearly a message to the White House as well."
428,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. The U.S. partial government shutdown is over (for now), Venezuela faces an international ultimatum, and the Afghan war could be near its end. Here’s the latest: President Trump temporarily reopened the government, but the clock is ticking. He warned that he was ready to shut down parts of the government again or bypass Congress altogether if Republicans and Democrats can’t agree on funding for a border wall by Feb. 15. The question in the meantime is whether the divided government can produce any results.On the same day the president bowed to pressure, the special counsel indicted a decades-long adviser of his, Roger Stone, and revealed the most direct link yet between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks’ effort to release hacked Democratic Party emails.Details: Here’s a profile of Mr. Stone — an eccentric Nixon apostle and self-described dirty trickster — and an explanation of what his indictment means. And here is a visual representation of the Trump campaign’s extensive contacts with Russian nationals and WikiLeaks. Analysis: The shutdown and the Stone indictment may have hurt the president’s leverage. According to some estimates, the American economy lost at least $6 billion during the 35-day stalemate. And Mr. Trump’s poll numbers were down, stirring concerns among Republican leaders about his ability to navigate the next two years.European countries including Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain urged President Nicolás Maduro to schedule new elections within eight days.If Mr. Maduro doesn’t commit to fresh elections, the European governments say they will recognize the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as interim president.Analysis: The ultimatum presents a new layer of uncertainty in a deepening crisis. Mr. Guaidó has urged protesters to keep the pressure on the government “if they dare to kidnap me.”Mr. Maduro, appearing to be striking a conciliatory tone, backed down from demanding that all American diplomats leave the country. Over the past year, the Trump administration has embarked on a global campaign to pressure allies to prevent Huawei and other Chinese companies from helping build out 5G networks.The U.S. has suggested to Poland that future deployments of American troops could hinge on whether the country works with Huawei. And in Germany, American officials warned that working with Huawei could pose a security risk to NATO.Why: The U.S. believes that whoever controls the high-speed 5G internet networks will have an economic, military and intelligence edge for much of this century. The Trump administration therefore calculates that Beijing — and companies perceived to be working for the Chinese government — must be shut out.What’s next? The U.S. campaign may complicate the round of trade talks with China that begin in Washington this week, particularly as Beijing seeks to free Huawei’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who was arrested in Canada at America’s request.The U.S. and the Taliban wrapped up six days of negotiations to end the 17-year conflict in Afghanistan. Both sides reported progress — a first in nine years of intermittent peace efforts.Details: Though much remains to be ironed out, the deal would kick off a phased withdrawal of American troops in exchange for a Taliban cease-fire. The Taliban would also have to pledge not to allow international terrorist groups to use Afghanistan as a planning hub. How the Taliban would share power with the Afghan government remains to be resolved.Caution: Most observers don’t believe Afghan forces can stand up against the Taliban without American support.Fear: The idea of a U.S. troop withdrawal worries Afghan women, who fear that their rights will be taken away.  The toll: The war’s toll has been immense: At least 62,000 Afghan military and police officers have been killed, along with possibly as many Taliban — and more than 24,000 Afghan civilians over the last decade alone. One photographer set out to capture the makeshift prosthetics some Afghans use.Coming this week: Britain’s Parliament votes on amendments to Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan, and the U.S. Federal Reserve meets (but will probably not raise interest rates).Germany: A panel of various interest groups laid out a plan to end the country’s use of coal power within two decades.Brazil: A dam collapse that left 58 dead and 305 missing is the deadliest mining accident in the country’s history. Alarm over a second dam spread panic and raised outrage about the industry’s perceived impunity. Singapore: The city-state has landmarks of Brutalist architecture — built by a 1970s movement partly influenced by a similar one in postwar Britain — and they are incubating gritty, artsy subcultures that belie the image of tidy streets and often-authoritarian governance. Some of the landmarks are on the verge of being sold, prompting calls to save them. Facebook: Mark Zuckerberg plans to merge the social media platform’s messaging services — WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger — at a time when the company has been scarred by scandal. The services will continue to operate as stand-alone apps but will allow users to communicate across the platforms.The Holocaust: On her way to visit Auschwitz, our reporter found “Heil Hitler” signs and other Nazi swag at a flea market in Poland, where regulations on such sales are rarely enforced.Spain: The authorities said they had found the body of a 2-year-old boy who fell into a well nearly two weeks ago. Gandhi: Around the world, the man who led India into independence is still revered as a peaceful revolutionary.

429,"WASHINGTON — Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, spent the last two weeks hammering out a deal on federal spending and border security with colleagues from both parties, reassured by a sense that Congress was finally asserting itself as a civil, stabilizing force.The feeling did not last. On Friday, President Trump mounted one of the most serious executive branch challenges to congressional authority in decades, circumventing Congress with an emergency declaration. It would allow him to unilaterally divert billions of dollars to a border wall and presented his Republican allies on Capitol Hill, who labored on a legislative compromise, with the excruciating choice of either defending their institution or bowing to his whims.The president’s move left Senate Republicans sharply divided, and it remains to be seen whether they will act collectively to try to stop Mr. Trump or how far into uncharted territory they are willing to follow a headstrong president operating with no road map beyond his own demands.“With him you always have to expect the unexpected,” said Ms. Capito, speaking on the phone from her kitchen in Charleston, W.Va., exhausted from a week of late-night talks at the Capitol.The Republican resistance to Mr. Trump’s emergency declaration was much more pronounced in the Senate than in the House, where a few Republicans — in the minority but more closely aligned to Mr. Trump — groused. But most of the conservative rank and file embraced it.After threatening to kill the spending compromise needed to keep the government open, Mr. Trump opted to cite a national emergency to pry loose additional funding to build a wall longer than the 55 miles in the bipartisan agreement. It was the divisive step that Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, Ms. Capito and most other Republicans in the Senate had forcefully urged him not to take, because it would establish a precedent they feared future Democratic presidents would use against them.The decision left Mr. McConnell, a professed guardian of the Senate’s prerogatives and power, joining with Mr. Trump in supporting an executive branch end run greater than any of the incursions into the legislative process he often accused President Obama of pursuing. Fellow senators said Mr. McConnell, a former member of the Appropriations Committee, was unhappy with the declaration but saw it as the only way to pass the spending bill.Some top Republicans, led by Mr. McConnell, pivoted quickly to say they supported the president’s action because it was the only option left to him after Congress failed to meet his demands for wall funding. Mr. McConnell has even begun offering the president strategic advice on how best to push his plan, aides said.But Mr. McConnell is also warning Mr. Trump of the damage it could inflict on the party heading into the 2020 elections. Other Republicans portrayed it as a gross violation of the constitutional separation of powers, a blatant disregard by the president for Congress’s fundamental role in determining how federal dollars are spent.“He is usurping congressional authority,” Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a veteran member of the Appropriations Committee, said in an interview. “If the president can reallocate for his purposes billions of dollars in federal funding that Congress has approved for specific purposes and have been signed into law, that has the potential to render the appropriations process meaningless.”Several other Senate Republicans publicly and privately joined Ms. Collins in describing the move as a flagrant breach of congressional jurisdiction and a dangerous precedent. Their numbers raised the clear possibility that enough Republican defectors could join with Senate Democrats to provide a majority to disapprove of the president’s decision should the opportunity arise.Four Republicans might be enough to join with Senate Democrats and pass legislation rebuking the president, and leadership aides put the number of potential defectors as high as 10. But the unrest seemed well short of the sort of partywide revolt necessary to override a veto by Mr. Trump of any legislative attempt to prevent his declaration of an emergency, leaving a legal challenge as the only recourse.“I would not vote for disapproval,” said Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the Appropriations Committee chairman who led the spending negotiations. “He’s got the power to defend the country, to defend the borders, to protect the people as commander in chief. I believe the courts would uphold him on this.”Despite reservations about many of the actions taken by Mr. Trump and the White House over the past two years, most congressional Republicans have been reluctant to put too much distance between themselves and the president given his grip on Republican voters, many of whom consider the wall a national necessity. Mr. Trump exerts a powerful hold on his party, and lawmakers are cowed by the belief that opposing him will end in their political destruction.Still, the emergency declaration was a direct assault on the ability of lawmakers themselves to restrain the president, and it raised expectations that more could balk at what was widely viewed as a serious case of executive overreach.“Somebody is going to have to say enough is enough,” said Trent Lott, the former Senate leader from Mississippi, who questioned the wisdom of the move.Even those senators who said they were willing to abide by the president’s decision did so grudgingly, acknowledging that it was a bad way to govern and could have significant consequences.“I don’t see anything that necessarily violates the law, but that is a very different question from whether we should be doing it,” said Senator Mike Lee, a conservative Republican of Utah who is known for his view that Congress has handed over too much power to the executive branch.“We have relinquished power voluntarily because we don’t want to make judgment calls that make people angry, so we leave it to the executive,” he said. “It’s almost as if Congress doesn’t want to go through the difficult task of lawmaking.”Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida spoke for many House Republicans in praising the president’s action. “I’m proud of our president for boldly declaring he will not allow politics to stand in the way of the United States’ national security interests,” said Mr. Gaetz, a Trump ally.Democrats were united in their condemnation, accusing Mr. Trump of claiming a false crisis because he could not win over Congress with his argument. They said the president was so desperate to build the wall as a difficult re-election campaign loomed that he was willing to shred the Constitution to do so.“This is not how you use national emergencies,” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, a former White House chief of staff to President Barack Obama. “He is literally creating a constitutional crisis because he has a campaign crisis.”With Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress during his first term, Mr. Trump never had to issue a veto. But that streak could be broken with a Democratic-led House joining with Democrats in the Senate and the right number of Republicans to support legislation voicing disapproval of the emergency declaration.Party strategists said a veto could even bolster Mr. Trump by showing his backers that he was willing to take on Congress over his wall and that it was unlikely there would be enough votes to override it. The divide, though, could become a political problem for embattled Republican incumbents up for re-election next year, like Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, who will face competing calls back home to break with the president or stick with him.Some Republican senators said they were less concerned about the political implications than the effect on Congress. Members of the Appropriations Committee said that their spending bills had been carefully constructed and that shifting money could stall projects that both they and federal agencies including the Pentagon had deemed necessary. And they fear consolidating too much power in the hands of a president.“It is inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution because, after the American Revolution against a king, our founders chose not to create a chief executive with the power to tax the people and spend their money any way he chooses,” said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee.“This is a fundamental constitutional responsibility of Congress,” said Ms. Collins. “We should be opposing this strongly.”There is a small chance that Mr. Trump will accept a list of existing programs, compiled by Mr. Alexander, that Republicans believe could be used for wall money, rendering the emergency declaration moot. But nobody is holding out much hope that will happen.Ms. Capito said she would spend the holiday weekend weighing what to do next. She encouraged Mr. Trump to do the same.“He’s got to ask himself, ‘What are the ramifications of what I’m doing?’” she said. “If the resolution comes from the House to the Senate, where are those votes going to fall? What does that do to my momentum? He’s got to be considering that, I’m certain. Maybe he’s willing to take whatever could happen, maybe that’s not bothering him.”"

Here’s the sign-up.)The president plans to speak from the Oval Office at 9 p.m. Eastern to discuss what he calls a crisis at the border with Mexico, and the need to address it before a partial government shutdown can end. Mr. Trump’s demand of $5.7 billion for a border wall is at the heart of a budget impasse that has led to the second-longest shutdown in U.S. history.Today, Democrats in the House plan to start the process of passing individual appropriations bills to reopen the government, beginning with legislation that would fund the Treasury Department, including the I.R.S.Notable: In making his case for a wall, Mr. Trump has said his predecessors in the Oval Office had admitted to him that they should have built the barriers themselves.

432,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. President Trump agreed to reopen the federal government for three weeks while negotiations continued over border security, backing down after a monthlong standoff with Democrats over funding for his border wall.The decision paved the way for Congress to pass spending bills as soon as Friday. The stopgap measure will restore normal operations at a series of federal agencies until Feb. 15 and begin paying the 800,000 federal workers who have been furloughed or forced to work for free for 35 days.The plan includes no money for the wall and was essentially the same approach Mr. Trump rejected at the end of December. But he cautioned that the cease-fire might be only temporary.“We really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or steel barrier,” Mr. Trump said in the Rose Garden. “If we don’t get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on Feb. 15, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and Constitution of the United States to address this emergency.”Airport delays this morning added to the urgency of a solution. La Guardia Airport in New York was closed to arriving flights, and a shortage of air traffic controllers triggered significant delays across the Northeast._____2. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, revealed the most direct link yet between the parallel efforts of the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks to damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid.In a seven-count indictment against Roger Stone, above, an informal adviser to President Trump, the special counsel disclosed evidence that a top campaign official had instructed Mr. Stone to get information from WikiLeaks about thousands of hacked Democratic emails. That effort began well after it was widely reported that Russian intelligence operatives were behind the hack.The indictment makes no mention of whether Mr. Trump played a role, though Mr. Mueller did leave a curious clue about how high in the campaign the effort reached: A senior campaign official “was directed” by an unnamed person to contact Mr. Stone about additional WikiLeaks releases that might hurt the Clinton campaign, according to the court document.Who is Roger Stone, anyway? Here’s what we know about him and his colorful career._____3. Venezuela’s opposition leader made his first public appearance since he declared himself president, and told supporters to keep pressure on the authorities “if they dare to kidnap me.”The rally was peaceful and there was no indication Juan Guaidó would be arrested, as many feared.At the same time, President Nicolás Maduro took a more conciliatory approach than before and called for dialogue. The request appeared to signal that the standoff between the government and Mr. Guaidó may be shifting.Opposition talks with the military may be a factor. Venezuela’s top brass swore allegiance to Mr. Maduro, but an opposition lawmaker said her colleagues were holding discreet talks with military leaders in hopes that they could build enough support to get large factions to switch sides._____4. Jennifer Glover was assaulted by her fellow guards at a nuclear site in Nevada, she said.And instead of responding to her complaints, the government contractor she worked for eventually fired her.The encounter followed months of sexual harassment that she said began soon after she was hired. Even after reporting the abuse, she continued to face harassment and intimidation. She was reprimanded for calling out sick — to avoid her attackers, she said — and ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluations.“Work went from being so exciting to being a nightmare,” she said._____5. Mark Zuckerberg once vowed to keep WhatsApp and Instagram independent. Now he’s changing course to keep their users inside Facebook’s ecosystem.Facebook’s chief executive has mandated that the social network’s three messaging services — the third is Facebook Messenger — be knitted together. The three services will continue operating as stand-alone apps, but their underlying messaging infrastructure will be unified.The changes also raise questions of data privacy because of how user information may be shared among the services. Today, WhatsApp allows people to sign up with only a phone number. By contrast, Facebook and Facebook Messenger ask for users’ real names.Separately, Amazon’s new facial recognition technology had more difficulty identifying the gender of female and darker-skinned faces than similar services from IBM and Microsoft._____6. Can paid parental leave be too much of a good thing?The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is cutting its unusually generous paid leave in half — to six months — because yearlong leaves were impairing its work, it said. It is also adding a $20,000 stipend for new parents to spend on child care costs.The Gates Foundation’s experience highlights the challenges of devising effective family policies, especially in the U.S. — the only industrialized country not to offer paid leave.On top of questions about whether leave should be mandatory and who should pay for it, there has been little agreement on the right length of time. International evidence points to some answers: Around six months seems to be the magic number. And paid leave is not enough: Financial assistance for child care has a bigger effect on women’s ability to keep working._____7. It was nothing but a box of paperwork.In 1979, a Navy man credited with starting the quirky Hawaiian Iron Man Triathlon was reassigned to the mainland. He was looking for someone to run the third edition of the race — and handed off some papers to a couple who said they would do it.They went on to make the Ironman into an iconic test of endurance and one of the world’s premier sports brands. A Chinese conglomerate paid $650 million for it in 2015. Above, bikes awaiting their riders at the 2018 Ironman World Championship Triathlon.And because of that box, all these years later, the fight over who rightfully owns the race endures.Separately, have you noticed the N.B.A.’s scoring explosion this season? It has to do with the league’s emphasis on pace and 3-pointers, combined with an edict to make defenders back off._____8. Roy Wood Jr. is best known as a correspondent on “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah.”But he has made a niche for himself as one of the country’s foremost comic voices on social issues — especially those affecting African-Americans.He almost didn’t make it this far: He grew up among gang members in Birmingham, Ala., and was arrested in his junior year of college for stolen credit cards. His probation officer encouraged him to keep doing comedy. Tonight, his first Comedy Central special premieres.In the special, Mr. Wood jokes that the national anthem controversy is especially absurd because the tune is based on a British song: “Now, you’re running around telling stolen people in a stolen land that they should stand for a stolen song?”And no matter how much time you have this weekend, we have TV recommendations for you._____9. Ninety-nine percent of the U.S. population lives under light-polluted skies.After one math teacher from Washington, D.C., visited the country’s first International Dark Sky Reserve, 1,400 square miles in Idaho, he wondered how to make sure people know places like it existed.“A lot of people who live in an urban setting and who look like me will never get to see the beauty of our world in its natural state,” he told our graphic journalist.“There is no lock on the door. Nobody is trying to keep people of color out. But not having the opportunity to know about it, that’s a lock.”_____10.

433,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. President Trump plans to declare a national emergency, Amazon nixes a New York headquarters and Britain’s Parliament delivered more Brexit chaos. Here’s the latest: A two-month war of attrition between the president and Congress has effectively ended, but at the possible cost of a new battle. The White House announced that President Trump would sign a border deal passed by the Senate that averts a partial government shutdown, but also that he would declare a national emergency in order to circumvent Congress and unilaterally allocate billions of dollars for his promised border wall. Here’s how a national emergency declaration would work. It could provoke a constitutional clash between the president and Congress over control of the federal purse. Lawmakers would have two avenues of opposition: legislation, which Mr. Trump could veto, and the courts.Legal specialists warned of high long-term costs to American democracy.Other news from Washington: Andrew McCabe, the former deputy F.B.I. director, said the agency was so alarmed by Mr. Trump’s decision to fire the bureau’s director, James Comey, in 2017 that Justice Department officials considered encouraging cabinet members to invoke a constitutional amendment to remove him from office.And the Senate confirmed William Barr as attorney general, despite concerns from Democrats that he might not make public the findings of his department’s Russia investigation.The technology giant announced that it would not “move forward” with plans to build a sprawling corporate campus in Long Island City, Queens, after stiff opposition from some local lawmakers and unions empowered by the rise of Democratic political strength.Amazon had forecast that the campus would have created more than 25,000 jobs.The opposition: A point of contention was the $3 billion package of incentives and subsidies the city and state agreed to — their largest ever, dedicated to one of the world’s richest companies. City officials had also agreed to remake plans for the Queens waterfront and give the company’s chief, Jeff Bezos, access to a helicopter pad.There was also concern over the company’s anti-union practices and the changes its huge presence would bring to Queens. Before Amazon’s announcement, we looked at the resistance.Prime Minister Theresa May’s efforts to salvage her Brexit plan suffered a significant parliamentary defeat. Details: Parliament rejected a motion in support of Mrs. May’s tattered Brexit strategy, which hinges on reopening negotiations with the E.U. The motion was intended to reassure the E.U. that Parliament would back Mrs. May in any negotiations. Instead, lawmakers show that they aren’t rallying around her or any plan. The debate: The motion was defeated because of a widening divide within the Conservative Party over whether Britain should take a “no-deal” Brexit off the table. Hard-line Brexit supporters want to lord the possibility over the E.U. as leverage, and sunk the motion to assert that prerogative. But the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, warned Britain that the balance of power was not in its favor and that it was becoming a “middling economy.” Looking ahead: Several ministers are threatening to resign if Mrs. May hasn’t secured a revised deal with the E.U. by Feb. 27. Some analysts believe the outcome of Brexit will remain unclear until a few days before the March 29 deadline.

One verse in particular — “I kiss you amid the Taliban” — has become a rallying cry.Background: Last month, the Taliban and U.S. negotiators agreed in principle to a framework for the phased withdrawal of American troops, but the Afghan government has been left out of the process. Women in particular have voiced concerns about their rights.E.U. economy: The German economy did not grow in the year’s final quarter, the government said. The news is partly an effect of President Trump’s trade policies and is a bad sign for Europe, where the middle-class has shrunk in most places since the late-2000s recession.Iran: Vice President Mike Pence lashed out at Britain, France and Germany at a conference on Middle East security, accusing them of trying to “break American sanctions” against Iran and demanding that they abandon the Iranian nuclear accord.

434,"TIJUANA — Life in Tijuana’s largest migrant shelter has begun to take on the familiar rhythms and sounds of a Central American neighborhood: Early in the morning, adults rise and get ready to go to work. Children dress for school. Mothers gather huge bundles of dirty clothes for the day’s wash. Vendors hawk coffee.“We are getting used to this life,” said Norma Pérez, 40, who left Honduras in a migrant caravan bound for the United States about two months ago with her 5-year-old son.For weeks, they walked from Central America up to the Mexican border with the United States, fleeing poverty and violence. All along the way, President Trump described the migrants as a danger, as invaders trying to crash their way into the United States. But they didn’t stop their trek north.When they arrived at the border, Tijuana was not ready for them. The conditions were deplorable, and the migrants were surprised they would not be able to apply for asylum right away. Twice, groups of migrants approached the border fence and were repelled by border patrol agents using tear gas and pepper spray.But now, life for many of the new arrivals has settled down.Mexico’s new president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has begun to make good on promises to create alternatives to immigration, and he has already rolled out a plan to increase wages along the United States-Mexico border.And the migrants themselves have begun to create a sense of community in the shelters here, like the city’s largest, known as El Barretal. They said they have no intention of turning back.Mr. Trump “should personally go to Honduras so he can see with his own eyes that we simply can’t go back, that there are no jobs, no companies, nothing,” Ms. Pérez said.So she is settling in at El Barretal, a concert venue turned into a shelter where tents are lined up in orderly rows on the clean concrete floor. For the thousands of migrants like her in El Barretal and 18 other Tijuana shelters, this is home — for now.As she waits for her chance to apply for asylum in the United States, Ms. Pérez has decided to apply for a temporary humanitarian visa in Mexico. That will let her find a job in Tijuana and support herself and her child for as long as necessary, she said.Rodolfo Figueroa, an official with the National Immigration Institute, a government agency, said most of the migrants who arrived in Tijuana with the caravan and who applied for humanitarian visas have been approved. In total, 2,200 visas have been awarded in little over a month, he said. About 1,300 migrants have either been deported or voluntarily returned to their home countries, he added.Early on a typical morning in the El Barretal shelter, migrants who already hold a temporary Mexican visa head to work at a nearby market as meat and poultry vendors. Others make their way to jobs as truck drivers, construction workers or laborers in the city’s electronics manufacturing plants.The shelter’s manager, Leonardo Nery, said the number of people living there had dropped from 3,000 a month ago to around 1,000 as some migrants found their own living arrangements in town. Others have crossed over to the United States or returned home, he said.Around 10 a.m., loudspeakers inside El Barretal announced that buses sent by the Mexican federal government had arrived to take anyone interested in Mexican humanitarian visas to an immigration office. The same voice reminded migrants to gather any trash and place it in the available cans.Around noon on most days, English classes start inside a small white tent with bright blue carpets covering the concrete floor. Puzzle pieces are spread on tables, along with drawings and crayons. Posters with names of colors hang on the walls.Darwin Bardales, an 18-year-old Honduran, has been working as a volunteer in the shelter’s English school.“It feels good to do something for the others, especially the kids,” he said. “After all, we are all in the same vulnerable situation.”The children usually take classes in English and Spanish, learning to read, to color and to eat healthy foods. This Friday, the classes got a late start: The arrival of donated teddy bears and piñatas had the children’s full attention until a female voice boomed from the loudspeaker.“Hello everybody, it’s your teacher!” the voice said. “It’s time for class, kids!”Adult migrants scattered around the camp cheered in response.Food is cooked and distributed both by private aid groups and by Mexican marines twice a day — rice, soup and sandwiches. It is a bare-bones existence, but friendships have developed and at least one wedding took place in a downtown shelter.Early on Friday, José Daniel Castro, 44, was already busy managing what has become the shelter’s corner shop, where he sells cigarettes, potato candy, soup and other basics around the clock.Mr. Castro left Honduras in mid-October. Now he buys supplies in Tijuana every morning, and he earns about $20 a day reselling them — enough to buy his own food, he said. Having been deported from the United States three times, he plans to stay in Mexico indefinitely, working as a vendor, he said.“I can work here and make a little money,” he said. “That is already more than I can say about back home. In the end, all we wanted was to work and help our loved ones back home.”Taracio Pérez stood nearby holding bottles of soda, hoping for customers.“We are fighting, and hustling,” said Mr. Pérez, who also scrubs floors in a downtown Tijuana restaurant. “The dream was and is the United States. But it has all become so difficult and dangerous for us that the best thing to do is work while we wait for things to get better.”Their first few days in Tijuana last November were chaotic, and a bitter disappointment, migrants said. The Trump administration had limited the number of asylum applicants that could be seen in a day, separated parents from their children, sent troops to patrol the frontier — and even, starting last month, shut down the federal government in a bid to get funding for a border wall.Housed initially in an open-air sports complex, the migrants saw a torrential downpour turn the ground to mud around their makeshift tents. Children started to get sick and adults grew dispirited.But to many, those hardships felt temporary — and less threatening than the conditions they had left at home. And life at El Barretal is a definite step up from those first, soaking days.Elisabeth Ponce, 38, was putting the last touches on her makeup before she started her day’s work. She came from Honduras and now has a job inside the shelter, handing out toiletries, medicine and other basic supplies.She fled Honduras, like so many others, fearing for her life after being threatened by criminal gangs. Joining the caravan was a drastic decision: It meant leaving behind her four children and venturing outside her country for the first time, knowing she had no one to help her if she ever got to the United States.Now she knows she may never get the asylum she is applying for, and that crossing illegally is dangerous. But she remains resolute.“I am going to try, regardless,” she said."
435,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.For the first two years of his presidency, it seemed like Donald Trump could, as he famously put it during his campaign, shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose his voters.Republican majorities in the House and the Senate negotiated his agenda on Capitol Hill. The majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and House Speaker Paul Ryan protected him from serious Congressional investigations, and passed a sweeping tax bill, the president’s major legislative accomplishment. G.O.P. lawmakers largely lived in fear of angering the president’s still-loyal base if they challenged him.Times have certainly changed. Mr. Trump spent the Christmas holidays complaining that he was all alone in the White House. Now, with the government in the middle of its longest-ever shutdown, his State of the Union address has been delayed indefinitely. Even his G.O.P. armor shows some tiny cracks, with a half dozen Republican senators voting on Thursday afternoon in favor of a Democratic proposal to reopen the government.So far, divided government hasn’t been a good look for Mr. Trump. And a batch of new polls released over the past few days tells a pretty unflattering story for him.• His approval rating is at an all-time low: 36 percent in a CBS News poll, 40 percent in a Politico/Morning Consult poll and 34 percent in an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.• Perhaps, most importantly, his sales pitch on the border wall hasn’t succeeded. Only 22 percent of American voters, including 40 percent of Republicans and 15 percent of independents, consider the situation along the southern border an “emergency,” according to a Fox News poll.• Only about a third agreed that the wall would make the country safer, according to the A.P. poll. Not even a majority of Republicans supported Mr. Trump’s argument that a wall would reduce the availability of illegal drugs in the United States, the poll showed.• The CBS News poll showed that seventy-one percent of Americans, including 43 percent of Republicans, do not believe the wall is worth the federal shutdown. Two-thirds of respondents want him to agree to a budget without wall funding and 60 percent see the shutdown as causing “serious problems” for the country, according to the poll.It’s unclear whether these numbers will sway the president, who spent the morning tweeting out his case for the wall. He has a history of focusing on the polling numbers that reinforce what he wants to see and discrediting the rest as “fake news.” And while proposals float around the White House for a big deal on immigration, there are certainly some in his administration who still believe Democrats will cave on the wall.But the economic pain of the shutdown is real — and spreading. There’s a little bit of noise about a primary challenge to Mr. Trump, a rumbling that grew slightly louder last week after Gov. Larry Hogan, a Maryland Republican, used his inaugural address to raise the specter of impeachment. And while shutdowns don’t generally decide elections, Democrats see an opportunity to undermine the president’s image as a master deal maker, a key piece of his political identity, ahead of 2020.Keep in mind, this is all happening before the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller, delivers his findings on the Trump campaign’s dealings with Russia. Depending what that investigation reveals, Mr. Trump could be in for a chilly spring.____________________Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We’ll try to answer it. Have a comment? We’re all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com.____________________Here at On Politics we spend a lot of time writing about the Betos, Bidens, Warrens and Sanders of the political world — the early possible stars of the 2020 Democratic primary cycle. But it takes a crowd to create a crowded field. Below those boldfaced names lurks a whole other world of presidential politics.We spoke to two men yesterday — Pete Buttigieg and former Representative John Delaney — who are definitely long shots but are hoping to have their moment on the national stage.They are probably little known beyond the world of political junkies; neither man is listed in early voting polls or has expansive lists of supporters. But both see little downside in taking their shot to become the leader of the free world.“A broad field, a wide-open field that’s a good thing for newcomers,” said Mr. Buttigieg.Wednesday was a big day for Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., who announced his presidential exploratory committee at a Hyatt hotel in Washington, D.C. The location was telling: It was chosen because it would be close to the offices of political reporters and on the sidelines of a conference for American mayors.The youngest and only gay candidate in the race, Mr. Buttigieg, 37, believes his economic record in South Bend, his youth and his military service give him an edge in a crowded field.“I’m the only one who is living a middle class lifestyle in Middle America,” he told reporters. “I get the odds but I also believe we can do something that no one else can do.”Mr. Buttigieg cast his underdog status as an advantage, saying it would allow him to be bold, though he didn’t introduce any new plans during his announcement. His last moment on the national stage? A bid for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee in 2017 that ended with Mr. Buttigieg dropping out of the race shortly before voting.Some of the questions he fielded this time around: What makes him unique? How does he stand out in a packed race? And how do you pronounce his name?Mr. Buttigieg’s official Twitter feed offered this pronunciation: BOOT-edge-edge. His husband, Chasten Buttigieg, offered some other options.Mr. Delaney, meanwhile, has been running for president for more than 18 months, after announcing his bid in an op-ed in the summer of 2017 — almost three and half years before the election. The former Maryland congressman told On Politics that he thinks he’s gaining traction in the race, citing his 20 visits to Iowa and his six campaign offices in the state.His pitch: He can bring Americans together because he’s “someone who’s not ashamed to say I’m more moderate.” That might be a tough sell in a party that’s tilted left, both on policy and tactics, during the Trump era.Still, Mr. Delaney sees a way to win. The fact that he’s able to self-fund some of his campaign makes it easier, too.“I think I break out on the ground in Iowa,” he said. “As people start figuring out the progress we’re making in Iowa I think it becomes very clear what our path is.”____________________• The shutdown could prompt government service to lose its allure, causing some civil servants to worry about a brain drain of scientists, researchers and other specialists.• No one likes traffic. But could it be a public health issue? • Vanity Fair scores the juiciest excerpt from a tell-all by a former White House aide, Cliff Sims, about his time in the Trump administration.____________________Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says he doesn’t understand why furloughed federal workers don’t just take out loans against their future paychecks._____________________Were you forwarded this newsletter?

436,"No sooner had the news of an impasse come out of a meeting room in Washington than thousands of miles away, on an island in the Pacific, Tomas Kaselionis had to start making decisions.“For me, it’s do I consider a car payment or do I pay the gas bill or the phone bill?” said Mr. Kaselionis, who is working on typhoon recovery for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, unpaid and far from home in the United States commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. “Those are conversations within the next week that I have to have with my wife.”By Saturday, the federal government will have been shut down for two weeks, a full pay cycle for federal workers. If the shutdown lasts through Monday, it will surpass the one of 2013, and if it lasts beyond the following Saturday, it will be the longest shutdown in United States history. Politicians have said they were hopeful that the standoff could be over in a matter of “days and weeks,” a reassurance that rang hollow to hundreds of thousands of federal workers who were not getting paid.[Read more: What is and is not affected by the federal government shutdown.]“They have to realize that this affects everyday people,” said Ray Coleman Jr., a corrections officer who teaches G.E.D. classes at a federal prison in Florida and is president of his local union. “It affects the boots on the ground. To me, it’s like a political chess game that they’re playing, and we seem to be pawns.”By Thursday, fallout from the shutdown was spreading fast. The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission announced on Twitter that the agency would “suspend most operations.”Federal court proceedings, to the irritation of judges, slowed as government lawyers asked for stays. The Justice Department asked to delay a hearing on a suit brought by the N.A.A.C.P. over the Trump administration’s census preparations. And a much-anticipated E.P.A. hearing on lead contamination in East Chicago, Ind., was canceled.All the while, claims for unemployment benefits were piling up; the District of Columbia said it had received about 900 claims connected to the shutdown, and the state of Maryland counted 637 at midweek. More than 350 federal workers in Colorado had filed unemployment claims.Daniel A. Sobien, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Tampa, Fla., who has been furloughed and is living on savings, said that federal workers are “tired of being political pawns.”“I realize that unfair things happen to people all the time,” he said, “but it really is unfair that because of politics, government employees have to shoulder the burden.”The impasse may be centered within a few blocks in Washington, D.C., but the federal work force shouldering the burden is spread across the country — fewer than one in five federal workers are in the Washington statistical area. Among the 800,000 federal workers affected are people with doctorates earning $100,000 a year and those making a quarter of that; workers in labs and workers in prisons; people who clean up majestic national parks and people who clean up cramped offices in the early morning hours.Among these workers, there was a widely shared sentiment of frustration, even disgust, that the people in charge seemed to lack concern for the people who actually keep the government working.“It’s indefensible to not appreciate the role and responsibility that there is to make sure the government runs smoothly,” said A. Ashley Tabaddor, a federal immigration judge in Los Angeles and president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, who is currently on furlough.Brian Turner, an officer with the Transportation Security Administration at the Philadelphia airport, said he has for six years enjoyed being “the last line of defense” for people getting on airplanes. He endured a 16-day shutdown in 2013, but at the time did not have a house or a family, and the politics back then, as fierce as they were, just seemed more predictable, he said.“I love working for the country,” he said. But, he added, “I can’t go two months without a paycheck.”About 420,000 of the workers affected are classified as essential and have been working without knowing when they will next be paid. About 380,000 federal workers have been furloughed. Unions and federal agencies have not provided demographic information about the workers affected, but have said that the group is generally similar to the broader federal work force, some 2.1 million nonmilitary workers.The work force is spread out nationally, with thousands of federal employees in every state, tens of thousands in states like Georgia, Pennsylvania and Oklahoma, and the highest percentage in California. According to officials at unions which represent federal employees, the shutdown seemed to be affecting workers outside of the Washington, D.C. area most severely.Less-populated areas may be hit disproportionately hard, including small towns such as Pollock, La., where the biggest employer is a federal penitentiary.“Our members get an average take-home pay of $500 a week, and next week they aren’t going to get that,” said J. David Cox Sr., president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents about 40,000 Bureau of Prisons employees who have been furloughed in the shutdown. “The places that are getting slammed are the ones, like Pollock, that you can’t find with a GPS.”In addition to the federal workers, thousands of people who work for contractors — cleaning offices or serving food — are missing wages, but are not considered in proposed legislation that promises back pay once a deal is worked out.“Just to think about it, it’s so frightening,” said Donna Kelly, a contracted security guard who works — or did work, before the museums closed on Wednesday — at the Smithsonian Institution. She had applied for unemployment benefits, but was still waiting for her application to be processed. “I really don’t know what I’ll do until I’m actually feeling the pressure.”Nearly all of those affected, the contractors, furloughed employees and employees who were working without pay, were experiencing a growing, gnawing anxiety. They were keeping track of the news: Mr. Trump’s demands for a border wall, the daily shifts over terms of an imaginable deal, the vows by Democrats and Republicans not to budge. But many said they were doing so simply to find out if they could pay mortgages, plan vacations or take care of car payments.“I don’t think anybody who works for the government is worried about if this wall gets built or not,” said La-Shanda Palmer, a T.S.A. employee in Philadelphia. “They want to go back to work.” She was concerned about paying her bills and racking up late fees, and providing for her family. She said she called her utility company hoping for an accommodation; she did not get a break.“Right now, the stress level is at 1,000,” said Kutonya King, a correctional counselor at the federal prison in Jesup, Ga. Like other corrections officers, Ms. King said she was concerned about the safety of the inmates and of her fellow workers, who will have more and more to occupy their minds if the shutdown drags on. An officer at another prison wondered how many of her colleagues would end up staying home because they could not afford gas.Still, Ms. King said some inmates had offered sympathy. That seemed to be more than workers were hearing from Washington.“I don’t particularly blame a particular party; I think it’s across the board,” Ms. King said. “They need to think about the people.”Ms. King has been making plans in case the shutdown lasts the promised days and weeks, having already canceled a long-planned family trip for the holidays. She may need that money to pay bills, she said.Later on Thursday afternoon, back in Washington, a key Republican senator suggested to reporters a new possible timeline for the shutdown: “months and months.”"
437,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Today’s declaration is intended to allow Mr. Trump to access billions of dollars to build a wall on the southwestern border that Congress refused to pay for, transforming a policy dispute into a confrontation over separation of powers.Mr. Trump plans to divert $3.6 billion to the wall from military construction projects, White House officials said. He would also use more traditional presidential budgetary discretion to tap $2.5 billion from counternarcotics programs and $600 million from a Treasury Department asset forfeiture fund.A spending package that Congress passed on Thursday included none of the money that Mr. Trump had demanded for his wall. White House officials said Mr. Trump would sign that bill, which would avert another government shutdown, either later today or on Saturday.The impact: Legal experts said the decision to circumvent Congress would violate constitutional norms and set a precedent of presidents acting unilaterally to achieve their policy goals. What’s next: Lawmakers could override the emergency declaration, but they most likely wouldn’t have the votes to overcome a presidential veto. They could also challenge the decision in court.The Daily: Today’s episode is about the dispute.The company’s announcement on Thursday that it was scrapping plans for headquarters in Queens exposed deep disagreements within the Democratic Party in New York and beyond. It also highlighted how cities try to lure wealthy companies with lavish incentives financed by taxpayers. Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio had promoted the deal, which Amazon said would create 25,000 jobs. But activists and other elected officials, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,  said the company didn’t deserve nearly $3 billion in tax breaks. Read more about the political fallout.The background: Polls showed that New Yorkers largely supported the plan, but Amazon learned that “happy customers don’t necessarily translate to political power,” our technology columnist writes.Since the recession of the late 2000s, the middle class has shrunk in more than two-thirds of the countries in the European Union. It’s a decline similar to one in the U.S., and while middle-class households are more prevalent in Europe, they face new levels of vulnerability.Our correspondent reports on the trend from Spain, which made great progress after the financial crisis but where economic uncertainty persists.Another angle: Germany’s economy barely avoided sliding into a recession in the final quarter of last year, data released on Thursday showed. One reason is the global trade conflict.The Trump family business, which faces scrutiny from federal prosecutors and congressional investigators, is shelving plans for two hotel lines.Eric Trump, who runs the business with his brother Donald Trump Jr., said in a statement on Thursday: “We live in a climate where everything will be used against us, whether by the fake news or by Democrats who are only interested in presidential harassment and wasting everyone’s time, barraging us with nonsense letters.”The details: An ethics code that President Trump was encouraged to adopt has prevented the company from doing new business abroad while he’s in office. In the U.S., the firm has called off plans for a new hotel in the Mississippi Delta.First they confused Silicon Valley. Then they confused Australia.

438,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. The crisis in Venezuela deepens, the U.S. shutdown continues and a hedge fund billionaire sets a real estate record. Here’s the latest: A day after an opposition leader proclaimed himself the country’s rightful president, the military declared its loyalty to President Nicolás Maduro, deepening the political crisis.Details: The Trump administration recognized the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as the legitimate leader of Venezuela, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on nations across the Americas to do the same. (Several, including Canada and Denmark, already have).Mr. Maduro, in turn, cut ties with the U.S. and ordered American diplomats to leave Venezuela. But the U.S. said it would not heed the order because Mr. Guaidó had invited them to stay.China, which has invested billions in Venezuela, urged all sides to “resolve their political differences.” Russia warned the U.S. not to intervene in Venezuela’s domestic affairs and Mexico has notably held back on recognizing Mr. Guaidó.Background: Venezuela’s government has overseen the near-total collapse of its economy. Here’s a primer on how the country got to this dire situation.What next? Still unclear. Mr. Guaidó said he intended to serve as interim president until the next election. And the Trump administration said it was ready to send the country $20 million in aid. But with the military standing by Mr. Maduro, an analyst told us, commanders appear to have concluded Mr. Maduro has the upper hand for now.Lawmakers voted against two competing proposals to reopen the government, sending Congressional leaders back to the drawing board for a bipartisan solution to end the impasse.Details: Each party presented its own measure. The Republican proposal included $5.7 billion in funding for President Trump’s border wall, paired with legal protections for some immigrants. The Democratic proposal would have temporarily reopened the government until Feb. 8, but omitted wall funding.What’s next? Lawmakers and aides in both parties expressed hope that the double-barreled losses would break the logjam that has gripped Washington since the partial shutdown began. The urgency is mounting, with 800,000 federal workers set to miss their second paycheck on Friday.House Democrats said they were considering giving Mr. Trump as much as $5.2 billion for border security — but not for a wall.What about the State of the Union? Mr. Trump agreed to delay the landmark speech, originally scheduled for next Tuesday, until after the government reopens.Go deeper: Aviation workers’ unions warned that the shutdown presented an “unconscionable” safety threat for air travel. And nearly six weeks in, the shutdown is eroding the good will of highly skilled federal workers who chose public service over higher-paying private employment.Almost two months after a Chinese researcher, He Jiankui, announced that he had created the first genetically edited babies, scientists are trying to devise international standards that would prevent such experiments in the future.While most researchers agree that major health and science institutions should act quickly, they differ on the best approach.Background: Some U.S. researchers said Dr. He told them beforehand about his experiment — in which he disabled a gene in the embryos that allows a person to become infected by H.I.V. — but they were unable to stop him, in part because China’s system is so complex that the scientists didn’t know who to alert. A global system would ideally eliminate that problem.Why it matters: Scientists fear that genetically edited babies could develop unknown health problems that could be inherited by subsequent generations. They also worry about attempts to alter genes for physical features, intelligence or athletic prowess.What’s next? The World Health Organization is assembling a panel to create global standards and the World Economic Forum also had a discussion on the issue.A growing number of start-ups are selling insights gleaned from small, relatively cheap satellites, known as “cube satellites.”Background: The Chinese province of Guangdong stopped publishing a monthly health report on its manufacturing sector in October, after five consecutive months of declining production amid the trade war with the U.S.But a small company in San Francisco found a way to get that crucial data using photos and infrared images captured by satellites, and now it’s selling it to hedge funds, banks and other investors.Why it matters: Satellites already monitor everything from how busy retailers’ parking lots are, to oil tank levels, to illegal mining activity — giving companies a new competitive advantage.And the niche seems set for further growth: Nearly 730 satellites were launched in the last decade, and another 2,220 are expected to follow in the next ten years.Afghanistan: U.S. and Taliban negotiators are close to striking a deal in which American troops would withdraw in exchange for a pledge from the insurgents that the country wouldn’t become a terrorist base again, officials said. Though many details remain unclear, Western diplomats said they expected an announcement imminently.China: The Foreign Ministry said Yang Hengjun, the Australian writer detained this week, was suspected of “endangering national security” — making him the third foreigner held on that sweeping charge. Australian Embassy officials in Beijing have been pushing for access to him.Censorship: China appears to have blocked Microsoft’s search engine, Bing, despite the company’s efforts to comply with the country’s restrictions — a potential sign that Western companies can do little to persuade Beijing to let them into the world’s largest internet market.Renault: The French carmaker announced new leadership a day after Carlos Ghosn resigned as chairman and chief executive from his Tokyo jail cell. Jean-Dominique Senard, the new chairman, and Thierry Bolloré, the new C.E.O., are tasked with mending Renault’s alliance with Nissan. Here’s what’s at stake.Indonesia: A Christian politician from the capital city of Jakarta was released from prison after serving two years for blasphemy against Islam, a case that led to vast protests against the former governor and highlighted the rise of political Islam in the country.Malaysia: The ousted former Prime Minister Najib Razak, who now faces dozens of corruption-related charges, pleaded his case to the public in a music video. He posted his Malay-language rendition of the R&B hit “Kiss and Say Goodbye,” with new lyrics, on Facebook.North Korea: Kim Jong-un praised President Trump for his “unusual determination” to settle the countries’ nuclear arms dispute through a second summit meeting, according to local news media, and said he would work “step by step” with the U.S.Ukraine: Former president Viktor Yanukovych was found guilty of treason for inviting Russia to invade the country and reverse a pro-Western revolution five years ago, the first ruling to formally determine he served Russian interests. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison.$238 million: That’s what a hedge fund billionaire paid for an apartment in New York City — the highest price ever paid for a home in the U.S.Overlooked no more: Mabel Stark became the world’s most celebrated tiger trainer, spending most of her life among the big cats at circuses and theme parks.

He wrote hundreds of poems and songs before his life was cut short by illness, including the New Year’s Eve favorite “Auld Lang Syne.” His use of vernacular is a barrier for English speakers, but it is difficult to overstate the esteem he commands in Scotland and in the hearts of expatriates like this writer, who grew up in Burns’s home of Ayrshire. His verses gave dignity and voice to the disenfranchised, and he is beloved for his romanticism and sense of humor. Scots around the world celebrate his birth with “Burns suppers.”The most elaborate celebrations feature pipers marching in with a haggis (a traditional concoction of minced offal, oatmeal and spices) to a standing ovation. The host recites Burns’s praise-filled “Address to a Haggis.” Eating and toasts from the “laddies” and “lassies” follow.So tonight, whatever is on your plate, join me in a toast to Scotland’s best-loved son.

439,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. No deal. With the partial government shutdown now in its 12th day — and with Democrats taking control of the House on Thursday — President Trump invited congressional leaders from both parties to a gathering in the Situation Room billed as a border security briefing.The meeting yielded no agreement. It only served to highlight the gulf between the president, who has dug in on his demand for Congress to fund a border wall, his signature campaign promise, and Democrats, who have refused to do so.Earlier, Mr. Trump rejected a plan that Vice President Mike Pence privately floated to Democrats last month, saying $2.5 billion for border security — rather than the $5.6 billion that the president has requested — was insufficient. He also rejected a compromise that would pair money for a wall with legislation to protect young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. Above, at a cabinet meeting._____2. Native Americans are among those hit hardest by the partial government shutdown, with tribes across the U.S. scrambling to make up for lost federal funding.Among the services curtailed: a food program that fed 90,000 people last year.Generations ago, tribes negotiated treaties with the U.S. government that guaranteed money for services like health care and education in exchange for huge swaths of territory. Above, at a New Year’s powwow in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.“The federal government owes us this,” said the chairman of one tribe. “We prepaid with millions of acres of land.”Also, the Smithsonian Institution’s museums, along with many other federally funded tourist attractions, are closing because of the government shutdown._____3. Savvy legislator. Prolific fund-raiser. Colleague both feared and admired.Nancy Pelosi is poised to reclaim her former title as speaker of the House.She will be the first lawmaker in more than half a century to hold the office twice, making her the highest-ranking and most powerful elected woman in American political history. Our video team takes a look inside her leadership playbook.Ms. Pelosi, above, is facing some self-imposed time constraints. To satisfy House Democrats who pressed for a younger generation of leaders, she has agreed to limit her term to four years. Some say that could weaken her, a notion she dismissed.“I’m used to, shall we say, enthusiasms from all elements of the party,” she said. “I can roll with that.”_____4. Women who worked for the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign in 2016 say complaints of sexism and mistreatment were not addressed.Discussions about sexual harassment, demeaning behavior and pay disparities in the campaign have circulated in recent weeks in emails, online comments and private discussions among former supporters.Now, as the Vermont senator tries to build support for a second run at the White House, his perceived failure to address this issue has damaged his progressive credentials, delegates and nearly a dozen former staff members told us in interviews over the last month. Above, at a rally in Ames, Iowa.The senator’s campaign committee said it had developed a new harassment policy and was reviewing pay disparity claims._____5. Apple cut its first-quarter revenue forecast, citing a steep drop in sales in China.In a letter to shareholders, the company said it expected revenue of about $84 billion in the quarter that ended Dec. 29, down from a previous estimate of $89 billion to $93 billion.The company’s announcement added to concerns about the ability of U.S. tech giants to navigate an increasingly uncertain economy and a continuing trade war with China. Above, a retail store in Beijing.China has become Apple’s third-largest market in recent years, driven mostly by iPhone sales.Separately, Wall Street stocks opened sharply lower but recovered after a rise in oil prices lifted shares of energy producers. And Tesla reported record quarterly production and deliveries — but also announced a price cut that sent shares nearly 7 percent lower._____6. The Army is rolling out a new recruiting strategy. For decades, the Army has relied disproportionately on the South, where young people enlist at two to three times the rate of other regions.But after falling 6,500 soldiers short of its nationwide recruiting goal in 2018, the Army is planning a big push in 22 left-leaning cities, like Chicago, San Francisco and Seattle, places where relatively few recruits have signed up. Above, in Seattle.The Army’s head of recruiting wants to frame enlistment as a patriotic opportunity for public service, travel and adventure. “Come do your gap year in the Army,” he said. (Figuratively speaking, that is: Enlistees commit to serve for two to six years.)_____7. President Xi Jinping urged unification with Taiwan and demanded greater progress in Beijing’s decades-long quest to win control of the disputed island.Mr. Xi gave Taiwan two options: He could use military force if the self-ruled territory grasped for independence, or he could offer a “one country, two systems” deal, similar to the framework used in Hong Kong. But the president didn’t lay down a timetable for either path.Only 3 percent of Taiwan’s population favors immediate unification with China, according to a recent survey. Above, in Taipei, Taiwan.Separately, our New New World columnist takes a look at companies in China where thousands of low-wage workers help the government monitor and scrub content online._____8. California is feeling the effects of a marijuana glut.When the state legalized recreational marijuana a year ago, supporters predicted soaring sales and tax revenue. But instead, sales have fallen since 2017, when only medical marijuana was legal.The industry is hampered by disputes over regulations and taxes, and angry residents who don’t want cannabis grown in their neighborhoods. Above, in Berkeley, Calif.At the same time, a black market continues to thrive. California’s surplus — equal to 13 times Colorado’s total annual production — is being smuggled eastward to other states where the wholesale price is much higher._____9. A new crop of animal film stars is emerging, our culture critic writes.They don’t talk like humans. They don’t shake hands or roll over. Instead they are captured somewhat naturalistically.The cat Towne, above, spends much of “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” gazing languidly from a couch. In “Roma,” a family dog barks incessantly. And in “Widows,” a fluffy white terrier named Olivia pants calmly as violent criminals creep around her.These recent pet performances raise the question: Are animals getting better at acting?_____10. Finally, does a matched pair of socks — your own or someone else’s — give you joy?Marie Kondo, above, the Japanese tidying guru whose 2014 book, “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up,” has sold over 8.5 million copies sold in over 40 languages, now has a reality TV show.Have a neat evening.Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

440,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. The Senate failed to pass two competing proposals to reopen the government, sending lawmakers back to the drawing board for a bipartisan solution to end the impasse.The Republican proposal included $5.7 billion in funding for President Trump’s border wall, paired with legal protections for some immigrants. The Democratic proposal would have temporarily reopened the government until Feb. 8, but it omitted wall funding. A half dozen Republicans voted for it, but the tally still fell short of the 60 votes it needed to advance.Lawmakers and aides in both parties expressed hope that the double-barreled losses would break the logjam that has gripped Washington since the partial shutdown began. House Democrats said they were considering giving Mr. Trump as much as $5.2 billion for border security — but not for a wall.Nearly six weeks in, the shutdown is eroding the good will of highly skilled federal workers who chose public service over higher-paying private employment. And the Commerce Secretary suggested that instead of using services like food banks, federal workers should take out loans to stay afloat. Above, NASA workers protest in California._____2. The leader of Venezuela’s military declared his loyalty to President Nicolás Maduro, above, and said the opposition’s efforts to replace him amounted to an attempted coup.It was a setback for the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, who proclaimed himself the country’s rightful leader on Wednesday. In a further blow to the opposition, Russia warned the U.S. against meddling in Venezuela, a longtime Kremlin ally.On Wednesday, the U.S. recognized Mr. Guaidó as the country’s legitimate president, and as did nations like Canada, Ecuador and Brazil. In response, Mr. Maduro cut ties with the U.S. and ordered American diplomats to leave.Taken together, the events escalated the confusion and conflict in Venezuela, an oil-rich and formerly prosperous country upended by political corruption and severe economic hardship under Mr. Maduro. Here’s a primer on how the country got to this dire situation._____3. The Senate Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Michael Cohen, a day after President Trump’s former lawyer and fixer pulled out of a public hearing before the House Oversight Committee.Mr. Cohen will be called to formally correct false testimony that he delivered last year about a proposed Trump Organization project in Moscow. The Senate committee had been working with him and his lawyers to secure a voluntary return visit. But those talks were unproductive. Above, Mr. Cohen in August.Mr. Cohen will have little choice but to comply with the Senate subpoena. But unlike the Oversight session, his return to the Intelligence Committee will almost certainly be behind closed doors._____4. Satellite surveillance was once the domain of superpowers. Now, a growing number of start-ups are selling insights gleaned from small, relatively cheap satellites, known as “cube satellites.”Take the Chinese province of Guangdong, which stopped publishing a monthly health report on its manufacturing sector amid declining production in the trade war with the U.S. A small company in San Francisco used images captured by satellites to get that data, and now it’s selling it to hedge funds, banks and other investors.Satellites already monitor everything from how busy retailers’ parking lots are, above, to illegal mining activity — giving companies a new competitive advantage. And the niche seems set for further growth: Nearly 730 satellites were launched in the last decade, and another 2,220 are expected to follow in the next 10 years._____5. The type of deadly Ebola virus responsible for recent epidemics has been found in a bat in West Africa, Liberian health officials announced.Bats carrying the lethal disease have been found in Central Africa, and scientists have long suspected they were a natural host and a source of human infections in other areas, as well. Now they have proof.While the results are preliminary, the discovery could help researchers learn more about how the virus infects humans, and help public health officials educate the public about staying safe. Above, researchers sampling a bat.The same strain found in the bat caused the current Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with more than 700 cases and more than 400 deaths. It’s the second-largest outbreak ever._____6. A hedge fund billionaire bought a New York City penthouse apartment for $238 million — the most ever paid for a home in the United States.The head-turning sale comes amid intense debates about the wealth transforming the city. The property in question, above, is emblematic of that: A rent-regulated building was torn down to make way for the 79-story luxury condominium tower.Kenneth Griffin, founder of the hedge fund Citadel, purchased the nearly 24,000-square-foot unit. It’s not his first trophy property, either — he’s spent $750 million on homes around the world in recent years. Here’s what else we know about Mr. Griffin._____7. Now we turn to the pantry in our latest effort to help organize your life in the New Year.Having a well-stocked pantry is a baseline for every cook, advanced or novice. And it’s not just about having the spices you turn to most. Our definition of pantry encompasses refrigerator, freezer and cupboard, so you can make entire meals with staples you keep on hand.For starters, take everything out of your pantry, keep what looks and smells good, assess what remains, and fill in the blanks with food that will make you a better cook._____8. “The big thing is the sound. I’m not really looking for how they cut.”That’s the composer Julia Wolfe, who was in the market for scissors for her new musical work, “Fire in my mouth.”The orchestral and choral composition is about the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire of 1911, which killed 146 garment workers, mostly immigrant women. She won a Pulitzer Prize for an earlier work about Pennsylvania coal miners.Ms. Wolfe wanted to suggest factories in the new composition. String parts recall sewing machines, and chorus members open and close scissors at various points. But first she needed to find the right snip, so we followed her around New York’s garment district on her search._____9. Mabel Stark had her first encounter with a tiger in 1911, when she sneaked into the grounds of a circus in California and found herself face to face with a mature Bengal named King.She was hooked. Ms. Stark would go on to become the world’s most celebrated tiger trainer, spending most of her life among the big cats at circuses and theme parks. She died in 1968 and never received a Times obituary, until now“For me,” she wrote in her autobiography, “there is no greater thrill than stepping into a cageful of those glorious beasts and matching wits with them.”_____10. Finally, we end with a sweet serenade.When a Massachusetts middle school choir teacher got engaged in 2016, he kept it quiet for months, not knowing how his students would react to him having a husband.But word got out last year, and two school mothers organized a surprise celebration. After a month of secret rehearsals, 50 students performed “All You Need Is Love” by the Beatles at the couple’s rehearsal brunch — and a recording of the performance went viral.“Some of the students singing have inner struggles,” the choir teacher said. “I was so glad they were there, feeling the love in the room and knowing everything’s going to be O.K.”Have a lovely night._____Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

441,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Lawmakers are to consider two spending measures on Thursday, the first time senators are addressing the budget impasse since the partial government shutdown began last month.One of the bills includes President Trump’s call for $5.7 billion for a border wall, the other is a short-term funding proposal by Democrats that wouldn’t finance a wall. Neither measure is expected to pass, but there’s hope that the votes will lead to negotiations for a bipartisan compromise.Go deeper: Mr. Trump has been focusing almost exclusively on the wall, suspending the rest of his policy agenda, because he’s convinced his presidency is on the line, our chief White House correspondent writes.By a 5-4 vote on Tuesday, the justices granted the Trump administration’s request to bar most transgender people from military service while cases challenging the policy move forward in lower courts.President Trump announced the ban in 2017, saying that American forces couldn’t afford the “tremendous medical costs and disruption” of transgender service members. The policy makes exceptions for those already serving openly and those willing to serve “in their biological sex.”Gun rights: The court also said it would hear its first Second Amendment case in nearly a decade, a test of the justices’ approach to gun rights after the arrival of Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative, in October. The case involves a New York City law that limits residents from transporting guns outside their homes.DACA: The court took no action on the Trump administration’s plans to shut down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields some 700,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation. That means the court will almost certainly not hear the administration’s challenge in its current term, which ends in June.Juan Guaidó, 35, an opposition leader and president of the National Assembly, has called on Venezuelans to take to the streets today to protest the government of President Nicolás Maduro and the economic crisis that has led more than three million people to flee the country.Catch up: The president was sworn in for a second term this month, after a disputed election that many countries didn’t recognize, and Mr. Guaidó says the government is illegitimate. Mr. Maduro dismisses the opposition as “little boys” who are pawns of the Trump administration.Yesterday: Vice President Mike Pence declared Washington’s “unwavering support” for the planned demonstrations.In his latest clash with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Gov. Andrew Cuomo opposed a requested fare increase on Tuesday and questioned whether the agency really needed the revenue to make much-needed improvements. “Tighten your belt. Make the place run better,” said Mr. Cuomo, who has repeatedly complained about the agency’s bureaucracy.A vote on Thursday could determine whether the cost of a MetroCard swipe will go up to $3 in March.In numbers: Experts predict the M.T.A. will have a deficit of nearly $1 billion by 2022. Subway leaders warn they will have to raise fares or cut services unless other revenue sources are found. The former Soviet republic of Georgia has offered tax breaks, land deals and cheap energy to attract tech-savvy entrepreneurs and the high-powered computers that are needed to mine the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, even though its value has tumbled.Our chief European business correspondent traveled to the capital, Tbilisi, to learn more about a “state-supported dash toward data supremacy.”Los Angeles teachers end strike: Tens of thousands of employees in the nation’s second-largest public school system are set to return to work today after they reached a deal to end a weeklong strike. The agreement includes caps on class sizes, and hiring full-time nurses for every school.The 2020 election: Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., announced today that he was starting a Democratic presidential campaign. A veteran of the war in Afghanistan, Mr. Buttigieg is the first openly gay candidate to join the 2020 presidential race.Chris Brown case: The R&B singer was released without charges after being questioned in Paris over accusations of rape.

Hundreds of thousands of people are expected at the five-day event, which Pope Francis will attend.In memoriam: Russell Baker, one of the most celebrated American writers and a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, died on Monday at 93. His column (including one about a dreaded Christmas fruitcake) appeared in The Times and other newspapers for 36 years.Oscar nominations: Netflix received its first best picture nod for “Roma,” a foreign-language film that tied with “The Favourite” to lead the nominations, at 10 each.

We asked Pamela Paul, the editor of the Book Review, what today’s readers should know about the book, which follows a wealthy young German through seven years in a tuberculosis sanitarium just before World War I.“Many people read it as a metaphor for the sickness of Europe on the brink of war,” she answered. “Well-heeled invalids gather indefinitely, for a cure that doesn’t necessarily come — perhaps deliberately. The longer they stay, the greater the owner’s profits.“They spend their days gossiping, pursuing love affairs and having abstract arguments that never reach any decisive resolution.”"
442,"It was a case study in mixed messaging. On a Thursday in early January, Border Patrol union leaders appeared at a news briefing with President Trump, backing the shutdown and his plan for a wall on the southern border. A week later, employees of the Transportation Security Administration protested the shutdown outside Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.Adding to the dissonance was this inconvenient detail: Both groups of workers are represented by the same umbrella organization, the American Federation of Government Employees, whose leadership has the unpleasant task of finessing their irreconcilable views.“There are some members at the Border Patrol that support the wall even if it means they have to go without pay, and we respect that,” said David Borer, the federation’s general counsel. “But there are many thousands more government employees for whom the paycheck is the first and only issue.”At a time when 800,000 federal employees — largely unionized — are going without pay, they might be expected to speak with one voice. In fact, the stress of the situation is highlighting differences in both tactics and philosophy.The federation, by far the biggest union of government workers, represents 700,000 employees in more than three dozen agencies, from the Coast Guard to the Census Bureau. It has been a hefty contributor to Democratic candidates and causes. But some groups within the organization, representing Border Patrol agents and immigration officers, endorsed Mr. Trump.The contrasting approaches complicate efforts to influence a dispute in which the ultimate weapon — the right to strike — is denied by law, and other traditional sources of leverage, like political lobbying, are less useful than usual.Beyond being unable to strike, a vast majority of federal workers are forbidden to collectively bargain over wages and benefits, which are set by Congress. The unions that represent them bargain over work rules and working conditions — like safety measures or whether they can telecommute — and due-process rights for workers who have been disciplined or fired.But just because the unions can’t bargain over pay and benefits doesn’t mean they exert no influence on these questions. The unions maintain close relationships with powerful members of Congress, stemming in part from political spending.The American Federation of Government Employees spent over $5 million in the 2016 campaign cycle, between contributions to candidates and “super PAC” expenditures that paid for ads and turnout efforts. Nearly 90 percent of the contributions went to Democratic candidates.Many members of Congress, especially in less populated areas, are also aware that federal employees are among their largest blocs of voters.On a trip to Washington this month, Eric Young, president of the federation’s labor council representing 30,000 federal prison workers, met with the Senate’s Democratic caucus. Mr. Young said his members, many of them military veterans, were nearing their breaking point after working for weeks without pay. He has met with the staffs of several swing Republicans, like Senators Cory Gardner of Colorado and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, to tell them that he would hold lawmakers responsible if the shutdown resulted in death or injury for any of his members.“They will absolutely have blood on their hands,” Mr. Young said in an interview. “When people are distracted by trying to pay their bills, they may take their eyes off an inmate they’re supposed to be supervising.”As he was making the rounds in the Capitol, his members were picketing the office of Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, in Lexington, Ky. And this week the prison workers’ council erected billboards across the state, home to five federal prisons, saying the shutdown is hurting law enforcement and putting the onus on Mr. McConnell to end it.Historically, the combination of this inside game and grass-roots pressure gave the unions sway in Washington. Last year, after Mr. Trump proposed freezing federal pay, the unions used their influence in the Senate to help pass the nearly 2 percent pay increase they sought — by a 92 to 6 margin. (The president later issued an executive order blocking the increase, which Congress is likely to seek to overturn whenever it passes legislation to fund the rest of the government.)The shutdown is putting that model to the test. Most Senate Republicans, however sympathetic they may be privately, have so far resisted the appeals of union officials, deferring to the president on a fight he says is central to his re-election. And the raw emotion of the shutdown is fraying some labor unions that are typically united on matters that affect their personal bottom lines.The Border Patrol, whose leadership has been most outspoken about backing Mr. Trump, employs a tiny fraction of the hundreds of thousands of workers affected by the impasse in Washington. But the tensions are being felt more broadly.John Kostelnik, the head of the union local that represents about 850 workers at a federal prison in Victorville, Calif., said the border wall and the shutdown had become divisive topics at his workplace, where political discussions are normally rare.“It’s created a political environment within the prison, which is the last thing you want when our brothers and sisters are trying to protect themselves,” said Mr. Kostelnik, who estimates that his members split fairly evenly between Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016. “It’s to the point where people are arguing with one another.”In a poll of 1,228 federal employees in mid-January by GovExec.com, most opposed the wall. But a surprising chunk — 21 percent — said they supported the shutdown.Even without the right to strike, workers could use other forms of pressure to end the stalemate — say, a work slowdown by air traffic controllers and airport security personnel to throttle air travel.“If this were done in certain key locations, choke points, it would have a big effect,” said Joseph A. McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University.Yet that does not appear to be in the cards. There is “no shortage of bright ideas about how we should slow the system down,” said Trish Gilbert, the executive vice president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, a union representing nearly 20,000 workers. “But that’s something we will never ever do.”Lurking in the background is the pervasive fear of repeating history. In 1981, when air traffic controllers began an unlawful strike, President Ronald Reagan fired almost all of them — over 11,000 — and barred them from ever being rehired. The episode traumatized the labor movement for decades.In addition, many of the agencies ordered to work through the shutdown are staffed by career civil servants or military veterans — the latter make up about 30 percent of the federal work force — who are conservative by disposition.“It’s not in the workplace culture of most federal workers to be rebels,” Mr. McCartin said. “They work within large organizations. It only works if the rules are respected.”Or as Lorie McCann, head of the National Treasury Employees Union chapter that represents Internal Revenue Service workers in the Chicago area, put it: “We’re kind of by-the-book people.”Still, union leaders said that beyond a certain point, many federal employees would no longer be able to afford to work without pay — especially those who have large work-related outlays, like child care and gas.“I think it’s going to eventually occur in the sense that people are not going to be able to get to work, they can’t afford to get to work,” said Mr. Young, the prison union leader.Today, airport screeners for the Transportation Security Administration are among the lowest-paid federal workers, earning an average of about $35,000 a year.A growing number of T.S.A. workers are already calling in sick. One in 10 did not report to work on Sunday, often citing “financial limitations,” the agency said. If absenteeism remains high, it will add stress to an already strained industry.And other parts of the labor movement could also play a role. Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants, said her union was “watching closely” to see whether the furlough or potential attrition began to seriously jeopardize safety.“If the system is unsafe, our members do not have to go to work,” Ms. Nelson said. “If the shutdown continues, our aviation network will unravel, and ultimately the entire system will come to a screeching halt.”"
443,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. Senate leaders offered the first glimmers of a potential resolution to the government shutdown, scheduling procedural votes Thursday on two competing bills to reopen the government.One measure includes funding for President Trump’s border wall; the other is a short-term spending bill that would fund shuttered agencies through Feb. 8. Although neither is likely to pass, the compromise gives each party a chance to press its proposal. And the votes could prompt the two sides to negotiate a bipartisan compromise.Above, Mexican migrants prepare to jump the border fence to get into the U.S. in December.At the same time, Mr. Trump and Speaker Nancy Pelosi remained in a private standoff about whether he should be allowed to deliver his State of the Union address next week. Ms. Pelosi has yet to issue Mr. Trump a formal invitation.The shutdown, now in its fifth week, has forced some of the unpaid 800,000 federal workers to enter the gig economy to make ends meet. Here’s a roundup of our other shutdown coverage._____2. The Supreme Court revived the Trump administration’s policy of barring most transgender people from serving in the military.The justices voted 5 to 4 to temporarily allow the ban to go into effect while court challenges move forward.The policy prohibits people identifying with a gender different from their biological sex from serving in the military, with narrow exceptions. Since the ban was announced on Twitter by President Trump in 2017, it has been challenged in lower courts with mixed success. Above, protesters outside of the White House after Mr. Trump’s original announcement.The court also agreed to hear a challenge to a New York City gun law that restricts people with a particular kind of gun license from transporting their guns outside of the city. It will be the first Second Amendment case to go before the court since 2010 and will shed light on the court’s approach to gun rights under a newly reliable five-member conservative majority._____3. A Trump administration deal to lift sanctions on companies controlled by a prominent Russian oligarch may have freed him from hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, according to a confidential document.Last month, the administration characterized the move as tough on the oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, above, and on Russia. But the deal contains provisions that free Mr. Deripaska, a close ally of the Kremlin, from debt while leaving him in control of his most important company, the document shows.House Democrats won widespread Republican support last week for efforts to block the sanctions relief deal, but the measure fell short in the Republican-controlled Senate.Separately, a former U.S. Marine who was arrested in Moscow on spying charges had received a flash drive that he thought contained pictures of churches but was instead loaded with classified information, his lawyer said._____4. Vice President Mike Pence declared “unwavering support” from the U.S. for planned mass protests in Venezuela against President Nicolás Maduro.“We are with you,” he wrote on Twitter, posting a video message. It was the administration’s most explicit backing yet for efforts to unseat Mr. Maduro.Leading the opposition is a virtually unheard-of 35-year-old, Juan Guaidó, above, who called for citizens to take to the streets on Wednesday.Conditions in Venezuela have deteriorated to a point where the opposition sees an opportunity: A group of soldiers has turned against Mr. Maduro, the government is running out of money and countries across the region have called the president an illegitimate dictator._____5. Los Angeles public schoolteachers are expected to return to their classrooms on Wednesday morning after reaching a tentative deal to end a weeklong strike.The teachers won a 6 percent pay raise and caps on class sizes. The city and county will also spend money to expand services in schools, including hiring more nurses, counselors and psychologists.The agreement also includes a pledge that the school board will vote on a resolution to “establish a charter school cap.” Charter schools have been embraced by political leaders and are popular among parents, but the union says they siphon off students and money from traditional public schools.The contract still needs to be ratified by the union, but that is widely expected._____6. A speedy new technology for genetic fingerprinting is changing the way crimes are solved.Rapid DNA machines can match a suspect’s genetic code to previously collected samples in 90 minutes. And they allow the police to analyze results themselves, instead of needing outside labs and waiting a month or more.But forensic experts see a potential for misuse. As police agencies build out their local DNA databases, they are collecting samples not only from people who have been charged with major crimes but also from people who are merely deemed suspicious._____7. A record number of Americans understand that climate change is real, a new survey found, and they are increasingly worried about its impact on their lives.Some 73 percent of Americans polled late last year said global warming was happening, a jump in 10 percentage points from 2015. And 72 percent of Americans said global warming was personally important to them, jumping nine percentage points since last March. Above, Mexico Beach, Fla., after Hurricane Michael last year.In other environmental news, the world’s oceans are getting louder. Ship traffic, sonar and now seismic air gun blasts planned for offshore drilling all contribute to the growing din. And experts fear the man-made noise is fundamentally disrupting the marine ecosystem._____8. And the Oscar nominees were… announced today.Netflix got its first best picture nod for “Roma,” above, which had 10 nominations today, including for direction, cinematography and original screenplay. It will compete against “The Favourite” (also with 10 nominations), “A Star Is Born” and “Black Panther,” the first superhero film to get a best picture nomination.The best picture selections were remarkably diverse compared to past years. But the acting categories were less inclusive, with one black actor and one black actress among the 20 nominees. All of the directing and cinematography nominees were men.Here’s a complete list of nominees and a look at all the snubs and surprises._____9. Renovation projects often face delays or run over budget — but not usually because of a mysterious artwork from the 17th century.Last summer, workers on a new Oscar de la Renta boutique in Paris discovered a 10-by-20-foot oil painting of an elaborately dressed 17th century nobleman. It turned out to have been painted by a significant artist in 1674.So how did it end up hidden behind a wall, and why? Nobody knows.For the last two months, a small team of conservators has swabbed away at the varnish to allow the colors to come through. They hope to finish in time to open the store in late spring._____10.

444,"WASHINGTON — America will get its first taste of divided government under President Trump this week when a Democratic House tries to wrest control of the political agenda from Mr. Trump, who appears determined to keep the focus on border security, immigration and his “big, beautiful” wall.After the midterm elections ushered in the most diverse freshman class in history, House Democrats intend to put a spotlight on the issues that worked well for them during the campaign: diminishing the influence of the wealthy and connected, expanding voting rights, lowering prescription drug costs and passing a bipartisan infrastructure bill.Mr. Trump, on the defensive and presiding over a federal government that remains partially closed, is trying to stomp on that message. On Tuesday, as the government shutdown was in its 11th day, Mr. Trump invited congressional leaders of both parties to a briefing on border security Wednesday afternoon. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Tuesday night that Mr. Trump would attend.It would be the first visit by Democratic leaders to the White House since Dec. 11, when the president told Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer he would be “proud to shut down the government for border security.”Mr. Trump appeared to make a gesture of peace ahead of Wednesday’s meeting.“Border Security and the Wall ‘thing’ and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker!” he said Tuesday on Twitter. “Let’s make a deal?”Just what deal Mr. Trump had in mind was not clear. While Ms. Pelosi has repeatedly signaled she would like to find a compromise that would allow the government to reopen, she has also made it clear that a wall cannot be part of any such deal, whether or not that leads to a messy start to her speakership.After she is elected speaker on Thursday, she hopes to introduce a transparency-in-governing measure to portray Democrats as a responsible governing party and draw a contrast between them and Mr. Trump’s scandal-ridden administration. The measure would require disclosure of shadowy political donors, end gerrymandering of congressional districts and expand voting rights.But their first order of business will be reopening the government, as Ms. Pelosi said Tuesday on Twitter in response to Mr. Trump.The president “has given Democrats a great opportunity to show how we will govern responsibly & quickly pass our plan to end the irresponsible #TrumpShutdown,” she said, “just the first sign of things to come.”Democrats also intend to use their first months in the majority to push for a bipartisan infrastructure bill and legislation to lower prescription drug costs, issues that they believe will have bipartisan appeal.The Democrats plan to pass two bills on Thursday. The first includes six bipartisan spending measures that would fully fund agencies like the Interior Department and the Internal Revenue Service through the end of the fiscal year in September. The second would fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8, with $1.3 billion for fencing but no money for a wall on the Mexican border.With the plan facing a shaky future in the Senate and an intransigent president, some rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties are suggesting that a deal to revamp the nation’s immigration laws, pairing border security and protections for some undocumented immigrants, may be the way out of the stalemate.“How about comprehensive immigration reform?” Representative Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, said on CNN on Tuesday, when asked how Democrats intend to compromise with Mr. Trump.One of Mr. Trump’s closest allies, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, has revived his long-stalled immigration proposal to marry $5 billion for the wall with immigration law changes that might appeal to Democrats, including three-year renewable work permits for young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, known as Dreamers.Mr. Trump has raised the prospects of broader talks on Twitter. “We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,” he said last week. “Hard to believe there was a Congress & President who would approve!”Mr. Trump has also claimed, somewhat misleadingly, that Democrats had already voted for a wall.“I’m in the Oval Office,” he tweeted on Monday. “Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the Wall. You voted yes in 2006 and 2013.”He was referring to the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along 700 miles of the southern border, and to a 2013 comprehensive immigration bill. That bill passed the Senate with 68 votes but did not make it out of the House. It combined the Republican priority of enhanced border security with the Democratic goal of offering legalization and a pathway to citizenship for the nation’s 11 million undocumented immigrants.Democratic leaders are wary of any immigration negotiations with Mr. Trump, whom they view as an unreliable partner. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the new chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said in an interview on Tuesday that Democrats would not again broach immigration before the government is reopened.“We do have a broken immigration system that needs to be fixed in a sustainable and bipartisan way,” Mr. Jeffries said. “However, it’s impossible to have a mature conversation about comprehensive immigration reform in the midst of a reckless Trump shutdown sparked by his desire to build a medieval border wall.”Democrats have not forgotten that a year ago, when they talked to Mr. Trump about DACA, he promised to work with them on a “bill of love,” only to back away, prompting Mr. Schumer to declare that negotiating with Mr. Trump was like “negotiating with Jell-O.”Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, said the challenge lies with the Republican majority in the Senate.“If you want to get a bipartisan immigration bill in the coming months, you’re going to have to have Republican senators willing to work across the aisle to get things done,” Mr. Van Hollen said. “I don’t think they can give President Trump the pen to write every word of legislation.”At the same time, Democratic leaders will face pressures of their own, from a freshman class packed with first- and second-generation immigrants, Latinos and immigrant advocates. House Democratic leaders and their staffs have indicated to immigration advocates that they plan to act on legislation to protect immigrants who face an imminent threat of deportation after the shutdown is over. That proposal would grant permanent residence to DACA recipients and to others who came under Temporary Protected Status, which Mr. Trump has also moved to rescind.“What we want in 2019 is early action on a bill that combines a permanent solution for Dreamers and for T.P.S. holders,” said Frank Sharry, the executive director of America’s Voice, an immigrant advocacy group.Democrats have already begun strategizing privately around such a bill, which would most likely pass the House with little to no Republican support. But Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, has shown little appetite for politically tricky measures that divide Republicans or put them at odds with Mr. Trump — particularly on immigration.The issue could expose fissures among Democrats as well. Liberals are agitating for measures such as abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency that carries out deportations, or killing funding for immigration detention beds and enforcement agents.But Democratic congressional leaders and many rank-and-file members, including freshmen elected in districts carried in 2016 by Mr. Trump, say they are all for border security and enforcement, as long as it is effective and reasonable.Broader immigration legislation “would be nice, if we had a reliable person at the other side of the table to negotiate with,” said Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia. “I wouldn’t be so bold as to predict a magic bullet.”"
445,"Good morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) For weeks, she’s been on a national tour promoting her memoir. This month, Politico reported that she shut down her state campaign committee and donated the rest of the money she raised for a California race, about $1 million, to causes including the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights and a foundation that helps firefighters.But only as of yesterday — not coincidentally, Martin Luther King’s Birthday — was it official: Senator Kamala Harris is running for president in 2020.She announced her run on “Good Morning America,” not in her hometown, Oakland, as a local radio station’s sources had predicted earlier. She will, however, hold a rally there on Sunday.“The core of my campaign is the people,” Ms. Harris said later in the day at Howard University, the historically black college she attended in the 1980s. “Nobody is living their life through the lens of one issue. And I think what people want is leadership that sees them through the complexity of their lives and pays equal attention to their needs. Let’s not put people in a box.”Ms. Harris, who is just the second black woman to serve in the U.S. Senate, joins a diverse and increasingly crowded field of Democrats vying for the nomination.(Here’s a succinct guide to everyone who’s announced their candidacy and everyone who’s likely to join the scrum.) Observers say Ms. Harris, a 54-year-old former California attorney general, could bridge generations of the party, both in terms of her age and experience and her positions.While she’s firmly a product of what she once described as San Francisco’s “hard-knocks politics,” Ms. Harris has also tried to align herself with Democrats’ leftward drift. After initially hesitating, she disavowed most corporate donations.Still, experts have suggested that her toughest criticism will stem from her time as San Francisco’s district attorney and the state’s attorney general.Already, in a stinging Op-Ed piece, a law professor wrote that Ms. Harris wasn’t the progressive prosecutor she claims she was. That prompted a response from a supporter and civil rights advocate who described Ms. Harris as a “voice for the voiceless and vulnerable,” when she was a prosecutor.In any case, experts think she’ll try to turn that vulnerability on its head, Politico reported, by presenting her law enforcement background as a foil to a “lawless” presidency.(A note: We often link to content on sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

Check back here for updates throughout the day.Jill Cowan: Is there any possibility the Oscars producers will try to do something splashy and unveil a surprise host between now and the ceremony? You wrote about why the ceremony could be better off without one. Kyle Buchanan: I’m doubtful we’ll get a full-blown host, but I think the Academy is searching for big-name presenters who may get expanded duties — more than just reading light patter and standing to the side. I’d expect producers to announce those names once they’re locked in, since without a host out there giving interviews, the Oscars will need somebody to promote. Then again, the Academy has fumbled more than a few of their announcements over the past year, so maybe they’ll just keep mum and we’ll tune in with no idea what to expect.Is there a way you’ll be gauging whether the Academy has been responsive to #OscarsSoWhite criticism? I think the #OscarsSoWhite conversation continues to be had in every part of the industry, not just the awards sector. Last year had some amazing movies directed by and starring people of color — among them, “Black Panther,” “If Beale Street Could Talk,” “Crazy Rich Asians,” “Widows” and “BlacKkKlansman” — and while not all of them found favor with Oscar, I think all the talk we’ve been having about representation has had a profound effect on what gets greenlit in Hollywood. And hopefully, with movies like “Black Panther” and “Crazy Rich Asians” having done so phenomenally well at the box office, Hollywood has an incentive to keep backing projects like this.And last one, just to ask: Your Best Picture winner prediction? You wrote about whether “Roma” can win, but it definitely has some obstacles. This has got to be one of the most wide-open Best Picture fields I can remember. “A Star Is Born” was nominated by every guild, and is the sort of film Oscar voters usually go for — a critically acclaimed hit that’s about the entertainment business — though it hasn’t been able to take home a big prize yet. “Roma” is the critics’ favorite and Netflix is spending through the nose, but a foreign-language film has never won Best Picture, let alone a black-and-white one distributed by a streaming service. And then there’s “Green Book,” which recently took the top prize from the Producers Guild of America, the group that has the most sterling record for presaging the ultimate Best Picture winner.California Today goes live at 6:30 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

446,"SHALER, Pa. — This should be an upbeat moment for Pennsylvania Democrats, desperate to deprive President Trump of a second term.In elections last year, two Trump-like Republicans running for governor and senator lost to Democrats by blowout margins. Four Democrats wrestled away Republican-held congressional seats, including Conor Lamb, whose victory here outside Pittsburgh seemed to be a template for how to win back voters in Trump country.But, listening to strategists and voters in a critical state for Democrats, the midterms feel like a long time ago. Instead, there are widespread worries that the momentum in Pennsylvania, and in other key Rust Belt states, could screech to a halt if the issues in the 2020 presidential primaries and the party’s eventual nominee stray too far left for the region’s many centrist voters.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]“The more we have presidential candidates or newly elected congresspeople talking about the Green New Deal, talking about ‘Medicare for all,’ talking about socialism, the more that plays into the Trump campaign’s hands,” said Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor and national Democratic chairman.He mentioned issues that are tantalizing to some primary voters and candidates but which risk alienating general election voters, such as reparations for descendants of slaves and a rapid, costly transition to carbon-free energy. “Reparations? What are we talking about?” Mr. Rendell scoffed. “Having only renewable energy by 2030? It’s not possible to achieve that.”Mr. Trump is in the White House in large part because of the crumbling in 2016 of three so-called blue-wall states, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which had not voted for a Republican presidential candidate in more than two decades.In 2020, if the rest of the electoral map is unchanged, with Mr. Trump winning the swing states of Florida and Ohio, Democrats understand that their most promising path back to the presidency is to resurrect the blue wall. Mr. Trump carried the three states by less than 80,000 total votes, so small fluctuations in his support or opposition would be pivotal.Christopher Borick, a political scientist and pollster at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, called 2016 a “lightning-in-a-bottle” victory that will be hard for the president to duplicate.But, he said, Democrats are in danger of creating the conditions in which it could happen.“A more left-leaning candidate opens the door for Trump,” Mr. Borick said. “If you want to lock up Pennsylvania for a Democrat, the more moderate Democrats are the key.”Some Democratic strategists said it is much too early to rule out any of the 2020 hopefuls as unable to defeat Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania, where disapproval of his job performance is 54 percent, with 42 percent approval, according to Gallup.“I’m not going to sit here and say there’s a Democratic nominee that can’t win Pennsylvania,” said Jason O’Malley, a party strategist in Lancaster County, a Republican-leaning region.Coleman Lamb, a senior adviser to his brother Conor, said a candidate’s personal qualities mattered more to voters than ideology. “I don’t think the only way to win is someone who proactively goes to the middle,” he said. “I think it’s more someone who is authentic, who’s saying what they actually believe and think.”In 2018, Conor Lamb flipped many precincts that had voted for Mr. Trump, especially in the North Hills suburbs of Pittsburgh. Recent interviews with two dozen voters there, a mix of blue- and white-collar workers, revealed the full Democratic spectrum, from progressives eager for a nominee who leans hard left, to party apostates who voted for Mr. Trump and remain solidly behind him.[Who’s in, who’s out and who’s still thinking about it. Check out our presidential candidate tracker.]Nick DiCaprio, a retired postal worker, illustrated the challenges facing Democrats. A longtime Democrat, he voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 but returned to the party in the midterms when he helped elect Mr. Lamb, a former Marine and prosecutor, who vowed to oppose Nancy Pelosi for House speaker.Mr. DiCaprio’s 2020 vote is up for grabs. Asked which Democrat might win back Pennsylvania, he said “probably Kamala,” referring to Kamala Harris, the California senator and former attorney general. There was one Democratic hopeful he was sure he would not vote for: Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. “He wants to take everything off the rich and give it to the poor: That’s communism,” Mr. DiCaprio said.It is probably no coincidence that most of the Pennsylvania Democrats who won Republican-held congressional seats last year were moderates who had defeated progressives in primary contests. The one progressive who made it to the general election in a competitive district, Scott Wallace, lost to the Republican, Brian Fitzpatrick, in Bucks County, which Hillary Clinton carried.Leading Democratic and Republican strategists in Pennsylvania said the most likely nominees to carry the state, at this early stage, appeared to be former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a native of Scranton, and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, both of whose centrist policies fit comfortably with the state’s voters.Both are “a Yuengling order for a Pennsylvanian right now,” said Ryan Costello, a former Republican congressman from suburban Philadelphia. That is, someone as familiar as the beer brewed in Pottsville.Mr. Costello said that by nominating a progressive in 2020 — he named Mr. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren — the general election would become a referendum on far-left policies rather than the president. “The whiplash on the left right now, it’s almost like they didn’t learn the lesson of why they were successful in 2018,” Mr. Costello said.Ms. Klobuchar has said she is no “magic genie” who can provide free college, and she prefers improving the Affordable Care Act rather than rolling out Medicare for all. She is Mr. Rendell’s top choice. “Amy is the only Democrat who did well during the Kavanaugh hearings,” he said.Mr. Biden, known as Pennsylvania’s “third senator” in his decades representing Delaware, is seen as able to win back white blue-collar voters who defected to Mr. Trump across the Rust Belt.But some Democrats quietly hope Mr. Biden does not run, fearing that his age — he is 76, four years older than Mr. Trump — puts him at a disadvantage, as does political baggage he carries from an earlier era.“I love Joe, but I think that with the new era, and the MeToo and all that, Joe has some skeletons in his closet,” said Jane Lyons, 63, a hospital administrative assistant in suburban Pittsburgh. “There are people coming up under me that won’t tolerate it.”As the president’s former lawyer Michael D. Cohen on Wednesday called Mr. Trump a racist, a cheat and a con man in House testimony, the solidity of the president’s base was on display here, especially the resentments of white working-class voters who turned out in droves for him in 2016.“We had eight years of nothing,” said Diane Pappert, 75, a retired school guard, referring to President Barack Obama, “and this guy’s trying to clean up everybody’s mess.”Her daughter Angie Hughes, 55, a nurse, had cast the first vote of her life for Mr. Trump. She said she would never vote for a Democrat because she believed that the party favored generous welfare benefits. “When you see people who have three, four, five children to different fathers, they have no plans of ever going to work,” she said.Lou Iezzi, 68, who still works at an auto garage he opened at 19, had voted Democratic for decades before casting a ballot for Mr. Trump. He liked the way he sounded as if he were on the next barstool, and Mr. Iezzi chuckled approvingly recalling Mr. Trump’s dismissive remarks about the newscaster Megyn Kelly in 2015 that were widely interpreted as referring to menstruation.Mr. Iezzi could vote for a Democrat in 2020 if the nominee “sounds like he’s talking honestly,” he said. His choice of the male pronoun was deliberate: “I just can’t see a woman running this country.”Rob Kopler, a retired deputy sheriff, who agrees with the president on a border wall, voted for him in 2016, but in the midterms he supported Mr. Lamb and Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat.He is doubtful any of the 2020 Democratic hopefuls will win him over. “The Democrat party let their people down,” he said. “They were going so far into the different extremes they forgot about who put them in office: the middle-class white male.”There were Democrats who had no problem with expansive government programs like Medicare for all or free public college. “Bernie would be a very good choice,” said Fran Balsomico, 66, who retired last year after three decades as an elementary school teacher.But others said someone would have to pay for such programs, and the most likely someones were suburbanites like themselves.Joe Carnevale, 59, an IT director at a public utility, is an independent who leans Democratic. He voted for Mrs. Clinton. “How do we get them back?” he asked of the Trump voters who were once loyal Democrats.“Someone’s got to take the Democrats into the real world,” Mr. Carnevale said. “Liberalism is good. There’s nothing wrong with that. But there has to be a middle there. We do have a working class.”"
447,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Efforts to reach a border security deal bogged down on Sunday, less than a week before parts of the federal government are again set to run out of money.The details: The breakdown appears to center on Democratic demands for a limit on the number of unauthorized immigrants already in the U.S. who could be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. That could force the Trump administration to focus on immigrants with criminal records, rather than on broader sweeps. Looking ahead: President Trump is scheduled to hold a rally tonight in El Paso to build support for his proposed border wall. Officials in the West Texas city dispute the president’s assertion that border fencing has reduced violent crime there.Related: Gov. Gavin Newsom of California is expected to withdraw nearly 400 of his state’s National Guard troops from the border with Mexico today.One of Robert Mueller’s prosecutors suggested last week that the special counsel investigation was focusing on Trump campaign officials’ response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and to American sanctions on Moscow.According to a transcript of a hearing in Washington, the prosecutor, Andrew Weissmann, discussed contacts between President Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and a Russian associate. Mr. Mueller’s team says that Mr. Manafort misled them about those discussions, and when pressed by the judge about why it mattered, Mr. Weissmann said, “This goes, I think, very much to the heart of what the special counsel’s office is investigating.”Background: Prosecutions by the special counsel have skirted the question of whether there was some kind of deal between Russia and Mr. Trump’s campaign. Persuading the U.S. to ease or end sanctions has been a primary goal of Moscow. Mr. Trump has dismissed Mr. Mueller’s investigation as a “witch hunt.”A draft resolution sent to a state House committee on Sunday directs lawmakers to determine whether the sexual assault accusations facing Lt.

In a video she secretly recorded last year, the adult daughter of the ruler of Dubai described a life of rigid restrictions and stunted hopes in the United Arab Emirates: “Especially if you’re a female, your life is so disposable.”In March, the princess known as Sheikha Latifa, pictured above left with her trainer, announced that she had left Dubai “for good.” But she was soon captured at sea and forcibly taken back. This is the story of her short-lived escape and the video that has reminded the world of the few freedoms allotted to women in the region. Splitting the bill for troops: South Korea agreed on Sunday to increase its contribution for the cost of the U.S. military presence on the Korean Peninsula.

But it was the King of Pop who would be remembered, as one dance critic put it, “coasting backward across the stage, step by gliding step, as if on a cushion of air.”"
448,"WASHINGTON — As the reality of divided government sank in the day after the midterm elections, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who had just expanded his majority, held out hope that he and incoming Speaker Nancy Pelosi would find a way to get things done despite their deep differences.“We’re not unfamiliar with each other,” Mr. McConnell told reporters in November, recounting their time working together on spending bills, “and we’ll probably have a lot more dealings with each other in the future.”Those dealings are off to a terrible start. A significant portion of the government remains shut down, angry accusations of irresponsibility are flying and the prospects of finding a quick solution to the crisis — or of coming together to pass significant legislation when it ends — remain grim.Now, with Mr. McConnell making his first significant legislative overture to break the stalemate on Sunday, the outcome might rest on the capacity of Ms. Pelosi and Mr. McConnell to find a way to bridge the divide between them, their parties and the White House.The two congressional leaders are ideological opposites who are two of the capital’s most experienced deal makers, yet to this point each has mainly called on the other to relent.“They come from very different universes,” said Antonia Ferrier, a former top aide to Mr. McConnell who also worked in the House for the Republican leader John A. Boehner.Ms. Pelosi says the Senate should allow votes on House-passed measures to reopen government agencies; Mr. McConnell says Democrats should support border-protection measures they have backed in the past — including those in the president’s offer on Saturday that would extend temporary protections for thousands of young immigrants at risk of deportation in exchange for wall funding. Mr. McConnell is intending to put on the Senate floor this week a plan that would immediately reopen the government, impose the deportation protections, provide the president’s wall money and offer other sweeteners for Democrats.Mr. McConnell has tried to turn up the pressure on Ms. Pelosi in recent days — with little success — in a series of speeches on the Senate floor, accusing the “very distinguished congresswoman from San Francisco” of playing to her party’s left wing with her description of the wall as an immorality.“These days, it seems like Democrats are happy to take their cues from the gentle lady from San Francisco and her extreme, fringe position that walls have now become immoral,” Mr. McConnell said in a typical rebuke to the newly restored speaker.In a phone call with the president before Saturday’s proposal announcement, Mr. McConnell encouraged Mr. Trump to extend the offer with temporary immigration protections as a way to reach out to Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats with a more appealing overture, according to a person familiar with the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation.Ms. Pelosi has argued that it is Mr. Trump’s intransigence — and Mr. McConnell’s refusal to allow a vote on House bills that would reopen the government but not fund a border wall, despite the Senate’s passage of such a measure last month — that is putting the nation at risk.“The president’s insistence on the wall is a luxury the country can no longer afford,” Ms. Pelosi said on Thursday.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, suggested that Mr. McConnell was “way out to lunch” in trying to place responsibility for the shutdown on Ms. Pelosi. Her allies in the House say the speaker is hardly the sort to wilt under Mr. McConnell’s attacks.“The bottom line is Pelosi is showing some leadership over here,” Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Rules Committee, said last week. “McConnell is behaving like a coward. He is afraid to take on Trump.”As longtime party leaders, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. McConnell have history with each other, much of it not good given their divergent ideologies. Ms. Pelosi was a harsh critic of the 2017 tax law that Mr. McConnell championed. They have also clashed bitterly over the Affordable Care Act and the economic stimulus program enacted by Democrats under Ms. Pelosi’s stewardship during the first years of President Barack Obama’s administration despite Mr. McConnell rallying his party in near blanket opposition to the Democratic agenda.Ms. Pelosi, in a television interview last year, characterized Mr. McConnell’s 2010 claim that his top priority was to make Mr. Obama a one-term president as a “racist statement.” The criticism irritated Mr. McConnell, who prides himself on his civil rights record and history. Ms. Pelosi’s office said she did not refer to Mr. McConnell himself as racist, but the comment still rankles the senator and his team.As the parties clashed over the shutdown, Mr. McConnell threw more fuel on the fire last week with an op-ed article in The Washington Post assailing the ethics and election overhaul legislation that Democrats proudly designated H.R. 1 to emphasize its centrality to the party’s image and agenda. Mr. McConnell belittled the package as a power grab and “a naked attempt to change the rules of American politics to benefit one party.”Ms. Pelosi and Mr. McConnell managed to work together in the past to produce spending measures covering foreign operations when they served as top members of the relevant appropriations subcommittees in the House and Senate nearly two decades ago. During the economic collapse of 2008, Mr. McConnell called Ms. Pelosi “extraordinary” in negotiating an economic recovery package embraced by both parties to calm the crisis, and she praised his leadership as well.A spokesman for Ms. Pelosi said that the relationship between the two was strictly business and that much more of Ms. Pelosi’s time was dedicated to working with Mr. Schumer and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader.Ms. Pelosi has ignored Mr. McConnell’s attacks, and Democrats do not believe they are doing much damage. She has instead focused her own efforts on pinning the shutdown on Mr. Trump, and suggested that he delay his State of the Union address scheduled for this month. He retaliated by canceling a military flight she intended to take to visit American troops in Afghanistan.Democrats had planned to use their new power center on Capitol Hill to showcase their legislative priorities. But the shutdown fight is instead consuming Congress and putting in serious doubt any possibilities for initiatives on a new North American trade deal, a plan to lower drug prices and a long-sought public works bill, among other proposals with some bipartisan underpinning. Not to mention the fact that Congress needs to raise the federal debt limit this spring.“I hope this is the low-water mark, and not the high-water mark,” said Representative Will Hurd of Texas, one of the few Republicans who have consistently joined Democrats in voting to reopen the government. “If this is an indication of how every particular issue is going to be, then divided government is going to be pretty rough on both sides.”While Democrats are not advancing their planned agenda at the moment, they believe the shutdown is significantly harming Mr. Trump, with public opinion polls showing him getting most of the blame. Senate Republicans also take solace in the fact that polls show they are not being held accountable, one of the reasons Mr. McConnell has kept his distance from the fight.Despite the lack of legislative activity, members of both parties still hope they can get back on track once the shutdown is resolved, with a public works bill considered the top bipartisan possibility.“Infrastructure is not and should not be a partisan issue,” said Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon and chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. “There is substantial agreement that it needs to be done. Once we can put this behind us, we can apply ourselves to doing a real infrastructure bill.”Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said common ground could be reached. “I mean, we’ll figure something out — we always do,” he said. “We passed the criminal justice reform bill that got, what, 80-plus votes in the midst of all this polarization, so we’ll figure something out. Don’t despair.”"
449,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Michael Cohen publicly testified in Congress today that President Trump knew an adviser was communicating with WikiLeaks and that Mr. Trump implicitly instructed Mr. Cohen to lie about a Trump Tower project in Moscow during the 2016 campaign.Calling Mr. Trump “a con man,” “a cheat” and “a racist,” Mr. Cohen said that Mr. Trump knew in advance through a longtime adviser, Roger Stone, that WikiLeaks would publish hacked emails from the campaign of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Mr. Cohen is now answering questions from the House Oversight and Reform Committee.Read: Mr. Cohen’s prepared remarks and the documents he provided to Congress to support his testimony.Closer look: Today’s hearing will focus in part on how much Mr. Trump knew about hush money payments and the proposed Trump Tower in Moscow. Here’s what we know about the two episodes.Yesterday: Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, denounced Mr. Cohen as a “disgraced felon.” Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, threatened to reveal what he said were Mr. Cohen’s extramarital affairs, rejecting assertions that his attack could amount to witness intimidation.President Trump met over dinner today with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in Hanoi, Vietnam, before the formal start of talks on Thursday over the North’s nuclear weapons program. (Hanoi is 12 hours ahead of Eastern Time.) “I think you will have a tremendous future with your country — a great leader,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Kim. “And I look forward to watching it happen and helping it to happen.” Here are the latest updates.Go deeper: Mr. Trump has signaled that he is willing to shift his administration’s goals from immediate dismantlement of the North’s arsenal to limits on its size and reach. “I don’t want to rush anybody,” he said this past weekend. “As long as there is no testing, we’re happy.” Another angle: In an interview with The Times, the highest-ranking North Korean diplomat to defect in years said Mr. Kim had no intention of relinquishing his nuclear arsenal.The effort to prevent President Trump from diverting funding to a border wall without congressional approval is headed for a vote in the Senate in the coming weeks, after the House passed the measure on Tuesday.Three Republican senators have already declared their backing for the measure, one shy of the number needed for Congress to ratify it. But it remains highly unlikely that there will be enough support to overturn Mr. Trump’s promised veto.The details: Thirteen House Republicans joined the Democrats to block the national emergency declaration. Here’s how every representative voted.Related: House Democrats subpoenaed three cabinet officials on Tuesday, escalating their battle over the administration’s policy of separating migrant families at the southern border.In a decision that could split the United Methodist Church, church officials and lay members from around the world voted on Tuesday to strengthen a ban on same-sex marriage and on gay and lesbian clergy.Some pastors and bishops in the U.S., where Methodists are the second-largest Protestant denomination, are already talking about leaving and possibly creating an alliance for gay-friendly churches. Notable: The vote reflected the growing clout of Methodists from outside the U.S. About 30 percent of the church’s 12 million members are from African nations, which typically have conservative Christian views.Tensions escalated today between the nuclear-armed neighbors after Pakistan’s military said it had shot down two Indian warplanes and captured a pilot. Pakistan had initially said that it held two Indians.India’s government later confirmed that one of its fighter jets had been “lost” as it thwarted an attempt by Pakistan’s air force to strike an unspecified target inside India.Yesterday: Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan promised to retaliate after Indian fighter jets crossed the disputed Kashmir region for the first time in decades to launch an airstrike within Pakistan.

The country has long led the region in progressive politics, including legalizing marijuana and same-sex marriage.While hard-liners in Miami might threaten military intervention to oust Mr. Maduro, on the laid-back streets of Montevideo, Uruguay’s capital, residents tend to resolve problems over a slow barbecue and the ever-present thermos of caffeine-rich mate (pronounced MAH-tay)."
450,"WASHINGTON — President Trump attacked Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday for rejecting his proposal to end the partial government shutdown, as he and Republican leaders in Congress sought to put Democrats on defense, a place they have rarely been during the shutdown stalemate.In a series of morning tweets, Mr. Trump said Ms. Pelosi had behaved “so irrationally” in spurning his offer to restore the temporary protections he took away from some undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall. He also pushed back against conservative critics who called the plan amnesty for immigrants who came to the United States illegally.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, plans to bring up legislation as early as Tuesday that would wrap Mr. Trump’s proposal into a broader package that would include billions of dollars in disaster relief and immediately reopen the government, an aide said. The move is intended to ratchet up pressure on Democrats, who have insisted they will not negotiate with Mr. Trump until the shutdown is over.“President Trump has put forward a serious and reasonable offer to reform parts of our broken immigration system and reopen government,” Representative Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader, said on Twitter. “The moment now turns to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. The country is watching.”But there was little indication from Democrats, who have denounced Mr. Trump’s plan as “hostage taking,” that they would abandon that position.“If he opens up the government, we’ll discuss whatever he offers, but hostage taking should not work,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, told reporters in New York on Sunday, adding, “It’s very hard to negotiate when a gun is held to your head.”With the shutdown now in its fifth week, and 800,000 federal employees still furloughed or working without pay, pressure is rising on both Republicans and Democrats to end it. If it lasts until Friday, Congress will be forced to reckon with another grim milestone: Affected workers will miss their second paycheck.[Read: Trump’s Deal Meets With Skepticism Among Immigrants in Texas]As Republicans go on offense in the Senate, Democrats will stay on offense in the House, where they have already passed a string of government funding bills that Mr. McConnell — who has largely remained on the sidelines during the shutdown debate — has refused to take up. On Wednesday, Ms. Pelosi plans to bring up a package of six bills to fund shuttered government agencies, ignoring Mr. Trump’s requests.The measures gained approval last year from Republicans on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees; in effect, Ms. Pelosi will be daring Republicans to vote against their own legislation. Democrats will also begin talking more about their own vision for border security — a shift in strategy for a party that has focused mostly on the economic and personal toll of the shutdown.Amid the posturing, however, there were some hints that Mr. Trump’s proposal, which he unveiled in a 13-minute White House address on Saturday, might open the door to talks that could result in a deal. Vice President Mike Pence, in an appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” suggested that Mr. Trump’s proposal might be amended on the Senate floor.“Well, of course,” Mr. Pence said, when the host, Chris Wallace, asked if he was open to negotiation. “The legislative process is a negotiation.”And Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a centrist Democrat, described Mr. Trump’s plan as “a starting point” on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” though he added, “You’ve got to start by reopening the government.”Polls show the public largely blames Mr. Trump for the shutdown, and his advisers have been searching for an exit strategy. Last week, Mr. McConnell told Mr. Trump, Mr. Pence and White House advisers that he needed the president to put forth a public offer so he could bring legislation to the floor.“McConnell’s view of shutdowns is when you’re in one, it’s a great opportunity for both sides to get things,” said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist and former McConnell aide who remains close to him. “And what I think is dumbfounding everyone here is: Why aren’t the Democrats treating it as a situation where they could get something? The president has opened the door for them to get something, so let’s talk.”Throughout his administration, Mr. Trump has sought to limit both legal and illegal immigration. Last year, he moved to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which shielded from deportation hundreds of thousands of young unauthorized immigrants known as Dreamers. He also revoked Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S., for some undocumented immigrants from Latin American and African countries.In the plan he unveiled on Saturday, Mr. Trump offered to restore the DACA and T.P.S. protections for three years. But Democrats say that is a nonstarter, because it does not offer a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, and because Mr. Trump is simply giving back protections that he himself took away.The McConnell aide, Don Stewart, said the Republican legislative package would include seven appropriations bills that would fund government agencies that have been partially closed for a month.“The legislation that the majority leader will bring to the floor this week would both reopen the remaining portions of the government, fund disaster relief, fund border security and address immigration issues that both Republicans and Democrats would like to address — all in one bill,” Mr. Stewart said.Mr. McConnell would need votes from all Republicans and seven Democrats for the package to pass. But only a handful of Democrats in Republican-leaning states might feel pressured enough to cross the aisle. A spokesman for one of them, Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, said Mr. Manchin — who just won re-election — would remain undecided on the Republican proposal until he saw it.In broadening the package beyond Mr. Trump’s plan, Mr. McConnell may be trying to pick up additional Democrats — especially those who are eager to vote for disaster relief.“He’s starting to move the pieces around to see what’s going to fly and what’s not going to make it,” said Jim Manley, who was a top aide to Harry Reid, the former Democratic leader from Nevada. “He’s trying to put the pressure back on Democrats, and he’s trying to see what the possibilities of a deal are by putting a larger package there. He’s trying to see how large the package has to be to bring Democrats on board.”But Mr. Trump seemed to be holding fast. He retweeted a series of endorsements of his proposal from Republican lawmakers on Sunday evening, and earlier in the day, he took aim at Ms. Pelosi and pushed back against conservative critics who have described the plan as amnesty for undocumented immigrants.“Nancy Pelosi and some of the Democrats turned down my offer yesterday before I even got up to speak,” Mr. Trump wrote. “They don’t see crime & drugs, they only see 2020 — which they are not going to win. Best economy! They should do the right thing for the Country & allow people to go back to work.”Mr. Trump went on: “Nancy Pelosi has behaved so irrationally & has gone so far to the left that she has now officially become a Radical Democrat. She is so petrified of the ‘lefties’ in her party that she has lost control...And by the way, clean up the streets in San Francisco, they are disgusting!”And to his conservative critics, Mr. Trump wrote: “No, Amnesty is not a part of my offer. It is a 3 year extension of DACA. Amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal, whether on immigration or something else. Likewise there will be no big push to remove the 11,000,000 plus people who are here illegally — but be careful Nancy!”Ms. Pelosi took to Twitter to strike back. “@realdonaldtrump, 800,000 Americans are going without pay. Re-open the government, let workers get their paychecks and then we can discuss how we can come together to protect the border,” she wrote, using the hashtag #EndTheShutdown."
451,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.Four years ago, the Conservative Political Action Conference featured a parade of Republican stars. There was Ted Cruz! Chris Christie! Marco Rubio! Rand Paul! Even the reality TV personality Donald J. Trump made an appearance.Fast forward to 2019. Now, there’s only one attraction: President Trump.This year at CPAC, attendees can pose at a fake White House podium, admire an enormous mural of Mr. Trump with a bald eagle, and buy MAGA gear at an official Trump store set up at the front of the convention center. Wandering the halls are once-high-profile supporters of Mr. Trump like Kris Kobach, who lost his bid for governor of Kansas, and the former White House press secretary Sean Spicer.Founded in 1974 as a protest of sorts against President Richard Nixon, the conservative confab used to be a wild event, a mash-up of religious leaders, Tea Partyers in colonial garb and all kinds of fringier parts of the right. From the stage, rising Republican stars fought for their support.This is where Ronald Reagan, as governor of California, tested early versions of his message of a “shining city on a hill.” Where Newt Gingrich celebrated becoming House speaker. Where Mitt Romney described himself as “severely conservative” as he tried to win over the base in 2012. And where Mr. Trump first alluded to running for president as a Republican eight years ago.CPAC is the place where conservative activists have long declared their priorities to the Republican establishment.But in 2019, they don’t need to make their agenda known to the establishment. They are the establishment.“This is probably my eighth or ninth CPAC, and it feels very different,” said Mark Lloyd of Virginia, who headed up a Tea Party organization before backing the Trump campaign. “You’ve actually got people here now that they don’t doubt Trump. Trump doubt is dissipated.”During my visit, speaker after speaker thanked the president: for nominating Brett Kavanaugh, fighting abortion rights, standing up for Israel, supporting gun rights. They blasted Democrats for threatening impeachment.“We’ve got a lot in common now — I like him and he likes him,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, a onetime critic of Mr. Trump who has become one of the president’s strongest supporters. “Four more years.”Of course, the biggest attraction on the agenda is the president, who will address the crowd on Saturday. Vice President Mike Pence speaks tomorrow, along with a number of other administration officials and supporters.But conservative celebrities, not political leaders, are the big draw. Diamond and Silk, two African-American women who have become minor internet stars for their videos praising Mr. Trump, got the liveliest reception today. “When they try to play the race card, I want you all to stand up and play the Trump card, so we can win and win,” they said, as the audience jumped to their feet, cheering.The issues that could expose some cracks in the Republican Party — trade, economic populism, the emergency declaration over the border wall — got little attention compared to topics like abortion, censorship of conservatives and the rise of socialism.In my tour through the conference, I found that it lacked the kind of freewheeling energy that once made it a must-see political show. The audience wasn’t nearly as raucous, the garb not nearly as gonzo. Even the infamous straw poll, once a test of conservative opinion, asked participants to rate not Republicans but Democrats.Some of that is because Republicans are no longer fighting for power in the same way, given that the party controls the Senate, the Supreme Court and the White House. Some is a result of how the organizers have worked over recent years to push out the raucous Ron Paul supporters who once overran the event.But mostly, the changed atmosphere underscores just how much the president and his brand of no-holds-barred politicking has conquered the Republican Party.____________________Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers.

452,"WASHINGTON — A bus emblazoned with the United States Air Force logo was idling outside the Capitol on Thursday, members of Congress on board, ready to depart for Joint Base Andrews and a waiting military aircraft. Inside, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was in her office making final preparations to lead the congressional delegation on a secret visit to American troops in Afghanistan with a stop in Brussels.Then came word from the White House: President Trump was grounding their plane and killing the trip.Mr. Trump’s decision to upend Ms. Pelosi’s travel plans was a remarkable bit of one-upmanship in an increasingly bitter government shutdown drama in which Mr. Trump and Ms. Pelosi, the newly elected Democratic speaker, are the main antagonists.The day before, Ms. Pelosi had suggested that the president cancel or delay his State of the Union address this month, citing security concerns amid a prolonged partial shutdown that has forced thousands of federal employees to work without pay. Mr. Trump at first said nothing, but 24 hours later, without mentioning her request, the president released a sarcasm-tinged letter in which he told her the trip was off.“In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the strong border security movement to end the shutdown.”“Obviously,” Mr. Trump added, she still had the option of flying commercial.[Read more on how Nancy Pelosi’s aides are accusing the Trump Administration of leaking her travel plans.]The letter amounted to the latest reminder, if any was needed, that the stalemate over Mr. Trump’s demand that Democrats support his request for $5.7 billion to build a border wall has reached such a poisonous pitch that even the most tradition-bound rituals of government — the president’s annual address to a joint session of Congress, lawmakers’ periodic trips overseas to gather facts and perform oversight — have been consumed in a storm of ill will and competing agendas.It came on the 27th day of the shutdown, a day on which there were once again no negotiations between the two sides. But there was some indication that House Democrats, increasingly concerned that they have not sufficiently countered Mr. Trump’s demands for a wall with ideas of their own, were privately weighing offering their own plan for more effectively securing the border.The move would be something of a shift in strategy for the Democrats, who have steadfastly refused to engage in a debate with Mr. Trump about border security as long as the government remains shuttered.“There have been concerns by some members saying we need to tell our constituents what we’re for and what it would look like in terms of border security,” said Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, Democrat of California and the chairwoman of the appropriations subcommittee that handles homeland security. “That is probably a way to respond to that, and a way that does not violate what we are saying: open up the government and then we will talk about border security.”Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon and the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, who told a group of committee chairmen at a closed-door meeting on Wednesday that it was time for their party to go public with its own border security ideas, reiterated the idea in an interview.The president, he said, “is making this about border security, but what he is proposing would not provide real border security — it’s a stupid, static wall which is a symbol, and it’s not a great symbol, and it would be ineffective.”Among the investments that Mr. DeFazio said should be made instead are more money for Coast Guard equipment and personnel to intercept maritime drug shipments, better technology to scan vehicles legally crossing the border to detect illegal drugs, resources for costly reconfiguration of border crossings to make them more secure, and funds for additional personnel to police them.“It’s a horrible waste of money when we have real needs,” Mr. DeFazio said of Mr. Trump’s wall, “so I just want to highlight the real needs to counter his fake proposal.”Ms. Pelosi hinted at such a proposal in a morning news conference on Thursday, where she also said that Mr. Trump had yet to respond to her request about delaying his speech. “Very silent more than 24 hours,” the speaker told reporters.But the lull did not last long.Mr. Trump’s decision to revoke Ms. Pelosi’s military transport drew howls of outrage from Democrats and some Republicans, and threw into disarray a long-planned trip by the speaker and senior lawmakers — including the chairmen of the House Intelligence and Foreign Affairs Committees — to visit American allies and troops stationed overseas.Democrats, newly in control of the House and eager to use their power to challenge Mr. Trump, vowed that they would not be bullied into scrapping the trip altogether.“We’re not going to allow the president of the United States to tell the Congress it can’t fulfill its oversight responsibilities, it can’t ensure that our troops have what they need whether our government is open or closed,” said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the intelligence panel.“We are a coequal branch of government,” Mr. Schiff said, suggesting that the president apparently did not understand the new reality in Washington. “It may not have been that way with the past two years when he had a Republican Congress willing to roll over anytime he asked, but that is no longer the case.”Mr. Schiff was on the bus outside the Rayburn House Office Building near the Capitol when Mr. Trump fired off his letter, along with Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and several other lawmakers in what made for an unusual tableau.Instead of heading for Joint Base Andrews and boarding a military plane, the lawmakers sat stunned on their bus, unsure of what to do next, until it eventually drove slowly to the Capitol driveway — some journalists jogging or riding electric scooters to keep up — to disgorge its perplexed passengers. At one point, the House sergeant-at-arms, the chamber’s chief law enforcement officer, turned up to puzzle over the security arrangements for the lawmakers, whose secret travel plans were now public. And the speaker, holed up in her office with aides as reporters mixed near the Rotunda with tourists oblivious to the drama, calmly plotted her next steps.In the hallway one floor below, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, sputtered with anger.“It’s petty, it’s small, it’s vindictive,” Mr. Hoyer said. “It is unbecoming of a president of the United States, but it is unfortunately a daily occurrence.”White House officials — including Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff — had been irked by Ms. Pelosi’s invocation of security concerns as her premise for urging Mr. Trump to move his speech, and sought to put her in her place after she had emphasized that she represented a coequal branch in governing, according to aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions.Depriving Ms. Pelosi of an aircraft was the easiest way to remind her, they said. So Mr. Trump made a play for dominance and one-upmanship reminiscent of his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, when he was mayor of New York. White House aides were tickled by the move, even as some acknowledged that Republican House members might fear for their own trips going forward.Some of Mr. Trump’s usual allies were less amused.“One sophomoric response does not deserve another,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said in a statement.“Speaker Pelosi’s threat to cancel the State of the Union is very irresponsible and blatantly political,” he added. “President Trump denying Speaker Pelosi military travel is also inappropriate.”[Read the letter here.]Later in the day, the Trump administration had some good news for State Department employees, announcing that despite the stalemate it was asking furloughed workers to return to work on Tuesday, citing the department’s vital national security mission.It was the latest instance of the administration determining that an agency or department has a critical mission and its employees should return to work. But unlike in other parts of the government, the State Department employees will be paid, at least for work performed in the next pay period.Military planes are traditionally provided to congressional delegations for foreign trips, which are typically kept secret because of security concerns, particularly when lawmakers are heading to war zones and the delegation includes high-ranking congressional leaders. The White House has known about the trip since early last week, when it was brought to its attention by the Defense Department, according to White House officials.A spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, Drew Hammill, noted that Mr. Trump had traveled to Iraq to visit with American forces there during what he referred to as the “Trump Shutdown.” He added that the trip by the congressional delegation had a similar purpose.“The purpose of the trip was to express appreciation and thanks to our men and women in uniform for their service and dedication, and to obtain critical national security and intelligence briefings from those on the front lines,” Mr. Hammill said.A White House spokesman said that all coming official visits by lawmakers, known as congressional delegations or “codels,” would be canceled until the shutdown is over, and by day’s end on Thursday, officials announced that Mr. Trump had also canceled plans to send Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland.But Melania Trump, the first lady, kept her plans to fly on a military jet to West Palm Beach, Fla., to go to the family’s Mar-a-Lago compound.As of late Thursday, multiple congressional officials could not say, citing security concerns, whether Ms. Pelosi’s trip to Afghanistan was still on."
453,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning.President Trump prepares to meet with North Korea’s leader, tensions between India and Pakistan reach new heights, and Britain’s Labour Party changes its stance on a Brexit vote. Here’s the latest:On Wednesday, Kim Jong-un and President Trump are to meet in Hanoi, Vietnam, to discuss the North’s nuclear arsenal. The two leaders might also declare an end to the Korean War, which was technically only paused, according to South Korean officials. Seoul has long pushed for the peace declaration as a way to incentivize the North to give up its nuclear weapons.The meeting holds special significance for the vast Korean diaspora in Japan, who arrived during the Japanese occupation of the Korean Peninsula. Many of these people, known as Zainichi, have family members isolated in the North.History: In the late 1950s, Tokyo worked to repatriate Koreans who had moved or were forcibly taken to Japan to work during World War II.North Korea’s economy was then larger than the South’s and its promises of socialist programs were attractive. Nearly 95,000 Koreans migrated to the North — among them, the mother of the current North Korean leader.Go deeper: Mr. Kim’s visit to Vietnam, his first, will be full of symbolism. We break down the historical and political undercurrents of his itinerary in the fellow Communist country, which has shared a long friendship with North Korea.Facing a rash of resignations from Labour and the prospect of more, the party’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, dropped his resistance to a second referendum on whether the country should withdraw from the European Union.The amendment is unlikely to be approved in Parliament any time soon, but it will cheer those in the country who have been fighting to reverse the outcome of the 2016 referendum.What’s next: On Wednesday, Parliament is expected to vote to eliminate the chaotic option of leaving the E.U. without a transition plan in place. That would leave Prime Minister Theresa May, who met with European leaders in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on Monday, with few options to complete Brexit by the March 29 deadline.Go deeper: Mrs. May has said that Britain’s era of austerity is over. But a divorce from the European Union could depress growth for years. We explain austerity and how it has affected the politics of those who grew up knowing only the “big squeeze.”In January, Xi Jinping, China’s president, summoned hundreds of officials to Beijing to convey an urgent message: The Communist Party faces major risks on all fronts.Whether dealing with foreign policy, trade, unemployment and even disillusionment among China’s youth, Mr. Xi called on officials to keep trouble from spiraling into real threats. He demanded stricter controls on the internet and warned officials to beware of “black swans” and “gray rhinos” — meaning surprise economic shocks and financial risks hiding in plain sight.Why it matters: The warnings underscore how slowing growth in China and the country’s trade war with the U.S. are starting to affect the party’s authority. Mr. Xi is in no mood to take any risks, while U.S. trade negotiators have pushed Beijing to decrease state control of the economy.Trade talks: President Trump delayed his self-imposed March 1 deadline for increasing tariffs on Chinese goods, citing “substantial progress” in negotiations this week in Washington. He said he hoped to meet Mr. Xi to finalize the agreement, but no new deadline was set and no details of any potential deal were released.In the past few days, India has moved thousands of new troops into the Kashmir Valley. Families are fleeing the border area. A government directive ordered hospitals to “gear up their Rapid Response Teams.” Food and fuel supplies are running out. And both countries have fired artillery shells.After a Kashmiri suicide bomber killed dozens of Indian paramilitary police officers this month — an attack that India blamed on Pakistan — tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors have reached a point that analysts say could be the most dangerous in years.The chances: An all-out conflict seems unlikely, some experts say. Though the two countries have gone to war over Kashmir several times since partition in 1947, neither side wants a dramatic escalation now.But the risks are compounded by a coming election in India in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party is using the episode to fan the flames of Hindu nationalism.Iran: The country’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, abruptly resigned, bringing an end to the tenure of one of the Islamic Republic’s best-known figures abroad. In his announcement on Instagram he cited his “shortcomings,” but as a proponent and broker of the country's nuclear deal, he has been under strong pressure from hardliners.Afghanistan: The Taliban and the U.S. began their highest-level negotiations yet in Doha, Qatar, with the insurgent group’s deputy leader, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, at the table. His presence raises the possibility of progress toward ending the conflict.Australia: In the past decade, officials in Western Australia have sent thousands of people to jail for petty crimes — unpaid fines from minor offenses, loitering or failure to register a dog. Aboriginal women made up a highly disproportionate share of those arrests.Bangladesh: Special forces stormed a plane on the tarmac of an airport in Dhaka, the capital, and fatally shot a passenger who had tried to storm the cockpit after takeoff and forced the pilots to make an emergency landing.The border wall: The House of Representatives will vote on Tuesday on a resolution to end President Trump’s national emergency declaration to pay for the wall. Some former Republican lawmakers are pressing their party to split with Mr. Trump and vote for the measure.India: This year’s Kumbh Mela, a Hindu pilgrimage that is the largest religious gathering in the world, was the biggest and most expensive ever, complete with “glamping” options. Critics say the once-humbling event has become too luxurious and corporate.Venezuela: Vice President Mike Pence announced new sanctions on Venezuelan officials allied with the country’s embattled president, Nicolás Maduro.The Oscars: In case you missed it, Rami Malek and Olivia Colman went home with the big prizes. “Green Book,” a movie about a white chauffeur who drives his black client through segregation-era America, won best picture despite criticism for being a clichéd racial reconciliation story. Here’s a roundup of the best and worst moments from the ceremony and, of course, the red carpet.John Legend: The EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony) winner spoke to The Times Magazine about R. Kelly, Kanye West and his new single, “Preach,” that bemoans political inaction. “Part of what I’ve been able to do,” Legend said, “is put a sympathetic face on some radical actions.”Tips for a more fulfilling life.Recipe of the day: This spicy, lamb-forward take on a ragù is done in a fraction of the usual time.

Susanne Fischer of New York City suggested the Oxford comma, which was traditionally used at Oxford University Press.“I’m a big fan, use it often, and think it’s really important for clarification,” she wrote.The Times, like most other news organizations, does not usually use the comma, which is also known as the serial comma. “In general, do not use a comma before and or or in a series: The snow stalled cars, buses and trains,” our stylebook says.“A goal of punctuation is to make a sentence as clear as possible, and in most cases that final comma isn’t necessary for understanding the relationship of all the items in a series,” said Susan Wessling, The Times’s senior editor for editing standards.There are exceptions. Around this time last year, a Maine dairy company agreed to pay its drivers $5 million after a dispute that hinged entirely on the lack of an Oxford comma — in a list of activities that did not require overtime payments.Inyoung Kang, a home screen editor based in London, wrote today’s Back Story.Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

454,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. British business braces for impact, President Trump gives an interview to The Times, and European teenagers become a protest vanguard. Here’s the latest: Companies across Britain, faced with confusion around the country’s pending departure from the E.U., have been stockpiling products, making backup plans and exploring new shipping routes. International banks are shifting thousands of jobs from Britain to the Continent.“It’s meant extra resources, extra overtime, to get it done,” said one executive. “It’s incredibly annoying.”By the numbers: Britain’s economy is 2.3 percent smaller than it would have been if voters in 2016 had opted to remain in the E.U., according to one research institution. And investment in the auto sector was found to have plunged by almost 50 percent in 2018.What’s next? Parliament remains mired in disagreement and the E.U. disinclined to reopen matters. Sixty days out from the March 29 deadline to leave the bloc, uncertainty is spreading.Come again? As a BBC anchor ended an evening news program by saying, “Theresa May says she intends to go back to Brussels to renegotiate her Brexit deal,” the screen showed grainy images of World War II planes that appeared to be Spitfires. Watch here. President Trump told our reporters in an 85-minute interview on Thursday that negotiations with Congress over his border wall were a “waste of time” and that he would proceed without lawmakers. This weekend he will retreat to Mar-a-Lago — his gilded club where all is well.Russia investigation: Mr. Trump denied an account by his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, that late in the 2016 presidential campaign he was still discussing a project to build a Trump-branded skyscraper in Moscow. He also claimed that his lawyers had been reassured by the outgoing deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, that the president himself is not a target of the special counsel, Robert Mueller. Here are five takeaways from what Mr. Trump said.Trade: Mr. Trump spoke immediately after wrapping up a session with China’s visiting vice premier in which the president said they had made progress toward defusing the trade war. In other Washington news: The Senate voted to pass nonbinding bipartisan legislation that objects to Mr. Trump’s withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan and Syria, the second time in two months that the Senate has rebuked the president’s foreign policy.“Police investigators, tax officers, pro-government tabloids” have become the hammers of President Aleksandar Vucic and his populist, conservative Serbian Progressive Party. That was the testimony to the Council in Europe in November of Nebojsa Zelenovic, the mayor of Sabac, one of the few places not controlled by the governing party.Serbia has become a live wire of contradictions running through Mr. Vucic, a former information minister for the strongman Slobodan Milosevic who rebranded himself as a moderate. He faces intense protests as he both strives for E.U. membership and celebrates President Vladimir Putin of Russia. In an interview with The Times, he painted the protest movement as agitation against his risky plan to settle over Kosovo, and against E.U. membership. Mr. Zelenovic countered that “beneath that European surface, Vucic is a dictator.”Big picture: Last year, Borko Stefanovic, an opposition politician who speaks out about the overlap between government and organized crime, was attacked by three men and beaten viciously. He survived, and a protest movement of tens of thousands grew from early December to resist Mr. Vuvic and push pro-democratic measures. Quote: “I think that we belong to a very democratic society,” Mr. Vuvic said with characteristic calm.A loose-knit environmental movement has emerged in Europe over the past several weeks, and it’s driven by young people. Details: Tens of thousands of students skipped school in Belgium on Thursday to join demonstrations for action against climate change, the fourth consecutive Thursday of such action. Protests have sprung almost spontaneously from social media in France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and elsewhere. The inspiration of much of it is Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swede who has called for school strikes against global warming.Impact: After meeting with climate activists this week, Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium said he was prepared to act, but he also alluded to the financial concerns of the “Yellow Vest” movement in France — a sign of tensions in Europe between fighting global warming on the one hand and economic troubles on the other. Italy: The country officially went into recession, and Europe as a whole is essentially at an economic standstill, a possible signal that the world is headed for a significant slowdown.India: The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which came into power five years ago vowing to create millions of jobs, has been accused of suppressing an official report on unemployment that apparently showed it had reached a 45-year high in 2017. E.U.-Iran relations: After months of delay, Britain, France and Germany unveiled a way to continue doing business with Iran despite U.S. sanctions. It is unclear when the vehicle, a new company called Instex, for bartering, will become operational. Trump Organization: A slate of Brazilian investors have been arrested and charged with diverting pension money into a Trump-branded hotel project in Rio de Janeiro, from which the Trump campaign exited in December 2016 because of what it called construction delays. An international arrest warrant will be issued for the project’s mastermind, Paulo Figueiredo Filho — the grandson of the last dictator in the authoritarian government that ran Brazil from 1964 to 1985.Soccer and social justice: An increasing number of powerful sports executives have called for the release of a Bahrain-born soccer player, Hakeem al-Araibi, who has refugee status in Australia but has been detained in Thailand since late November.

455,"WASHINGTON — As the partial government shutdown took hold over the holidays, President Trump seemed to express wonder at being alone in the White House with little but the cheeriness of heavily armed guards to keep him warm for the better part of a week.“I was waving to them,” Mr. Trump said just after New Year’s Day. “I never saw so many guys with machine guns in my life. Secret Service and military. These are great people.”Mr. Trump’s “Home Alone”-like Christmas tale has hardened into a 20-day standoff as relations between his administration and Congress over his $5 billion demand for a border wall grow ever frostier. The White House has stopped paying its water bill. Desks of some furloughed employees, whose job can include such drudgeries as helping their bosses work the copy machine, sit empty in the West Wing.And the Secret Service agents Mr. Trump was so impressed with, down to the officers who check IDs and wave black SUVs in and out of the gates surrounding the complex, are all working unpaid — everyone in the Secret Service is, according to an official at the agency.However, the agency said, “those employees who are performing emergency work involving the safety of human life or the protection of property, the majority of the Secret Service work force, must continue to report to work.”With paychecks failing to fatten the bank accounts of some 800,000 federal workers, the pain of this partial shutdown bit into all corners of America — even the White House, where there is often very little sympathy for those whose job it is to keep Washington running. Only 156 of the Executive Mansion’s 359 full-time employees are allowed to report for duty because their work is considered essential, according to a government contingency plan.But multiple administration officials have stressed this week that despite the shutdown, it is still business as usual. The janitors are emptying the trash and vacuuming offices. The Navy-run White House mess is still serving food — this week, chicken and dumpling soup was on the menu, after leaner offerings including fruit, nuts and other snacks were presented last week on an abbreviated schedule because of the new year.Still, while Trump administration officials emphasize the normality, others who have endured lengthy shutdowns warned of the broader effects on the White House staff, including an inevitable slowdown in accomplishing important policy decisions with fewer workers.“I don’t think people appreciate how isolated you feel,” Jennifer Palmieri, a former communications director for President Barack Obama and a former aide in the Clinton White House, which owns the current record — 21 days — for a shutdown, an unfortunate benchmark Mr. Trump is poised to pass if the impasse continues.Ms. Palmieri said the two shutdowns she experienced were “distinct in my mind as extraordinary moments because there are so few people around and because the stakes are so high.”During a shutdown during the Obama administration in 2013, Ms. Palmieri recalls that she and other workers were forced to bring in their own food, feed the occasional hungry reporter with instant macaroni and cheese fished out of desk drawers, and cart out their own trash.Emptying her own trash was not her biggest concern.“You can get caught up in winning this fight to the detriment of a lot of other policy,” Ms. Palmieri said, “and also your own political capital for the long term.”Bracing for a fight has not always appeared to be a particular concern for aides in this White House, which tends to function in a state of personnel flux and operates with a trench-warfare mentality in the best of times.At the center of the operation, after all, is a commander in chief who emphasizes the importance of never backing down, and Mr. Trump, who is said to be exploring ways to circumvent the need for Congress to provide money by declaring a national emergency — has given every indication that he doesn’t care how long this fight goes on.But some of the president’s furloughed aides are among those who are not able to communicate with others using work phones or email, or seek outside income, rules that have spanned administrations. It all sounds familiar to Cody Keenan, a former speechwriter for Mr. Obama. Mr. Keenan recalled that he was able to continue commuting to his West Wing office during the shutdown in 2013, but many other staff members, including fellow speechwriters, most of whom were stationed in the adjacent Eisenhower Executive Office Building, could not.“Our teams were hit really hard,” Mr. Keenan said in an email. “My speechwriters were furloughed, and we were legally barred from contacting each other until the shutdown ended. Not being paid was especially hard on younger staff who didn’t have any savings yet. But there’s nothing you can do.”Federal employees are counting on getting back their lost pay at some point, but contracted workers could face a different outcome. A spokeswoman for the General Services Administration said that facility managers — considered federal employees — and many contracted janitors and maintenance workers in some offices are still working, but was not able to say whether the contractors would eventually receive their pay.“If they are contractors,” said Amanda Osborn, a spokesman for the agency, “their pay is determined by the status of their contract.”Besides the issue of paying workers, other practical matters at the White House have been left unattended for now.Days after the shutdown took hold, representatives from the Treasury Department left notice with DC Water, the Washington water utility, that the federal government’s $16.5 million quarterly water bill would not be fully paid, leading to a lively discussion among the DC Water Board about at what point a client’s water could be cut off, according to a report from the news website WAMU.It turns out the board will let this one slide.“We are not turning off water to the White House,” Vincent Morris, a DC Water spokesman, said in an email. The outstanding tab: $5 million.Lengthy shutdowns can be disastrous for the White House for other reasons.The last time a shutdown went on for this long, President Bill Clinton put himself on the long road to impeachment when he approached a young intern named Monica Lewinsky in an empty corner of the West Wing. Nonessential employees had been sent home, unpaid interns were brought in to work, and the rest is bitter history.The Obama administration barred interns from coming to work during a shutdown, and the Trump White House’s new class of interns has not yet started, according to a senior official.(“It’s a smart move not to” allow them in, Leon E. Panetta, Mr. Clinton’s former chief of staff during the shutdown, said in an interview.)On Thursday, as the most recent shutdown approached the 21-day mark, Mr. Trump was grudgingly coaxed from the White House. He took a handful of people still working in the White House with him aboard Air Force One to Texas, where he met with border security officials and people whose lives had been affected by the scourge of illegal immigration, not a nagging shutdown.At least seven senior aides were aboard the flight, including Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser; Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his press secretary; Bill Shine, his deputy chief of staff for communications; Mick Mulvaney, his acting chief of staff; and Stephen Miller, a senior White House adviser and architect of the administration’s “zero tolerance” immigration policies.Some may have seen it as a way for the president to break out of his self-imposed shutdown isolation and learn about its effect on legions of federal workers, some of whom are back home, standing sentry on his front lawn. But Mr. Panetta warned that it might have had another effect.“The primary danger is that the president feels that somehow whatever he’s doing he’s winning,” Mr. Panetta said, “and tries to tell himself that it’s the other side that’s going to break first.”"
456,"Good morning. Venezuela’s opposition plans a dramatic next move, Chinese and Iranian hackers step up anti-U.S. efforts and Facebook is excoriated in a British report. Here’s the latest: The Trump administration and the Venezuelan opposition have a plan to weaken President Nicolás Maduro: getting desperately needed food and medicine into the country.On Saturday, the two forces are set to unleash an ambitious, coordinated land-and-sea effort to move supplies through Colombia, Brazil and Curaçao and into the hands of thousands of Venezuelans.At a rally in Florida, President Trump contentiously framed the struggle as against socialism broadly. “In Venezuela, and across the Western Hemisphere, socialism is dying and liberty, prosperity and democracy are being reborn,” he said. “We seek a peaceful transition of power, but all options are open.”Ahead: The opposition has not said how it will break past Mr. Maduro’s blockade, saying that releasing plans would allow him to stymie the effort. Some activists have suggested simply smuggling the aid in. Others say protesters from Venezuela could overrun soldiers. Risk: Mr. Maduro has sent troops to the border, and tensions over the aid are high. One analyst warned of the possibility of “a hair-trigger moment.” And embracing Mr. Trump could make the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, look like a U.S. puppet. Dozens of American corporations and government agencies have been hit by attacks that have been attributed to Iran, according to analysts at the National Security Agency and the private security firm FireEye.Those cyberattacks coincide with a renewed effort by China to steal trade and military secrets from U.S. military contractors and technology companies that include Boeing, General Electric and T-Mobile, according to nine intelligence officials, private security researchers and lawyers familiar with the attacks.Context: Cyberespionage from both Iran and China had cooled under former President Barack Obama, who reached landmark agreements with both in 2015. The attacks spiked again after President Trump opened a trade war with Beijing and reneged on the Iran nuclear deal last year.France is having a crisis of conscience about its perennial and growing problem of anti-Semitism after Alain Finkielkraut, one of the country’s leading essayists and critics from the right, was mobbed by Yellow Vest protesters near his Paris home over the weekend and assailed with anti-Semitic insults. The son of an Auschwitz survivor, he was told to “Go home to Israel!”Mr. Finkielkraut renounced his support for the Yellow Vest movement last week, attracting the ire of its members. Fueled by economic and class resentments, the protesters have previously given off whiffs of anti-Semitism, with coded conspiracy theories about Jewish influence circulating at the edges of the movement. The police are investigating the invective against Mr. Finkielkraut, who has been accused of prejudice himself over his views on immigration. By the numbers: Episodes of anti-Semitism in France jumped 74 percent last year, to 541, up from 311 in 2017, according to government data. (There has also been an uptick in New York.)In Britain: Seven lawmakers resigned from the Labour Party to become independents, one of them accusing Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, of tolerating anti-Semitism in the party, and others denouncing him for refusing to call for a new referendum on Brexit. Decades after the crisis of clerical sexual abuse of minors first exploded into public view, victims of sexual abuse have arrived in Rome for a landmark meeting Pope Francis is holding with representatives of the world’s bishops’ conferences.The victims will speak of their experiences during evening prayers. Context: The meeting comes as more instances of sexual abuse emerge, including the long-overshadowed abuse of nuns by priests. A Times investigation found that the crisis even goes beyond abuse to the suppression and shaming of homosexual priests. And the Vatican revealed to The Times that it has general guidelines for what to do when clerics break celibacy vows and father children. Some of those children will be at the meeting.Over the weekend: Pope Francis expelled a former cardinal and archbishop of Washington from the priesthood after the church found him guilty of sexually abusing minors and adult seminarians. The former cardinal, Theodore McCarrick, was the first Catholic leader at that level to be defrocked for sexual abuse.In the Southern Baptist church: The largest evangelical denomination in the U.S. announced initial recommendations for addressing revelations of rife sexual abuse in Southern Baptist churches across the country.Facebook: After an 18-month investigation, a British parliamentary committee issued a scathing report accusing the social media company of breaking data privacy and competition laws. Trump vs. Europe: At a security conference in Munich last week, the rift between Europe and the Trump administration became open, angry and concrete, diplomats and analysts say. Leaders and officials from across the continent, particularly Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, laced into the Trump administration’s foreign policy and warned that U.S. isolationism would embolden Russia and China.Brexit: Wall Street’s biggest banks, including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, are shifting their operations from London to European capitals, reshaping the financial industry across the continent. And Honda said it would close its plant in Swindon, which employs 3,500 workers, by 2021.Yemen: Houthi fighters have left a million unmarked land mines across much of the country, stalling the onslaught of Saudi-backed forces but also killing and maiming civilians. U.S.: A coalition of 16 states, including California and New York, challenged President Trump in court over his plan to use emergency powers to spend billions of dollars on his border wall.Poland: After Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said on Thursday that “the Poles cooperated with the Nazis” in the Holocaust, Poland’s president withdrew on Monday from a trip to Israel that was planned with the leaders of three other East European countries. Kashmir: Militants in the disputed region killed an Indian Army major and at least three other soldiers just days after carrying out a bombing that left more than 40 Indian paramilitary officers dead. The attacks have unleashed jingoism across India and raised the specter of conflict with Pakistan. Transportation: Virgin Hyperloop One, a company based in Los Angeles and partly backed by Sir Richard Branson, is testing a mass transit system that would put passengers in pods speeding through vacuum tubes at more than 600 miles per hour.  While such visions are a distant dream, hyperloop companies have attracted key talent and enthusiastic municipalities.Technology: The founder of the Chinese technology giant Huawei, breaking from the company’s previous silence about U.S. criminal charges against the company and his daughter, a top executive, called the case against her politically motivated.Is the game called “tag,” “tig,” “tick” or “it”?

But real, meaningful relationships thrive when they’re face-to-face. It’s as simple as making time for them.Puccini’s “Madama Butterfly” is one of the most popular operas ever written. It would have been pretty amazing to be at its premiere, which was given this week in 1904, right?Undoubtedly — because it was one of the great fiascos in opera history.The premiere, at the storied Teatro alla Scala in Milan, was often drowned out by what one critic described as “groans, roars, moos, laughs, bellows, sneers.” The New York Times reported that the opera had been “received rather coldly.”Puccini compared the experience to a lynching. Some believed rivals had organized claques to embarrass him. Others cited the opera’s difficult subject matter: An unsympathetic American naval lieutenant impregnates and abandons a Japanese teenager, later driving her to suicide.After several revisions — including a new remorseful aria to soften the lieutenant — “Butterfly” became a hit. (The challenge in staging it these days has more to do with avoiding Orientalism and cultural appropriation.)And in 2016, La Scala staged the rarely seen original version, in a symbolic act of contrition.Michael Cooper, a Times reporter who covers classical music and dance, wrote today’s Back Story.Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.Check out this page to find a Morning Briefing for your region.

457,"President Trump’s family business has employed undocumented workers more broadly than it was previously believed, with multiple workers losing their jobs last month at a Trump golf club in southern New Jersey.The club in Pine Hill, N.J., known as the Trump National Golf Club Philadelphia, was the third Trump property where undocumented workers have been fired since The New York Times reported in December that the Trump club in Bedminster, N.J., for years employed immigrants who were in the country unlawfully.The president’s company terminated about a dozen undocumented workers at the Bedminster property after the article was published, as well as a dozen workers at the Trump National Golf Club Westchester, in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.People familiar with the terminations at Pine Hill said that about five workers at that property were fired or told not to report to work again, including two seasonal employees who were not scheduled to work until the spring. One of the people familiar with the matter said that many other seasonal workers expected to be told not to return in the coming weeks.The revelations about the undocumented workers has been an embarrassment for the Trump Organization, coming to light as Mr. Trump has railed against illegal immigration, blamed undocumented immigrants for crime and pledged to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep more people from entering the country unlawfully.The company has said it was duped by employees who used false identification to get their jobs. But some of the workers in Bedminster told The Times they were kept on the payroll despite the fact that management was aware of the false documents.A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on Friday.The workers at the Pine Hill property said their terminations, which occurred in January, came abruptly.“Just like that, I got fired,” said Victor Reyes, who is from Mexico and worked in the kitchen alongside the chef.“The manager called me and asked, ‘Victor, are you legal?’ I said, ‘No, I am not legal.’ It surprised me because I knew he knew that I was illegal. I have worked for him 16 years and then he asks me,” said Mr. Reyes, who added that it was his first job since crossing the border.Mr. Reyes had worked up from a dishwasher to grilling steaks and preparing a la carte orders, he said, and acquired many cooking skills along the way.The firings at the Pine Hill golf club were the result of a broader audit that the Trump Organization is conducting at its properties across the country, according to people briefed on the review. Although the organization has conducted similar reviews in prior years, this is the largest effort yet to ensure that the company’s employees are authorized to work in the country.The review has presented yet another legal and public relations headache for company executives who are trying to contain the fallout from the revelations. It comes as the Trump Organization is facing wider scrutiny from congressional Democrats examining the company’s business practices.At this point in the review, the issues appear to have been largely concentrated in the Bedminster and Westchester golf clubs, the people said, though the discovery of undocumented workers at the southern New Jersey property show that the matter is more widespread than initially believed. The terminations at the Westchester club were first reported by The Washington Post.The Trump Organization announced on Tuesday that it was using a system — known as E-verify — to prevent undocumented workers from getting jobs at its properties. For the last several years, the company had utilized that system in many of its hotel properties, though it did not adopt it at most of the golf courses.“I must say, for me personally, this whole thing is truly heartbreaking,” Eric Trump, an executive vice president with the Trump Organization, said in a statement on Tuesday. “Our employees are like family, but when presented with fake documents, an employer has little choice.”He said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the Trump Organization, and that it “demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately.”About eight million undocumented workers participate in the United States labor force, and it is an open secret that they use fake documents to get hired, typically made-up social security numbers and permanent residency cards.The Pine Hill club has an 18-hole golf course surrounded by maple and pine trees on 365 acres. Members enjoy putting greens and a 43,000-square-foot clubhouse where weddings and other events take place. Sitting atop a hill, it boasts a view of the Philadelphia skyline.The golf club employs 100 to 200 people, many of them in seasonal jobs. Immigrants employed there were charged with watering, mowing and manicuring the greens; the upkeep of the banquet hall, which has a 300-person capacity; and preparing food in the club’s restaurant.Because the workers do not have lawyers and remain in the country illegally, two of those who described the firings, as well as their family members, declined to be named.Workers said that those who were terminated were summoned to a meeting with Eric Quinn, the general manager, and a human-resources executive who they believed was from the Trump Organization. Each was told that their documents did not pass inspection after an audit and that they should leave the premises immediately, leaving some of the workers who lacked driver’s licenses to scramble to find rides home.“People were getting fired on the spot, no warning, no nothing. No time to find a job,” said one worker, who declined to be named.The worker said that the immigrants had been treated well by the club’s management and that some of them had broken down when they were fired. “It’s not easy to find a job if you don’t have papers, after you worked there,” the worker said. The general manager, according to several accounts, was said to have lamented the terminations.Executives at the Pine Hill club declined to comment.The problem of undocumented workers at Trump properties came to light in December, when The Times wrote about Victorina Morales of Guatemala, a housekeeper at the Bedminster property who made the president’s bed, washed his clothes and dusted his golf trophies for five years. After Mr. Trump was elected, a manager told her that her fake documents had expired and helped her acquire new ones.Ms. Morales said that on the advice of her lawyer, she stopped going to work on Dec. 4, two days before The Times article was published. The lawyer, Anibal Romero, has said that neither he nor his client had been notified that she was fired, and that her employment status was not clear.Ms. Morales, who is protected from deportation because she applied for asylum, was invited by her Democratic congresswoman, Bonnie Watson Coleman, to attend the State of the Union address on Tuesday. Also attending will be Sandra Diaz, a native of Costa Rica and a legal resident of the United States who said she was undocumented when she worked at the Trump resort. She will be the guest of Representative Jimmy Gomez, a California Democrat.Another undocumented worker, Emma Torres, told The Times that someone in human resources at the Bedminster club had removed her name and other undocumented workers’ names from a list of employees submitted to the Secret Service in 2017. Ms. Torres quit shortly after on her own volition.At Pine Hill, Mr. Reyes said that he was treated well by Mr. Quinn, the general manager, and expressed gratitude for the opportunity to grow professionally during his years at the golf club, where his hard work was recognized, he said. Over the years, on the job his repertoire of dishes grew and he learned English.“I had too many raises,” said the immigrant from Puebla, who said that he earned $18 an hour. The money enabled him to pay his rent and send money to his family back in Mexico.He received his first bonus in all his years working at the club, he said, in late December. In hindsight, Mr. Reyes wonders whether that was because management knew that he would not be welcome back after the winter hiatus.Now, he said, he is seething with a sense of betrayal.“I loved my job. I learned to cook everything. They helped me grow,” he said, erupting in tears. “Now I feel bad. I don’t trust nobody.”Mr. Trump, who during his campaign called Mexicans “rapists” and “criminals,” has made border security and protecting jobs for Americans cornerstones of his presidency. His commitment to erecting a border wall resulted in the recent partial government shutdown.He has deemed illegal immigration “a major, major problem,” and his administration has intensified workplace raids and payroll audits at companies suspected of employing undocumented workers."
458,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning.India’s economic problems threaten to undermine the prime minister, businesses in Britain prepare for a chaotic Brexit and Apple takes a strong stand on data privacy. Here’s the latest:India’s jobless rate hit 6.1 percent in the last year, its highest level in 45 years, according to a report published on Thursday in the independent Indian newspaper Business Standard.Alarm spread over the figure, as did accusations that the government had been trying to cover up the bad news. Two government advisers resigned in protest of its failure to release the economic data.The developments could deepen Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vulnerability in national elections that are expected to take place in early May.Background: Mr. Modi swept into office in 2014 with a campaign focused on jobs and reviving the economy. But since then, droughts, a sluggish manufacturing sector and Mr. Modi’s widely criticized decision to replace most of India’s currency have fueled unemployment and contributed to an economic slowdown.Already, the impact of the economy is beginning to hurt Mr. Modi. In recent local elections, described as the “semifinals” of Indian politics, his party suffered its worst defeat in recent years across five states.Companies across Britain, faced with increasing uncertainty around the country’s departure from the E.U., have been stockpiling products, making backup plans and exploring new shipping routes. International banks are shifting thousands of jobs from Britain to the Continent.“It’s meant extra resources, extra overtime, to get it done,” said one executive. “It’s incredibly annoying. It’s frustrating.”By the numbers: The economy is 2.3 percent smaller than it would have been if Britain had voted to remain in the E.U. in 2016, according to one research institution. And investment in the auto sector was found to have plunged by almost 50 percent in 2018.What’s next? Uncertainty is intensifying. Parliament remains at an impasse, with under 60 days to the March 29 deadline to leave the E.U.Solidarity elsewhere: The messy and self-destructive Brexit process in Britain has made E.U. membership more popular in other member countries, even among populists, writes our chief diplomatic correspondent in Brussels.The kingdom announced that its crackdown on high-level corruption, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was over and claimed it had helped retrieve $106 billion for the state treasury.A government statement said that the “anticorruption committee” had summoned 381 people. Of those detained, 87 were released after signing confessions and agreeing to settlements, while 64 had been referred to the public prosecutor.Background: About 15 months ago, the Saudi government detained hundreds of businessmen, former officials and even members of the royal family at a Ritz-Carlton hotel, where many were subject to coercion and physical abuse, according to witnesses.Analysis: The end of the crackdown may be part of an effort by Saudi Arabia to repair its image, which took a hit after the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year by Saudi operatives.In other Saudi news: A Filipina maid was executed this week after being found guilty of murder, Philippine officials said, but details about her case were not made public.As negotiators were concluding the second of two days of trade negotiations between the world’s two largest economies, President Trump said there was a “good chance” of striking an agreement.Liu He, China’s vice premier, was expected to formally propose that Mr. Trump meet with President Xi Jinping next month.In other Washington news: The Senate voted to pass nonbinding bipartisan legislation that expressed opposition to Mr. Trump’s withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan and Syria, the second time in two months that the Senate has rebuked the president’s foreign policy.“Waste of time”: Mr. Trump, in an interview with our reporters, said that he had all but given up on negotiations with Congress over his border wall. He also dismissed any wrongdoing in investigations that have ensnared his associates. Apple: Chief executive Tim Cook cut off Facebook’s access to apps and updates that it was working on internally, because the social media company had violated Apple’s rules with a research app that snooped on users’ online activity.Birth tourism: Three people who ran businesses that helped women give birth in the U.S. to secure American citizenship for their babies were arrested as part of a broad federal probe cracking down on an industry that has become increasingly popular, particularly among Chinese nationals.Polar vortex: At least eight deaths have been associated with the record-breaking cold snap sweeping through much of the U.S. Midwest, and hospitals have been treating dozens of frostbite and hypothermia cases. Thousands of flights were canceled, and schools and universities were closed.Soccer and human rights: An increasing number of powerful sports executives have called for the release of a Bahrain-born soccer player, Hakeem al-Araibi, who has refugee status in Australia but has been detained in Thailand since late November. The case represents the first time that sporting bodies have come together to “address the fate of a single person,” one of Mr. Araibi’s supporters said.New Zealand: Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern scrapped her initial targets in an ambitious plan to build 100,000 new homes over the next decade, signaling that a solution to the country’s shortage of affordable housing remains out of reach.Iran: Britain, France and Germany, in an attempt to bolster Iran’s economy while skirting U.S. sanctions, have set up a company that would essentially allow goods to be bartered between companies. Whether anyone will actually use it remains to be seen.11 days offline: Tonga, a remote island northeast of New Zealand, was forced into digital darkness after an underwater fiber-optic cable was severed on Jan. 20, cutting off internet connections, international calls and even credit card payments. Repairs are underway, and some connectivity has trickled back.Sri Lanka: Our Frugal Traveler hopped on a train from Colombo to Kandy, then from Kandy to Ella, to take in the lush, hilly terrain with rows of perfectly manicured tea plants. The country “is a place best seen slowly,” he writes.Overlooked no more: Forough Farrokhzad, who was perhaps the first female Iranian poet to write about the emotions and desires of women, elevating her among the great voices of Persian literature. Her death, from a car crash in 1967, was regarded as a national tragedy in Iran, but she didn’t receive a Times obituary.

We know its fruits today as the concept of Proto-Indo-European, a mother language for dozens of tongues. The idea revolutionized not only the study of language but the sense of human history.The man who delivered the talk, Sir William Jones, was, predictably, a student of languages and culture. Less predictably, he was in India because he was also a legal expert — the same reason he ultimately became convinced of his theory.He arrived many decades before the Raj, or British government rule. The British East India Company was increasing its control over territories it had long traded in.

459,"The government shutdown that began 20 days ago will become the longest shutdown in American history if it continues through Saturday, and President Trump has said that it could last “months or even years.”Where does this leave the 800,000 federal employees who are caught up in the shutdown, most of whom will miss a paycheck on Friday?We asked them to tell us how much longer they personally could endure a shutdown before experiencing financial setbacks, and how they felt about the fight over the border wall that is at the center of the standoff.More than 200 responded, describing the hardships they face — a sick child, a dwindling supply of prescription drugs, a mortgage in arrears — and the preparations they are making to get by.Here is a selection of their responses. They have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. My bank account balance is minus $169 and I have $0 in my savings. I am preserving the gas I have in my car and staying put and getting creative with the food I already have.— Tanisha K., Department of Commerce employee, MarylandI have a 1-year-old son who was born with a facial deformity, and I stand here in the midst of this shutdown with facial reconstructive surgery expenses for him looming. Instead of mentally preparing for this surgery, I have to be concerned about paying the associated medical bills and normal expenses.As firefighters in the U.S.D.A. [Department of Agriculture], we are already paid significantly less than other organizations. We spend the summer away from our families in service to the country, fighting fire to pay the bills. Missing a paycheck makes those sacrifices worth nothing.Our president states that [federal] employees support this shutdown and building the wall. But anyone with a little geographical knowledge knows what a futile endeavor it is. I do not support funding for the wall, and I do not appreciate being used as a leveraging support for this shutdown.— Nick L., Forest Service employee, Medford, Ore. Has enough savings to last through the end of January.My spouse passed in 2017. I have been struggling to pay a two-income household’s bills on just my one income since then. I’m an accountant. I’m not allowed to work private sector accounting while employed by the Treasury. I’m only six years from retirement.I worry when will they cancel my government insurance — health, dental and life — since insurance companies aren’t getting paid with no paycheck. I think I’m going to have to put the house up for sale, the house I have struggled to retain after John’s death.I want a barrier. I don’t think children and women are as likely to cross with a barrier. It is a physical deterrent. Give him [President Trump] enough money to build what he can in the next two years.— W.B., Treasury employee, Georgia. Has a month’s worth of savings.I am forced to work [during the shutdown] and am making slave wages — nothing. We may have to move in with family. The only walls I care about are the ones that keep the roof over my family’s heads.— Jim P., Homeland Security employee, Washington. Has a month’s worth of savings.It’s immoral (and should be illegal) to abuse civil servants this way. A vast majority of us are apolitical and devoted to our jobs. We put our hearts and minds into doing the best job we can, effectuating whatever goals Congress sets, as the higher-up execs interpret (by regulation).We generally have no say or input into either. We are not to blame for badly designed programs, unintended consequences and objected-to goals. We certainly should not be punished as a result of completely unrelated policy disagreements.— M.S., U.S.D.A. employee, Montana. No savings; tapping into home equity to get by.I believe some things are worth fighting for, and this is one of them.My husband is an essential employee who continues to work knowing his pay will be delayed. I’m looking to increase my work hours.— C.M., Florida. Her husband is a Homeland Security employee. They have several months of savings, but she will look for a job to supplement their income if the shutdown lasts another month.I am a federal worker at the F.D.A. [Food and Drug Administration] with enough liquid savings to last for the next month or so, but there are plenty of federal workers who are early in their careers or have medical or family expenses who have already tapped those savings.Plenty of us are still working and incurring commuting costs — we’re just not getting paid. And we’re cleaning our own office restrooms because the contractors are not doing it. Those are the people I worry about the most, as they earn very meager wages to begin with and have no hope of recovering lost pay.— Kara M., F.D.A. employee, Frederick, Md.I have been a federal employee for almost 39 years. Not knowing if I can pay my rent or other household bills is frightening! I want the wall. I support it totally … But not at my expense!— Elenore Mary Maggio, Treasury employee, New York. Has savings for two months.I have five children and am a single father who has day care and preschool to pay for, not to mention a mortgage and basic necessities. My bills keep coming, gas to get to work still needs to be paid for. My creditors will allow me to miss payments but not without fees and ruining my credit.— Matthew F., Homeland Security employee, New York. Has savings for no more than two months. I was hired by the F.A.A. [Federal Aviation Administration] as an air traffic control specialist after over a year and a half of going through the hiring process. I was supposed to start Monday. I moved my fiancée and me across the country, bought a house, only to find out that I won’t actually be starting until after the shutdown.— Tyler Lano, F.A.A. employee, Rochester, Minn. Has two months’ worth of savings.I am an air traffic controller in the New York City metro area. We can make it until February before defaulting on our mortgage.Having to deal with not receiving a paycheck while still working 50 to 60 hours a week is adding to the pressures of an already stressful job.The uncertainty of not being able to meet our financial obligations, along with the president’s threat that this could drag on for months keeps me and my wife up every night. Even my three children are fearful of what’s to come.— Bill O., F.A.A. employee, New York.We have family members who will help. We can last about a year. We want this wall and are willing to fight for it, sacrifice for it.— Sandra M., Department of Defense employee, Tacoma, Wash. Has a year’s worth of savings. I’m just glad I saved all of the money I made while in Afghanistan. That and the disability retirement pension I got for getting blown up and broken too many times are the only things that will keep me from facing really hard decisions. Funny, I’m now kind of glad that I have a limp and suffered permanent damage to my endocrine system in battle.— B.B., Forest Service employee. Has savings for 13 months and 11 days.The shutdown has allowed me to get another job, which the employer knows I will leave once the shutdown is over. This is a godsend for my family, since I can make enough to get by, knowing I will get a big back paycheck from the government for having done nothing while the shutdown was in effect!— Bruce Kesselman, Interior Department employee, Las Vegas, Nev."
460,"Tanisha Keller, a single mother who works for the federal Census Bureau, used to live paycheck to paycheck. Now, she is living nothing to nothing.Payday would have come this week for Ms. Keller, 42, and many of the 800,000 other federal workers across the country caught up in the partial government shutdown. But as the standoff drags on, no paychecks are arriving to replenish their savings or pay down their maxed-out credit cards.Ms. Keller’s bank balance has dipped to negative $169. She can no longer afford the $100 stipends she once sent to her son, Daniel, to help out with his college books and groceries. She does not know how she will make next month’s $1,768 rent on her apartment in Waldorf in Southern Maryland, or how she will cover the bills that automatically debit from her checking account, or even how she will gas up the car she has been trying not to drive.“There’s no cushion,” she said. “When February rolls around, my rent’s going to be due, and I’m going to need the nation to help.”Since Dec. 22, furloughed workers and those working without pay have been living off their savings, credit cards and the last paychecks that landed in their accounts.But many of those wells are now dry. And as President Trump warns that the shutdown could last months or years if Democrats do not agree to fund his border wall, unpaid federal workers across the country, from the Washington suburbs to farming towns to remote federal prisons, are growing increasingly desperate and furious at the political impasse. They are now in shutdown survival mode: opening new credit card accounts to pay off their bills, borrowing from relatives and eating the dregs of their pantries.“I have child support and rent, and I’ve told my landlord that any increase and I will have to move,” said Joseph Gudge, 41, an electronics technician who works for the federal government maintaining and inspecting air-traffic control safety systems at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.If the shutdown goes on long enough, when the hard reality of working without pay just can’t be sustained no matter what, he said he will have to quit.“Two months,” he said, describing his personal crisis clock. “Some co-workers are already looking.”A furloughed health-communications worker in Dallas applied for a temp job at his local Y.M.C.A. An international development worker in Washington is scrounging for babysitting gigs. A wildland firefighter in western Colorado sold his truck to pay next month’s bills.Amid the uncertainty about workers’ pay, the Trump administration moved on Tuesday to head off what could have been another far-reaching effect of the shutdown: potential cuts to food assistance for millions of Americans.The Agriculture Department said that benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, would be fully provided for the month of February. But the department offered no assurance about what would happen in March if the shutdown continued.The timing of workers’ paychecks varies across the federal government, but many employees would normally receive a paycheck on Friday, according to a former official at the Office of Management and Budget. Others would normally be paid next week.In Orlando, Fla., Joe Rojas, a federal corrections officer, is starting a side job driving for Uber to help make next month’s $2,000 mortgage payment.“This weekend, family time is going to be Uber time,” he said. “Nobody signed up for this, to work for free. We knew the dangers of working in a prison. The reward was protecting society, getting a decent paycheck.”While some government employees earn six-figure annual salaries, an average employee’s weekly take-home pay is about $500, according to American Federation of Government Employees, a labor union that represents about 700,000 workers.Financial fears that once seemed implausible — overdraft fees, missed mortgage payments, lowered credit ratings — are now consuming many. Food pantries in Maine, in Colorado, on Long Island and elsewhere are offering help to federal workers. Thousands of federal workers have applied for unemployment benefits.Shelly Carver, 57, a furloughed employee of the Internal Revenue Service in Ogden, Utah, said that she worried not just about paying her own expenses but also about helping her three adult children, who also work for the I.R.S. and have been furloughed. All would normally have been paid this Friday or next Monday.Her older daughter — “single, and she does not have a backup” — has a mortgage payment due. Her son has a 5-month-old. Ms. Carver herself has $5,000 in savings that she had earmarked to help pay off $40,000 in credit card debt, but she is now planning to use it to help her children instead.“They have no resources,” Ms. Carver said. But if the shutdown persists, she said, “I will be in the same boat as them.”Belkys Colon, who turns 51 on Wednesday, makes less than $52,000 a year as an assistant investigator in the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. She would normally be paid by direct deposit at the end of this week, and she is terrified about what missing this paycheck will mean. She is most afraid of not being able to pay the roughly $1,400 in rent for her apartment in the Bronx, and being kicked out on the street.“I’m just scared that this is going to be for a long time, and I’m a single woman,” she said. “What is going to happen with me? Who could help me?”For now, she is trying to spend as little money as she can. She is not buying any groceries except milk, and is cleaning out her cupboards to eat. She said she is mostly living on cereal, bread, crackers and other packaged foods — “stuff that you buy when you’re food shopping and nobody eats it.”“At the moment I’m going to have to be very careful with what I have left,” she said.For Angela Tucker, 44, who is working without pay as a corrections officer at a federal prison near Seattle, everything has become a balancing act.“I’m on a lot of medications, because I’m a year out from being a breast cancer survivor, so I have to make the decision — do I refill all of my medications even before I need them, because I might not have the money later, or do I pay for the child care?” Ms. Tucker said. “Or do I buy food?”The budget triage, Ms. Tucker said, comes down to setting priorities and muddling through. “What can I do without, what can I make stretch, what’s the most important need?” she said. “I’m putting only half a tank of gas in now. And all the other bills are just on a standstill — I just have to hope and pray that they’ll work with me.”What makes things even more challenging, said Ms. Tucker, who has 15 years on the job, is that the prison is also short-handed. So people are not just being required to work one shift without pay, but often two in a row — 16 hours on the job.“When we finally do get paid, we’re going to be trying to climb out of a big hole,” she said.Matt Kampf, 49, a wildland firefighter in Montrose, Colo., should be getting paid on Saturday. The money would have gone to his mortgage, insurance, groceries — the normal costs of “trying to live that American dream.”Instead, the Kampf family has pruned every expense they can. They have canceled travel plans and dropped Netflix, Hulu and Xbox subscriptions, cut out date nights and switched from Rice Krispies to the store brand. Mr. Kampf even sold his truck for $8,600 to keep paying for the house and keep the lights and heat on.Like many federal workers, Mr. Kampf said he loves his job and the idea of working for something bigger than himself. But he does not know how many more payless paydays he can endure.“The bite is truly there,” he said. “If this drags out till the end of January, I don’t know what we’re going to do.”"
461,"COLUMBUS, N.M. — Just minutes from the border in rural New Mexico, the Borderland Cafe in the village of Columbus serves burritos and pizza to local residents, Border Patrol agents and visitors from other parts of the country seeking a glimpse of life on the frontier. The motto painted on the wall proclaims “Life is good in the Borderland.”“This is the sleepiest little town you could think of,” said Adriana Zizumbo, 31, who was raised in Columbus and owns the cafe with her husband. “The only crisis we’re facing here is a shortage of labor. Fewer people cross the border to work than before, and Americans don’t want to get their hands dirty doing hard work.”President Trump has shut down part of the government over border security and his plan to build a wall along the border with Mexico, and in a prime-time speech on Tuesday night he painted a bleak picture of life in towns like Columbus.He said border residents were suffering through a “humanitarian crisis,” and he described a landscape scarred by violence and prowled by “vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.” But that is not how Ms. Zizumbo sees it. People in Columbus, she said, opposed the idea of a wall by about a “90-to-10 margin.”“Enough about the wall already,” she said. “We have other problems here that need fixing.”Extending nearly 2,000 miles from southern Texas to a fence jutting out into the Pacific Ocean in San Diego, America’s border with Mexico is as long and as varied as the terrain. Remote spots in the desert like Columbus, a town of 1,600 people about 80 miles west of El Paso, are sleepily tranquil. In cities like El Paso and San Diego, the growing number of migrant families pushing for entry to the United States has generated crowds and controversy, with migrants packed into detention centers and bus stations, and clashes at the fences between rock-throwing immigrants and federal agents.In anticipation of the president’s speech, The New York Times sent correspondents to the Mexico side of the border and to the four states on the United States side — California, New Mexico, Arizona and Texas — and found few who shared the president’s sense of alarm.Many said there was indeed a humanitarian crisis unfolding, but they blamed the Trump administration for worsening it with a series of policies aimed at deterring Central American migrants from making the journey. Those policies, many of which have been blocked by legal challenges, have failed to stop the flood of migrants. But they have succeeded in escalating tensions, overwhelming volunteer shelters and putting those seeking asylum from violence at renewed risk of health threats and other problems once they arrive in the United States.The border has long been more than a barrier or a headline. It is the setting of a uniquely American story, a binational place of contradictions and commerce. One afternoon a few months ago, a Latino teenager walked through the bus station in the South Texas city of McAllen, a transit hub where hundreds of apprehended immigrants are dropped off daily by the authorities. The boy was not fresh from detention. He was a native Texan. He was visiting a relative and wore a black T-shirt correcting any misconceptions about his identity. It read “Relax Trump, I’m legal.”That was the vibe along many parts of the border on Tuesday, ahead of Mr. Trump’s speech.A cattle rancher in southern Arizona said he had traveled to Mexico a day earlier, and he saw no emergency. The lines were long — officials have shut down the number of ways people there can cross — but there were no signs of conflict or people pressing to get in.“There is no border problem, except for ones we are causing,” said the rancher, who said he had not had any problems with illegal border crossers on his property and who asked not to be identified out of fear of retribution from strident supporters of Mr. Trump’s planned border wall. “There’s no need for a bigger wall. There is not a border crisis down here.”Some of the worsening problems, some city officials have said, are a result of the federal government’s own management of the border. In El Paso and other cities in California and Arizona, the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has in recent weeks released thousands of immigrants unannounced onto city streets, forcing city officials and migrant shelter operators to scramble to accommodate them.“They were just being dropped off with nothing — no money, nothing,” said Kevin Malone, one of the founders of the San Diego Rapid Response Network, which has been dealing more frequently with unannounced releases. “They’re setting people up for failure every step along the way. This is a contrived emergency. They don’t have to be doing it like this.”From 2014 to 2017, local municipalities in South Texas had to spend $873,000 on immigrant relief efforts, expanding staffing, securing migrant assistance centers and maintaining restrooms, generators and sleeping quarters.“Then we get blasted for being sanctuary cities — get real,” said Jim Darling, the mayor of McAllen. “It’s not our fault. The feds are the ones dropping them off. What are we supposed to do?”Some of those along the border, to be sure, believe the government should be not rushing to accommodate new migrants but fortifying to keep them out. James Johnson, a prominent farmer in Columbus, said he had voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 and continues to support the president, including his proposal for a wall.“Listen, we need security and a wall will provide that security,” said Mr. Johnson, 43, whose family-owned onion and chile farm sits along a stretch of the border. “I’m 100 percent for the wall. Trump is bold in pushing for it.”For a look at those whom Mr. Trump’s supporters would like to keep out, one needed only to take a short drive across the border from southern Texas to the Mexican town of Matamoros, where hundreds of migrants were biding their time on Tuesday, waiting to cross into the United States and apply for asylum.A porous tarp at their makeshift camp shielded them from the sun and, for the most part, the rain.A Honduran mother, Iris Patricia Oseguera, 51, sat in slightly better conditions, at a nearby shelter, with her 10-year-old son. Having been turned back from the international bridge crossing by Mexican authorities when she tried to enter the United States, she said the two of them had been told to find permanent housing soon.“We have nowhere to go,” Ms. Oseguera said, adding that she and her son could not return to Honduras because of the worsening gang violence there. If forced to leave the shelter, she said, she wasn’t sure where she would go. “We don’t even have money to eat. How am I going to pay for a house?”At the migrant camp, a group of American volunteers was giving away bags of fruit and bottles of water.One of them was Cyndie Rathburn, the mayor of the Texas town of Rancho Viejo, home to what she described as a large population of conservative Trump supporters. “This is not a national security crisis,” she said as she purchased a bag of fruit from a local vendor. “President Trump has a flair for hyperbole and rhetoric.”Back at the Borderland Cafe in New Mexico, Ms. Zizumbo’s husband, Lawrence Haddad, keeps a pistol underneath the cash register in case something happens. He hasn’t had to use it.“Nothing much happens, and that’s the way people like it,” said Mr. Haddad, 32.Still, quiet Columbus hasn’t escaped the political turmoil over border policy: Ahead of the midterm elections in November, self-described militia members from around the country descended on the town to prepare for the arrival of a caravan of Central American migrants, then making its way up through Mexico.“Honestly, these guys were kind of absurd, wearing camo and looking at their maps,” Ms. Zizumbo said. “They accomplished nothing, and now they’re gone. Maybe they’ll be back after Trump talks.”Hours ahead of Mr. Trump’s address on Tuesday, Randy Shaw, 71, was outside the Borderland Cafe. He held a sign that read “Stop truth decay: Dump Trump.”Mr. Shaw is from Wyoming, but spends winters in Columbus. “This whole crisis thing is Trump’s creation,” he said. “Don’t let him fool you.”"
462,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)American and Taliban officials have agreed in principle on a framework for a peace deal, the chief U.S. negotiator confirmed today, the first tangible step toward ending a 17-year war that has cost tens of thousands of lives.The details: The plan centers on a phased withdrawal of American troops in exchange for a Taliban cease-fire. The insurgent group would also pledge not to allow international terrorist groups to use Afghanistan as a hub.

463,"REYNOSA, Mexico — As the human smugglers stalk the bus stations, migrant shelters and twisting streets of this Mexican border town, they have no trouble collecting clients like Julian Escobar Moreno.The Honduran migrant arrived in Reynosa, Mexico, intending to apply for asylum in the United States. But new policies north of the border have instead driven him into the hands of the city’s smuggling cartels, whose business is booming.“I honestly don’t want to cross illegally, but I don’t really have a choice,” said Mr. Moreno, 37.The Trump administration, which has partially shut down the federal government in a fight over funding for an enhanced border wall, has adopted a number of strategies over the last two years to deter migrants and persuade them to turn around — or not to come at all.Its latest effort is a policy that admits only a few asylum seekers a day, if that, at border crossings. As a result of this metering, migrants are now waiting on the Mexican side of the border for weeks and months before they can submit their applications.In Reynosa and elsewhere, the delays caused by the policy are prompting many migrants to weigh the costs and dangers of a faster option: hiring a smuggler, at an increasingly costly rate, to sneak them into the United States.In November, the number of migrant families apprehended attempting to cross the border skyrocketed to its highest levels on record, with some of those caught having turned to smugglers at some point in their trip.“What we have seen is that no one is getting across the border,” said Hector Silva, the director of a center providing services to migrants that sits near the banks of the Rio Grande, which separates Reynosa from McAllen, Tex. “This forces families, with all the desperation they feel, to go illegally.”The decision to endure a long wait or illegally expedite the journey to the United States is playing out not only in Reynosa, where the crack of gunfire has become a soundtrack of the city, but across the long sweep of the United States-Mexico border, all the way to Tijuana, where a crisis is unfolding as thousands of Central Americans wait their turn to cross the border.A visit to a Reynosa migrant shelter quickly makes it clear how many are considering the smuggling option.“I’m scared to go to the border crossing, because they will deport me,” said Maximo Rene Arana Nunez, a Guatemalan who arrived in Reynosa a few days ago and is looking to cross. “I’m stuck here until my family in the United States can save enough money to pay for a smuggler.”According to those recently deported, migrants who are attempting to cross and local officials, the price that smugglers can command is rising along with the demand for their services.For those able to afford it, and willing to accept the risk, finding smugglers in Reynosa is easy. The streets seethe with smuggling cartel agents, who openly pitch their services.The dangers of an illegal crossing are not enough to dissuade migrants. They are fearful, but many feel they have no other recourse. For many, the calculation is predicated on a simple truth: What lies behind them is worse than what may lie ahead.“I don’t have an option, I can’t be there,” Mr. Moreno said of his native Honduras. “Our government is totally corrupt, and if the Mexicans or Americans deport me, I’m dead.”Mr. Moreno now works 12-hour shifts on the outskirts of the city, trying to save enough to pay for a smuggler.For other migrants in the shelter, the equation was not necessarily of life or death, but of exchanging well-known hardship for vaguer hope.“Look, we know what the situation is in our country,” said Osman Noe Guillén, 28, who reached Reynosa with his partner shortly after their marriage, having treated the ride on the buses up from Honduras as something of a honeymoon. “We don’t know what will happen when we cross.”Mr. Guillén gripped the hand of his wife, Lilian Marlene Menéndez, and allowed himself a smile. Blind faith and economic need were enough for them. They did not know how grim and dangerous Reynosa was before they arrived, only that it was the closest crossing from Honduras and therefore the cheapest to reach.Yes, they had heard the angry rhetoric about migrants coming out of the United States, they said, and knew about the deportations and long waits at the border. But they didn’t care.“Desperation makes you do crazy things,” Mr. Guillén said. “I don’t think anything would stop me. And certainly not a wall.”The couple, having priced out the next leg of the journey with local smugglers, said they had accepted the risks of continuing. The smugglers, or polleros, are known to kill or strand migrants who falter in their payments, and to extort those who have families that can mortgage homes or drum up more money.In recent days, the couple was quoted a price of $7,000 apiece just to make it to the banks on the Texas side of the river.That appears to be on the higher end; many Central Americans recently have been quoted $5,500 to be ferried to reach the other side of the river. Not long ago, $4,000 was the going rate.Some of the migrants interviewed who were planning to try the smuggling route said they still intended to apply for asylum if and when they made it to the United States.While the United States’ revised policy toward asylum seekers is primarily aimed at dissuading Central American migrants from making the trip to the border, it is also affecting Mexican policy and the lives of Mexicans in border cities.The mayor of Reynosa, Maki Esther Ortiz Dominguez, noted that her city, in the state of Tamaulipas, was already one of the most dangerous in Mexico. She said she is worried the situation in Reynosa could grow even worse, as migrants are either preyed upon by criminals or recruited to join their ranks.“This policy could at any moment detonate a new crime wave here,” Ms. Ortiz Dominguez said.In the center of the bridge that connects Reynosa with McAllen, the United States Border Patrol this summer constructed a new booth for prescreening people hoping to make it into American territory. At least two officers are on duty in the tiny structure, asking everyone who passes for their documentation.More recently, Mexican officials have begun acting as a first line of border defense. As people queue up to cross the bridge, Mexican agents are now pulling Central Americans out of the line, demanding their paperwork and detaining them if they have not filled out the proper documentation.Some have languished for months waiting for family members to send money to pay the fee for the paperwork.The new approach by Mexican agents at the border was begun under pressure from the United States, said one Mexican official in Reynosa, requesting anonymity because this person was not authorized to discuss the decision publicly.It was this new approach by the authorities in Mexico that ensnared Mr. Moreno.Having been run out of Honduras by the notorious 18th Street gang for refusing to work for them, he believed he had a good case for political asylum in the United States and went to the bridge in Reynosa so he could start the application process.But moments after arriving with his pregnant wife and three children at the foot of the international bridge, he and his family were stopped by Mexican officials and detained.A few months ago, Mr. Moreno’s lack of proper paperwork would have been ignored by the Mexican authorities, according to local officials and immigration lawyers. But Mr. Moreno was held in a cell for 20 days and his family was placed in a temporary shelter.The lure of the smugglers in Reynosa is not limited to Central Americans. Mexicans, too, employ their services, although the cost is lower — the prices charged seem to depend on just how bad the situation is in a migrant’s home country.On a recent day in a migration office in Reynosa, a group of Mexicans sat waiting to be processed after their deportations from the United States.“For the migration authorities, it is a job,” said Melvin Gómez, 18, who is from the Mexican state of Chiapas. “For Mexicans and Central Americans, immigration is a dream.”Mr. Gómez had just tried crossing for the fourth time the day before.“We have something to live for,” he said, “and that keeps us going.”"
464,"WASHINGTON — With the government shutdown over for now, the 116th Congress will hit reset this week, showcasing a Democratic agenda in the House that was overshadowed by the struggle to reopen the government and furnishing both chambers with early opportunities to test whether divided government can produce results.The House, which spent weeks passing futile bills to reopen the government, will turn to legislation higher on the Democrats’ priority list, including a bill to raise pay for civilian federal employees. Leading Democrats also plan to reintroduce a marquee bill to close the pay gap between men and women that they have fought to enact for years.In the Senate, Republicans will try to push through a bipartisan Middle East policy bill that includes a disputed provision targeting the movement to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel. With the measure, Republicans will test for fractures in the resurgent Democratic Party, where Palestinian rights activists have found new voices in House freshmen such as Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.And in both chambers, lawmakers have teed up a high-impact lineup of hearings — effectively the first of the year. House Democrats will zero in on the cost to the military of President Trump’s election-eve troop deployments to the border and begin to consider their ambitious legislation to expand voting rights, make political giving more transparent and do away with partisan gerrymandering.Senators will press the leaders of the nation’s intelligence services on the status of global threats, kick off a push to search for common ground on cutting prescription drug prices and begin to advance dozens of Mr. Trump’s nominees, including his pick for attorney general, William P. Barr.“We have a lot of different things we have to deal with,” said Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which will hold the first hearing on Democrats’ ambitious elections bill on Tuesday. “The shutdown slowed things down somewhat, probably by a couple weeks. There is only so much time and attention people can give in a day.”Looming over all of this action will be the border wall fight.Mr. Trump is threatening to shut down the government again in less than three weeks if Congress cannot reach a deal that provides him money for a wall along the southwestern border, and Democrats and Republicans will enter formal negotiations this week to see if they can reach a compromise on border-security funding levels and what constitutes a “wall.”“If you’re the president of the United States, and you know that you have to defend the nation, do you want to shut the government down? No,” Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “Do you want to declare a national emergency? No. But you do need and want to defend the nation.”But with much of the early negotiating likely to take place behind closed doors, both parties seem to agree that after weeks of a near total shutdown eclipse, Congress needs to move on. They hope that some regular order can help heal the bruises left by the impasse.“Border security and immigration issues are important, and we should deal with them, but we can deal with several important issues at the same time,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. “We can’t put the rest of the business of government on hold while these issues, important though they are, are resolved.”For House Democrats, the return to normal governance provides a window to reclaim some of the attention the shutdown drained from the initial rollout of their legislative agenda. House Democratic leaders had insisted when they took control early this month that the shutdown would not affect their carefully choreographed agenda rollout. But it did.Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and her allies plan to hold a ceremony on Wednesday to formally reintroduce the Paycheck Fairness Act, a measure intended to equalize pay between men and women that Democrats have tried to enact for 20 years. Like other bills under consideration in the House, it is unlikely to be taken up by the Republican-controlled Senate, but it is a key piece of Democrats’ messaging to voters ahead of the 2020 elections.Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Trump also are likely to renew discussion in the coming days about a date to reschedule the president’s State of the Union address, which was previously scheduled for Tuesday and became a casualty of the shutdown. Last week, Ms. Pelosi rescinded her invitation for the president to address Congress while the government was still shuttered, and has said subsequently that the two sides will work to find an agreeable date in the future to allow time to prepare.On the House floor, Democrats will bring up a vote on legislation that would give nonmilitary federal workers a pay raise in line with the pay increase members of the military have received. The legislation, if it became law, would override an executive order issued by Mr. Trump a week into the shutdown that froze civilian federal pay.The House Armed Services Committee will hold a hearing on Tuesday about the cost and rationale behind the deployment by Mr. Trump of thousands of active duty troops to the southern border. Representative Adam Smith of Washington, the committee’s chairman, said in a statement that “there has not been adequate justification for the use of our military personnel in this way.”And the Judiciary Committee will hold the first hearing on the “For the People” Act to start building support for the legislation that would overhaul key aspects of the way federal elections are financed and held. In an interview, Mr. Nadler ticked off a dozen or so other policy areas awaiting attention by his committee alone.“We were all elected on much of this stuff,” he said. “There is a frustrating backlog.”Even lawmakers in Mr. Trump’s party, many of them rattled by the costs of the longest shutdown in the nation’s history, have signaled they are eager to broaden their work, in part to lower the temperature around immigration talks and show voters they can govern.Ms. Collins said she had stalled the introduction of important bills because of the shutdown, and she stressed that the Senate needs to “demonstrate to the American people that we can work together on issues that really affect them,” such as infrastructure, prescription drug pricing and retirement security.“One of the frustrating side effects of this awful shutdown was that it prevented the Senate from getting a fast start on a lot of important issues,” she said on Sunday.Several Senate committees will begin to change that this week.In the Senate Judiciary Committee, Republicans will effectively restart the gears of machinery they used in the last Congress to confirm record numbers of conservative judges to lifetime appointments on federal courts all over the country. On the agenda for a meeting on Tuesday are Mr. Barr, Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, as well as six potential federal appeals court judges and more than three dozen other judicial nominees, the committee’s chairman, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said last week.And though committee customs are such that the nominees are unlikely to get a final vote this week, Mr. Graham is taking an important step in filling up a reservoir of nominees that Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, can slowly bring to the Senate floor for confirmation.The Senate Intelligence Committee will push the leaders of the F.B.I., the C.I.A., the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the director of national intelligence to account for developments in geopolitical hot spots like Russia, China and North Korea.And Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, will convene the Senate Finance Committee for the first in what he said would be a series of sessions focused on “the sky-high cost” of prescription drugs — one of the few areas in which Democrats and some Republicans believe they could reach an agreement with Mr. Trump this term.“We already know what the problem is,” Mr. Grassley said last week. “It’s time to look at bipartisan solutions and work to turn them into law.”The legislative package the Senate will vote on beginning Monday, called the Strengthening America’s Security in the Middle East Act, is expected to pass with bipartisan support, but not without controversy. It pairs three noncontroversial bills with a fourth that affirms the right of state and local governments to break financial ties with companies that participate in efforts to boycott, divest investments from and sanction Israel, a movement known as B.D.S.Supporters view the legislation as a key pillar of a sustained push to counter growing support for the B.D.S. movement and continue what has been historically strong bipartisan support for Israel. But Republicans believe that it will highlight the divide among Democrats, between that more traditional view and that of a younger generation in the House critical of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians.Already the National Republican Congressional Committee has taken to labeling Ms. Omar “an anti-Semite” for her positions on Israel, a charge she hotly rejects.“With the shutdown over, I look forward to my colleagues putting politics aside and considering this bill that will keep America and our allies safer and more secure,” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and the bill’s lead author, said in a statement on Sunday."
465,"MARIANNA, Fla. — A federal prison here in Florida’s rural Panhandle lost much of its roof and fence during Hurricane Michael in October, forcing hundreds of inmates to relocate to a facility in Yazoo City, Miss., more than 400 miles away.Since then, corrections officers have had to commute there to work, a seven-hour drive, for two-week stints. As of this week, thanks to the partial federal government shutdown, they will be doing it without pay — no paychecks and no reimbursement for gas, meals and laundry, expenses that can run hundreds of dollars per trip.“You add a hurricane, and it’s just too much,” said Mike Vinzant, a 32-year-old guard and the president of the local prison officers’ union.If nature can be blamed for creating the first financial hardship, the second is the result of the even less predictable whims in Washington: President Trump warned last week that the shutdown might last “months or even years.”In Florida, where Republicans dominated the November midterms and the state’s only Democratic senator went down in defeat, conservative towns like Marianna — along with farm communities in the South and Midwest, and towns across the country that depend on tourism revenue from scaled-back national parks — will help measure the solidity of public support for Mr. Trump and his decision to wager some of the operations of the federal government on a border wall with Mexico.Jim Dean, Marianna’s city manager, said he had already been concerned, even before the shutdown, that the hurricane would prompt public agencies to consider reducing their footprint in the region. What if an extended shutdown contributed to keeping the prison closed indefinitely?“I worry about the government pulling out of rural America,” he said.This, after all, is one of many towns across the country where private industries are few and the federal government is intimately connected to livelihoods. Wedged near the border with Alabama and Georgia, Marianna’s 7,000 residents depend on the federal medium-security prison to employ nearly 300 people in good-paying jobs with attractive benefits. (The prison once housed Lynette Fromme — a Charles Manson disciple, known as Squeaky, who tried to assassinate former President Gerald Ford — as well as members of a spy ring known as the Cuban Five.)[Read more about how the shutdown’s effects are reverberating across the economy, with mortgage applications delayed and paychecks missed.]And the prison isn’t the only federal benefactor. The United States Department of Agriculture provides crucial assistance to farmers, many of whom plant cotton or peanuts or raise cattle.“The U.S. Department of Agriculture office is currently closed, due to the lapse in federal government funding,” read a printout taped to the door of a local U.S.D.A. office on Friday. “The office will reopen once funding is restored.”The phone rang occasionally in the office next door. A federal worker who was working without pay patiently explained to frustrated callers that no, she could not connect them to the person they needed to talk to, because that employee was furloughed for the shutdown.Mr. Dean recently received a letter from the Bureau of Prisons assuring city officials that the bureau would pay its utility bills, though the payments might be slow to arrive.But prison workers were facing trouble even before the partial government shutdown. At least two-thirds of the Marianna staff members sustained hurricane damage to their homes, according to prison managers. The local prison officers’ union estimated that 10 percent of its affected members experienced total property losses.Charles Jones, 32, a corrections officer and vice president of the union, said he and his wife were expecting their first child next month. “Because of the storm, I’ve already had to defer a payment here and there for my car,” he said. “Those are the basic things that we’re trying to do.”Robert Richards, 33, returned from a monthlong stint in Mississippi the day after the shutdown began. He said he was owed about $2,500 in expenses. “We’re tired of being put in the middle,” he said.Though Mr. Trump  said on Twitter over the weekend that “most of the workers not getting paid are Democrats,” that is far from true in places like Jackson County, Fla., where Marianna is the county seat. It is a Republican bastion so deeply conservative that it was illegal to sell liquor by the drink until November 2017. The president and his plan for a wall along the border are popular here, as they are across much of the state, which might explain why Florida Republicans in Congress have done little to pressure party leaders in the Senate to put an end to the shutdown.“Everybody I talk to wants the wall,” James Grover, 72, a car salesman from nearby Blountstown, said over breakfast on Saturday at the Waffle Iron, a diner on Route 90 that opens six days a week even though its facade, destroyed by the hurricane, is temporarily made up of plastic sheeting and plywood.Few prison guards interviewed leveled any criticism at the president or his border policy, instead blaming the impasse on both Republicans and Democrats in Congress who have failed to reach any agreement.“You can point fingers at both sides,” said Jason Griffin, 44. “I point fingers at everyone. If they want to get something done, they can.”[Here’s a look at what is and what isn’t affected by the government shutdown.]Mr. Vinzant, the union president, said he believed a wall was necessary because he trusted fellow public employees who work for the Border Patrol. “Those guys will sit there and say, ‘We need help,’” he said. “So I have to agree with it. We don’t have a choice.”But that solidarity does not make the prison officers’ situation any easier, especially since they face an added stress: The Bureau of Prisons as a general condition of employment requires that its workers pay their debts in a timely fashion. Failure to do so can result in discipline.“I hate the shutdown,” said Joseph Sims, 37, a corrections officer of six years. “Sometimes you’ve got to do stuff to get stuff done,” he said of Mr. Trump’s stance, “but now it’s starting to take a toll on everybody at work.”On Saturday, Mr. Sims stood in his living room as his wife, Melissa Sims, a prison nurse, prepared to hug their 3-year-old twins before embarking on the nearly seven-hour drive to work for two weeks in Mississippi.“Mommy’s got to go bye-bye,” she told her son, Eli, who shrieked: “No! You can’t!”“Oh my gosh, don’t make me cry,” said Ms. Sims, 39.The day after she is scheduled to return, her husband will have to leave for Yazoo City himself, so they will hardly see each other. And the shutdown seems likely to delay repairs at the Marianna prison, which workers fear will remain effectively closed for at least a year.“We can handle a month or two, but if it gets much longer than that, I’m going to look for another job — a job in the private sector,” Ms. Sims said of working without pay.She blamed Mr. Trump for the shutdown, a point on which she disagreed with her husband and most of her colleagues. “This definitely is making me more political than I have been in the past,” Ms. Sims said. She has been researching how Congress passes budget bills.“My stance is that if there’s a wall, they’re going to find a way to get past it — legal or not,” Ms. Sims said.“I believe there should be a barrier,” her husband countered.A few miles away, another prison employee, Crystal Minton, accompanied her fiancé to a friend’s house to help clear the remnants of a metal roof mangled by the hurricane. Ms. Minton, a 38-year-old secretary, said she had obtained permission from the warden to put off her Mississippi duty until early February because she is a single mother caring for disabled parents. Her fiancé plans to take vacation days to look after Ms. Minton’s 7-year-old twins once she has to go to work.The shutdown on top of the hurricane has caused Ms. Minton to rethink a lot of things.“I voted for him, and he’s the one who’s doing this,” she said of Mr. Trump. “I thought he was going to do good things. He’s not hurting the people he needs to be hurting.”"
466,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning.The U.S. pushes allies to block Huawei, Venezuela faces mounting international pressure and India struggles to keep troublemaking monkeys in line. Here’s the latest:Over the past year, the Trump administration has embarked on a global campaign to pressure allies to prevent Huawei and other Chinese firms from helping build out 5G networks.The U.S. has suggested to Poland that future deployments of American troops could hinge on whether the country works with Huawei. And in Germany, American officials warned that working with Huawei could pose a security risk to NATO.Why: The U.S. believes that whoever controls the high-speed 5G internet networks will have an economic, military and intelligence edge for much of this century. The Trump administration has therefore adopted a zero-sum calculus in which Beijing — and companies perceived to be working for the Chinese government — must be shut out.What’s next? The U.S. campaign may complicate the round of trade talks with China beginning in Washington later this week, particularly as Beijing seeks to free Huawei’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who was arrested in Canada at the request of the U.S.President Trump temporarily reopened the government on Friday, but the clock is ticking. He warned that he was ready to renew the confrontation or bypass Congress altogether if Republicans and Democrats couldn’t agree on funding for a border wall by Feb. 15.On the same day the president bowed to pressure, the special counsel indicted one of his longtime advisers, Roger Stone, revealing the most direct link yet between the Trump campaign and the WikiLeaks effort to release hacked emails from the Democratic Party.Here’s a profile of Mr. Stone and an explanation of what his indictment means. And here’s a visual representation of how many times the Trump campaign had contact with Russian nationals and WikiLeaks.Analysis: The combination of the shutdown and the Stone indictment may have damaged the president’s leverage. According to some estimates, the American economy lost at least $6 billion during the 35-day stalemate. And Mr. Trump’s poll numbers were dragged down, stirring concerns among Republican leaders about his ability to navigate the next two years of a divided government.European countries — including the Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain and Britain — urged President Nicolás Maduro to hold new elections within eight days.If Mr. Maduro doesn’t commit to fresh elections, the European governments will recognize the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as the interim president of Venezuela.Analysis: The ultimatum presents a new layer of uncertainty in a deepening political crisis. Mr. Guaidó, who proclaimed himself the legitimate leader of the country, urged protesters to keep the pressure on the government “if they dare to kidnap me.”Mr. Maduro has done an about-face and appeared to be striking a more conciliatory tone. He backed down from demanding that all American diplomats leave the country. And his government has refrained from detaining Mr. Guaidó as support for the opposition leader grows at home and abroad.The U.S. and the Taliban wrapped up six days of negotiations to end the 17-year conflict in Afghanistan. Both sides reported progress — a first in nine years of intermittent peace efforts.Details: Though much remains to be ironed out, the deal would kick off a phased withdrawal of American troops in exchange for a Taliban cease-fire. The Taliban would also have to pledge not to allow international terrorist groups to use Afghanistan as a planning hub. How the Taliban would share power with the Afghan government remains to be resolved.Caution: Most observers don’t believe Afghan forces have the ability to stand up against the Taliban without American support, leaving any truce in a precarious state once the U.S. leaves.Another angle: The toll of the war has been immense — at least 62,000 Afghan military and police lives, and possibly as many Taliban lives, and more than 24,000 Afghan civilians killed over the last decade alone. One photographer set out to capture the makeshift prosthetics some Afghans use.Coming this week: The British Parliament votes on amendments to Prime Minister Theresa May’s latest Brexit plan, and the U.S. Federal Reserve meets (but will probably hold off on raising interest rates).Philippines: Two bombs exploded at a cathedral on the southern island of Jolo, killing 20 people and wounding many others, officials said. The attack came days after voters had rejected a bid to include the Jolo in a Muslim autonomous area, sparking fears of separatist reprisals.Indonesia: At least 68 people have died and nearly 7,000 have taken refuge in emergency shelters on the island of Sulawesi after floods, landslides and a tornado battered the region last week.Facebook: Mark Zuckerberg plans to merge all of the social media platform’s messaging services — WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger — at a time when the company has been scarred by scandal. The services will continue to operate as stand-alone apps but will be more unified, allowing users to communicate across the platforms.Brazil: A dam in southeastern town of Brumadinho collapsed, leaving 34 people dead and almost 300 missing in the deadliest mining accident in the country’s history.Gandhi: Around the world, the man who led India into independence is still revered as a peaceful revolutionary. But his halo has dimmed for the Hindu right and lower castes.Germany: A panel drawn from the power industry, environmental movement, miners and local interest groups laid out a plan to end the country’s use of coal power within two decades, the most significant national attempt yet to reduce carbon emissions.The Holocaust: On her way to visit Auschwitz, our reporter found “Heil Hitler” signs and other Nazi swag at a flea market in Poland, where laws regulating such sales are little enforced.Australian Open: In a stunning career revival, Novak Djokovic beat Rafael Nadal for his 15th Grand Slam title.

467,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. Venezuela’s political crisis deepens, the U.S. Senate fails to end the partial shutdown, and start-ups offer spy satellites. Here’s the latest: The leader of Venezuela’s armed forces declared his loyalty to President Nicolás Maduro, a leftist who exercises authoritarian powers, saying that the opposition’s efforts to replace him with a transitional government amounted to an attempted coup. Russia also warned the U.S. not to intervene in the South American nation, a close Kremlin ally — a further setback for the opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who proclaimed himself Venezuela’s rightful leader on Wednesday and sought the armed forces’ backing. Along with many Latin American countries, the Trump administration has recognized Mr. Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate leader and is urging more countries to reject Mr. Maduro. What’s next? Invoking past “gringo” interventions in Latin America, Mr. Maduro has cut ties with the U.S. and ordered American diplomats to leave Venezuela. The U.S. said it would not heed that order — raising the possibility of a standoff at the embassy. Mr. Guaidó said he intended to serve as interim president until the next election. The Trump administration said it was ready to send $20 million in food and medical aid, but otherwise its plans are vague. Background: Venezuela’s government has overseen a near-total collapse of the economy. Here’s a primer on how the country got into this dire situation.Lawmakers voted against two competing proposals to reopen the U.S. government, sending congressional leaders back to the drawing board.Details: Each party had its own measure. The Republican proposal included $5.7 billion in funding for President Trump’s border wall, paired with legal protections for some immigrants. The Democratic proposal would have reopened the government until Feb. 8, without wall funding. What’s next? Lawmakers and aides in both parties expressed hope that the double-barreled losses would at least break the logjam over the shutdown. Urgency is mounting, with 800,000 federal workers set to miss their second paycheck on Friday. House Democrats said they were considering giving Mr. Trump as much as $5.2 billion for border security — but not for a wall.Go deeper: Aviation workers’ unions warned that the shutdown presented an “unconscionable” safety threat for air travel. And nearly six weeks in, the shutdown is eroding the good will of highly skilled federal workers who chose public service over higher-paying private employment.Greek lawmakers are almost certain today to approve a pact changing the name of neighboring Macedonia, despite protests inside and outside Parliament over the deal, which touches a nationalist nerve in Greece.Details: The agreement between Athens and Skopje seeks to resolve a 27-year dispute by changing Macedonia’s name to North Macedonia in exchange for Greece’s lifting its objections to the country’s joining NATO and the European Union. Reaction: Polls show that about 70 percent of Greeks are against the deal, which Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has been pushing as “historic” progress. In northern Greece, where opposition is most intense, protesters have targeted the homes of lawmakers from his leftist Syriza party. A growing number of start-ups are selling insights gleaned from small, relatively cheap satellites, known as “cube satellites,” encroaching on a domain once dominated by global superpowers. How it works: The Chinese province of Guangdong stopped publishing a monthly health report on its manufacturing sector in October amid the trade war with the U.S. But a small company in San Francisco found a way to get that crucial data using photos and infrared images captured by satellites, and now it’s selling that information to hedge funds, banks and other investors.Why it matters: Satellites monitor specialized areas like how busy retailers’ parking lots are, oil tank levels, and illegal mining activity. And the niche seems set for further growth: Nearly 730 satellites were launched in the last decade, and another 2,220 are expected to follow in the next 10 years.Afghanistan: U.S. and Taliban negotiators are making headway on a deal under which American troops would withdraw from Afghanistan in return for a pledge from the insurgents that the country won’t become a terrorist base again, officials said. But many details remain unclear.Scotland: Alex Salmond, the former first minister of Scotland who for years led a campaign for Scottish independence, has been arrested and charged with two counts of attempted rape and several counts of sexual assault, a public prosecutor said. He denied the charges. Soccer: Search efforts have been called off for the Argentine soccer player Emiliano Sala and his pilot after their small plane vanished over the English Channel on Monday. Renault: The French carmaker announced new leadership after Carlos Ghosn resigned as chairman and chief executive from his Tokyo jail cell. Jean-Dominique Senard, the new chairman, and Thierry Bolloré, the new C.E.O., must now mend the company’s alliance with Nissan.

About 200,000 Georgians have gotten into the game, even selling cars and cows to buy equipment, and about 10 percent of the country’s energy goes into the cryptocurrency endeavor.$238 million: That’s what a hedge fund billionaire paid for an apartment in New York City — the highest price ever paid for a home in the U.S. — heightening debate about income inequality.Prince William: Long outspoken about his own emotional struggles, the British royal has taken his campaign for mental health awareness to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, urging global leaders to help break the stigma.Brazil: Just three weeks into his term, Jair Bolsonaro, who rode to the presidency denouncing corruption and elitist privilege, is now trying to fend off charges that his far-right administration is exhibiting just that. Currency: Claims by an Italian deputy prime minister, against expert consensus, that a French-backed currency used by 14 African nations was accelerating migration have highlighted a long-running debate over whether the currency is stabilizing or neocolonial.

468,"SAULT STE. MARIE, Mich. — For one tribe of Chippewa Indians in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the government shutdown comes with a price tag: about $100,000, every day, of federal money that does not arrive to keep health clinics staffed, food pantry shelves full and employees paid.The tribe is using its own funds to cover the shortfalls for now. But if the standoff in Washington continues much longer, that stopgap money will be depleted. Later this month, workers could be furloughed and health services could be pared back. “Everything,” said Aaron Payment, the chairman of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe, “is on the table.”For many Americans who are not federal workers or contractors, a shutdown is a minor inconvenience. A trip to a national park may be canceled. A call to a government office may go unanswered. But for Native American tribes, which rely heavily on federal money to operate, a shutdown can cripple their most basic functions.All across Indian Country, the federal shutdown slices deep. Generations ago, tribes negotiated treaties with the United States government guaranteeing funds for services like health care and education in exchange for huge swaths of territory.“The federal government owes us this: We prepaid with millions of acres of land,” said Mr. Payment, who also criticized the shutdown on Monday from the stage at his tribe’s New Year’s powwow. “We don’t have the right to take back that land, so we expect the federal government to fulfill its treaty and trust responsibility.”On the Navajo Nation, a mostly rural reservation of red rock canyon that spans parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah, the government shutdown has already been difficult, said Russell Begaye, the Navajo Nation’s president.A blanket of snow has covered the region, but roads are unplowed because federal maintenance has stopped. Many people are now trapped in their homes, unable to make the 20- or 50-mile journey to buy water, groceries and medicine, said Mr. Begaye.The Interior Department’s Indian Affairs bureau provides basic services to about 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives, often by funneling funds to the tribes to administer the services themselves or by employing federal workers to run the programs. This means that services from law enforcement to tribal courts, disaster relief and road maintenance are often completed by tribal employees whose salaries rely on federal funding — or by federal workers, some of whom are tribal citizens.The Bureau of Indian Affairs was set to furlough 2,295 of 4,057 employees during a shutdown, meaning at least some of those services and salaries will be slowed or stopped.Because the federal government contributes to the salaries of many members of the Navajo Nation, Mr. Begaye said the lack of pay would hurt families on the reservation, where a single salary can support a family of six, 10 or even 12 people. Mr. Begaye said loan sharks have started circling, leaving fliers on cars and doorsteps.“It just kind of snowballs into our people doing things that they know they shouldn’t do and further financially obligating themselves,” Mr. Begaye said. “They have to keep their heater going. They have to keep their water on.”On the Bois Forte Indian Reservation in northern Minnesota, tribal officials have instituted a hiring freeze and are planning to meet later this week to discuss budget cuts. Cathy Chavers, the tribe’s chairwoman, said tribal functions were continuing for now, but “it will probably come down to minimal, minimal basic services” if the shutdown lasts another month.Already, police officers on her reservation, who are employees of the federal government and not the tribe, were being forced to work without pay.“These officers are putting their lives on the line,” Ms. Chavers said, “and they don’t know if they’re going to get a paycheck or not.”Tribes are making plans for how much longer they can operate, while not knowing whether they will be reimbursed for shutdown-related expenses. Officials with the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin said that they had made contingency plans but that they could manage at least another month without any cuts. The Shoshone-Bannock Tribes in Idaho posted on Facebook that they had enough money to operate at full strength through Saturday, but would then have to re-evaluate.“Things do grind to a halt,” said Kevin Washburn, who served as the assistant secretary for Indian Affairs under President Barack Obama. “Indian Country stops moving forward” during a shutdown, Mr. Washburn said, “and starts moving backward.”A spokesman for the Interior Department, reached on New Year’s Eve, said so many people were out of the office for the holiday, or furloughed, that he had no information about the way the shutdown was playing out in Indian Country.“Literally, there’s a handful of people that are currently excepted and able to work,” said the spokesman, John Bockmier, about his office. “I just don’t have any details from around the country to give you,” he went on, “because there is no one out there that is currently able to provide that information for me.”For tribes, this has become a familiar, painful scenario. In 2013, during Mr. Obama’s presidency, a lengthy shutdown forced a California tribe to close its child care program. In Minnesota, a tribe postponed nonemergency medical procedures. And the Sault Ste. Marie Chippewa in Michigan lost several employees to layoffs, including hard-to-replace medical staff who did not return after that shutdown ended.With those bad memories in mind, the Sault Chippewa tribal council approved a resolution last month (on the same day President Trump sparred with Democratic leaders about a border wall on television) that allowed leaders to shuffle funds if federal money stopped flowing. That step has delayed the worst of the pain, but it can help only for so long. Already, tribal officials have sent a memo encouraging frugality and canceled the purchase of a new computer server.“We’re not going to collapse. We may have to decide, ‘What we can do with our own funding?’” said Christine McPherson, the Sault Chippewa Tribe’s executive director. “But we’ll never close.”There have been some efforts to limit the impact. Representative Markwayne Mullin, Republican of Oklahoma, introduced a bill last month that would have maintained funding for the Indian Health Service during a shutdown. His proposal did not make it to a vote, but Mr. Mullin, who said “I have no read on how long” the shutdown would last, said he hoped his idea would gain bipartisan traction if the broader impasse stretches on.“This is a true federal obligation to treaties to Native Americans,” said Mr. Mullin, who is a citizen of the Cherokee Nation and who received health care at an Indian Health Service facility while growing up. “This is different than really any other government agency.”If the shutdown continues, it could also curtail a Department of Agriculture food program that helped feed about 90,000 Native American people in fiscal year 2017. The program is funded through January, but no new federal money will be designated if the government closing goes beyond that, according to a memo from the department. State and tribal agencies will have to decide if they can fill in the gap. Chairman Joseph Rupnick of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, headquartered in northeast Kansas, said he feared the impact that this would have on his members.“Those stores will be depleted,” Mr. Rupnick said of the tribe’s food distribution center. “When they’re going through a shutdown, they’re thinking: ‘I need five billion for a wall. I need dollars for this or that.’ The bottom line is it always impacts the neediest people in the country.”The shutdown has further eroded many Native Americans’ confidence in the federal government, which they said has never lived up to lofty promises made in long-ago treaties. “I believe very strongly that it adversely affects a population that is already adversely affected by the United States government,” said Harry Barnes, a former chairman of Montana’s 17,000-member Blackfeet Nation."
469,"LONDON — To hear some British politicians tell it, they are mere servants. They can only execute popular will, whatever the cost to the country or themselves. To do otherwise would be to betray democracy itself.“The will of the British people is an instruction that must be delivered,” Prime Minister David Cameron said after voters narrowly approved leaving the European Union in a 2016 referendum, though this meant both his resignation and, in his telling, devastation to the British economy.Yet lawmakers also believe they must determine for themselves how to serve Britain’s best interests. Prime Minister Theresa May, Mr. Cameron’s successor, justified her plan for withdrawal, or Brexit, as the best way forward, even if it was not the most popular.Voters seem to share these dual expectations. The British government, many believe, should first and foremost safeguard the national good, including from the whims of public opinion, which has flipped several times since the initial vote. But it must also respect public opinion, as captured in that nearly three-year-old vote, above all else.That contradiction “is as old as liberal democracy itself,” said Steven Levitsky, a Harvard University political scientist. But it is growing sharper and more destabilizing, he said, and not just in Britain.Around the world, rising populists and angry electorates are putting pressure, sometimes deliberately, on what Mr. Levitsky called democracy’s “two conflicting imperatives: majority rule and liberalism.”In Western countries, white majorities are challenging rights long promised to minority groups and outsiders. Populist leaders, including President Trump, are clashing with institutions that they say oppose popular will. Political establishments weaken every year.The result is a widening divide between two visions of democracy. There is the ideal of rule by the people. And there is the more complicated reality, in which institutions and representatives balance majority opinion against considerations like universal rights and the common good.Unable to reconcile those contradictory demands, once solid-seeming democracies are breaking down. Faith in a system that makes two contradictory promises is declining. The resulting chaos, far from elevating one vision of democracy over the other, could weaken both.Democracy may have begun as the idea that authority comes from the people, but there was always more to it.As its modern form first took hold, philosophers and revolutionaries debated how to balance several lofty ambitions, of which popular rule was just one. And they fretted over how to make their new system last.They concluded that democracy could never work as “simply the rule of public opinion,” said Nadia Urbinati, a Columbia University scholar of democracy. It would need “rules and procedures” to guard against factionalism, an abusive majority or a power-hungry leader.They converged on a system in which “elections are just one leg,” alongside a second leg of rules, rights and institutions, she said. “Without that, we don’t call it a democracy.”Edmund Burke, the 18th-century Irish philosopher, argued that an elected leader’s duty required both listening to constituents and putting his or her “mature judgment” ahead of their whims.During debates over the American Constitution, James Madison warned in one of the essays that became the Federalist Papers that unbridled majoritarianism had made earlier democracies “as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.” Only “a republic” of representatives subject to rules and institutions as well as the public, he wrote, “promises the cure for which we are seeking.”Such treatises formed the basis of today’s democracies, in which the people’s will is carefully incorporated but rarely intended to dominate.But that is not quite how this new system won the consent of everyday citizens.The first democracies built their legitimacy on that of monarchies, then common, with a few proper nouns swapped around. “Instead of having one king, you have a collective king, the people,” Ms. Urbinati said.That vision of democracy as rule by the people persists, still heard in classrooms and in campaign rallies, where citizens are told that their authority is paramount.It has set up voters for shock and outrage when they discover, time and again, that they are not as powerful as they’d thought. The checks imposed on popular will can feel like democracy failing — though it’s actually the system working as intended — provoking angry backlashes.Brexit is a near perfect encapsulation of this contradiction.Mr. Cameron and others sold the 2016 referendum as handing power to the people (never mind that the prime minister, confident that the measure would never pass, was really just looking for a political fig leaf). But it has left Britons more politically disaffected than at any other point in years.Members of the 48 percent who voted to remain in the European Union have asked why a slim majority should dictate the nation’s fate. Lately, with the polls having turned against Brexit, it can feel like raw majoritarian rule by a majority that no longer exists.Meanwhile, Britons who voted to leave have watched lawmakers fight over widely divergent plans, none of which enjoy majority popular support. There is speculation about a second referendum that might overturn the first, feeding suspicion that the establishment never intended to follow the people’s will.Referendums can end up feeling less democratic than promised in part, political scientists argue, because they are not actually all that democratic.They tend to be volatile, turning on unrelated political events or even the weather, which is thought to have influenced Colombia’s 2016 referendum on a peace deal with insurgents. They are notoriously poor at reflecting public opinion, particularly on a complex issue like Brexit. And they force majoritarian rule onto a political system that is designed to resist it, setting up voters and leaders for collision.But even if democracies are not designed for direct popular rule, democracy is often idealized as being exactly that, making it nearly impossible for British leaders to justify ignoring the 2016 vote. Even many who wish to do so are arguing for holding a second referendum, repeating the same risks as in the first.Challenges to liberal democracy’s checks on popular input are growing globally.In France, protesters known as the Yellow Vests, not content to defer national policy to Emmanuel Macron, the centrist president, have demanded that the country hold regular referendums on new legislation.The Alternative for Germany, a far-right party, has also pushed for referendums, including on whether to leave the European Union. Though the party is unlikely to get its wish, merely asking allows it to portray itself as a champion of popular will against an unresponsive establishment.Some elected leaders are governing as if by never-ending referendum, pushing for raw popular will to carry the day.In the United States, failing so far to get his border wall, President Trump — as populist leaders often do when institutions stand in their way — has portrayed Congress as opposing the will of the people. Then he allowed the federal government to be partially shut down.Other populists have taken things further. The ruling party of Poland, after portraying the judiciary as an obstacle to popular will, briefly tried to purge the Supreme Court. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte told the police that they could keep citizens safe only by favoring him over the rule of law.Such crises are growing more common, Mr. Levitsky argues, because of a shift within democracies.Leaders have always needed the support of both voters and establishments to win elections. Voters wanted popular rule, establishments wanted checks and institutions; the two held each other in balance.But in recent years a series of changes, including the rise of social media and online fund-raising, have severely weakened establishments’ power.“Now, politicians are learning that they need to be much more responsive to voters than to the establishment,” Mr. Levitsky said.Marginal figures like Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, a longtime lawmaker and now the president, can win by promising to empower popular will over the establishment. That doesn’t have to mean abolishing democratic checks, but it makes doing so far easier.That can be taken to extremes. A new generation of elected strongmen has risen by exploiting the gap between popular expectations of democracy and its reality.Institutions and rules really do limit the public’s role. Though they are meant to protect universal rights and the common good, they can be portrayed by populists as an elite conspiracy to subvert the people.The only way to save democracy, the populists argue, is for a strong leader to smash those institutions and rule directly on the people’s behalf.This can initially feel liberating to that leader’s supporters. But, as Mr. Madison warned in the Federalist Papers, a democracy imposed “by the superior force” of an “overbearing majority” may not always remain democratic.And sooner or later, with the establishment taken care of, strongmen tend to start going after the people themselves."
470,"SAULT STE. MARIE, Mich. — For one tribe of Chippewa Indians in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the government shutdown comes with a price tag: about $100,000, every day, of federal money that does not arrive to keep health clinics staffed, food pantry shelves full and employees paid.The tribe is using its own funds to cover the shortfalls for now. But if the standoff in Washington continues much longer, that stopgap money will be depleted. Later this month, workers could be furloughed and health services could be pared back. “Everything,” said Aaron Payment, the chairman of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe, “is on the table.”For many Americans who are not federal workers or contractors, a shutdown is a minor inconvenience. A trip to a national park may be canceled. A call to a government office may go unanswered. But for Native American tribes, which rely heavily on federal money to operate, a shutdown can cripple their most basic functions.All across Indian Country, the federal shutdown slices deep. Generations ago, tribes negotiated treaties with the United States government guaranteeing funds for services like health care and education in exchange for huge swaths of territory.“The federal government owes us this: We prepaid with millions of acres of land,” said Mr. Payment, who also criticized the shutdown on Monday from the stage at his tribe’s New Year’s powwow. “We don’t have the right to take back that land, so we expect the federal government to fulfill its treaty and trust responsibility.”On the Navajo Nation, a mostly rural reservation of red rock canyon that spans parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah, the government shutdown has already been difficult, said Russell Begaye, the Navajo Nation’s president.A blanket of snow has covered the region, but roads are unplowed because federal maintenance has stopped. Many people are now trapped in their homes, unable to make the 20- or 50-mile journey to buy water, groceries and medicine, said Mr. Begaye.The Interior Department’s Indian Affairs bureau provides basic services to about 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives, often by funneling funds to the tribes to administer the services themselves or by employing federal workers to run the programs. This means that services from law enforcement to tribal courts, disaster relief and road maintenance are often completed by tribal employees whose salaries rely on federal funding — or by federal workers, some of whom are tribal citizens.The Bureau of Indian Affairs was set to furlough 2,295 of 4,057 employees during a shutdown, meaning at least some of those services and salaries will be slowed or stopped.Because the federal government contributes to the salaries of many members of the Navajo Nation, Mr. Begaye said the lack of pay would hurt families on the reservation, where a single salary can support a family of six, 10 or even 12 people. Mr. Begaye said loan sharks have started circling, leaving fliers on cars and doorsteps.“It just kind of snowballs into our people doing things that they know they shouldn’t do and further financially obligating themselves,” Mr. Begaye said. “They have to keep their heater going. They have to keep their water on.”On the Bois Forte Indian Reservation in northern Minnesota, tribal officials have instituted a hiring freeze and are planning to meet later this week to discuss budget cuts. Cathy Chavers, the tribe’s chairwoman, said tribal functions were continuing for now, but “it will probably come down to minimal, minimal basic services” if the shutdown lasts another month.Already, police officers on her reservation, who are employees of the federal government and not the tribe, were being forced to work without pay.“These officers are putting their lives on the line,” Ms. Chavers said, “and they don’t know if they’re going to get a paycheck or not.”Tribes are making plans for how much longer they can operate, while not knowing whether they will be reimbursed for shutdown-related expenses. Officials with the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin said that they had made contingency plans but that they could manage at least another month without any cuts. The Shoshone-Bannock Tribes in Idaho posted on Facebook that they had enough money to operate at full strength through Saturday, but would then have to re-evaluate.“Things do grind to a halt,” said Kevin Washburn, who served as the assistant secretary for Indian Affairs under President Barack Obama. “Indian Country stops moving forward” during a shutdown, Mr. Washburn said, “and starts moving backward.”A spokesman for the Interior Department, reached on New Year’s Eve, said so many people were out of the office for the holiday, or furloughed, that he had no information about the way the shutdown was playing out in Indian Country.“Literally, there’s a handful of people that are currently excepted and able to work,” said the spokesman, John Bockmier, about his office. “I just don’t have any details from around the country to give you,” he went on, “because there is no one out there that is currently able to provide that information for me.”For tribes, this has become a familiar, painful scenario. In 2013, during Mr. Obama’s presidency, a lengthy shutdown forced a California tribe to close its child care program. In Minnesota, a tribe postponed nonemergency medical procedures. And the Sault Ste. Marie Chippewa in Michigan lost several employees to layoffs, including hard-to-replace medical staff who did not return after that shutdown ended.With those bad memories in mind, the Sault Chippewa tribal council approved a resolution last month (on the same day President Trump sparred with Democratic leaders about a border wall on television) that allowed leaders to shuffle funds if federal money stopped flowing. That step has delayed the worst of the pain, but it can help only for so long. Already, tribal officials have sent a memo encouraging frugality and canceled the purchase of a new computer server.“We’re not going to collapse. We may have to decide, ‘What we can do with our own funding?’” said Christine McPherson, the Sault Chippewa Tribe’s executive director. “But we’ll never close.”There have been some efforts to limit the impact. Representative Markwayne Mullin, Republican of Oklahoma, introduced a bill last month that would have maintained funding for the Indian Health Service during a shutdown. His proposal did not make it to a vote, but Mr. Mullin, who said “I have no read on how long” the shutdown would last, said he hoped his idea would gain bipartisan traction if the broader impasse stretches on.“This is a true federal obligation to treaties to Native Americans,” said Mr. Mullin, who is a citizen of the Cherokee Nation and who received health care at an Indian Health Service facility while growing up. “This is different than really any other government agency.”If the shutdown continues, it could also curtail a Department of Agriculture food program that helped feed about 90,000 Native American people in fiscal year 2017. The program is funded through January, but no new federal money will be designated if the government closing goes beyond that, according to a memo from the department. State and tribal agencies will have to decide if they can fill in the gap. Chairman Joseph Rupnick of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, headquartered in northeast Kansas, said he feared the impact that this would have on his members.“Those stores will be depleted,” Mr. Rupnick said of the tribe’s food distribution center. “When they’re going through a shutdown, they’re thinking: ‘I need five billion for a wall. I need dollars for this or that.’ The bottom line is it always impacts the neediest people in the country.”The shutdown has further eroded many Native Americans’ confidence in the federal government, which they said has never lived up to lofty promises made in long-ago treaties. “I believe very strongly that it adversely affects a population that is already adversely affected by the United States government,” said Harry Barnes, a former chairman of Montana’s 17,000-member Blackfeet Nation."
471,"LONDON — To hear some British politicians tell it, they are mere servants. They can only execute popular will, whatever the cost to the country or themselves. To do otherwise would be to betray democracy itself.“The will of the British people is an instruction that must be delivered,” Prime Minister David Cameron said after voters narrowly approved leaving the European Union in a 2016 referendum, though this meant both his resignation and, in his telling, devastation to the British economy.Yet lawmakers also believe they must determine for themselves how to serve Britain’s best interests. Prime Minister Theresa May, Mr. Cameron’s successor, justified her plan for withdrawal, or Brexit, as the best way forward, even if it was not the most popular.Voters seem to share these dual expectations. The British government, many believe, should first and foremost safeguard the national good, including from the whims of public opinion, which has flipped several times since the initial vote. But it must also respect public opinion, as captured in that nearly three-year-old vote, above all else.That contradiction “is as old as liberal democracy itself,” said Steven Levitsky, a Harvard University political scientist. But it is growing sharper and more destabilizing, he said, and not just in Britain.Around the world, rising populists and angry electorates are putting pressure, sometimes deliberately, on what Mr. Levitsky called democracy’s “two conflicting imperatives: majority rule and liberalism.”In Western countries, white majorities are challenging rights long promised to minority groups and outsiders. Populist leaders, including President Trump, are clashing with institutions that they say oppose popular will. Political establishments weaken every year.The result is a widening divide between two visions of democracy. There is the ideal of rule by the people. And there is the more complicated reality, in which institutions and representatives balance majority opinion against considerations like universal rights and the common good.Unable to reconcile those contradictory demands, once solid-seeming democracies are breaking down. Faith in a system that makes two contradictory promises is declining. The resulting chaos, far from elevating one vision of democracy over the other, could weaken both.Democracy may have begun as the idea that authority comes from the people, but there was always more to it.As its modern form first took hold, philosophers and revolutionaries debated how to balance several lofty ambitions, of which popular rule was just one. And they fretted over how to make their new system last.They concluded that democracy could never work as “simply the rule of public opinion,” said Nadia Urbinati, a Columbia University scholar of democracy. It would need “rules and procedures” to guard against factionalism, an abusive majority or a power-hungry leader.They converged on a system in which “elections are just one leg,” alongside a second leg of rules, rights and institutions, she said. “Without that, we don’t call it a democracy.”Edmund Burke, the 18th-century Irish philosopher, argued that an elected leader’s duty required both listening to constituents and putting his or her “mature judgment” ahead of their whims.During debates over the American Constitution, James Madison warned in one of the essays that became the Federalist Papers that unbridled majoritarianism had made earlier democracies “as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.” Only “a republic” of representatives subject to rules and institutions as well as the public, he wrote, “promises the cure for which we are seeking.”Such treatises formed the basis of today’s democracies, in which the people’s will is carefully incorporated but rarely intended to dominate.But that is not quite how this new system won the consent of everyday citizens.The first democracies built their legitimacy on that of monarchies, then common, with a few proper nouns swapped around. “Instead of having one king, you have a collective king, the people,” Ms. Urbinati said.That vision of democracy as rule by the people persists, still heard in classrooms and in campaign rallies, where citizens are told that their authority is paramount.It has set up voters for shock and outrage when they discover, time and again, that they are not as powerful as they’d thought. The checks imposed on popular will can feel like democracy failing — though it’s actually the system working as intended — provoking angry backlashes.Brexit is a near perfect encapsulation of this contradiction.Mr. Cameron and others sold the 2016 referendum as handing power to the people (never mind that the prime minister, confident that the measure would never pass, was really just looking for a political fig leaf). But it has left Britons more politically disaffected than at any other point in years.Members of the 48 percent who voted to remain in the European Union have asked why a slim majority should dictate the nation’s fate. Lately, with the polls having turned against Brexit, it can feel like raw majoritarian rule by a majority that no longer exists.Meanwhile, Britons who voted to leave have watched lawmakers fight over widely divergent plans, none of which enjoy majority popular support.

472,"WASHINGTON — As the most diverse freshman class in history settles into the House of Representatives, newcomers like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan have been racking up social media followers and soaking up the spotlight, liberal firebrands largely elected to safe Democratic seats.But overlooked in the hallway protests and often glowing news media coverage, a larger group of more centrist Democrats has arrived with a different agenda. And now, they are quietly asserting their influence as the partial government shutdown, which has left them scrambling to explain why 800,000 workers are still without pay, enters its fifth week.The centrists, elected to seats held last year by Republicans, delivered Democrats their House majority, and their re-elections will be critical to keeping the party in power. They include a sizable subset with backgrounds in military, intelligence and national security, and won by promising to work across the aisle and to end dysfunction in Washington. Now they are caught in the most dysfunctional situation of all — a record-breaking shutdown — and they are under pressure from constituents to do something about it.[The Latest: In White House Address, Trump Proposes DACA Deal in Exchange for Wall Funding]This past week, a group of freshmen in Trump-leaning districts convened a private strategy session to discuss how they could press Speaker Nancy Pelosi to reclaim the issue of border security for Democrats and to open the door to negotiations with President Trump. Some also aired their frustrations with Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the chairman of the Democratic caucus, who hosted a small dinner for freshmen from battleground districts.“We have very real credibility on the border security issue,” said Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado and a former Army ranger. “I did two combat deployments to Afghanistan. Both of those were on the Afghan-Pakistan border interdicting drug and gun smuggling and insurgents coming across from Pakistan and the tribal regions. So I like to think I know a thing or two about border security, and you don’t do it by building walls.”Ms. Pelosi appears ready to listen. When Congress returns to Washington in the coming week, she is expected to bring up legislation that will include an additional $1 billion for border security measures, including 75 additional immigration judges and infrastructure improvements at ports of entry — though no money for Mr. Trump’s cherished border wall.She is also weighing whether to propose a Democratic homeland security bill that could lay the foundation for talks with Mr. Trump — a step that would be a significant shift in strategy for the new majority, which has instead spent the past several weeks emphasizing the shutdown’s emotional and financial toll on unpaid workers.“As someone who worked on preserving the homeland her entire life, I’m ready to talk about homeland security,” said Representative Elissa Slotkin, Democrat of Michigan, a former Pentagon official who also served in the C.I.A., and who organized the strategy session. “I don’t think we need a wall from sea to shining sea. But am I willing to talk about more fencing and more drones and technology and radar and border agents? Absolutely.”Of the roughly 60 new Democrats in Congress, two-thirds, including a tight-knit group of 10 who are either veterans or have national security experience, flipped Republican seats. They represent a very different face of the party: pragmatic moderates who believe they were elected not just to resist the president but also to cooperate with him where they can.“Every single one of them ran on a platform of going out to Washington, shaking things up and getting things done,” said Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, a member of Democratic leadership who focuses on electing Democrats in Trump districts. “From the day they were sworn in, the government has been shut down, and they don’t like it and the people they represent don’t like it.”Several of the freshman Democratic centrists, all members of a bipartisan group called the Problem Solvers Caucus, met with Mr. Trump at the White House this past week. Representative Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, a former C.I.A. operative who handled and recruited spies in Europe, said she told Mr. Trump that people in her district, including prison officials and Transportation Security Administration officers, are suffering. She said Mr. Trump did a surprising amount of listening.“I can’t speak for how he interpreted what we said, or how he listened to that information,” she said, “but it was a calm meeting. Most people spoke multiple times, and so I found that to be a positive thing.”But while Democratic leaders understand the eagerness to quickly end the shutdown — a sentiment shared by Democrats across the philosophical spectrum — they are also urging caution, and sticking to their insistence that they will not negotiate with Mr. Trump on border security until the government is fully open.“It’s fair to say that the freshman members of Congress, particularly the veterans and national security professionals, were sent to Washington to solve problems, and they would like to resolve the issue of border security in a bipartisan way,” Mr. Jeffries said. “That is the position of the House Democratic caucus as well, but it’s just a question of timing and the Republican willingness to stop acting like wholly owned subsidiaries of the Trump administration and engage in a meaningful conversation.”After just three weeks in Washington, many of the centrists say the partisan split in the Capitol is even worse than they had imagined, and some have been quietly reaching out to freshman Republicans to see if they can find a way to bridge the divide and end the shutdown.“When I think about being deployed on an aircraft carrier and we are simultaneously launching strikes against terrorist targets in Iraq and Afghanistan and I’m supervising the operation at the nuclear reactors, I don’t turn to one of the operators next to me and say, ‘Are you a Democrat or a Republican?’” said Representative Elaine Luria, Democrat of Virginia, who spent 20 years as a surface warfare officer and nuclear engineer in the Navy. “We’re all very frustrated by the partisanship.”Ms. Slotkin, who was an acting assistant secretary of defense under former President Barack Obama, described what she called a lack of evidence-based planning to secure the border.“If I was back at the Defense Department, we would look at an objective needs assessment for securing the border and we would build a budget to fund that security, and we would be negotiating on it,” she said.But she said that when she asked senior House members if such a document existed, she was told that the White House had its needs assessment and Democrats had theirs — and that neither was “truly objective.”In talking points issued to Democrats, Ms. Pelosi’s office ticked off a list of items that the party favors as part of a plan for “strong, smart, effective border security,” including scanning technology at ports of entry to screen for drugs and weapons, drones and radar to spot migrants crossing illegally, filling more than 3,000 vacancies for customs officers and building up infrastructure at official border crossings.The “service candidates,” as the veterans and national security professionals call themselves, see themselves taking a leading role in articulating that vision.In addition to discussing the financial toll of the shutdown, Representative Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, a former federal prosecutor and Navy pilot, said Democrats needed to start underlining the “safety aspect” as well: “While we are arguing over border security, we’re not paying our Customs and Border Patrol agents, so we’re creating less security right now.”But the emphasis on border security may not sit well with their more progressive colleagues, who are more apt to talk about abolishing the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency than stopping the flow of drugs at the southern border with Mexico.“I don’t think we need to try to out-border security the Republicans at this point with this president,” said Corbin Trent, the communications director for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. “It makes more sense to focus on ways of creating an immigration system to bring people into this country to help build our economy and our society, rather than to help keep them out.”But Ms. Slotkin said it was time for the voices of those who flipped districts to be heard.“By the numbers, we should and do have a strong voice in the caucus,” she said, adding, “I think Alexandria has done a great job of attracting new young people into the political process and getting people engaged. I think that’s a good thing. Do I think she always represents every freshman? No.”"
473,"Achiri Nelson Geh, a young activist deeply involved in the independence movement in southern Cameroon, knew he had to flee: Police officers had killed his brother, and they were looking for him. Making his way by plane, boat, bus and foot to Mexico, he surrendered to United States authorities at the border in the hope of winning asylum.But his new life wasn’t what he expected. He has spent the 21 months since then inside three federal immigration detention centers, imprisoned until he can collect $50,000 for a bond, while his asylum case winds through the appeals court.One day this past summer, though, a lifeline arrived: Not $50,000, but a letter from Anne-Marie Debbané, a professor of geography at San Diego State University, near the Otay Mesa Detention Center, where he was housed for the first 20 months. “I am terribly sorry for what you are going through both in Cameroon and here,” she wrote. “I applaud you for your bravery, courage and determination in standing up for justice and freedom.”Mr. Geh, now 29, was elated to hear from someone, even someone he had never met. “Thank you for your letters,” he wrote. “It gives me courage.”Here began an old-fashioned correspondence that bloomed into a friendship, part of an unusual epistolary campaign initiated by San Diego State professors and others in suburban San Diego. Last week, the university library made public the digital archive of hundreds of letters from detainees, throwing open a window into the fragile lives of migrants from more than 20 countries living, some of them for years, inside a nondescript private prison.The debate over how to receive immigrants in a country that both depends on their labor and criminalizes them as intruders has emerged as the signature flash point of the Trump administration, which has swept a growing number of undocumented immigrants like Mr. Geh into detention at places like Otay Mesa and vowed to secure the border against future illegal crossings.But as Washington battles over the president’s plan for a border wall and how to handle an influx of new migrant families arriving from Central America, the letters exchanged in San Diego have made an international political drama intensely personal.“In the U.S. our tendency is to really dehumanize migrants,” said Kate Swanson, another geography professor at San Diego State. “We put them in these concrete boxes. This helps them become visible.”Detainees began writing letters, many using stubby golf pencils purchased for 6 cents from the commissary. They pleaded for help while telling their stories of rape, murder and torture in their home countries, and of separation from their children at the border. Volunteers responded with shock and empathy, sending Christmas cards, poems, pictures and updates about their own families. They also sent small amounts of money to the detainees’ accounts for purchases of such things as extra food and drinks, toothbrushes and sneakers.For those awaiting imminent deportation, “all we could offer was commissary and moral support in the meantime — like the cup of coffee on the deck of a big ship that’s going to sink,” said Joanna Brooks, an associate vice president at the university who initiated the campaign, which has grown to 200 volunteers.Otay Mesa, operated by a private prison corporation under a contract with the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, opened in its current building southeast of San Diego in 2015. Of the 930 immigrants in ICE custody as of this week, 796 are men.But fewer than half of the detainees have criminal convictions, according to the latest records kept by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse of Syracuse University. Most are simply awaiting the outcome of deportation or asylum proceedings. Of those with criminal records, drunken driving and illegal entry into the country are the most common offenses, the analysis shows.“We are not who President Trump thinks we are,” wrote Luis, a 19-year-old gay man from El Salvador. “What I want is to create conscience of who we are as migrants. We are not a danger to society.”The letters, written in halting English and flowing Spanish, told stories of how people had wound up in a place so far from home. Mostly, they expressed longing to know that someone knew they were there.“Whenever you reply my letters, it is a light for me in the darkness,” said an asylum seeker from the Democratic Republic of Congo who goes by the initial K in the archive. “It is true it makes me cry because your letter showed care and love as a human.”As much as the communication has helped ease the loneliness for the detainees, it has deeply affected the lives of the letter writers as well. For Professor Debbané, whose academic specialty is post-apartheid South Africa, the letters to Mr. Geh led to in-person visits and prison calls; they talked about colonialism in Africa, and shared books and articles.“We are there for one another, and I believe that we appeared in each other’s lives at just the right moment,” she said of Mr. Geh, who was taken out of Otay Mesa by ICE on his 29th birthday and is now at a detention center in Alabama.“I have all of her letters with me,” he said in an interview. “I read them every day.”The letter-writing project began when the Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant parents from their children at the border was roiling the country last summer. Professor Brooks gathered similarly outraged friends and colleagues at her house; together, they found the names and alien registration numbers for 30 detainees at Otay Mesa who had been part of a migrant caravan held up at the border in Tijuana. The volunteers rented a post office box for the detainees’ responses.When the first batch of 16 handwritten letters came back July 11, Jennifer Gonzalez, a lawyer in the group, said: “We were all sharing bits and pieces and names and stories. I had this intense sense that each one of those letters didn’t just represent a real person, but they represented a family who missed this person, their community, down to their ancestors.”Within six weeks, the group had a system in place for writing letters daily and depositing funds into detainees’ commissary accounts. The group estimates it has spent more than $10,000 since July.“There are 140 of us who have organized to share our commissary,” wrote Ulises, who came to the United States to seek protection from the abuse he suffered as a gay man in Honduras. “We are people from different countries, India, China, Pakistan, Cuba, Jamaica, Vietnam, etc. There are many different languages and sometimes we have to communicate by signals because we don’t speak the same language, but that does not prevent us from providing moral support to each other.”Terrie Vorono, a volunteer in the group, thanked him for his letter and offered a connection: As the mother of a gay son, she is an advocate for gay rights. “We know that our children are never 100 percent safe even in the United States,” she wrote to him.The letter writers have not found universal support. Rosanna Benink, who has hosted volunteers at her house every Monday, said one of her friends wondered why she bothered.“She said to me, ‘Well, they shouldn’t be here in the first place, so what did they expect?’” Ms. Benink said. She said she tried to explain that these were “true asylum seekers,” but ran into more apathy. “You get that reaction and it blows me away,” she said.The volunteers asked the detainees to describe their living conditions at the prison, and the letters revealed common complaints: spoiled food, itchy soap, harsh treatment, lack of access to legal counsel. An advocacy group formed by the letter writers, Detainee Allies, published a separate report based on the findings from the letters.“Things here become more and more unbearable,” a 50-year-old woman from Guatemala wrote on Dec. 3. “They make the temperature intensely cold, our bones hurt. The meal schedule is irregular and the food is not healthy. An officer said that it was food for dogs.”The detainee named Luis, who had come via the migrant caravan and has since been granted asylum, wrote that for personal hygiene, “we are only given soap and shampoo, but the soap and shampoo they give us makes us itch.” To avoid it, he said, detainees must buy a better brand from the commissary.Amanda Gilchrist, a spokeswoman for CoreCivic, the company that operates Otay Mesa, said officials at the detention center had been responsive to the needs of detainees, correcting problems when they came to light. She said facility managers monitored the temperatures and the food. “Meals in CoreCivic facilities meet or exceed nutritional standards, which are set by our government partners,” she said.As the months have passed, some of the detainees have left — either winning the right to live in the United States or, more often, sent back to their home countries.Professor Swanson has found herself thinking often about one of the men she wrote to Juan, who had come to the United States to avoid death threats from MS-13 gang members in Honduras.She had written to him about her son and husband, and sent Honduran soccer scores. But he was deported after three months, and the letters stopped. Professor Swanson said she was sure he was dead.But it wasn’t so. Reached in Honduras last week, Juan said he was safe and planning to leave again for Mexico to find work; he wouldn’t try to return to the United States, but he did have one lasting memory from the experience: Professor Swanson’s letters.“I felt like I had family,” he said."
474,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. President Trump addressed a divided government, the pope makes a rare acknowledgement and the #MeToo movement reaches the heights of Costa Rica’s political landscape. Here’s the latest: President Trump struck some unifying notes in his second State of the Union address, and he also made an extended argument for his border wall.Our coverage includes video of the speech, and analysis, takeaways and fact-checks by our correspondents.The chamber’s Republicans broke out into chants of “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” more than once. The many newly elected Democratic lawmakers also listening were less enthusiastic.And the location of Mr. Trump’s second meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, is now public. They will sit down together this month in Vietnam.Other news from Washington: Federal prosecutors ordered Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee to turn over documents about donors, guests, finances and activities as part of an investigation into illegal foreign donations.On the plane returning from his historic trip to the United Arab Emirates, the pope said that the Roman Catholic Church had a persistent problem of sexual abuse against nuns by priests and bishops. It was the first time he has commented on the issue. The pope said the Vatican had suspended some priests. “Should more be done? Yes.” he said. “Do we have the will? Yes. But it is a path that we have already begun.” Background: In India, Africa and in Italy, Catholic nuns have accused clerics of sexual abuse in recent years. And last week a Vatican magazine wrote about nuns who were either getting abortions or giving birth to the children of priests. In Abu Dhabi: Francis celebrated Mass with about 135,000 Catholics, the largest public Christian rite in the history of the United Arab Emirates.A surprise offer: The pope also expressed a willingness to mediate a peaceful resolution to the political crisis in Venezuela if asked by both President Nicolás Maduro and the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó.Yesterday, we told you about the alarming prospect of glaciers in the Himalayas melting by a third or more over the next 80 years.But for millions of people from Japan to Wisconsin, ice is already vanishing closer to home. Lakes that used to routinely freeze over aren’t anymore.Details: For the first time, scientists quantified the effects of climate change on ice cover across 1.4 million lakes in the Northern Hemisphere. They found that thousands have already been experiencing years without ice and that “an extensive loss of lake ice will occur within the next generation.”Why it matters: Without ice, lakes begin warming earlier in the year, which increases the risk of toxic algal blooms and stresses certain fish. Dependably frozen lakes support cultural and economic activities like ice fishing, skating and winter festivals. Ice roads across lakes and rivers provide wintertime lifelines for remote areas.Representatives from the insurgent group and a delegation of former Afghan officials kicked off two days of talks in Moscow aimed at ending the 18-year conflict.The most significant contact between the Taliban and senior Afghan politicians since 2001, the talks come just a week after the Taliban and American diplomats said they had made significant progress in their own negotiations.Details: The talks offer a window into any future peace deal. The Taliban, which barred women from public life during their time in power, said they now respected women’s rights to education and work — a claim met with immediate skepticism in Afghanistan. One former governor who was forced from office last year urged a gradual withdrawal of foreign troops.In Afghanistan: None of the talks have included representatives of the U.S.-backed government in Kabul. President Ashraf Ghani criticized the Moscow meeting as an attempt to undermine the authority of the Afghan state, though Afghanistan’s political elite is beginning to rally around the peace effort.Of note: Thirty years after the Soviet Union retreated from Afghanistan, the Russian government played a quiet but major role in orchestrating this meeting, and has pointed to the U.S. military presence in the country as the main hindrance to peace.Venezuela: Opposition leaders said they’re preparing to deliver food and medicine donations to ease the country’s shortages, which would likely weaken the authority of President Nicolás Maduro. But some major relief organizations are reluctant to cooperate, fearing that the plan could turn aid into a political weapon.#MeToo: A psychiatrist and nuclear disarmament activist has accused the former president of Costa Rica, Oscar Arias Sánchez, of sexually assaulting her four years ago, bringing the movement to one of Latin America’s most revered statesman. Paris: At least 10 people were killed and 37 injured after a fire tore through an eight-story building in a residential part of the city — the deadliest in the French capital in over a decade. The fire appeared to be tied to a neighborhood dispute, and the authorities are treating it as a possible case of arson.Islamic State: A British journalist, John Cantlie, who was abducted by the militant group in Syria in 2012 is believed to still be alive, a British official said. Since his capture, Mr. Cantlie has appeared in several online videos often delivering Islamic State propaganda, possibly under coercion, but the last one was released more than two years ago.Japan: The finance minister apologized for saying that people who didn’t have children were to blame for the country’s declining population and social security costs.World Bank: President Trump plans to nominate David Malpass, an outspoken critic of the global financial body, to lead it, officials said. Mr. Malpass’s stance that multilateral institutions are growing increasingly “intrusive” squares with the president’s own skepticism of global structures.Myanmar: The Secretariat, where the country’s independence hero, Aung San, was assassinated in 1947, will be the backdrop for a two-day night bazaar promoting ties between Myanmar and the U.S., with Krispy Kreme doughnuts and a live band from the local Hard Rock Cafe. Critics find the event insensitive.Mindfulness: Students at hundreds of schools in Britain will start to learn relaxation techniques, breathing exercises and other methods to “help them regulate their emotions,” the government said. The new program is aimed at introducing children to the issues around mental health and happiness.Chanel: For its most recent spring fashion show in October, the French luxury house created a beach inside the 828,220-square-foot Grand Palais, complete with real-water waves crashing on the artificial shore. It took nine days and a team of 150 people to pull the ambitious project together.Hummingbirds: Don’t be fooled by their beautiful colors and teeny tininess. Studies have found that the birds are ferocious fighters with beaks that have evolved into dangerous weapons for male-to-male conflicts.Tips for a more fulfilling life.Recipe of the day: Crispy pork chops paired with buttered radishes are an easy weeknight dinner.

(Ms. Colman got a best actress nod.)The movie focuses on Anne’s relationship with her favored confidantes — Sarah Churchill and her cousin Abigail Masham — and the many power struggles within the royal court.She’s shown as a weak monarch, if a stubborn one — a view that caught on in her own time and mostly stuck.But historians see another side to Anne’s reign, too. She ruled during a period of military and economic progress for Britain.She also oversaw the official unification of England and Scotland, creating the United Kingdom.Surely the queen deserves a little credit for all that?Claire Moses, a homescreen editor in our London office, wrote today’s Back Story.Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

475,"[Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.]BURLINGTON, Iowa — Beto O’Rourke, the 46-year-old former Texas congressman whose near-miss Senate run last year propelled him to Democratic stardom, announced on Thursday that he was running for president, betting that a broad message of national unity and generational change will lift him above a slate of committed progressives offering big-ticket policy ideas.His decision jolts an early election season already stuffed with contenders, adding to the mix a relentless campaigner with a small-dollar fund-raising army, the performative instincts of a former punk rocker and a pro-immigrant vision to counteract President Trump’s.Yet Mr. O’Rourke also comes to the 2020 race with few notable legislative accomplishments after three terms in the House representing El Paso. And in a primary so far defined by bedrock policy positions, like the economic agendas of Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Mr. O’Rourke enters without a signature proposal that might serve as the ideological anchor of his bid.“This moment of peril produces perhaps the greatest moment of promise for this country and for everyone inside it,’’ Mr. O’Rourke said in a video announcing his candidacy, released hours before a three-day tour of Iowa began on Thursday morning.Shortly after 8 a.m. Thursday, Mr. O’Rourke stepped into a coffee shop on Main Street in Keokuk and began introducing himself to a state he had never visited before.“Hey, nice to meet you. Beto O’Rourke,” he said, squeezing between news cameras and caffeine-seekers. “Good morning, good morning to you,” he said to people in the southeastern Iowa town of Keokuk — a county where Donald J. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 16 percentage points in 2016 but where former President Barack Obama won four years earlier.Soon, he was standing on a chair taking questions, perched between paintings of flowers and musical instruments. “This is democracy,” he said.Mr. O’Rourke was planning on spending much of the next three days in similar communities across eastern Iowa, the historically Democratic part of the state where so many voters swung to Mr. Trump three years ago. Keeping with the do-it-yourself spirit of his Senate race, the new candidate did not release a full schedule of stops. Details of his appearances spread by social media and word of mouth.His Democratic rivals quickly sent notice, however, that they were not going to let his long-anticipated launch go unimpeded. Former Mayor Julian Castro of San Antonio released a list of 30 new endorsements from Texas, including one state lawmaker from Mr. O’Rourke’s hometown. Mr. Sanders of Vermont, Ms. Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Kamala Harris of California emailed fund-raising appeals noting Mr. O’Rourke’s entry into the race — with Ms. Harris citing the historic diversity in the field, which she represents.And President Trump also swiftly weighed in, using a photo opportunity in the Oval Office to ridicule Mr. O’Rourke’s gesticulations.“I think he’s got a lot of hand movement,’’ the president said. “I’ve never seen so much hand movement. I said, ‘Is he crazy or is that just the way he acts?’’’Unlike many of his 14 Democratic rivals for the nomination, Mr. O’Rourke has spent little time until recently even considering a White House run, let alone building an operation that would sustain one. Some voters and activists have also wondered aloud if a white man is the best fit for this Democratic moment, particularly after midterm successes powered often by female and nonwhite candidates.[Check out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field.]With Mr. O’Rourke’s entry, the primary field appears close to settled more than 10 months before the Iowa caucuses; former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the only holdout among the expected major candidates, seems poised to join the race next month.Early polls have shown Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders on top. Mr. O’Rourke, three decades their junior, hopes to supply an unsubtle contrast, particularly given Mr. Sanders’s success with the kinds of young voters who flocked to Mr. O’Rourke in Texas.Advisers to other Democratic candidates have watched Mr. O’Rourke’s plans with concern, recognizing that the kind of face-to-face politicking that fueled his campaign to unseat Senator Ted Cruz in Texas should suit him well in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, where voters crave personal interaction with candidates.Mr. O’Rourke made his town hall forums the centerpiece of his Senate candidacy, turning the race into a national cause — the underdog liberal running in a famously red state — trailed by a documentary film crew and endorsed by celebrities from Beyoncé to Willie Nelson. He made a point of visiting each of the 254 counties in Texas, helping him bulldoze fund-raising records and come within about 200,000 votes of Mr. Cruz on Election Day.[Where Beto O’Rourke stands on the issues]Mr. O’Rourke also attracted many fans outside the state, drawing them into a perpetual social media live-stream capturing not only his political events but unscripted moments on the road: late-night burger stops, skateboarding in a parking lot, reminiscing with a former bandmate behind the wheel. For many politically obsessed liberals, his inevitably upbeat musings offered a welcome online antidote to Mr. Trump’s Twitter rampaging. On the eve of his announcement, Vanity Fair released a cover story on Mr. O’Rourke with photographs by Annie Leibovitz.Yet his boast in that interview — “I’m just born to do this” — and off-the-cuff comments he made Thursday about only sporadically helping his wife raise their children, quickly drew criticism and illustrated the peril of taking his unplugged style to the crucible of a presidential race.Admirers, however, believe it is this ability to generate his own narrative orbit that could separate him from his peers.“In a political environment where it’s so hard to break through, he has an ability to pique people’s interest and to drive a narrative on his own,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist who worked for Mrs. Clinton in 2016, and is not advising any candidate in 2020. “He isn’t just shadowboxing with the president’s Twitter handle.”On one central issue, though, Mr. Trump has provided Mr. O’Rourke with a useful foil. This year, when the president traveled to El Paso to press for a wall on the border with Mexico, the two headlined dueling rallies.Subsequently, he even said he would support tearing down the existing border wall in the El Paso area, a declaration that Republicans have suggested they will use against him should he make the general election.But the Democratic primary could present unique challenges to Mr. O’Rourke.It is an open question whether he will be able to scale up his skeletal organization and hand over control to the sort of political professionals he largely shunned in his Senate race. The lead-up to Mr. O’Rourke’s official announcement Thursday has been highly improvisational, in part because he was personally directing much of the planning.On Wednesday night, he was texting supporters in early nominating states to share his plans and to tell them he would have advisers get in touch with them about his schedule. And for weeks, he has been meeting and talking on the telephone with a number of Democratic strategists to gauge their interest in working for him, finding encouragement but also a reluctance to move to El Paso, where he is planning to base his operations.Mr. O’Rourke discussed the campaign manager job for 90 minutes with one strategist, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, but even on the eve of his announcement it was uncertain who would be at the helm of his organization.Yet he enjoys the support of many of Mr. Obama’s aides, some tacitly and others more full-throated, and he has relied on advice from a number of Mr. Obama’s strategists, including the 2008 campaign manager, David Plouffe. (Mr. Plouffe is not, however, planning to formally participate in the race on behalf of any candidate.)But unlike Mr. Obama, who ran in a year when the Iraq war was the single overriding policy issue in the Democratic race, Mr. O’Rourke is seeking the presidency at a moment his party is lurching left on issues across the board. He will be immediately under pressure to expand upon the sometimes-vague liberalism that has colored his public life.Already, allies of Mr. Sanders in particular have questioned Mr. O’Rourke’s commitment to progressive priorities. (Mr. O’Rourke has declined to call himself a progressive, saying he was “not big on labels.”)In 2016, he supported a centrist challenger to Nancy Pelosi to lead House Democrats. In 2018, he frustrated Texas activists by refusing to endorse Gina Ortiz Jones, a prized Democratic recruit for a House seat, because she was facing Mr. O’Rourke’s Republican friend, Representative Will Hurd, who eventually won by fewer than 1,000 votes.Mr. O’Rourke should have little trouble pulling in enough money to get a presidential campaign off the ground, though it is possible that some of his fund-raising success in 2018 owed to his opponent, Mr. Cruz, whom liberals love to loathe.Some in the party have questioned whether a Senate-race-losing candidate  should even be running for president so soon. Senate Democrats aggressively lobbied him to take on Texas’s other Republican senator, John Cornyn, who is up for re-election next year, even dispatching senior party officials to El Paso to make the case.In the months since his defeat, Mr. O’Rourke himself seemed to be casting about for answers, discussing a possible run with advisers but appearing genuinely conflicted — seeking clarity at one point by making a solo road trip to meet Americans in unrehearsed settings.On Thursday, any lingering apprehension was well concealed.“This is the moment,” he said, standing atop a coffeehouse counter in Burlington, hands flying, “for the leadership of the indispensable country.”He left little doubt which leader he had in mind for the top job."
476,"FORT DODGE, Iowa — The coffee crew at Zakeer’s still likes Steve King. They voted for him over and over and don’t believe he is a bigot. They say he’s getting a raw deal from the news media and Republicans in Washington.But here’s the thing: These rock-solid supporters of Mr. King, whose comments seeming to endorse white supremacy brought stinging rebukes from his own party leaders, are also convinced that his 16-year career in Congress representing northwest Iowa is effectively over.“I think he’s dead in the water,” said Pat Reed, a retired history teacher in a purple University of Northern Iowa sweatshirt, reacting to the news that House Republicans this week had stripped Mr. King of his positions on the Agriculture and Judiciary Committees.“I think he’s done,” echoed Ross Nemitz, the owner of Ross’s Appliance Center in Fort Dodge, a small blue-collar city in the heart of Mr. King’s district full of agribusinesses.Every rural Iowa community has its Zakeer’s, a cafe with a table of early morning regulars — a Greek chorus speaking with a collective voice on dramas playing out on the local and national stage.The men at Zakeer’s have had breakfast together for more than 20 years. They keep attendance logs and play a game of chance to see who picks up the coffee tab. (On Wednesday the loser was an out-of-town reporter.)For Mr. King, 69, losing the chorus at Zakeer’s spells deep trouble. A copy of The Des Moines Register on a table displayed a top-of-the-page headline, “House rebukes King.” It upstaged the story of Gov. Kim Reynolds’s State of the State speech.Mr. King was also the top story on WHO, a conservative talk radio station broadcasting across much of his vast, 39-county district of corn and soybean fields, whose black furrows lay under two inches of snow.John Kilmer, a retired truck-driver listening from an adjacent table, who had voted for Mr. King in the midterms, said now he must resign. “They’ve stripped him of his committees and he’s just taking up space,” he said.And it wasn’t just voters who think Mr. King’s career is nearing an end: Republican officials are already planning to move past him, and are busy recruiting and raising money for primary challengers in 2020 if he does not step down.Mr. King says he has no plans to seek “another line of work,” as Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader, recommended this week. He pushed back on Wednesday in a fund-raising letter to supporters, writing that “the unhinged Left has teamed up with Republican ‘NeverTrumpers’ and is pulling out all the stops to destroy me.”He attacked The New York Times, which published a quotation from him in an article last week that led to the firestorm in Congress.“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” Mr. King told The Times, comments he now says were taken out of context.Some longtime supporters in Mr. King’s Fourth District said that even if the nine-term congressman defiantly stays on, they will most likely back a primary challenger. Two candidates announced this week that they would jump into the race, including a prominent Republican state lawmaker, Randy Feenstra, and others are expected.The Fort Dodge Messenger, which in November endorsed Mr. King over his Democratic challenger, J.D. Scholten, issued an unusual correction on Wednesday night calling on Mr. King to resign.“It is now clear that the endorsement we made was a mistake,” the editorial board wrote. “We should have pondered more carefully King’s pattern of making outrageous statements.”There are many reasons Mr. King has been re-elected repeatedly despite years of white identity politics and demeaning comments about Hispanic immigrants, whom he has compared to dogs, dirt and drug mules “with calves the size of cantaloupes.”The most basic reason may be the deeply conservative nature of his district, where Republicans almost always triumph: President Trump carried it by 27 points. Mr. King’s conservatism on abortion and gun rights lines up with a majority of his constituents, as does his reputation as an outsider defying the party establishment.Some supporters said the rebuke by party leaders in Washington and Des Moines would only increase his appeal and backfire on those hoping he leaves Congress.“Now that they’ve stripped him of his committee assignments, I’ve seen people dig in their heels and say, ‘No, Congressman King is one of us, Congressman King is a pro-life, pro-gun, pro-conservative person, just like we are,’” said Jacob Hall, who leads an activist group, Sioux County Conservatives.Mr. Hall disputed the notion that Mr. King’s latest comments about white supremacy would move many votes one way or the other.“There’s nothing anybody is going to hear Congressman King say that’s going to change their mind about him, whether they’re a supporter or a detractor,” he said. “Our minds are made up in the Fourth District.”But the results of November’s midterms call into question that view. Mr. King barely squeaked out a three-point victory, after winning by 23 points two years earlier. His support plummeted late in the race after he endorsed a Toronto mayoral candidate with neo-Nazi ties and met with members of a far-right Austrian party accused of trivializing the Holocaust. The chairman of the House Republican election committee issued a stinging rebuke of him a week before the election, labeling him a white supremacist.Many Iowa Republican officials fear that if Mr. King is on the ballot in November 2020, he will drive up Democratic turnout, threatening other Republicans running, especially Senator Joni Ernst.“Down-ballot and up-ballot he’s definitely a liability,” said Dane Nealson, a former Republican chairman of Story County, the largest and most Democratic county in Mr. King’s district.Ms. Ernst may be vulnerable even if Mr. King is not running, after distancing herself from him only this week, as did Iowa’s senior senator, Charles E. Grassley, and Governor Reynolds. Each had spent years embracing Mr. King because they needed his conservative base of voters.“Grassley, Joni Ernst, Kim Reynolds, they could have taken a stance on this years ago,” said Troy Price, chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party. “It’s appalling; it’s a failure of leadership on their part.”Opponents of Mr. King, and even some of his supporters, have long been frustrated by the impression he gives to non-Iowans who think his 16 years in office prove that his constituents are racists.“I’m embarrassed by him,” said Amy Presler, 48, a librarian in Fort Dodge, who grew up on a farm as the youngest of 10 siblings. “I don’t want people in the nation and the world to think that Iowans are behind him and support that sort of talk. We don’t.”Mr. King’s racist remarks over the years have mainly been directed at undocumented Latino immigrants. He was years ahead of Mr. Trump in calling for a concrete border wall, in demonizing migrants as violent criminals and opposing any plan to legalize “Dreamers” as a form of amnesty.Mike McCarville, a former Fort Dodge mayor, said that when it came to the many Latinos who work in meatpacking, construction and agriculture in the region, native-born Iowans could be “two-faced.’’“All the farmers will bitch about all the Hispanics,” he said, “but they hire them and we can’t get along without them.”“If they accomplished what they say they want and just round them all up and ship them back, our economy would grind to a halt,” he added.On Monday, after House Republicans stripped Mr. King of his committee assignments, Lorena Lopez, the publisher of La Prensa, a Spanish-language newspaper in the district, received a flood of texts and emails from readers. “Every Latino knows how he has been, his negative comments especially against Latinos,” she said.The response of the Latino community, she said, has been simple: “It is about time.”Back at Zakeer’s, the coffee crew said that Mr. King’s loss of committee assignments means the Fourth District now has no seat at the table in Congress.“No matter how much you may like the guy, if that person can’t represent you as well because he’s been stripped of powers …” began Mr. Nemitz, the appliance dealer.Mr. Reed, the retired schoolteacher, finished the sentence: “Then there isn’t much sense of being there.”"
477,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning.Boeing’s decision-making processes, India’s strategically bloated budget and Apple’s impact on the Chinese economy. Here’s the latest:In 2010, Airbus announced it would introduce a more fuel-efficient version of its popular A320 jetliner. Within months, Boeing announced plans to upgrade its own 737 jets.In designing the new 737 Max, Boeing tried to avoid a complete overhaul of its systems so that it could persuade the U.S. regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, that there would be no need for expensive, time-consuming retraining for pilots.That decision appears to have left the crew of the Lion Air jet that crashed in October, killing 189 people, without a full understanding of how to respond when faulty data led the flight control system to repeatedly push the plane’s nose down.How we know: Our journalists interviewed engineers, former Boeing employees, pilots, regulators and congressional aides to understand some of the choices Boeing made as it developed the 737 Max.The central problem: The Max’s enlarged engines had to be mounted differently, which had a destabilizing effect. A new, automatic flight control system was created to counter the possibility of stalls. It’s likely the Lion Air pilots weren’t made of aware of the system — or how to handle it in an emergency.The takeaway: Safety on modern jetliners is shaped by a complex combination of factors, including fierce industry competition, technological advances and pilot training. In the rare instances when things go awry, the interplay of those factors can create unintended and potentially fatal consequences.A new pension plan for rickshaw pullers. Tax breaks for the middle class. Cash handouts for struggling farmers.These are some of the financial gifts for voters in the government’s new budget, released just a few months before elections that could unseat Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Analysis: Most analysts believe neither Mr. Modi’s party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, nor the Indian National Congress Party will win an outright majority. That means regional and caste-based parties will probably become the kingmakers, and the farmers who make up the bulk of their voters will be major beneficiaries of the new budget. There are also some sweeteners for rickshaw pullers, tea sellers and others in the informal sector that makes up another large chunk of India’s economy.Background: Mr. Modi was elected in 2014 on a campaign pledge to provide more employment opportunities, but he and his ministers are under fire, accused of trying to bury an official jobs report that showed unemployment at a 45-year high.In other India news: The country lodged a formal complaint with the American government after an undercover operation to expose immigration fraud led to the arrest of several Indian students in January.China’s factories, the manufacturers for the world, now meet domestic demand, too. And so they’re more vulnerable to the country’s weakening consumer demand and broader economic slowdown, made worse by China’s trade war with the U.S.We looked closely at Huojiancun, an area at the edge of glittering Shanghai where factory workers assemble Apple iPhones. Their dwindling paychecks aren’t just weakening their prospects but also the economic microcosm that emerged around them — a bustling night market and food stands.Impact: The cycle is worsening China’s economic slowdown, which has posed a major challenge for Beijing and could put it at a disadvantage in the trade war with President Trump.In January, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe boasted that 67 percent of women in Japan were working, an all-time high.But many are stuck in limited roles in the workplace, unable to advance in part because of rigid gender expectations that shoulder them with most of the domestic work.By the numbers: Women who work more than 49 hours a week do 25 hours of housework a week, according to an analysis of government numbers. Their husbands put in an average of less than five hours at home — among the lowest rates in the developed world. As a result, almost half of the country’s working women are employed part time, and more than half are on temporary contracts.Why it matters: Mr. Abe has prioritized what he calls “womenomics” to help boost Japan’s slowing economy, and analysts say that helping women reach higher-level jobs would help the country’s severe labor shortage. But cultural norms stand in the way.State of the Union: President Trump will deliver his yearly address to Congress on Tuesday night in Washington. Immigration, a topic that has led to weeks of political impasse, will be a main theme, the White House said.In the Oval Office: In an interview with our reporters last week, Mr. Trump said he had all but given up negotiating over his border wall and would most likely take action on his own. The Times’s publisher, A. G. Sulzberger, took the lead in questioning the president about his attacks on the press, noting that foreign leaders were increasingly using the term “fake news” to justify suppressing independent scrutiny.Australia: The government said the last remaining refugee children on the Pacific island of Nauru would be resettled in the U.S. — a milestone victory for lawyers, doctors and migrant advocates who have been raising the alarm about Australia’s offshore detention centers.Pope Francis: The pope arrived in the United Arab Emirates for a three-day visit, becoming the first pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church to visit the Arabian Peninsula. Here’s why his trip matters.Blackwater’s founder: A company owned by Erik Prince, who created the security contracting firm Blackwater, announced that it had struck a deal to build a training camp in the Chinese region of Xinjiang. Asked about the deal, Mr. Prince said he had “no knowledge” of it, and the announcement was removed from the company’s website.Deutsche Bank: In 2016, the German bank rejected a loan request from Donald Trump, which he had sought for work on his golf property in Scotland, judging that his divisive presidential campaign made him much too risky a client.El Chapo: Two days before jurors were set to begin deliberations in the trial of the drug lord Joaquín Guzmán Loera, prosecutors unsealed secret documents in which an associate said Mr. Guzmán routinely raped girls as young as 13 years old, sometimes by drugging them.Philippines: Five soldiers and three members of Abu Sayyaf, an Islamic State-affiliated militant group, were killed in a gunfight on the southern island of Jolo, six days after a church bombing linked to the same group.South Korea: A court in Seoul sentenced a former presidential candidate, Ahn Hee-jung, to three and a half years in prison for sexual assault, making him among the best known public figures to be felled by the country’s growing #MeToo movement.Britain: A woman in London was found guilty of the genital mutilation of her 3-year-old daughter. She is the first person to be convicted since the practice was banned in the country in 1985.Antarctica: Scientists discovered a gaping cavity in a vast glacier, caused by warming waters, that could speed up its decay.

Often they felt an unspoken greater mission to break the constraints society placed on their race.”The project was created in partnership with Past Tense, a new team at The Times that is delving into our archives to bring to life compelling stories from our past.

478,"In his first State of the Union address last year, President Trump outlined his vision for an “America first” approach to overhauling the immigration system, revitalizing manufacturing and prioritizing national interests abroad. As Mr. Trump prepares to deliver his second address on Tuesday, which is also expected to highlight the president’s immigration agenda, here’s an assessment of his progress on the promises he made last year. Attempts to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul failed in Congress, with proposals backed by the White House receiving the least support.The “four pillars” Mr. Trump described are providing a pathway to citizenship for the young immigrants known as Dreamers, building a wall on the southern border, ending the “diversity lottery” visa program and limiting family-based immigration.In February 2018, the Senate rejected three immigration bills. The White House plan, which met all four of Mr. Trump’s requirements, received the fewest votes. The two other bills did not fulfill all the requirements. In June, the House rejected another bill that included the four pillars as well as a more hard-line measure that did not provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, who were brought to the country illegally as children.And Mr. Trump’s address this year comes after a 35-day government shutdown, the longest ever, over the president’s demand for border wall funding. Toyota and Mazda broke ground on their $1.6 billion joint venture in Alabama in November. Chrysler had announced that it would move production of heavy-duty pickups — not the plant itself — from Mexico to Michigan, but has since paused those plans.A database maintained by the Reshoring Initiative, a group that encourages companies to move back to the United States, listed plans by Chevrolet to expand car battery production in Michigan, Ford’s unveiling of a 3-D printing operation in the state and the opening of a new factory in Ohio by a Japanese company that makes prototype parts. But no other company has announced or opened a new assembly plant in the United States. In contrast, General Motors said it would idle five car factories. New rules for automakers in the successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement would require automakers to eventually produce 75 percent — up from 62.5 percent — of a vehicle’s content in North America to qualify for zero tariffs. But the deal still awaits congressional ratification. And the changes would do little to encourage investment in the United States since “most vehicles are going to be able to get over those new thresholds pretty easily,” said Kristin Dziczek, vice president for industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.Even if the administration raised tariffs on foreign car imports, spurring investment in the United States, automakers would still be mindful of the volatility of Mr. Trump’s trade policies and “investment would sit on the sidelines,” Ms. Dziczek said.Employment in the auto industry has increased slightly under Mr. Trump’s watch, to about one million in November 2018 from 955,800 in January 2017. The number of vehicles manufactured in the United States has continued to decline, even after a slight uptick last summer. According to the Reshoring Initiative, announcements to increase investment or move companies back to the United States peaked in 2016.Mr. Trump has renegotiated Nafta and a bilateral trade deal with South Korea.While the changes to the South Korea agreement were modest, the revised Nafta strengthens intellectual property rights in Canada. An investigation into China’s trade practices concluded that Beijing had, among other unfair trade practices, violated American intellectual property rights. As a result, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese products. The two sides are in talks over a trade deal to resolve the dispute.Mr. Trump signed “Right to Try” legislation into law in May, allowing terminally ill patients to seek access to experimental medicine that is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.A similar program known as compassionate use, or expanded access, has been in place since the 1970s, and the F.D.A. says it authorizes 99 percent of the requests it receives. The new law allows patients, with the approval of their doctor, to ask drug companies directly for access, rather than wait for approval by the agency.Drug prices are still increasing, albeit at lower rates than in previous years.An Associated Press analysis found that from January to July 2018, drug companies raised prices on more than 4,400 products, with a median increase of 5.2 percent. That was lower than the median increase of 8 percent for the same period in 2017. Drug prices have continued to increase on hundreds of medicines this year.No comprehensive bill has emerged since Mr. Trump nudged Congress to act.A detailed version of Mr. Trump’s proposal, released by the White House in February 2018, pledged $200 billion in federal funding (less than half of what the Trump transition team promised in December 2016). The money would come from savings from other cuts in the federal budget, according to the White House, and would spur states and private companies to invest $1.5 trillion in infrastructure over the next decade.Yet Congress has not passed any bill that would make good on this $200 billion proposal. Draft legislation to temporarily increase the gas tax to shore up the Highway Trust Fund was never formalized or voted on.Mr. Trump signed an executive order in May making it easier to fire government employees, but a federal judge struck down most of its provisions. A similar bill was introduced in the House but did not advance to a vote.While Congress has not yet repealed the defense sequester limiting military spending, lawmakers effectively ignored it and increased funding last year.The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposes caps on federal spending for the next decade, to compel Congress to find savings in the budget. If lawmakers do not reduce spending, “sequestration” kicks in and enforces the caps. Later spending deals raised the caps, limiting military spending to $549 billion in the 2018 fiscal year and $562 billion in the 2019 fiscal year.Mr. Trump signed legislation that allotted the Pentagon $629 billion and $647 billion in 2018 and 2019 fiscal years, far exceeding the spending limits. (Those figures do not include a separate Pentagon account for war spending.)While the sequester is still in place for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years, it is not difficult to imagine lawmakers and the president continuing to raise the cap — rendering the sequester moot.Congress ignored Mr. Trump’s calls to drastically reduce foreign aid, instead approving budgets that included billions more than the president had requested, and made no significant changes to foreign aid policy.Sarah Rose, an analyst at the Center for Global Development, said the administration had been constrained by Congress — and its own “fundamental inconsistency” in funneling money to friends and allies while simultaneously giving aid to countries that might not otherwise receive it in order to counter China’s influence. Mr. Trump has threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries over migrant caravans, and Nikki R. Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations, had proposed making aid contingent on support for American-backed policies at the United Nations.Yet the amount of assistance given to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador has been typical. And while the United States did end funding for Palestinian refugees in August, it did not follow through on withholding aid from countries that voted for a United Nations resolution condemning Mr. Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, said Jeremy Konyndyk, a former director of the foreign disaster assistance program at the United States Agency for International Development.“The issue is that he made a promise that was well beyond his ability to accomplish,” Mr. Konyndyk said. “The president is not a monarch and can’t just do things unilaterally.”"
479,"Beto O’Rourke has driven alone across the plains, straining to find his emotional bearings — or at least a Pancake House in Liberal, Kan. He has collected an “El Pasoan of the Year” award, before a modest audience, and smiled coyly through an interview with Oprah Winfrey, before a bigger one.He has surfaced on college campuses, to listen to students; at a Metallica concert, to listen to Metallica; and at the premiere of a documentary about his star-making Senate run in Texas at the South by Southwest festival, to listen to himself on screen.He has journaled extensively.“We’re in this together, like it or not,” Mr. O’Rourke wrote, summarizing the lessons of his recent solo travels in one of several stream-of-consciousness online posts. “The alternative is to be in this apart, and that would be hell.”As the Democratic presidential field takes final shape, Mr. O’Rourke seems inclined to be in this, according to interviews with people who have spoken to him and other top Democrats. He says he has made a decision about whether to run and could announce it as early as this week, unsettling prospective rival campaigns that consider Mr. O’Rourke a credible threat.Yet in the four months since his Senate loss, Mr. O’Rourke, 46, has done little to demonstrate the kind of intensive preparation — building national political infrastructure, projecting a signature policy rationale for a candidacy — typically associated with a top-flight presidential campaign.There has been no flirtation tour in Iowa, no trip to New Hampshire since his college years as an Ivy League rower. Mr. O’Rourke had no traditional campaign-in-waiting at the ready after the midterms — the sort of operation available to a more experienced holdout like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. or carefully built over months by first-time presidential candidates like Senators Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris.Few doubt Mr. O’Rourke’s capacity to upend the race regardless, buoyed by a talent for relentless retail politics, a formidable low-dollar fund-raising army and an unsubtle contrast to front-runners in their 70s, like Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.He also can count on help from several veterans of former President Barack Obama’s campaigns. One of them, Paul Tewes, Mr. Obama’s 2008 Iowa state director, has been helping to plan Mr. O’Rourke’s candidacy, according to three Democrats familiar with the effort, and Mr. O’Rourke is expected to appear in Iowa this weekend to campaign for a local candidate in an upcoming special election.[Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.]But perhaps no major 2020 player invites as many question marks as Mr. O’Rourke, and his drawn-out non-candidacy has provided few answers:Is this the moment for a relatively untested white male in a party eager to elevate female and nonwhite voices in the quest to dethrone President Trump?Can Mr. O’Rourke scale up to a national campaign without losing the intimate, semi-improvisational feel of his perpetually live-streamed Senate bid?And in a primary where some top candidates have already sought to establish progressive litmus tests on key issues, what does Mr. O’Rourke actually believe?“He’s still an open book,” said Maurice Mitchell, national director for the Working Families Party. “He sort of catapulted himself into the national spotlight without answering a lot of questions about where he stands.”Amanda Litman, a Democratic strategist who worked for Hillary Clinton in 2016, wondered aloud if Mr. O’Rourke would be considered a top-tier candidate “if he wasn’t a handsome young white man.”“He’s certainly effective at communicating the values behind a policy,” she said, “but that may not cut it in a primary where we all share the same values and are debating the execution on those values.”Mr. O’Rourke has betrayed little concern about catering to his left flank. People close to him say a central takeaway from speaking to disparate audiences in recent months is that voters are far less ideological than some in the party might believe — supplying an opening, Mr. O’Rourke senses, for a unifying figure in a bog of partisan warriors.[Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager in 2016, said that Mr. O’Rourke stands apart as a politician who can “drive his own news,” independent of Mr. Trump, alluding to his history of social media-ready flourishes on the campaign trail.“It’s not just a matter of being authentic,” Mr. Mook said. “It’s authentically taking on Trump and challenging political norms.”Still, most candidates considered to be top 2020 contenders tend to check at least one of the following three boxes: a firm policy bedrock anchoring their campaigns, like the economic platforms of Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren; the potential to make history, like Ms. Harris or her female Senate peers in the field; or deep experience and national standing, like Mr. Biden.Mr. O’Rourke would appear to satisfy none of these descriptions, though his instinct for viral internet ubiquity and generational uplift may amount to its own category.His fans compare him to Mr. Obama or the Kennedys — a font of rangy inspiration — rarely dwelling on his record. But Mr. O’Rourke would enter the race without a signal achievement over six years as an El Paso congressman, nor an obvious big-ticket policy idea that might animate his bid.In public settings of late, Mr. O’Rourke has placed immigration, education and especially climate change at the center of his remarks, which tend to focus most on a high-minded-but-vague message of uniting a divided nation. Perhaps mindful of this reputation, he has recently unveiled multi-point plans on immigration and criminal justice reform. Both sketch out ideas he has largely outlined before.Friends say he has cycled through a number of policy passions through the years — marijuana legalization, advocacy for veterans, rural hospital access — often prompted by insights from the people he meets.“It’s the time that calls his issues,” said Steve Ortega, a friend who served on the El Paso City Council with him.Mr. O’Rourke spent much of the last two months of 2018 finishing his work in Congress, condensing his preparation period even more tightly. In recent weeks, though, he has done some of the more typical work of a politician considering a run for president: conferring with longtime staff and others who he hopes might join his cause; speaking to key groups, like a conference of Hispanic leaders in Chicago and gun control advocates in his hometown; headlining a rally to counter Mr. Trump’s call for a border wall when the president appeared in El Paso.But his indecisiveness has compelled some veteran Democratic aides who admire him to accept positions with other candidates. Several people who have spoken to his team came away questioning whether Mr. O’Rourke was thoroughly prepared for the crush of a national race. Some suggested he lacked detailed plans like a comprehensive strategy for amassing delegates. (Mr. O’Rourke and his advisers have, however, spoken to campaign veterans with experience in managing the delegate process about possibly joining his team, according to a person familiar with the discussions.)Unlike other candidates who recruited staff members over the past year with a wink and a nod — all but sure that they would enter the race — Mr. O’Rourke was still conveying uncertainty as recently as last month, according to the people who spoke to him.Since then, he has sounded firmer.“I think he feels his time is now,” said Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, who met with Mr. O’Rourke at length recently.Ms. Weingarten, speaking with Mr. O’Rourke and his wife, Amy, in El Paso, raised the possibility of Mr. O’Rourke’s challenging Senator John Cornyn in 2020.Texas Democrats have prodded him on this score as well, but few expect Mr. O’Rourke to confine his ambitions to another state-level race. After prolific success with small-dollar donors during the midterms, Mr. O’Rourke is likely to have little trouble raising enough money to get a presidential run off the ground. His presence could energize some crucial voting blocs, like young people, who formed much of his coalition in Texas.“If he got in, it would be a pretty big game-changer,” said Eliana Locke, who leads the College Democrats at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where Mr. O’Rourke met with students last month.Supporters also say it is laughable that some liberals, particularly allies of Mr. Sanders, have described Mr. O’Rourke as a squishy moderate because of a congressional record that sometimes veered toward centrism.More recently, Mr. O’Rourke moved well to the left of many 2018 Democrats by raising the prospect of impeaching Mr. Trump; argued for the destruction of existing border barriers between El Paso and Mexico; and, in perhaps his most widely seen social media moment, defended the professional football players who were kneeling in protest during the national anthem.“In Texas, Ted Cruz called me a socialist. I’m too liberal for Texas,” Mr. O’Rourke told the students in Wisconsin. “Outside of Texas, people say, ‘Is he really a Democrat? I think he’s a closet Republican.’ I don’t know where I am on a spectrum, and I almost could care less. I just want to get to better things for this country.”Mr. Ortega, the friend from the City Council, suggested that part of Mr. O’Rourke’s appeal owes to his self-awareness on matters of substance: He knows what he doesn’t know and is unafraid to concede that a question extends beyond his expertise.“He’s not the kind of guy who’s going to give you a made-up, half-baked answer,” Mr. Ortega said.For now, supporters would settle for the fully baked answer he is keeping to himself: Is he in or out?"
480,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)President Trump said on Thursday that he had all but given up negotiating with Congress to fund a wall on the southwestern border, suggesting that he planned to declare a national emergency to build it instead.Mr. Trump made the remarks in an interview with The Times, during which he also dismissed the investigations that have dogged his presidency, expressed optimism about reaching a trade deal with China and denied being at odds with his intelligence chiefs.Here are five takeaways from the interview, and excerpts from the conversation.Fact check: We assessed the president’s statements about trade, the military and the flow of drugs at the border with Mexico.Background: The interview was arranged after Mr. Trump invited A. G. Sulzberger, the publisher of The Times, to an off-the-record dinner. Mr. Sulzberger declined, saying he would prefer an on-the-record interview that included two Times reporters. The Daily: Today’s episode is about a discussion of the media during Thursday’s interview.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the suspension of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty this morning, based on the long-running accusation that Moscow is violating its terms. Russia has likewise accused the U.S. of breaking the accord. American officials expect a full withdrawal from the treaty after six months. Starting on Saturday, the U.S. would be free to begin testing or deploying its own weapons.Background: The I.N.F. was long considered a model arms control treaty, banning an entire category of weapons deployed in the 1980s. But China was not a signatory, and the treaty’s terms prevented the U.S. from countering its growing nuclear arsenal.Bitter temperatures are expected to loosen their grip on the Midwest today, as the dangerously cold weather system that has disrupted life in the region heads toward the East Coast. On Thursday, a temperature of minus 38 was recorded in Illinois. If confirmed, it would be a record low for the state.Notable: At least 21 deaths have been attributed to the cold, including that of a student at the University of Iowa who was found unconscious outside a campus building.The Super Bowl on Sunday between the Los Angeles Rams and the New England Patriots follows a season in which the league’s TV ratings rebounded after dropping the previous two years.Plenty of dangers remain — including a concussion crisis and dwindling attendance —  but new stars and fewer off-the-field controversies have helped the N.F.L. renew its popularity.The details: The game starts at 6:30 p.m. Eastern on Sunday. Our writer picks the Rams to win, but it’s hard to bet against Tom Brady, the Patriots quarterback, who’ll be starting his ninth Super Bowl. You can follow our live coverage of the Super Bowl here.Another angle: The Rams’ Sean McVay, 33, is the youngest head coach in Super Bowl history. The rest of the league has rushed to replicate his success.She’s been a punch line for most of her adult life, after she cut off her husband’s penis 26 years ago. But few asked what made her do it. Lorena Gallo, as she is now known, talked to our reporter about the rest of the story, one of a young immigrant who snapped after enduring years of domestic violence. A strong jobs report: The U.S. economy added 304,000 jobs in January, the Labor Department reported today. Analysts had been uncertain about the effects of the monthlong partial government shutdown and had expected a gain of only 172,000 jobs.The 2020 election: Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey announced today that he is running for president, joining the increasingly crowded Democratic field. A bipartisan rebuke: The Senate voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to advance legislation drafted by Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, to express strong opposition to President Trump’s withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Syria and Afghanistan. Fix for iPhones: Apple said on Friday that it would release a software update next week to repair a security flaw that allowed one iPhone user to eavesdrop on another through the FaceTime app. Apple-Facebook dispute: Apple restored access to its internal apps for Facebook’s 35,000 workers on Thursday, after cutting it off for two days over a violation of Apple’s rules. The spat underscored the tensions between two tech giants. Clarity on Trump Tower calls: Phone calls that Donald Trump Jr. received from a blocked number around the time of a 2016 meeting with Russians were from family friends, not his father, according to evidence obtained by Senate investigators. There have long been questions about whether President Trump knew about the meeting.India’s economy: Months before a general election, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was accused on Thursday of suppressing an official report said to show the unemployment rate at a 45-year high. Mr. Modi’s popularity has rested in part on his promises to make India an economic powerhouse. Snapshot: Above, the funeral service for Kim Bok-dong in Seoul, South Korea, today. Ms. Kim, a former sex slave for the Japanese military during World War II, helped bring international attention to the suffering of thousands of women like her. She died on Monday at 92.News quiz: Did you follow the headlines this week? Test yourself.Late-night comedy: Jimmy Kimmel was puzzled by the possibility that President Trump would divert disaster aid to a border wall: “Sometimes I’m kind of amazed he only bankrupted three casinos.”What we’re listening to: “The Shining 2:37 Podcast.” Our culture editor, Gilbert Cruz, writes: “If you know a little about Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 horror classic, you know that Room 237 is where the really bad things happen in the Overlook Hotel. This podcast offers the deepest of dives — each episode deconstructs a 2 minute and 37 second chunk of the film.”Cook: End the week with a glass of red wine and an Italian-American classic: pasta alla vodka.Read: Our editors recommend 10 new books, including a memoir of obesity and weight loss.Watch: Natasha Lyonne’s new Netflix show, “Russian Doll,” is a gritty take on “Groundhog Day,” with a nihilistic New Yorker repeating her birthday party.Listen: Florence and the Machine has released a yin-yang pair of new songs. Are you in the mood for room-shaking rock-soul (“Moderation”) or a decorous piano waltz (“Haunted House”)?Smarter Living: Unplugging your DVR, or trading it in to stream with apps, is one way to cut your electric bill. DVRs are enormous power drainers; as of 2017, set-top boxes in the U.S. were using about seven large power plants’ worth of electricity each year. App-based services use far less.We also have ideas for how to spend less when you’re on the road.On this day in 1786, a Briton living in India delivered a discourse on a little-known proposition: that Sanskrit, Persian, Latin, Greek and other languages might have a common source.The commentary set off the field of comparative linguistics. Its fruits are known today as the concept of Proto-Indo-European, a mother language for dozens of tongues. The idea revolutionized not only the study of language, but also the sense of human history.The man who delivered the talk, Sir William Jones, was, predictably, a student of languages and culture. Less predictably, he was in India because he was also a legal expert — the same reason he ultimately became convinced of his theory.He arrived many decades before the Raj, or British government rule. The British East India Company was increasing its control over territories where it had long traded. Some of the company’s officials wanted British justices like Jones to supervise the administration of Indian courts; translations from Sanskrit to English were crucial to that effort.Jones’s work with translators enabled his remarkable insights."
481,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. The F.B.I. opened an inquiry into whether President Trump was secretly working with Russia after he fired James Comey as F.B.I. director, according to former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation.The inquiry carried explosive implications. Counterintelligence investigators had to consider whether the president’s own actions constituted a possible threat to national security.The special counsel, Robert Mueller, took over the inquiry when he was appointed days after F.B.I. officials opened it. The investigation also had a criminal aspect, which has long been publicly known: whether Mr. Trump’s firing of Mr. Comey constituted obstruction of justice.The inquiry into Mr. Trump is part of Mr. Mueller’s broader examination of how Russia interfered in the 2016 election and whether any Trump associates conspired. It is unclear whether Mr. Mueller is still pursuing the counterintelligence matter.No evidence has emerged publicly that Mr. Trump was secretly in contact with or took direction from Russian government officials.2. At midnight, the partial government shutdown became the longest in American history.Our White House correspondents analyzed the mood in Washington.Officially, Republicans blame Democrats. Privately, many concede, the stalemate over President Trump’s demand for a border wall has been made exponentially worse by how the White House played its cards on Capitol Hill, where two years of contradictory statements and actions have built up a profound lack of trust.“It’s always difficult when the person you’re negotiating with changes their mind — including my wife,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas._____3. The shutdown is being felt by Americans in widely varying ways, hitting some hard and missing others completely.“It has been terrible,” said Andrea Caviedes, a single mother who is furloughed from the Agriculture Department. “My rent bill is due, my electric bill is due, my water bill is due, and I have medical expenses.” Ms. Caviedes, above right, serves on her church’s stage production team in her spare time.To her friend Ximena Gumpel, it’s a blip on the nightly news: “You kind of push it aside and figure it will pass, that it’s just political bickering,” she said.The partial shutdown is starting to affect air travel as a growing number of security agents are refusing to work for no pay. Another industry being held hostage by the shutdown: craft brewing._____4. The U.S. began withdrawing equipment from Syria — but no troops yet — as part of President Trump’s order to wind down military operations there.Officials said the number of American troops might actually increase in Syria, to help protect the final withdrawal — an operation that is still expected to take at least four to six months. Above, a convoy of U.S. military vehicles in Syria in December.As recently as Sunday, the White House national security adviser, John Bolton, said the pullout was conditional. Then early Friday, a vaguely worded statement from the American military headquarters in Baghdad said the withdrawal process had begun.The surprise announcement came amid continuing confusion over plans to disengage from one of the Middle East’s most complex conflicts._____5. An 18-year-old woman who fled Saudi Arabia fearing for her life has been granted asylum in Canada, officials said.Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, 18, above right, had rallied support from an airport hotel room in Thailand to avoid being deported, saying she feared that her relatives might kill her.The phenomenon of women trying to flee Saudi Arabia is not new. But the number of young women considering and taking the enormous risk appears to have grown in recent years, rights groups say, as women frustrated by social and legal constraints at home turn to social media to help plan, and sometimes document, their efforts to escape.In Saudi Arabia, all women are required to have a male guardian, whose permission they need to get married, travel and undergo some medical procedures. “It is male guardianship that made us flee from Saudi Arabia,” said one woman who ran away as a teenager. “That is the biggest reason that the girls flee.”_____6. Poland has arrested two telecommunications executives, including a Chinese employee of Huawei, and charged them with spying for Beijing.The arrest of the Huawei employee is almost certain to escalate tensions between Western countries and China over the company, which the authorities in the United States have accused of acting as an arm of the Chinese government and making equipment designed for spying.In December, the daughter of Huawei’s founder was arrested in Canada at the request of the U.S. It was unclear whether the arrests in Poland had been requested by the U.S., but a senior Western diplomat said the Justice Department had been working with the Polish government.Huawei has long denied spying for the Chinese government._____7. A 13-year-old girl who disappeared the same night her parents were shot to death in rural Wisconsin was found alive, three months after their murder.Jayme Closs, above, escaped from the home where she had been held and was found wandering on a road by a passer-by in Gordon, Wis., on Thursday afternoon. Jake Patterson, 21, was being held pending formal charges of murder and kidnapping, the authorities said, adding that “the suspect had planned his actions.”The murder case and Jayme’s disappearance set off waves of fear and speculation around the small town of Barron and drew national attention. Jayme’s name topped the F.B.I.’s missing persons list._____8. “Our city is Latino and we bring our cultures with us from other countries.”There are 50,000 street vendors in Los Angeles, according to official estimates, and selling on the city’s sidewalks is often the first profession for newly arrived immigrants.But for over a century, sidewalk vending has been officially forbidden and many on the streets faced crackdowns. Now, as part of California’s push to protect undocumented immigrants, Los Angeles has legalized the trade.One vendor told us the change acknowledged the contributions of immigrants. Follow our reporter and explore the neighborhood vendors of a changing city._____9. Did Fortnite steal the Floss?That’s the question before a federal court reviewing complaints from three performers who say the video game used their signature dance moves without their permission.The survival game is free to download, but players purchase add-ons as they go along, including a rotating offering of dance moves called “emotes.”Among the moves in question are an enthusiastic arm-swinging motion that looks just like the Floss, above, created by a teenager called Backpack Kid, and a snappy number called Fresh that’s uncannily like the Carlton Dance from “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.”_____10. Female ranchers are reclaiming the American West.As men leave animal agriculture for less gritty work, more ranches are being led by women — with new ideas about technology, ecology and the land. For some women, it’s about turning tradition on its head. For Native American women, it’s a return to the natural order.“We are a matriarchal society, always have been,” said one member of the Lakota Nation.Above, Caitlyn Taussig and her mother, Vicki Taussig, mending fences on their ranch in Kremmling, Colo.Meanwhile, our graphic journalist talked to a bootmaker in Spring City, Utah, about what goes into a $4,500 pair of handmade boots. They take months, even years, to make._____11. Finally, we end the week with a little bit of magic.After decades of performing on television in Ecuador, the renowned magician Olmedo Renteria — aka Olmedini El Mago — moved to New York City to make his mark. Now he showcases his talents to audiences commuting on the city’s subways.Mr. Renteria, 78 and blind since a stroke a decade ago, usually works the subway for four hours with help from an assistant. While performing his routine, he likes to punctuate tricks by singing out the opening bars of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony.Have a marvelous weekend.Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

482,"Good Tuesday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.The Justice Department partly unsealed a pair of indictments yesterday that accuse the Chinese telecommunications firm of trying to steal trade secrets, evade economic sanctions on Iran and obstruct a criminal investigation into its behavior.The context: The charges come as officials from Beijing and Washington prepare to continue trade negotiations and as the Trump administration tries to shoulder Huawei out of international efforts to build the next generation of wireless networks, known as 5G. The company has denied the claims; a spokesman for China’s industry and information technology ministry called them “unfair and immoral.”The allegations: The U.S. says that Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei, participated in a plot to defraud four large banks into clearing millions of dollars in transactions with Iran in violation of international sanctions. American officials say that Huawei tried to impede their investigation by destroying evidence and by moving employees out of the U.S. to prevent them from being called as witnesses. The company, prosecutors say, also stole information about a phone-testing robot called Tappy from T-Mobile facilities in Washington state and encouraged employees to steal other confidential information from competitors.What now: Matthew Whitaker, the acting attorney general, said that the U.S. government wants to have Ms. Meng extradited from Canada, where she was detained last year at Washington’s request and where officials are now on tricky political turf trying to balance American and Chinese interests. The tussle has the industry on edge; an internal assessment from Deutsche Telekom concluded that the 5G rollout in Europe would be delayed by at least two years and cost billions of euros if governments banned Huawei, whose technology underpins much of the current network infrastructure.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________The Huawei charges will complicate negotiations on Wednesday that were already expected to be tense.A delegation of dozens of Chinese representatives led by Vice Premier Liu He will meet near the White House with a group headed by Robert Lighthizer, President Trump’s top trade negotiator, and Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary. On Thursday, Mr. Liu is expected to meet with Mr. Trump.Mr. Mnuchin said there had been “significant movement” on talks that involved “very complicated issues,” including intellectual property protections and questions of enforcement. The Chinese may offer to increase their purchases of U.S. farm products and energy, and slightly change their industrial policies, while pushing back on demands to eliminate subsidies to favored industries.The parties have until early March to reach an agreement, or else risk an escalation in the trade conflict.Mr. Trump is being pressured by the markets and the corporate sector to deliver a deal. A recent survey found that his trade policies had led more than a third of American manufacturers to raise prices.

Investors, executives and analysts nervous about signs of weakness in the economy are grasping for details about the labor market, inflation and business spending. And when the Federal Reserve’s policymaking group meets starting today, it will be missing some of its customary guides.Howard Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks, told Andrew yesterday that he was not fazed by criticism that his potential presidential bid as an independent could strengthen President Trump’s chances for re-election.“Nobody wants to see Donald Trump removed from office more than me,” Mr. Schultz said at an event in a Barnes & Noble bookstore in New York to kick off his national book tour.Responding to critics: Mr. Trump said in an early morning tweet that Mr. Schultz did not have the “guts” to run, a taunt that Mr. Schultz called “childish.” Michael Bloomberg, another possible presidential contender, condemned independent bids.Hecklers in the crowd: “Don’t help elect Trump,” yelled one protester, who was escorted out of the event in New York. Mr. Schultz was interrupted a second time by a man who chanted, “Health care is a human right.”More: Bill Burton, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, pushed back against criticism over his decision to join Mr. Schultz’s team. And the harsh response on social media to a potential Schultz candidacy could affect the Starbucks brand, according to the Washington Post.Carlos Ghosn, the global auto chief indicted on charges of financial wrongdoing, remains consigned to a small cell after a Tokyo court again denied his bail request.

483,"ANTELOPE WELLS, N.M. — The Border Patrol’s tiny base in the southwest corner of New Mexico is so remote that the wind howls through the surrounding basin where mountain lions still stalk their prey.But that hasn’t stopped thousands of Central Americans from journeying in recent weeks to the rural outpost and other isolated points along the Southwest border, launching increasingly desperate bids for asylum in the United States.In a two-day span in January, 362 migrants surrendered to the Border Patrol in Antelope Wells, overwhelming the small base’s capacity to process asylum requests. Last week, a new group of 306 migrants arrived at the same location, including children in need of immediate medical care — a situation officials in New Mexico say is without precedent.Prompting these trips to ever-more-remote border locations are not only the nearly 700 miles of border wall and fencing built since 2006, but the Trump administration’s increasingly rigid immigration policies aimed at deterring the flow of migrant families, mostly from Central America, that have streamed in from Mexico since 2014.Over the past year, the government has limited the number of asylum seekers who are allowed to present their cases each day at certain ports of entry, stationed agents on bridges to turn asylum seekers away and launched tear gas at migrants attempting to cross the border near San Diego.The administration went even further last week, announcing that it would start requiring some asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their applications are processed, which can take years. Officials plan to implement the new policy at the San Ysidro border crossing near San Diego before expanding it to crossings in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.Taken together, these moves effectively have forced some Central American migrants to wait for months to apply for asylum, sometimes sleeping on the street or in crowded shelters in Mexican border cities.Frustrated and increasingly desperate, thousands of families have lately been opting to pay smugglers to take them to remote border stations where they can surrender quickly to American officials and hope to be allowed to remain in the United States while their asylum claims are processed.In December, which saw a record number of families arriving at the border, 27,518 migrants traveling in families were apprehended in areas outside normal border stations. The El Paso sector, which includes the suddenly busy area of rural New Mexico, saw a 1,866 percent increase in family apprehensions during October and November of 2018, compared with the same period a year earlier.Pushing migrants toward remote desert locations puts them at higher risk of dehydration, heatstroke or hypothermia. Most are choosing the more dangerous crossing routes because they have been foreclosed from seeking asylum at the more widely traveled border crossings, said Fernando Garcia, director of the Border Network for Human Rights in El Paso. “How else to explain the desperation of thousands of people making it to the middle of nowhere just so they can surrender to Border Patrol?”Trump administration officials have argued that the new policies are an attempt to discourage migrants from even attempting the dangerous trips through Mexico where they are especially vulnerable to extortion and human trafficking. Officials contend that existing legislation encourages parents to bring children along on the journey.Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, laid blame on the federal government having to comply with the Flores agreement, a 1997 legal settlement aimed at preventing lengthy detentions of migrant children, and subsequent legislation codifying parts of the settlement into federal law.“We continue to call on Congress to address this humanitarian and security crisis that entices smugglers to bring families across the border,” Ms. Waldman said.Border Patrol officials have put forward various theories about why crossings at remote locations are climbing that have nothing to do with the administration’s policies. Kevin McAleenan, commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said in a conference call with reporters in December that smugglers could be trying to hold down the transit fees they pay to other criminal organizations with sway in northern Mexico by dropping migrants near remote locations like Antelope Wells.In an interview in El Paso, Jose Romero, a supervisory agent in the Border Patrol’s sector that oversees operations in New Mexico, offered another explanation, claiming that Mexican cannabis smugglers were trying to distract agents in the field by flooding remote stations with asylum seekers.“Our adversary is no idiot,” Mr. Romero said, adding that while agents were arresting 247 migrants in Antelope Wells one January day, traffickers were trying to smuggle hundreds of pounds of marijuana across the border in another location. “Now they know where our weak spots are,” he said.The administration has not been unmindful of the hazards of migrants venturing into little-traveled regions. Partly in an attempt to deter such crossings and what government officials describe as “meritless” asylum claims, the administration tried last year to refuse to accept asylum applications from anyone who had not entered the country at a legal border crossing, but that policy was blocked by the courts. And Antelope Wells, though remote, is a legal border crossing.Just how dangerous such crossings are became apparent in December, when Jakelin Caal Maquin, a 7-year-old girl from Guatemala, died in United States custody after she and her father crossed the border in a group of 163 migrants that surrendered to agents at Antelope Wells. Only a few weeks later, an 8-year-old boy from Guatemala, Felipe Gómez Alonzo, died after crossing the border about three miles west of the Paso Del Norte port of entry in El Paso.But the numbers have only continued to grow. Since the start of the 2019 fiscal year, the Border Patrol said, it has found at least 24 groups of 100 or more migrants that had crossed around the Bootheel, the sparsely populated area where New Mexico’s border with Mexico dips southward like a cowboy boot’s heel.At the end of a 45-mile road from the decaying hamlet of Hachita that runs through grazing lands dotted with creosote bushes, the Border Patrol has maintained a small presence at Antelope Wells for decades. A sign says the base is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The population of Antelope Wells, once 2, sometimes soars all the way into the high single digits when more than a handful of agents are deployed here for weeklong assignments.At another remote point to the west in Arizona, the Border Patrol reported that 376 migrants had tunneled through the sandy soil under the border fence near Yuma, earlier this month and then surrendered to agents. The group, which included dozens of children, ranks among the largest groups of families and unaccompanied children ever arrested on the border with Mexico.Immigration activists say the increase in remote crossings is just the latest development in a decades-long effort to push immigration out of urban areas, tracing back at least to Operation Blockade, a Clinton administration initiative in 1993 to curb unauthorized crossings in the city of El Paso. Border fencing erected in Southern California and Arizona in recent years drove some of the biggest migration flows toward the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, where the river marks the border and many migrants are able to cross with a short boat ride.Busy border crossings like the one in McAllen, Tex., now have relatively elaborate infrastructure set up to handle newly arrived families seeking asylum. But no such facilities exist in this stretch of rural New Mexico, raising fears that the recent deaths of the two Guatemalan children won’t be the last.The grim cost of United States immigration policies is hardly new. Law enforcement authorities have found the remains of about 8,000 migrants who have died while crossing the border with Mexico since the 1990s. And while undetected illegal border crossings have fallen sharply over the past decade, hundreds of migrants continue to die making the attempt each year.At least 413 migrants were found dead along the border in 2018, according to a preliminary count by the International Organization for Migration, up from 412 in 2017 and 399 in 2016.“We’re seeing the increase in people crossing out here, and we’re afraid,” said Amanda Adame, 39, a cattle rancher whose family lives in Hachita, about 45 miles north of Antelope Wells. “We’re fearful for the families that are going across and fearful for our own safety.”Still, humanitarian groups say they are waging an uphill battle to save lives along the border. Some cite the conviction in January of four volunteers from the Unitarian Universalist Church in Tucson on charges of abandonment of property after they left caches of food and water in an Arizona wildlife refuge where migrants have died while crossing into the United States.“Asylum seekers shouldn't have to cross in the middle of the desert,” said Justine Orlovsky-Schnitzler, a member of the advocacy group No More Deaths in Tucson. “This is the newest stage of policies that have been sentencing migrants to death for decades.”"

Here’s the sign-up.)President Trump’s national security adviser outlined on Sunday conditions for a withdrawal that could leave American troops in Syria for months or even years.Mr. Bolton’s remarks appeared to roll back the president’s plan to withdraw all 2,000 U.S. troops within 30 days, a decision that surprised allies and drew objections from the Pentagon. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned within hours of Mr. Trump’s announcement last month.The details: Mr. Bolton said the U.S. would remain in Syria until the Islamic State was completely defeated and Turkey had guaranteed that it wouldn’t strike Kurdish forces allied with the U.S.The Daily: On today’s episode, one of our White House reporters discusses the decision to leave Syria and what it means for the role of the U.S. military.President Trump said on Sunday that negotiations to end the partial government shutdown had been “productive,” but that if Congress didn’t allocate more than $5 billion for a border wall, he might use “emergency” authority to build the barrier with other government funds.Democrats said there was no progress in ending the shutdown, and appeared unmoved by Mr. Trump’s shift to calling for a steel barrier, rather than one made of concrete. What’s next: Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House would begin considering bills this week to reopen departments that handle crucial functions like tax refunds and food stamps.From Opinion: Declaring a “national emergency” in order to divert funds to pay for a wall would be illegal, a Yale law professor writes.Notable: Only a handful of asylum seekers at the border are allowed into the U.S. each day.

485,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.[Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.]For Júlia Quintanilla, a janitor at the Department of Agriculture, the government shutdown isn’t about building a border wall or standing up to President Trump. It’s about groceries.More specifically, it’s about being able to feed the three people living in her home: Ms. Quintanilla, her disabled mother and her 3-year-old grandson.“I had put a lot of food in the freezer and we’re taking it all out. The last fish and the last shrimp and the last chicken is all we’re eating now,” said Ms. Quintanilla, 54, who’s worked for nearly three decades cleaning government offices since she came to the United States from El Salvador. “I’m worried about not having food this week.”As the government shutdown continues into a third week, we’re starting to hit the pain point, where the impacts will begin to ripple far beyond the 800,000 affected federal employees, many of whom will miss their first paycheck this week. Those workers are already cutting their spending, meaning that everyone from the owner of City Cup Cafe in Oakland, Calif., to landlords in Duluth, Minn., are feeling the effects.There’s a lot that the government does that’s been put on hold, like collecting critical scientific data, providing business loans and funding some health care services.And then there’s the world of government contractors — a sizable industry that relies on the federal government for their income, including not only the usual suspects, like big defense contractors, but security guards and cleaning services like the one that employs Ms. Quintanilla.Ms. Quintanilla makes about $600 a week from her work at the Department of Agriculture. A second, part-time job cleaning at the Department of Housing and Urban Development provides some additional income. She hasn’t gotten paid from either since the shutdown began, before Christmas, and she’s scared of what the future might bring.“Months or years?” she asked, through a translator, when told on Friday of Mr. Trump’s suggestion that the shutdown could continue almost indefinitely. “Oh my god, we’re going to die of hunger.”Her story is just one example of the economic damage wrought by a prolonged shutdown.If it lasts into February, it could mean severe cuts in food stamps for 38 million low-income Americans. Economists have warned that if it stretches into March, the shutdown could shake consumer confidence and impact the economy.Contractors are in a particularly untenable situation. Because they work for private companies, they’ve never received back pay when the government reopens. Advocates are drafting legislation to change that, but it remains far from certain whether it can actually pass.“The damage is already done,” says Hector Figueroa, president of 32BJ S.E.I.U., a labor union that includes 2,000 building service workers caught up in the shutdown. “Our members don’t have savings to rely on. They don’t have much of a cushion. This is incredibly painful.”The union has become a de facto social service organization, as Mr. Figueroa and others attempt to connect their low-wage workers with food pantries, churches and other organizations that can help them with basic needs like food and medicine.During the 2013 shutdown, which lasted 16 days, Ms. Quintanilla borrowed about $1,500 to cover her bills, she said. It took her about six months to pay back the money because of the high interest rates. This time, she said, she’s going to try to borrow from family first.Her message to President Trump and the Democrats? “The politicians should stop hurting people like us. There are thousands and thousands of poor people who don’t make a lot money and who are really suffering because of this.”[Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox.]____________________After announcing her bid for president last week, Elizabeth Warren wasted no time in getting to Iowa, site of the first 2020 primary, to start campaigning. My colleague Astead Herndon traveled with Ms. Warren through the state over the weekend, and he sent us this dispatch:In her five city Iowa tour, Senator Elizabeth Warren gave a preview of what figures to be her defining message throughout the campaign season: a broad defense of government intervention, and the overarching belief that Washington corruption is the must-solve problem of our time.Across the state, Ms. Warren told voters that the country’s politics had been corrupted at its core, even before President Trump, and that the next president must work to undo the harm. She seemed comfortable in settings big and small, including a larger Des Moines rally where she lost her voice from a lingering cold but, to paraphrase the T-shirts at her merch table, persisted nevertheless.Key applause lines: when Ms. Warren calls for ethics reform in Washington and a mandate for all federal candidates to release their tax returns. The crowd also sits at ready attention when she talks about black-white wealth disparities and tells more of her personal story of humble beginnings. Unlike other politicians, who may begin with a joke to put a crowd at ease, Ms. Warren begins with the story of her family’s near foreclosure, and how that informed her political thinking.Attendees, some of whom did not consider themselves supporters of Ms. Warren at the outset, often told me they left feeling positively about her candidacy. Many said it was the first time they had heard about her family’s struggles with poverty.One worry, though: Several Iowans mentioned fears that Republicans had already branded her as too far left, and one audience member asked Ms. Warren about her decision to take a DNA test to prove her native ancestry. Ms. Warren again avoided apologizing or acknowledging the criticism from some Native American groups, who remain livid at her decision.Read Astead’s latest story from Iowa: With Warren Visit, Iowans Get the First Taste of 2020: ‘I’m Ready to Be Convinced’____________________Along with Ms. Warren’s Iowa jaunt, it’s a busy time for potential Democratic candidates. Here are a few highlights:• “Frank from Palm Beach” — otherwise known as Frank Biden — says his brother Joe “absolutely” has one more run for president in him. His remarks followed a weekend story by my colleagues detailing the former vice president’s thinking about the race.• Last week, The Times reported that former Bernie Sanders staffers experienced harassment and sexism on his 2016 campaign. On the heels of that story, one of his home-state newspapers, The Barre Montpelier Times Argus, urged Mr. Sanders not to run, saying, “It is one thing to start a revolution, but at a certain point you need to know when to step out of the way and let others carry the water for you.”• Julián Castro plans to announce his decision on a 2020 bid this weekend. In the meantime, the former mayor of San Antonio is making stops in Iowa and Nevada, with a trip for New Hampshire planned for next week.• John Delaney, the former Maryland congressman who has been all over Iowa since he announced his candidacy in July 2017 — yes, 2017, as in a year and half ago — has hired several senior staffers and will soon open six new field offices across the state, according to The Des Moines Register.____________________• A prohibitionist campaign appeared to be led by supporters of Roy Moore in the 2017 Alabama Senate race. But it was created by progressives — the second such secret effort to be unmasked.•  A New Hampshire man made a Facebook comment calling a police officer who had given him a traffic citation a “dirty cop.” The police, in turn, arrested him, saying he had committed criminal libel.• Did the reality television producer Mark Burnett create Donald Trump?

Sign up here.An influential financier warned investors in a letter to pay heed to growing risks and social tensions — and the message is already resonating at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Andrew writes in his column.In his annual letter, Seth A. Klarman, the billionaire investor who runs the Baupost Group hedge fund, warns that social and political division risks economic calamity:His message is likely to encourage hand-wringing of a sort usually seen in Davos, Andrew writes.Mr. Klarman says mounting debt in developed countries since the 2008 financial crisis could lead to a financial panic. He is especially worried about the debt load in the United States:More from Davos: Political turmoil has led several world leaders to skip the gathering. And less than a quarter of people attending are women.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________The world’s second largest economy grew 6.6 percent last year, the Chinese government said on Monday — its most sedate pace in nearly three decades. The slowdown intensified in the last three months of 2018, and the official jobless rate increased to 4.9 percent last month from 4.8 percent in November.Economists tend to be skeptical about official data from Beijing, but there’s been an onslaught of evidence recently for weakness in the Chinese economy, brought on by crushing debt, a bitter trade fight with the U.S. and evolving business norms.Factory jobs are no longer desirable, leading manufacturers to try automation, according to the NYT. Ford Motor assembly plants in Chongqing are slowing production. Chinese exporters have delayed hiring plans.And China’s securities industry last year suffered its first annual decline in head count since 2014. Bonuses are likely to shrink, too.Officials around the world are sounding the alarm:• Cecilia Malmström, the European Union’s commissioner for trade, said that European investment in China was declining, because doing business there was “becoming increasingly complicated.”• Heng Swee Keat, the finance minister of Singapore, a nation heavily reliant on international trade, said at the World Economic Forum that trade friction between China and the U.S. could have a “very negative” effect on the global economy.• President Xi Jinping of China said on Monday that his Communist Party faced “sharp and serious dangers”:The International Monetary Fund brought a chill to this week’s down-jacketed procession of world leaders, cutting its global economic growth forecasts.The fund expects weakness in Europe, a slowdown in China, a possible no-deal Brexit and trade spats sustained by the U.S. to lead to 3.5 percent growth in 2019 and 3.6 percent growth in 2020, down from October’s forecasts.“Risks are rising” after two years of “solid expansion,” said Christine Lagarde, its managing director. She added:More on the global outlook:• The I.M.F. got a new chief economist this month: Gita Gopinath of Harvard, the first woman in the role.

487,"WASHINGTON — For weeks, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, has remained conspicuously on the sidelines, insisting that it was up to President Trump and Democrats to negotiate an end to the partial shutdown of the federal government.But with the shutdown soon to enter its third week, and Mr. Trump dug in on his demand for $5 billion to build a border wall, Mr. McConnell for the first time is facing pressure from members of his own party to step in to resolve the stalemate that has left 800,000 federal workers either furloughed or working without pay.By absenting himself, Mr. McConnell had hoped to push the blame for a prolonged shutdown onto Democrats while protecting Republicans running for re-election in 2020 — including himself. Much as Democrats did in 2018, Republicans will face a difficult map in 2020, with a handful of incumbent senators facing re-election in swing states or states won by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race.But on Thursday, as a new era of divided government opened in Washington, perhaps the most vulnerable Republican, Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, broke ranks to become the first member of his party to call for an end to the shutdown — with or without Mr. Trump’s wall funding.“I think we should pass a continuing resolution to get the government back open,” Mr. Gardner, whose state has a heavy federal presence, told The Hill newspaper. “The Senate has done it last Congress, we should do it again today.”A second vulnerable Republican, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, one of the chamber’s most moderate members, said Thursday that she would support separating homeland security funding from the other bipartisan appropriations bills already approved in committee to reopen much of the government — as Democrats have proposed. But Mr. McConnell is refusing to take up the Democrats’ measures.“It would be great to have them signed into law because there is not great controversy over them, and at least we’d be getting those workers back to work,” Ms. Collins said.Mr. McConnell’s distant posture reflects his new status as the man in the middle in a Capitol where Democrats now control the House of Representatives and Republicans have netted two seats to hold a 53-to-47 majority in the Senate. He has repeatedly said he will not bring up legislation that Mr. Trump does not support — a point he reiterated in a speech on Thursday on the Senate floor.“I’ve made it clear on several occasions, and let me say it again: The Senate will not take up any proposal that does not have a real chance of passing this chamber and getting a presidential signature,” Mr. McConnell said. “Let’s not waste the time. Let’s not get off on the wrong foot, with House Democrats using their new platform to produce political statements rather than serious solutions.”After two years of trying to advance Mr. Trump’s agenda, Mr. McConnell now sees his primary job as standing in the way of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who vowed in her inaugural speech on Thursday to “reach across the aisle in this chamber,” but who is also poised to pass legislation on a bevy of liberal priorities, including gun restrictions and protections for young undocumented immigrants.“I think McConnell is going to be Trump’s best friend when it comes to blocking all of Nancy Pelosi’s worst shots,” said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist who is close to Mr. McConnell. “For Trump and McConnell, there’s a lot of good politics for that — particularly for McConnell in Kentucky.”Democrats are trying to drive a wedge between Republican leaders and their vulnerable incumbents up for re-election in 2020, especially Mr. Gardner, Ms. Collins, Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Senator Martha McSally of Arizona, who was appointed to fill the seat left vacant after Senator John McCain’s death. The campaign arm of the Senate Democrats released a series of statements to local news media on Thursday targeting each senator and demanding they make a choice to fund the government or “own” the consequences.“Cory Gardner owns every miserable consequence of his pointless government shutdown, and he just realized it’s a problem for his own political career,” read one from David Bergstein, a campaign committee spokesman. “When he votes 99 percent of the time with President Trump and then tries to run away from his record, all it proves is Coloradans can’t trust him to look out for anyone but himself.”And Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, called on Mr. McConnell to jump into the talks with Mr. Trump.“The power to end the shutdown is in two people’s hands: Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell,” Mr. Schumer said Thursday in a brief hallway interview. “Either one of them could end the shutdown. They both should try.”Mr. McConnell, 76, is the longest-serving Senate Republican leader in history and is a wily tactician. While he is not generally considered vulnerable, his popularity is lagging at home. A poll by Western Kentucky University last spring found that only 30 percent of Kentuckians approve of his job performance. Sticking with Mr. Trump, whose approval ratings top 50 percent in Kentucky, is in his own political interest.But if he wants to hang onto his job as majority leader, Mr. McConnell must also be mindful of the political fortunes of Republicans seeking re-election in states won by Mrs. Clinton in 2016 or by Democrats in November. A prolonged government shutdown is the last thing those lawmakers need. And even some Republicans up for re-election in states won by Mr. Trump, like Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, sound uneasy.“A shutdown, in my view, is a no-win proposition,” Ms. Capito said, adding that she heard complaints from Transportation Security Administration workers as she was returning to Washington for the start of the new Congress this week. Ms. Capito is the chairwoman of the appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security; the panel has already passed a bill funding the department, including $1.6 billion for border security including fencing — but with no money for Mr. Trump’s wall.“It is just a lot of unneeded stress on a lot of people,” she said of the shutdown.“I would like to see it resolved soon,” said Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, who also faces re-election in 2020. She repeated herself for emphasis: “I would like to see it resolved soon.”For Mr. McConnell, the shutdown fight presents a dynamic that is likely to become familiar over the next two years, as House Democrats rush to pass long-sought liberal policies and, in many cases, try to use the chamber to highlight Republicans’ opposition to legislative changes they believe are overwhelmingly popular. Mr. McConnell has already been burned once, having negotiated and passed through the Senate a plan to avoid the shutdown in the first place only to have Mr. Trump pull his support at the last minute.“He faces that reality now on every issue: What’s the White House going to do with this?” said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and Mr. Schumer’s No. 2. He predicted that Mr. McConnell’s approach — to simply stand in the way so that Mr. Trump is not forced to use his veto pen — would only change if Republican senators up for re-election begin to fear political costs of carrying the president’s water.Senator John Cornyn of Texas, Mr. McConnell’s former No. 2, compared Mr. McConnell’s task to “threading a needle.” Mr. McConnell’s former chief of staff, Josh Holmes, said it was considerably more simple than that.“He’s seen this situation many times before and knows where the leverage points are,” Mr. Holmes said. “He knows that there are attempts to try to get Republicans to negotiate against themselves. But he’s not going to be bullied into putting his conference into a disadvantage.”Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the Appropriations Committee chairman, has taken a more activist stance, running sideline negotiations with Democrats over the holidays to try to hatch a compromise that they and Mr. Trump could support. But those negotiations ultimately amounted to nothing, and on Thursday, Mr. Shelby predicted a protracted shutdown.“I am thinking we might be in for a long haul here,” he told reporters. “If we can ever get over this, then you have a new week, a new day and so forth. But if we don’t get over this, if this goes on for months and months — it could, hope not — then this might be a preview of coming attractions.”Mr. Shelby predicted the standoff would end with one side agreeing to come to the negotiating table, but he bemoaned the half-dozen appropriations bills he helped guide through committee that have, at least for now, been laid to waste.“Absolutely — it’s frustrating that we have not reached a resolution,” he said."
488,"WASHINGTON — Ramona Wormley-Mitsis got welcome news in December: After years of waiting, the federal government had approved a subsidy that allowed her to rent a three-bedroom house, bracketed by a white picket fence to keep her two autistic sons from bolting into traffic.A few days later, the dream was deferred. The Department of Housing and Urban Development — one of the federal agencies hit hardest by the shutdown — would not be able to pay her new landlord until the government reopened.“It is my dream home. It’s like my last stop; it’s like my last chance — you know?” said Ms. Wormley-Mitsis, 39, who lives in Fall River, Mass., and is staying with relatives until the check clears. “We drive by that house all the time. It’s torture. Waiting, waiting, waiting.”One month after the government shutdown began, its effects have begun to hurt some of the most vulnerable Americans: not just homeless people, but also those who are one crisis away from the streets. And nonprofit groups dedicated to helping low-income renters are already scrambling to survive without the lifeblood payments from HUD that began being cut off on Jan. 1.That has left a small but growing number of tenants, like Ms. Wormley-Mitsis, in limbo. Landlords, especially smaller management companies operating on narrow margins, have begun pressuring poor, disabled and elderly tenants who cannot afford to make up the difference.On Friday afternoon, a TriState Management employee in Newport, Ark., taped notices on the doors of 43 federally subsidized tenants, demanding that they cover the gap between what they typically pay and the full rent.“As of Feb. 1, 2019, all tenants will be responsible for full basic rent,” the letter said. “We will extend the due date for the rent to the 20th of the month. This will remain in effect until the government opens up.”Amanda Neeley’s heart sank. The three-bedroom home she shares with her daughter and granddaughter goes for a monthly rate of $505, of which she is required to pay $110. The rest — which her landlord now wants her to pay — is supposed to be picked up by the federal government under a program intended to help out the rural poor.“This is putting a hurt on all of us. Everything was going along normal until they decided to shut down the government,” said Ms. Neeley, 48, who gets by on a small disability check. “I can’t pay that much; it is beyond my means. It is not fair.”A TriState Management employee hung up the phone when asked about the policy on Friday. But lawyers for the poor say that renters can fight evictions in court, and many organizations, including the Fair Housing Action Center of Maryland, have begun distributing fliers informing tenants of their rights under local law.A week earlier, a property manager at another subsidized low-income housing complex in rural Arkansas, run by the Agriculture Department, sent a similar notice to tenants. “Until the government opens again, you are responsible for ALL of your rental amount,” the letter said.The letter was rescinded when federal officials vowed to cover the payments.Most other social safety net programs are facing a similar, if less imminent, emergency. The Department of Agriculture has announced that funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food stamps and other aid to almost 40 million poor and working-class Americans, will run out by March 1, and other nutrition programs are facing the same fate.The Department of Health and Human Services was largely exempt from the showdown and Medicaid and Medicare are not affected by the funding lapse. But Congress failed to reauthorize one of its main programs, the $16.5 billion Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which provides states with block grants for a range of services, cash welfare and child care. States are likely to pick up the tab for most programs, but a protracted shutdown lasting into the spring could result in cutbacks, according to analysts.While the housing crisis is just starting to hit individual tenants, it has already wreaked havoc on organizations responsible for housing homeless people and providing support services to veterans, people with disabilities and victims of domestic abuse.The funding lapse is being felt most acutely by providers who owe their survival to the month-to-month cash flow provided by the annual $2.8 billion federal Homeless Assistance Grant program.Susie Sinclair-Smith has helped build a network to help homeless people in Maryland’s high-rent Washington suburbs, an impressive but precarious Jenga tower of programs dependent on $3 million in annual federal funding.“The crisis has arrived,” said Ms. Sinclair-Smith, the executive director of the Montgomery County Coalition for the Homeless. The last payment the group received from HUD was a $250,000 reimbursement for its December expenses, which arrived at the start of the year.The coalition is now preparing to tap its modest reserve fund, of just over $200,000, that was intended to cover unintended emergencies, like floods or the loss benefits by individual clients. It will be used to bridge the loss of federal cash to cover rent, the salaries of case managers who provide support to disabled and elderly clients, maintenance costs, and other expenses for the 250 households of formerly homeless people.“We can get by for a while, but what happens if one of our buildings gets hit by a flood?” Ms. Sinclair-Smith said.In Boston, the Pine Street Inn, the region’s largest provider of homeless housing, is exploring its financial options to counter the loss of a major federal contract on Feb. 1. It bankrolls one of the provider’s most important units, a seven-member outreach team that is responsible for finding affordable housing for homeless people, said Lyndia Downie, the group’s president.In Kokomo, Ind., shelters that serve homeless veterans and victims of domestic violence are struggling to remain open without the monthly subsidies. Organizations in Kentucky, Texas, Arkansas, California and New Jersey face a mass funding halt at the end of the month.“If the shutdown continues, all these organizations will be left having to consider a spectrum of bad to terrible options, including staff layoffs and, in the worst-case scenario, evictions,” said Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a Washington-based advocacy organization.HUD, which funds most of these programs, has been hit not only by the furloughing of 95 percent of its work force, but also by a recent exodus of top staff members. Just days before the shutdown began, the department’s deputy secretary, Pam Patenaude, resigned in what one person with knowledge of the situation described as a forced exit after clashing with the housing secretary, Ben Carson.Critics said HUD officials inadequately planned for an extended shutdown, failing to recertify more than 1,000 contracts with landlords who provided subsidized housing.“I am thoroughly disgusted with the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s failure to follow its own contingency plan” for the shutdown, Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California and chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, wrote in a letter to Mr. Carson on Friday.Ms. Waters was particularly critical of Mr. Carson for exposing homeless programs, including those providing housing for victims of domestic violence, to financial harm.A spokesman for Mr. Carson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The shutdown has stopped vital funding allocations for public housing repairs, new housing voucher applications and even the processing of post-disaster housing requests from Puerto Rico and several hurricane-ravaged states.HUD officials often play down concerns about the impact of funding decisions on poor people. But privately, they too are growing increasingly concerned that some tenants and local groups that rely on funding from the department could be stranded if the shutdown lasts even a few more weeks.Smaller organizations, especially those that serve rural areas, are particularly vulnerable because they often lack endowments, cash reserves or lines of credit that their big-city counterparts can tap.“We are providing services without getting paid for those services, and eventually that is going to catch up with us,” said Adrienne Bush, executive director of the Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky, which relies on a $1 million federal grant that covers about half its expenses each year.Ms. Bush’s group has not received its January payments, and still has not gotten some of the money it was owed from providing services in 2018. To cover the gap, she has begun to tap a $75,000 cash reserve.Ms. Bush will soon have to stop paying some landlords, which could lead to evictions. To minimize the fallout, she has started to compile a list of owners willing to forgo payments for an extended period.She sent a letter pleading for help to Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. Ms. Bush said the shutdown was putting “people’s lives at risk.”She received an eight-word response, and no commitment to help.“I’ll be sure to pass on your concerns,” Tiffany Ge, Mr. McConnell’s legal counsel, replied in an email to Ms. Bush.A spokesman for Mr. McConnell said the senator would send a written response to Ms. Bush’s group and champion Mr. Trump’s latest offer to reopen the government — giving temporary protections to roughly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall.House Democrats have already rejected the president’s proposal."
489,"WASHINGTON — President Trump, facing a growing public backlash over the partial government shutdown, shifted course on Saturday and offered Democrats a deal: temporary protections for roughly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border.But the proposal, which Mr. Trump unveiled in a 13-minute address from the White House, appeared dead on arrival in the Capitol. Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected it even before Mr. Trump spoke, and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, denounced the offer as “not a compromise but more hostage taking.”With the shutdown entering its fifth week and polls showing a majority of the public blaming Mr. Trump, the president’s advisers have been searching for an exit strategy. Saturday’s speech grew out of talks that Vice President Mike Pence and the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, have had in recent days with lawmakers including Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader.The proposal was Mr. Trump’s first public offer to Democrats since the partial shutdown began nearly a month ago. It came after an acrimonious week of tit-for-tat politics, in which Ms. Pelosi told the president he could not deliver his State of the Union address in the Capitol until the shutdown was over, and the president retaliated by grounding a plane that was supposed to take Ms. Pelosi on a fact-finding mission to Afghanistan.In casting the plan as a compromise, the president sought to shift pressure to Democrats — who have repeatedly refused to give Mr. Trump any money for his border wall — to end the shutdown. But Democrats continued to insist they will not negotiate with Mr. Trump over border security until the government reopens.Over the course of his administration, Mr. Trump has repeatedly sought to curb both legal and illegal immigration. He has revoked Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S., which offers crucial protections for immigrants, for people from some Latin American and African countries. And he has moved to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, an Obama-era program that shielded the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation.In the deal he outlined on Saturday, Mr. Trump offered to restore T.P.S. protection for 300,000 people, and said he would allow 700,000 Dreamers to keep their protections for three more years in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier.“That is our plan,” Mr. Trump said. “Border security, DACA, T.P.S. Many other things. Straightforward, fair, reasonable and common sense with lots of compromise.” The proposal, Mr. Trump added, was intended to “break the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward.”The speech was the second time during the shutdown that the president addressed the nation about the immigration crisis. But unlike his first address, a prime-time broadcast from the Oval Office that leaned heavily on dark messaging about the dangers of crime and illegal drugs flowing across the border, Mr. Trump seemed on Saturday to soften his tone.He paired the address with his first naturalization ceremony at the White House, a move intended to underscore the idea that he supports legal immigration. And his language was markedly different; instead of insisting on the “big beautiful wall” he promised during his 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump took care to use the word “barrier” as well — and seemed to pare back his vision for it.Calling the wall “a powerful and beautifully designed see-through steel barrier on our southern border,” Mr. Trump said: “This is not a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea. These are steel barriers in high priority locations. Much of the border is already protected by natural barriers such as mountains and water.”Mr. Trump noted that he had adopted some Democratic proposals on border security. The president proposed $800 million for humanitarian assistance and $805 million for drug detection technology, in addition to funding for 2,750 more border agents and law enforcement officials and 75 new immigration judge teams.In her talking points, issued to Democrats, Ms. Pelosi said her party favored “new drug, weapons and contraband scanning technology at official ports of entry,” and “filling the more than 3,000 vacancies for customs officers.” Ms. Pelosi also intends to bring up legislation in the coming days that includes an additional $1 billion for border security, including $563 million for 75 new immigration judges and support staff.Even so, Democrats roundly criticized the president’s plan. They were particularly incensed that Mr. Trump’s offer extended protections to Dreamers and T.P.S. recipients that he himself revoked. And they said the deal was a nonstarter because it did not offer any permanent protections for Dreamers.“I think it’s simply more fake promises raising false hopes,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said. “It will fool few Americans because it’s neither serious nor credible as a real remedy for Dreamers.”Some on the right also pushed back, describing the proposal as amnesty. James Carafano, a national security expert at the Heritage Foundation who worked on Mr. Trump’s transition, was among the critics. “Amnesty encourages further illegal immigration, incentivizes the tragedy of human trafficking and undermines our citizens’ confidence in the rule of law,” he said.Mr. Pence, briefing reporters after Mr. Trump’s remarks, said the speech reflected a painstaking process of listening to lawmakers, including rank-and-file Democrats who made it clear they believed that protections for DACA and T.P.S. recipients must be included in a border security deal.And he pushed back forcefully against critics like Mr. Carafano who said the measure amounted to an unacceptable amnesty for undocumented immigrants.“There is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal,” Mr. Pence said.But that was one reason many Democrats considered it unacceptable. Other senior administration officials made it clear that part of Mr. Trump’s strategy was to try to drive a wedge within the party between those who want to hold out for a much more generous solution and those who may feel enough political pressure to end the shutdown that they will feel obliged to support it.Noting that Tuesday is the deadline for the government to reopen in time to prevent federal employees from going a second consecutive pay period without a check, Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, said Senate Democrats had a tricky decision to make. He also noted that the president’s ability to declare a national emergency was “absolutely” still a tool available to Mr. Trump to find funds to build the wall if a legislative agreement could not be reached.Now it will be up to Mr. McConnell to put legislation incorporating Mr. Trump’s proposal on the Senate floor.Mr. McConnell — who has insisted he will not put any legislation on the floor unless the president will sign it — spoke to Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner and Mr. Pence on Thursday night about finding a way forward.Mr. McConnell told the president that before he could bring up legislation on the Senate floor, he needed a “public reassurance” that Mr. Trump would sign it, one person close to the talks said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions.The president’s proposal “strikes a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle,” Mr. McConnell said in a statement after Mr. Trump’s speech.If Mr. McConnell does indeed put a bill on the floor, as the president said he would, Senate Democrats will have to decide whether to block it or let it come up for a vote. Despite Democrats’ vow to reject the measure, it could create an opening for negotiations between the two sides.The shutdown stalemate is creating increasing nervousness on Capitol Hill, especially among Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states. One of them, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, is among only a handful of Republicans who have broken with the president and called for the government to reopen without a border security deal.On Saturday, she praised the president, saying she hoped that Mr. Trump’s offer would “lead to constructive debate that will end this impasse.”White House aides and allies of Mr. Trump said Saturday that Mr. Trump succeeded in ratcheting up the political pressure on Ms. Pelosi, especially if the Senate succeeded in passing a bill.“The Democrats’ talking points have been that the president is solely responsible for shutting down the government,” Marc Short, the former White House legislative director, said. “This puts more onus on them to come back and say why this proposal is insufficient.”But one reason Democrats are so leery of the deal is that they have been down this road with the president before. Last year, Mr. Trump and Mr. Schumer negotiated $25 billion in wall money for a pathway to citizenship for the Dreamers. But that deal fell apart when hard-line White House advisers persuaded the president to back away.The standoff over the shutdown, some former aides noted, was the first time Mr. Trump has had to engage in meaningful, high-stakes negotiations. But even that has come as a last resort, in what some have likened to negotiating out of desperation after failing to score political points."
490,"[Looking for TV and movie recommendations? Sign up for our newsletter, Watching.]With the partial government shutdown continuing to stretch on, “Saturday Night Live” proposed its own solution to the standoff: a game show parody.The first new “S.N.L.” of 2019 opened with a special “government shutdown edition” of “Deal or No Deal,” whose only contestant was President Trump — played by Alec Baldwin in his recurring role — looking for a compromise that would end the impasse.As the host Steve Harvey (played by Kenan Thompson) explained to Baldwin, “Earlier today you went on TV and you told the American people that you wanted to make a deal.” He added, “So we decided to do this in the only format that you can understand: a TV game show with women holding briefcases.”After rejecting the immigration deal that Congress offered in December, Baldwin made a counterproposal: “I want $5 billion for my border wall,” he said, “and in exchange I’ll extend DACA, and I’ll release the kids from cages so they can be free-range kids.”Baldwin considered other offers contained in briefcases held by various members of Congress. He started with Nancy Pelosi (Kate McKinnon), whose briefcase contained a note that read, “$1 billion + you say ‘Nancy’s my mommy.’”As Baldwin and McKinnon bickered further, Thompson said, “This is like watching two grandparents fight over the thermostat.”Baldwin next turned to Chuck Schumer (Alex Moffat), who opened a briefcase that said, “Whatever you want.”McKinnon reminded him: “Chuck, we’re not doing that anymore. Remember, we’re projecting strength?” she said. Moffat turned over another card that read, “$15 + Pastrami on Rye.”Baldwin further approached Mitch McConnell (Beck Bennett), Maxine Waters (Leslie Jones) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Melissa Villaseñor), who quipped, “Trump and the G.O.P are just terrified of me because I’m under 100 and I know how to use Instagram.”Finally, Baldwin turned to a Clemson football player (Pete Davidson) who wasn’t holding a briefcase but instead carried a White Castle box with a note inside that read, “Hamberders.”Baldwin settled his dispute for a hamburger, and Thompson observed, “Well, I guess that makes as much sense as anything else that’s going on these days.”In other memorable moments from the show:Return of Pete Davidson of the WeekHours before the last “S.N.L.” episode of 2018, Pete Davidson published a troubling Instagram message in which he wrote, in part, “I don’t really want to be on this earth anymore. I’m doing my best to stay here for you but I actually don’t know how much longer I can last.” (The New York Police Department subsequently sent an officer to NBC to check on Davidson, who has talked about being given a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder.)This week, Davidson appeared in several sketches as well as this “Weekend Update” deskside segment where, at first, it appeared he was going to address last month’s worrisome events. “As you know,” Davidson said, “I’ve had a really crazy month, and I want to talk about something that really matters to me.”Colin Jost asked, “Mental health?”Davidson answered, “No, the new Clint Eastwood movie ‘The Mule.’”Davidson then brought out John Mulaney, the comedian and “S.N.L.” alumnus, and the two of them then really did make a lot of jokes about “The Mule.”But at one point in the bit, Mulaney said, “I’ve been spending time with Pete, to try to show him that you can have a life in comedy that is not insane; a sober domestic life.”Davidson replied, “Yeah, and after observing John’s life, I publicly threatened suicide.”After a few laughs, Mulaney turned to Davidson and said, “You are loved by many. And we are glad you are O.K.”“Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” Parody of the WeekYou can’t have an “S.N.L.” episode hosted by Rachel Brosnahan without poking a little fun at her hit Amazon series, “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” In this take on the show, Leslie Jones plays Rita Mae Johnson, a floor-sweeper at the Gaslight Café who, with a little encouragement from Mrs. Maisel, becomes an exceptionally foul-mouthed stand-up comic named “The Raunchiest Miss Rita.”We can’t reproduce any of her jokes here, but we will endorse this sketch’s impersonations of the “Mrs. Maisel” co-stars Alex Borstein (Aidy Bryant) and Tony Shalhoub (Kyle Mooney).Weekend Update Jokes of the WeekAt the “Weekend Update” desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff on the shutdown and a BuzzFeed News report that was disputed by the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.Jost:Che:Jost:Che:Weekend Update Deskside Bit of the WeekPlaying Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic Senator from Massachusetts and 2020 presidential hopeful, Kate McKinnon sought to establish herself as a fighter: “I’m like if ‘Monday Night Raw’ was hosted by Terry Gross,” she said. McKinnon also took potshots at potential Democratic rivals like Kirsten Gillibrand (whom she called “Kirsten Stole-My-Brand”) and rued her decision to take a DNA test to prove that her family had origins in the Cherokee and Delaware tribes:“I did the DNA test,” she said, “and the test came back 100 percent bad idea. Who knew race science wasn’t a good PR strategy?”Fake Commercial of the WeekIf you’ve kept up with the conversation around a recent Gillette advertisement that asks consumers to give more thought to patterns of toxic male behavior and turns the razor company’s slogan into a moral question — “Is this the best a man can get?” — you’ll have the proper context for this “S.N.L.” parody: a fake commercial for Kool-Aid, in which men engage in toxic conduct — say, bursting into a business meeting and interrupting a female colleague — while under the influence of the popular flavored drink. As a solemn voice-over reminds viewers, “The Kool-Aid boys watching today will be the Kool-Aid men of tomorrow.”"
491,"Representative Steve King of Iowa, who was stripped of his House committee seats on Monday night after making remarks defending white supremacy, has a long history of racist comments and insults about immigrants.Republicans rarely rebuked him until recently, with some suggesting that Mr. King’s language and views were new to them.“This just popped up on Friday,” Representative Steve Scalise, the second-ranking House Republican, said on Sunday, when asked if the party would penalize Mr. King for saying, in an interview with The Times, “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?”National Republicans courted his political support in Iowa: He was a national co-chairman of Ted Cruz’s 2016 presidential effort and of Gov. Kim Reynolds’ 2018 election. House leadership appointed him chairman of the subcommittee on the Constitution and civil justice. And President Trump boasted in the Oval Office that he raised more money for Mr. King than for anyone else.Yet Mr. King, who won a ninth term in November, has publicly promoted white nationalists and neo-Nazis on Twitter and disparaged nonwhite groups for years.

492,"ST. LOUIS — Andrea Caviedes and her friend, Ximena Gumpel, live in the St. Louis suburbs, have two children and helped plan a Christmas party together, but when it comes to the partial federal shutdown, now entering its fourth week, they might as well live in different countries.Ms. Caviedes, 42, a furloughed bilingual loan processor in the Agriculture Department’s rural development program, spent the week visiting her church’s food pantry, applying for unemployment insurance and job hunting at Walmart and Walgreens.“It has been terrible,” said Ms. Caviedes, a single mother whose 10-year-old son is partially blind and autistic. “My rent bill is due, my electric bill is due, my water bill is due, and I have medical expenses.”For Ms. Gumpel, 46, whose husband works at a chemical company, the shutdown is no more than a recurring segment on the nightly news. She feels for her friend, but “it hasn’t affected me at all,” she said. “You kind of push it aside and figure it will pass, that it’s just political bickering.”After all, the schools are still open, the mail is still being delivered, the trash is still being picked up, the buses are still running and, most important, her family’s income is uninterrupted.The shutdown’s day-to-day impact on Americans — both federal employees and the people who depend on the services they provide — shifts radically from workplace to workplace and neighbor to neighbor. On one side of the divide, the shutdown is inescapable; on the other, it is all but invisible.Some large-scale ordeals, like a recession, are pervasive, quickly gumming up the economy’s gears and seeping into the national psyche. But the fallout from this stoppage is wildly uneven, zigzagging across communities and workplaces in unexpected ways, and fracturing Americans’ reactions to the shutdown as well as the ways they experience it.Some reverberations depend on location. The shutdown touches one quarter of the federal government. The District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia have large concentrations of federal employees, but about four-fifths of the roughly 800,000 of them who are not being paid live and work outside the capital’s orbit. Thousands are in crowded urban areas in populous states like California, New York, Texas and Florida. Thousands more are in smaller cities and remote areas, where they often power the local economy, spending their paychecks at restaurants, gas stations, nail salons and stores.The scattershot nature of what is funded and what is not is also varying the experience of public-sector workers and private citizens.  Agencies including the Pentagon, Veterans Affairs, and Social Security are operating because of appropriations bills that already passed. Others like Homeland Security, Justice, State, Interior, Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, Environmental Protection, and Commerce are not.So military bases are open, Social Security checks are going out, and G.I. benefits are being processed. But farmers affected by the tariffs are unable to apply for emergency aid; tenants who depend on federal housing subsidies to cover their rent are facing eviction; private contractors working for the federal government are not getting paid, and rural homeowners and businesses who need a mortgage extension or guarantee cannot get one.[Farm country has stood by President Trump. But the shutdown is pushing it to breaking point.]In Boulder, Colo., where hives of researchers, engineers and scientists are variously funded by universities, private businesses, nonprofit organizations and the federal government, the effects can diverge from one desk to the next.Depending on who is providing the cash or sponsoring the research, colleagues who normally work side-by-side have vastly different prospects like the rows of numbered steel briefcases on the game show “Deal or No Deal” that can contain a disappointing penny or a million-dollar jackpot.Consider the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, a partnership between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of Colorado, Boulder.The staff there and around the university falls, in essence, into three camps, explained Waleed Abdalati, the institute’s director.Worst off are people employed directly by the federal government who cannot work and are not getting a paycheck.Then there are those paid by the university whose income is intact but who are locked out of their federal offices and may even be temporarily cut off from their research data.The last group comprises university professors, researchers, students and others who are unaffected. For them, Mr. Abdalati said, it’s: “Shutdown? What shutdown? I am not feeling anything.”The first days of the stoppage in late December had the discouraging but familiar feel of previous short-term budgetary standoffs between the president and Congress. Many private businesses were also closed or operating with skeleton staffs through the holidays. But as the work world revved back to life after the new year and many federal offices remained dark, the ripples extended further.[Air travel is starting to be affected as a growing number of security agents are refusing to work for no pay.]Twenty-six miles from the Boulder campus is the sprawling Denver Federal Center in Lakewood with 28 agencies spread across 44 buildings. Its low-slung buildings, ringed by wire fence, were abnormally quiet this week.Across the street, at a barbershop called Sport Clips, April Guerrero, 47, said business was way down, because so many people were now on furlough.This has meant a pay cut of several hundred dollars for employees, who receive minimum wage and count on bonuses to pay rent. “The majority of girls this week didn’t get bonuses,” she said. “I’m trying to push it to the back of my mind, but eventually it’s going to affect all of us.”One of the few customers that day was Lauren Kramer, 33, a furloughed microbiologist for the Food and Drug Administration, who brought her son Wade, 10, for a haircut. After Wade had climbed into the barber chair, Ms. Kramer put her face in her hands, clawing nervously at her chin.She had turned down high-paying jobs in the pharmaceutical industry for what she thought was a “stable” job with the federal government.Now Ms. Kramer, a single mother, found herself picking up food provided through a county program, unsure of when her next paycheck would arrive. “I felt demoralized,” she said. “I felt like a lot of the efforts that I have made in my life, the hardships I have had to endure to get to where I am, was just kind of taken right out from under my feet.”When she told her best friend, Jessica Rasmussen, 31, about her situation, Ms. Rasmussen was initially unsure what getting “furloughed” even meant. “It hasn’t affected me at all, it makes me feel terrible,” said Ms. Rasmussen, a vocal teacher who is struggling with the thought that as she considers buying her first home, her best friend is worrying about feeding her son.The shutdown — propelled by a dispute between the president and Congress over building a border wall — is splitting the nation, she said.“It’s very frustrating,” Ms. Rasmussen said, “that wall is going straight through the country, not between us and Mexico.”Those divides continue to shift, blur and deepen — between friends, neighbors, family members, and co-workers — as the shutdown entered its 22nd day on Saturday to become the longest in the nation’s history.[Here’s a rundown of what is and isn’t affected by the shutdown.]Idled workers spoke of intense stress, anger and boredom.In St. Louis, furloughed employees at the Agriculture Department’s rural development program coped in different ways. Patricia Battle, an accountant, was keeping the thermostat down in the home she shares with her husband, a veteran; her college-age son; and her 10-year-old grandson. “I’ve been wearing layers in the house,” said Ms. Battle, who earns about $70,000 a year. “Sweaters, warm clothes and two pairs of socks.”On Thursday evening, Ms. Battle attended a meeting of her college alumni group, whose other members, unaffected by the shutdown, were surprised to learn that she was out of work.“When they come into the knowledge that we’re not being paid, it’s like, ‘Oh my,’” she said.At one point, two members of the group took her aside and murmured a quiet prayer, asking God to keep her covered. “I really appreciated that,” Ms. Battle said. “It made me feel like someone had a heart.”And Rick Willenberg, 31, who earns $41,000 a year as a loan processor for the rural development program, is worrying about how to pay his own mortgage bill. “It’s so arbitrary,” he said. He had never before applied for unemployment insurance, but when he heard President Trump say the shutdown could go on for “months or even years,” he said, “I thought I better go ahead and file.”Both he and his older brother, Steve Willenberg — who lives in a nearby suburb with his family — were drawn to work for the government out of a sense of civic duty, nurtured by a mother who is a nurse and a father who worked for General Motors. “We live pretty identical lives,” Rick said.Except that the Department of Veterans Affairs, where Steve works processing benefits, is funded. So while his younger brother protested the furlough outside the federal office complex in wind-whipped weather, Steve was enjoying the last day of his scheduled paid vacation in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, where he swam with dolphins and drank piña coladas by the beach.“For the months of January and February, my department is on mandatory overtime of 20 hours a month” to correct widespread delays in benefit payments caused by computer glitches, said Steve Willenberg. “Compare that to my brother not knowing when his next paycheck is going to come.”"
493,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Scientists find acceleration in ocean warming, President Trump makes another push for a border wall, and a Baby Shark version becomes a global hit. Here’s the latest: In a new analysis published Thursday, scientists found that the oceans are heating 40 percent faster than the U.N. estimated five years ago, a finding with dire implications for climate change. It also concluded that ocean temperatures have broken records for several straight years.A few months ago, a version of a study also found that the world’s oceans were heating faster, which we reported here in the Briefing. But the study contained calculation errors that caused its authors to revise their estimates down. Now, the revision is much closer to the new consensus.Why it matters: The oceans have always provided a critical buffer against the effects of climate change by absorbing most of the heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions. Warmer oceans can lead to more powerful storms and increased stress on coral reefs.The trip to McAllen, Tex., a border community, is meant to press for funding for a wall.President Trump said he would “probably” declare a state of emergency, which would allow him to circumvent Congress to find funds for his wall — and allow him a face-saving way to sign spending bills that don’t pay for it, ending the government shutdown.If the government doesn’t reopen by Saturday, the shutdown will become the longest in 43 years.At stake: The partial government shutdown has left about 800,000 federal workers furloughed or working without pay. Here’s a state-by-state look at the impact. And it has halted one of the federal government’s most important public health activities: inspections of thousands of industrial sites for pollution violations.Word of the day: furlough. A leave of absence (usually authorized, often used in the military), derived from the Dutch word verlof, meaning permission.One more thing: President Trump cancelled his trip to Davos, Switzerland, for the annual World Economic Forum, citing the “Democrats intransigence” on border security.In 1978, Coca-Cola was among the first foreign companies allowed into China. Shortly after came the International Life Sciences Institute, or ILSI.The global organization is paid for by the biggest names in snack foods — including Nestlé, McDonald’s, Pepsi and Coca-Cola — and has helped shape much of China’s science and public policy on obesity. In fact, it runs its operations from inside the government’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention offices in Beijing.As a result, two new studies have found, Chinese health campaigns aimed at tackling obesity almost always promote exercise and rarely mention the value of cutting calories or reducing consumption of processed foods.Today: More than 42 percent of adults in China are overweight or obese, according to Chinese researchers, more than double the rate in 1991. And in Chinese cities, nearly a fifth of all children are obese, according to government surveys.One man spent 15 days in a detention center. Police officers threatened another’s family. A third was chained to a chair for eight hours of interrogation.Their offense: posting on Twitter.Chinese authorities, in an escalation of the country’s online suppression, are starting to control content on social media platforms blocked in China and invisible to the majority of people there.The crackdown is unusually broad and punitive. While past censorship has targeted prominent users, the current push includes no-name Twitter lurkers with few followers, which experts say is a drastic shift in the government’s approach.Why it matters: Twitter, though banned, plays an important role in the discussion of issues in China. A small but active community uses software to circumvent the government’s blocks to reach a last refuge of political debate. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a speech in Cairo, declared that the U.S. would take a more activist role in the region. He also rejected much of President Barack Obama’s human-rights-based approach there, outlining an approach that is based on a close alliance with authoritarian rulers.Mr. Pompeo — whose remarks came almost exactly a decade after Mr. Obama delivered a landmark speech in the same city — denounced the former president for underestimating “the tenacity and viciousness of radical Islam” and his policies on Iran. Here are the many ways Mr. Pompeo departed from Mr. Obama.Confusion: Mr. Pompeo apparently sought to reassure jittery nations with his declaration that “when America retreats, chaos follows” and that the U.S. would “expel every last Iranian boot from Syria,” but the effect was confounding to many, coming weeks after President Trump’s impulsive announcement that United States forces would leave Syria.Go deeper: The U.S. has spent $8 billion to build a strong Air Force in Afghanistan but it is still struggling, which could complicate President Trump’s efforts to pull out of the country.Michael Cohen: President Trump’s former personal lawyer, who implicated the president in a scheme to pay hush money to two women who say they had affairs with Mr. Trump, has agreed to testify publicly before Congress on Feb. 7.China: Beijing’s ambassador to Canada said, in an opinion piece for an Ottawa-based newspaper, that “white supremacy” was behind calls to release two Canadians detained in China, further straining relations between the two countries. South Korea: President Moon Jae-in said that the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s recent visit to China signaled that a second summit meeting with President Trump was imminent.Australia: A 48-year-old man was charged with sending 38 suspicious, potentially hazardous packages to foreign consulates in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra.

494,"WASHINGTON — At the beginning of the government shutdown, Bill Shine was about as far away from the capital as President Trump’s most senior communications official could get. While the president was complaining about sitting alone in the White House trying to force Democrats to accept a wall on the Mexican border, Mr. Shine was on a Hawaiian vacation.As the shutdown presented Mr. Trump with an ever-expanding political challenge, Mr. Shine, who joined the White House staff with the expectation that he would deliver on his promise to satisfy Mr. Trump’s hunger for positive news coverage, stayed on vacation, keeping in contact with colleagues by phone.Eventually, Mr. Shine came home early to help manage the administration’s response. But any expectation that he would be by the president’s side crafting a cohesive message would be a miscalculation of the role he has actually come to play as Mr. Trump’s latest communications director, according to interviews with over a dozen former and current administration officials.An alumnus of Fox News, where he was known as a protector of the network’s chairman, Roger E. Ailes, Mr. Shine has confined his White House role mainly to stagecraft, people who have worked with him say, and Mr. Trump, who chafes against being managed, has openly expressed skepticism about what he has done.Once he was back in Washington, Mr. Shine was among the aides pushing Mr. Trump to deliver Tuesday’s prime-time Oval Office speech and make a visit to the border on Thursday. And it was Mr. Shine who was among the unnamed targets of the president when Mr. Trump criticized those plans at a lunch with broadcasters before his speech.The border visit was “not going to change a damn thing,” Mr. Trump said, belittling the plan as a photo op urged on him by “these people behind you,” he said, pointing to Mr. Shine and a cluster of other communications aides.The criticism was nothing surprising given Mr. Trump’s habit of quickly turning on his staff, and his recent habit of asking people whether Mr. Shine has been “good” for him since arriving last summer had a familiar ring.For Mr. Shine, there was one obvious challenge from the beginning.“This president’s never going to be happy with his coverage because he’s in a permanent war with the media,” Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and an occasional Trump adviser who has been a contributor on Fox News, said in an interview. “Shine in that sense is in a challenging environment. His primary client is somebody who would like a result that requires change but is not willing to change.”The White House declined to provide comment for this article from a spokesperson, from Mr. Shine or from Mr. Trump, after multiple requests. But Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president, praised his instinct for a good story in a text message.“Donald Trump is an irrepressibly press-savvy, communications-centric president,” Ms. Conway said. Of Mr. Shine, she added that he “has a gut for what sells and an eye for what compels.”A longtime associate of Mr. Ailes, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Trump thought he was “getting Roger,” who built Fox with a keen eye for aggressive political strategy, in his hire. But Mr. Shine, according to his critics, has shown little understanding of the conservative media beyond the cable news ecosystem and his former network — the one place where the president does not need much assistance, and where Mr. Shine has few remaining admirers.Mr. Shine has survived mainly by fulfilling the president’s desire to be in charge of his own messaging.“He understands really strong personalities,” Mr. Gingrich said, noting Mr. Shine’s past at Fox. “He understands that his job is to operate within the framework of that personality, not to try to change that.”Mr. Shine, for his part, has told several colleagues he is used “to working for crazy bosses,” a reference to his time at Fox that made its way back to the network, where officials were displeased.At 55, Mr. Shine is older than many other aides in the West Wing. He is widely described as genial and good humored by his colleagues, several of whom refer to him as an “adult in the room.” He is usually at his desk around 6:45 each morning, a White House official said. Bearded, tall and often bleary-eyed, he works late into the evenings as a rotating cast of reporters filter in and out of his office. He is known as a level presence and, in the words of one senior administration official, is good at “staying in his lane.” Unlike many other White House aides, Mr. Shine tends to avoid matters that are not in his immediate purview.Exactly what that purview is can be hard to discern. Multiple people close to the White House, for instance, said the communications office issued no guidance on what points they should make on television after Mr. Trump’s Oval Office address.According to one senior administration official, Mr. Shine, arriving at the White House, appeared overwhelmed by a fractious West Wing, in part because he was hired by the president after John F. Kelly, his former chief of staff, was unwilling to reassign Mercedes Schlapp, the White House director of strategic communications.Early on, Mr. Trump was impressed with Mr. Shine’s ability to help pull him out of an unflattering news cycle after a widely criticized news conference in Helsinki, Finland, with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.Days after the meeting, Mr. Shine arranged for the president to step out in front of reporters on the South Lawn and hail his administration’s economic accomplishments. Describing the scene, a senior administration official said that Mr. Trump kept his eyes trained on Mr. Shine, who stood casually nearby with a Starbucks cup in hand, while the president addressed the group and momentarily shifted the news cycle.But two senior administration officials said that Mr. Shine’s new colleagues, who expected him to come in with a degree of Ailes genius, have not been impressed by what they considered timeworn suggestions, such as the president not tweeting so much.The shutdown has highlighted the inner workings of a strategy-challenged White House, where one official described Mr. Shine as a bridge between the bifurcated communications and press teams. He is one of four assistants to the president — an official distinction — who focus on communications. They often do not work in concert, according to several White House officials.But it is not as if there have not been some novel communications tactics.Last week, riding high from a meeting over the plans for funding his long-promised border wall, the president held a haphazardly arranged press briefing with law enforcement officials without taking any questions. At a cabinet meeting, he conspicuously displayed a “Game of Thrones”-inspired sanctions poster. And then there were his taped Rose Garden videos, or the tweet with the video of him singing “Green Acres” at he 2005 Emmys.Mr. Shine had nothing to do with any of that, according to an administration official.To his friends and allies, Mr. Trump wistfully brings up Hope Hicks, his most successful communications director, who departed nearly a year ago. Ms. Hicks had the president’s trust in a way that only a few remaining aides do, and she was generally seen as among the small number of people who could suggest to Mr. Trump that he hold back from indulging in some of his public relations whims.Since arriving, Mr. Shine has chosen to become useful to Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, the president’s son-in-law and eldest daughter. At one point, Mr. Shine tried to help craft a network special for a planned trip by Ms. Trump to Africa, which has been postponed amid the government shutdown.So far, Mr. Shine has not satisfied the president’s demand for better news coverage, but the two have bonded over Mr. Trump’s tendency to hold grudges toward certain journalists and news outlets. In November, as the president stepped up to the podium in the East Room of the White House for a news conference that devolved into an aggressive exchange with Jim Acosta, a CNN reporter, Mr. Shine turned to Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary.“This is going to be fun,” Mr. Shine said, a remark that was overheard by people nearby.White House aides said Mr. Shine could not have planned that a confrontation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Acosta would take place, or known that it would turn into a fight that ultimately went to court, and insisted he was referring simply to the president’s feistiness before he went to the podium.But Mr. Shine’s willingness to encourage a confrontation that led to Mr. Acosta’s White House access badge being pulled — something that aides for months had kept the president from doing — is in keeping with much of his private advice to the man he now works for.“After he’s done with all of this,” Mr. Gingrich said, “Shine will be able to write a great book. I joke with him that in the long run, there’s a great opportunity here.”"
495,"TIJUANA, Mexico — Pushed beyond their limits by prolonged waits in dangerous and squalid conditions in parts of Northern Mexico, thousands of caravan members who had been waiting to seek asylum in the United States appear to have given up, Mexican officials said, dealing President Trump an apparent win after a humbling week for his immigration agenda.About 6,000 asylum seekers who had traveled en masse, many of them in defiance of Mr. Trump’s demands that they turn around, arrived in Northern Mexico in late November as part of a caravan that originated in Honduras. Since then, more than 1,000 have accepted an offer to be returned home by the Mexican government, the officials said. Another 1,000 have decided to stay in Mexico, accepting work permits that were offered to them last fall, at the height of international consternation over how to deal with the growing presence of migrant caravans.Mr. Trump resorted on Friday to declaring a national emergency after he failed to secure funding from Congress for a border wall that he said would block migrants from entering the United States. But the data from Mexican officials suggested that harsh policies he has introduced to crack down on asylum seekers may already be achieving some of its intended effects.Added this week to new policies that are bearing down on asylum seekers — which include tight limits on the number of people who can apply for the status each day and a heightened standard of proof to qualify — was the extension of a rule that certain asylum seekers must wait in Mexico for the full duration of their legal cases, which can take years.[Read the first edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]The requirement originally applied only to adults, but the Department of Homeland Security expanded it to include families with children as well.Among those who have been dissuaded, at least for now, is Natali, 32, who asked to be identified only by her first name because she feared for her safety. Speaking from her modest apartment atop a steep hill in western Tijuana, she explained that she and her husband had fled their home in El Progreso, Honduras, after she witnessed a murder carried out by a local criminal gang. Soon after, she began to receive threats in the mail warning her to keep quiet.Once in Mexico, they heard about the increasingly long odds of receiving asylum in the United States, and feared more than anything that officials there would return them to their home country. Rather than crossing the border, they decided to seek humanitarian visas to remain in Mexico legally for at least one year, and have slowly begun to build a life.She still believes she might ask for asylum in the United States, but is realistic about her chances. “I like Tijuana,” she said. “It’s a very pretty city and there’s a lot of work.” More than anything, she fears the United States would deport her back to Honduras.Mexican officials said the data on people who have deferred or given up their quest for asylum in the United States reinforced an idea that is often raised by Mr. Trump: that many caravan members are not truly desperate for protection.“What happened is that many people came on an adventure, trying their luck,” said Cesar Palencia, Tijuana’s chief of migrant services. “When they realized that it was hard to cross and the conditions in Mexico were also difficult, among many factors, they decided to return home.”The Honduran caravan ballooned in size as it swept through impoverished villages, drawing a swarm of national media attention and an eclectic mix of participants. Many came from poverty, lacking education and resources, and said they were unfamiliar with the complex set of laws that would ultimately determine who would be granted legal status in the United States, and who would not.Immigrant advocates said that hype and false promises had attracted a group that was somewhat unrepresentative of typical asylum seekers. But they pointed to the roughly 4,000 members who had successfully entered the United States and had at least requested protected status to argue that most had legitimate claims.Michelle Brané, the director of migrant rights and justice at the Women’s Refugee Commission, warned that while Mr. Trump’s tough policies may discourage the undeserving, they might also endanger people who need protection. She said they would likely drive vulnerable migrants into the arms of human traffickers, who promise to provide passage into the United States.“It may look like it’s working in the short term,” Ms. Brané said, “But I don’t think it’s a long-term solution. It’s driving people further into the shadows and that’s exactly the opposite of what we want.”When they arrived in Mexico, many of the caravan members had been living in squalor, sleeping in tents or lean-tos inside the Benito Juárez sports complex. A downpour devastated the grounds, and those who remained fled to a new expansive shelter called Barretal on the outskirts of Tijuana. Once packed with 2,500 people, that location also recently closed because it had shrunk to fewer than 200.“It is not the same as when we had Barretal and Benito Juárez,” said Esme Flores, an immigrant-rights advocate at the San Diego office of the American Civil Liberties Union. “It really feels that the population has moved on.”On Friday, all that remained of the formerly bustling migrant quarter around the Barretal shelter was a small camp around the corner, only partially covered by a tin roof. The conditions are far from comfortable, but the occupants said it was better than sleeping on sidewalks.Most were not yet ready to give up trying to enter the United States, but knew of others who had. Elde Rodriguez, 26, said he had left Honduras hoping to send money back to his wife and daughter. Believing that he would not qualify for asylum, he tried last week to cross the border illegally but he and a friend were unable to find their away across and turned back.“There’s enough work here in Mexico, and you can live on that if you’re alone. But you can’t make enough to send money home, and that’s the point about all this,” he said. “If I can’t get in, I’ll just keep trying.”While Tijuana appears to be emptying, large groups of migrants have accumulated in other areas along the border as a result of the new policies. After a riot the day before, authorities in Mexico said on Friday that they would disband a group of 1,400 Central American asylum seekers who had been waiting in the city of Piedras Negras to cross the border into Eagle Pass, Tex., according to news reports.The Trump administration has said that the latest policy requiring asylum seekers to wait in Mexico, which it called Migrant Protection Protocols, is a vital response to a crisis at the border. Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, has said the policy aims to alleviate a humanitarian crisis on the border and secure the United States. Introduced as a pilot program across the border from San Diego, the administration plans to expand the policy into Texas.Border Patrol apprehensions of families along the southwest border remain near all-time highs, though there was a slight downward turn in January, as is often the case, according the latest government figures. Customs and Border Protection said more than 1,800 Central American parents and children crossed the border illegally on Monday, the largest number of families recorded on a single day. And like other asylum policies of this administration, the “remain in Mexico” policy has already drawn legal scrutiny, leaving its future uncertain.On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union and two other groups sued the administration on behalf of 11 asylum seekers who were required to wait in Mexico, claiming that the policy, which was introduced last month at the San Ysidro port of entry, near San Diego, violates United States and international laws.The lawsuit was filed in federal court in the Northern District of California on behalf of migrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador who feared for their lives in Mexico, according to the complaint.One of them was robbed at gunpoint and told by the assailant that he would be killed if he was seen again. Two others said that they had been threatened by local residents wielding rocks or sticks. Another plaintiff said he had to bribe a police officer to avoid arrest.“Asylum seekers in Mexico face a heightened risk of kidnapping, disappearance, trafficking, sexual assault and murder, among other harms,” said the complaint.In December, the A.C.L.U. successfully sued the administration over another new rule that became known as the “asylum ban” because it significantly restricted the locations where people could request the status. That policy remains enjoined by a federal court; the Supreme Court declined to reinstate it.Like members of the caravan, many of those who continue to come to the United States each day lack a comprehensive understanding of the system they are entering.Ela Marina Rodriguez, 49, and her daughter, Duña Ventura, 16, arrived in Tijuana about three weeks ago and were taken to the small shelter by a man whom they had been traveling with. Ms. Rodriguez said she had heard on the news that bringing her daughter would guarantee them admission into the United States, and the two thought if they could make it through the journey they would have an opportunity for a better life.“That’s why we came all this way,” she said. “I’ve dreamed of doing this my entire life but I was afraid. Hiding through the desert and the mountains, I never had the courage before, until we heard they were giving papers to families.”Her eyes grew wide when she heard from a reporter that some asylum seekers are being made to wait in Mexico. She sighed heavily and replied: “I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t want to be here.”Ms. Rodriguez said that “honestly, yes” she would cross illegally if that is what it takes to get into the United States. But if she is unable to gain entry to the United States, she said, she would likely turn back to Honduras. “I mean, what else can you do in that case?”"
496,"Good Wednesday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)A new research paper tracked the political donations of thousands of C.E.O.s from 2000 through 2017. The results, Andrew writes in his latest column, reveal what top business leaders really think about politics.They’re usually Republican. Nearly 58 percent of C.E.O.s showed a preference for the G.O.P., with just 18 percent designated as Democrats. (For executives to be counted as either, two thirds of their donations had to go to candidates affiliated with one party.)About a quarter were considered neutral. The report doesn’t disclose who was in each category, but its authors told Andrew that Tim Cook of Apple was neutral, having donated to both Hillary Clinton and Paul Ryan over the years.The disparity was narrower in some sectors. Tech and internet companies had somewhat more Democratic-leaning C.E.O.s. And female leaders were nearly evenly split between the G.O.P., Democrats and neutral territory.But the Republicans are quieter. The study found that there was a statistically significant association between a company having a Republican C.E.O. and less disclosure of political contributions.Why it matters: “The opinions held by executives have always resonated beyond their own industries, but their importance is more pronounced today,” Andrew writes. “Mr. Trump, for example, has not hesitated to equate economic policy with foreign policy. It is, then, instructive to understand the political views of our business leaders.”The U.S. and China will embark on another round of high-level trade talks in a final attempt to hash out an agreement, according to the WSJ.• “U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin plan to fly to Beijing next week to meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, Trump administration officials said.”• “The following week, a Chinese delegation led by Mr. Liu is expected to continue talks in Washington.”There are conflicting views on how far they’ve got: America seems upbeat. President Trump yesterday said that talks were “going very well,” and Myron Brilliant, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that “we’re in the endgame.” But China may be wary. “Some U.S. negotiators are concerned that China is pushing back against American demands in trade talks,” Bloomberg reports, citing unnamed sources. It may walk back some promises because they didn’t prompt assurances about American concessions.A deal could be ready by the end of April if the next talks go well, the WSJ estimates, about a month later than previously expected.Meanwhile, in Europe:  President Xi Jinping’s trip to Italy and France this week is drawing attention to Europe’s conflicted views on China.After years of criticism, Facebook said it would no longer permit advertisers in key categories to show their messages only to people of a certain race, gender or age group, Noam Scheiber and Mike Isaac of the NYT report.• Anyone advertising housing, jobs or credit would no longer have the option of explicitly aiming ads on the basis of those characteristics.• The new rules also cover advertising on Instagram and Messenger, which Facebook owns.• Facebook said it planned to carry out the changes by the end of the year.• The changes are part of a settlement with groups that have sued Facebook over these practices in recent years.The shift will annoy advertisers. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s C.O.O., told the NYT that the changes could make advertising on Facebook less efficient for some customers, but that it was “a cost well worth bearing.”And it has limits. “I don’t think it solves the problem of the potential for biased serving of ads,” Pauline Kim, a professor of employment law at Washington University in St. Louis, told the NYT. She explained that Facebook’s algorithms could show any ad to a particular audience if that audience were determined to be likelier to click on it.More Facebook news: Representative David Cicilline, the head of the House antitrust subcommittee, explains why he is calling on the F.T.C. to investigate the company. And are we asking it the wrong questions in the wake of the Christchurch shooting?In the wake of two fatal crashes involving Boeing’s 737 Max 8 plane, a new focus for investigations is how the F.A.A. certified the jet as safe, David Gelles and Tom Kaplan of the NYT report.• “The 737 Max was one of the first commercial jets approved under new rules, which delegated more authority to Boeing than had been the case when most previous planes were certified.”• “Top F.A.A. officials, who are briefed on significant safety issues, were not aware” of an automated piloting system suspected in the crashes, Mr. Gelles and Mr. Kaplan report, citing unnamed sources.• “The software did not elicit what are known as special conditions, usually applied to a novel feature that requires additional regulations before it can be certified as safe.” But other features, like non-rechargeable lithium batteries, received that designation.• Skepticism about the F.A.A.’s approval process existed before the crashes. “In 2012, an investigation by the Transportation Department’s Office of Inspector General found that F.A.A. managers had not always been supportive of efforts by agency employees to ‘hold Boeing accountable.’ ”• “The United States transportation secretary, Elaine L. Chao, on Tuesday called for her agency’s internal watchdog to open an inquiry into the process.”More aviation news: President Trump nominated Stephen Dickson, a former Delta Air Lines executive, to lead the F.A.A. And an off-duty pilot reportedly helped save a Lion Air 737 Max 8 flight in software-driven trouble just one day before the same jet crashed.The tech giant introduced a service yesterday that allows people to play high-definition games instantly over the internet. It’s hoping to lead a revolution in the $135 billion industry.Think of it as Netflix for video games. “The new service, called Stadia, will work for anyone with a fast internet connection and a computer, phone or tablet,” Daisuke Wakabayashi and Brian Chen of the NYT write. “Users pay a subscription to access a library of games that they can immediately play, as opposed to the traditional model of paying for a disc or waiting to download a game.”This isn’t the only game-streaming option. Sony offers one called PlayStation Now, and Microsoft plans to test something similar this year. The idea hasn’t yet hit the mainstream because streaming games is more technically demanding than streaming movies — and therefore prone to glitches.Plenty of unanswered questions hang over the announcement. What games will be available? How much will the service cost? And more fundamentally, what is Google’s business model? None of that is clear.But Google has not-so-secret weapons. “Using the global network of data centers that run its internet empire, it is set to unleash enough raw computing power to blow away the industry’s current way of doing things,” the FT writes, and it has “YouTube as a shop window.” Shares in Sony and Nintendo tumbled after the announcement.More Google news: In Europe, the company is changing how it displays some search results, and is giving Android users a choice of web browser to stave off complaints — and potential fines — from antitrust regulators.Just after midnight Eastern Time, Walt Disney closed its $71.3 billion takeover of 21st Century Fox. It has become, Brooks Barnes of the NYT writes, “an entertainment colossus the size of which the world has never seen.”Disney now owns an enviable array of assets. It already runs blockbuster properties like Marvel, Lucasfilm and ESPN, and a huge global theme-park operation. But buying most of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire brings:• The 20th Century Fox movie and TV studios, home to “X-Men” and “The Simpsons”• The Nat Geo and FX cable channels• Most of the Hulu streaming service• Star, the fast-growing Indian video providerThe consequences could be huge. Smaller studios may have to merge. Theater owners could lose out on box-office splits. And Disney’s efforts to dominate streaming could pose big challenges to Netflix, Amazon and Apple.But the stakes are high. “Mr. Iger and his lieutenants need to persuade investors to start viewing Disney more like a technology company, where near-term financial turbulence is often overlooked,” Mr. Barnes writes. And melding two corporate cultures isn’t easy.Anheuser-Busch InBev named Marty Barrington, the former C.E.O. of Altria, as its new chairman. Alex Behring, the head of the investment firm 3G Capital, stepped down from the board.Paul Ryan, the former House speaker, has joined the board of Fox.WarnerMedia named Toby Emmerich, Peter Roth and Kimberly Williams as interim co-heads of Warner Bros. while it seeks a replacement for Kevin Tsujihara.Kickstarter’s co-founder Perry Chen is stepping down as C.E.O.Barclays has hired Bob Peck, who was global head of internet investment banking at Credit Suisse, as a chairman of global internet banking.Deals• Lyft’s I.P.O. is reportedly oversubscribed, just two days after it started pitching to prospective investors.

497,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Hours after Democrats took control of the House on Thursday, representatives approved two measures that would reopen government agencies that have been closed for nearly two weeks over a budget impasse. The votes were nearly all along party lines.Both pieces of legislation are almost certain to die in the Senate. The majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said he wouldn’t bring to a vote measures that President Trump doesn’t support, and the House bills don’t include the $5 billion in border wall funding Mr. Trump is demanding. The new speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi, calls such financing “an immorality.”In the Senate: Mr. McConnell is facing pressure from members of his party to resolve the stalemate. On Thursday, Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado became the first Republican in the chamber to publicly call for an end to the shutdown — with or without wall funding.Closer look: The current spending impasse seems different from ones during the Clinton and Obama eras, our chief Washington correspondent writes. There’s little sense of urgency on either side about finding a resolution. Voices: The shutdown has left 800,000 federal workers either furloughed or working without pay. “They have to realize that this affects everyday people,” said a corrections officer at a federal prison in Florida. “It’s like a political chess game that they’re playing, and we seem to be pawns.”The 2019 freshman class in the House is the most racially diverse and most female ever.

The U.S. government refused to publicly discuss Mr. Whelan’s status in detail, but former C.I.A. officers said they didn’t think he was a spy.Why it matters: Mr. Whelan’s arrest comes after a Russian woman, Maria Butina, pleaded guilty last month in Washington to conspiring to act as a foreign agent. Current and former officials said it was possible Mr. Whelan was seized to exchange him for Ms. Butina.Vicente Zambada Niebla was groomed from an early age to take control of the Sinaloa drug cartel.

Notably, many video game lists included a new release with roots in 1984: Tetris Effect.It features a modern visual and sonic experience, including an acclaimed virtual-reality mode. But its core is the same gameplay that a Russian programmer, Alexey Pajitnov, created in his original title, Tetris.In that version — and in more than 200 subsequent official releases — seven shapes (configurations of four squares, which the company calls Tetriminos) stream one by one from the top of the screen. The player seeks to organize them to fill horizontal rows, which then clear from the field of play. The game ends when uncleared areas fill the playing grid. (Because of Soviet-era contracts, Mr. Pajitnov only began to get Tetris royalties in 1996.)A report in The Times in 1988 said players found it “surprisingly addictive.”That has been borne out. Players report seeing the Tetriminos away from the screen, including while dreaming.The phenomenon’s name? The Tetris Effect."

It suggested similarities between Sunday’s crash in Ethiopia and one involving a Boeing 737 Max 8 in Indonesia in October. Boeing’s C.E.O. said the company was “supporting this proactive step out of an abundance of caution.”The cost to Boeing could be huge. Airlines have “begun to demand compensation for their losses during the grounding,” Natalie Kitroeff of the NYT writes. And one analyst estimated that the company may have to spend nearly $1 billion to resolve issues with the 737 Max fleet. It could also face lawsuits from the families of passengers who died in the disasters.“But the bigger financial unknown is whether airlines lose confidence in the Max,” Ms. Kitroeff adds. If that happens, orders for the 737 Max — the company’s best-selling jet — could dry up, handing an advantage to Boeing’s European rival, Airbus, which makes a similar plane, the A320neo. But outright cancellations of orders seem unlikely, because airlines typically put down large deposits.The British Parliament voted last night to oppose the prospect of Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U. without an agreement with the bloc, writes Stephen Castle of the NYT.“The vote was another harsh blow” to Prime Minister Theresa May, Mr. Castle writes. “A critical part of her strategy has been to play for time and use the fast-approaching threat of a chaotic, disorderly and economically damaging exit as leverage.”“Mrs. May said that if lawmakers can support a deal in the next few days, she could request a Brexit delay until June 30 to put it in place,” he adds. “But that appears unlikely. Parliament rejected the agreement she negotiated with the European Union in a humiliating 432 to 202 vote in January, and defeated it again on Tuesday, 391 to 242.”“Without an approved agreement, a longer extension would be needed, forcing Britain to take part in European Parliament elections in May. That suggests Mrs. May might make one more effort to get her unpopular plan through Parliament, threatening hard-line Brexit supporters that, if it fails, she will seek a long delay that could, potentially, mean Brexit never happening.”Brookfield Asset Management announced yesterday that it had agreed to buy most of Oaktree Capital Management for about $4.8 billion, creating an alternative asset manager giant that will rival the likes of Blackstone.Brookfield and Oaktree would control $475 billion of assets under management, including debt, according to Reuters. Blackstone, the industry leader, has at least $650 billion including debt, according to a spokesman of the firm who spoke to the news agency.“The deal is a bet by Brookfield, which currently focuses on private equity, real estate, infrastructure and renewable power, on the prospects for investing in debt, which makes up around 70 percent of Oaktree’s assets under management,” Reuters adds.The purchase is “the latest sign of how Toronto-based Brookfield has quietly come to dominate the alternative asset management industry,” according to the FT.Just one day after the White House’s chief trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, said that a result from trade talks with China would be agreed “before too long,” President Trump undermined his efforts.“I’m not in a rush whatsoever,” Mr. Trump told reporters yesterday, according to Bloomberg. The WSJ reports that Mr. Trump said that President Xi Jinping of China knows that the U.S. would walk away from a poor deal, and that he said, “China very much wants to make a deal.”This could be a negotiating tactic. “Trump can use this for leverage and could also be mindful he would be criticized for a weak deal,” Christopher Adams, a former official in the Treasury Department and U.S. trade negotiator in Beijing, told the WSJ.But it suggests there will be no deal in March. Mr. Trump spoke in February of a possible summit meeting at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, with Mr. Xi this month to sign an agreement. But unidentified officials told the WSJ that an April date now looks more likely.More: President Trump’s former economic adviser, Gary Cohn, told the podcast “Freakonomics” that Mr. Trump’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, is in his view the only Ph.D.-holding economist in the world who thinks that tariffs do not hurt the economy. The former C.E.O. of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, still hasn’t officially decided whether to enter the 2020 presidential race. But during a speech at Miami Dade College yesterday, designed to drum up support for such a bid, Mr. Schultz did outline what his independent presidency might offer. WaPo reports his remarks:• “I would not sign any legislation — none — into law that does not have bipartisan support. … We need to be candid with the American people and admit, yes, that both sides have good ideas if we work together.”• “The courts have become yet another battlefield in the ongoing war between Democratic and Republican leaders. … These battles have undermined our faith in the rule of law and the impartiality of the entire judicial system. All of this has to change.”• “I will do everything I can to fight for the center, where the vast majority of Americans stand.”A grand jury in New York has subpoenaed records from at least two prominent smartphone and device makers that had entered into partnerships with Facebook, gaining access to the personal information of hundreds of millions of users, according to the NYT:“It is not clear when the grand jury inquiry, overseen by prosecutors with the United States attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York, began or exactly what it is focusing on.”“We are cooperating with investigators and take those probes seriously,” a Facebook spokesman said in a statement. “We’ve provided public testimony, answered questions and pledged that we will continue to do so.”“Facebook was already facing scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.” And the Justice Department’s securities fraud unit started an investigation last year in the wake of the company’s Cambridge Analytica data scandal.Renault has removed Mouna Sepehri, an ally of its former chairman, Carlos Ghosn, from her role as general secretary and placed her in advisory role. It is part of broader shake-up of the company’s senior management.At Mitsubishi, two other allies of Mr. Ghosn — Trevor Mann, the C.O.O., and Vincent Cobee, the head of product — have resigned.Aurora Cannabis hired Nelson Peltz, the founder of the activist hedge fund Trian Partners, as a strategic adviser.The U.S. Senate confirmed Neomi Rao to take Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s empty seat at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.Deals• Uber is in talks to sell a stake in its self-driving technologies unit to SoftBank and other investors for as much as $1 billion.

499,"For a sense of the true cost of his government shutdown, now deep into its second week, President Trump should spend less time rage-tweeting and venting his spleen in cabinet meetings about Democrats’ refusal to throw money away on his wasteful border wall and more time perusing the #shutdownstories making the rounds.With even a quick peek beyond his bubble, the president could learn much about the legions of government employees and contractors who spent the holiday season agonizing over how to cover their next mortgage payment or electric bill or trip to the grocery store if this political charade drags on much longer.Let’s be clear: This fight is not about security. Contrary to Mr. Trump’s claims, there is no flood of savage foreigners pouring across the border. Even so, reasonable Democrats and Republicans acknowledge a need for some mix of a bigger staff, better technology and, yes, fencing — as well as humane and sensible immigration and asylum policies. Achieving all of that has proved a tall order even for competent administrations. But it’s why Congress, on a bipartisan basis, has already been allocating more money for border security — although the administration has spent less than 10 percent of what Congress has allocated in the past year.To avoid the complex, hard work that has traditionally gone with his job, Mr. Trump has instead manufactured a political impasse over a symbol, a wall, that even his new acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, back when he was a congressman, derided as “an easy thing to sell politically” that “doesn’t really solve the problem.” John Kelly, Mr. Trump’s departing chief of staff, told The Los Angeles Times that the administration long ago abandoned the idea of a concrete wall as irrelevant to the real needs of border security — drawing a heated contradiction from the president on Twitter.If Mr. Trump would take the time to check in with what’s happening in the real world, he might read about the divorced Army veteran who’d worked “three jobs to survive” before getting hired as a paralegal at the Federal Trade Commission — and who now has no idea if he’ll make the rent. He could hear from the single mother who says that she’ll have enough for rent — but not for food. He might be moved by the wife of a corrections officer wondering how her family will handle their “mortgage, day care and car payments” while her husband is working without pay. Or by the disabled Air Force vet who, having waited more than a year for “service-connected surgery,” cannot get final approval for her procedure until the shutdown ends.An estimated 800,000 federal workers have had their lives upended by this latest presidential temper tantrum. Some 420,000 of those, deemed “essential personnel,” are working without pay. This includes upward of 41,000 law enforcement officials, 54,000 Border Patrol agents and 53,000 Transportation Security Administration workers. (If you flew this holiday season, it was only thanks to these unpaid women and men.) Another 380,000 workers have been furloughed, including 28,800 employees of the Forest Service, 16,000 in the National Park Service and 16,700 at NASA. The longer the stoppage continues, the more people will feel the squeeze. Already, the Small Business Administration has been shut down, delaying the processing of loans. A growing number of national parks, museums and historic sites will need to close, disrupting tourism for the sites and for surrounding businesses. At some of the parks kept open during the holidays, even as many rangers and other support staff members were furloughed, there were reports of trash piling up, toilets overflowing with human waste and episodes of vandalism. Routine screenings by the Food and Drug Administration are being put on hold, and the Federal Communications Commission is set to halt most of its operations on Thursday. The situation on Indian lands is about to get dire. The list goes on and on.For the workers directly affected, among those facing the greatest economic uncertainty are contractors, who make up more than 40 percent of the government work force. This includes not only white-collar positions, but also thousands of blue-collar jobs, such as janitors and security guards. Unlike regular government employees, many contractors may not be compensated for lost time. They could simply lose the income.Even for regular, non-contract employees, who have eventually been granted back pay after past shutdowns and can reasonably expect the same this time, the grinding anxiety and financial costs of scraping by in the meantime mount with each passing day. Many of these workers live paycheck to paycheck, with little wiggle room. Some of their creditors are more understanding than others, and even one missed payment can carry heavy consequences.Last Thursday, the Office of Personnel Management tweeted a link to “sample letters” that workers could use in negotiating payment plans with creditors. This is not a new practice; similar templates were sent during the 2015 shutdown. The letters nonetheless earned much mockery on social media — especially the section suggesting that workers ask their landlords about trading “services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments.” After suffering a Twitter beat-down, O.P.M. removed the offending passage and issued a statement that it was part of a “legacy document” from 2013 that had been posted in error.No matter: On the same day that federal workers were being urged to try their hands at a barter economy, Mr. Trump was busy firing off a series of rabid, finger-pointing, wall-related tweets, including one about how a wall deal had been thwarted not only by “Democrat obstruction” but also by uppity federal judges.In one characteristically empathetic post, Mr. Trump sneered that “most of the people not getting paid are Democrats.” While this divisive, evidence-free claim tells you everything you need to know about this president’s hyperpolitical approach to his role, it most likely failed to impress the hundreds of thousands of families across the political spectrum who are suffering as a direct result of Mr. Trump’s grandstanding.For pure lack of class, however, nothing topped the president’s tweets of Saturday, blaming Democrats’ opposition to his wall for the tragic death of two migrant children who had been apprehended by the Border Patrol and put into custody.As if all this weren’t bad enough, on Friday, Mr. Trump issued an executive order freezing pay for the government’s civilian work force in 2019 — around two million people. The order can be, and is expected to be, overridden by Congress once the budget impasse is resolved. So, practically speaking, Mr. Trump’s move does little more than further fuel tensions.Mr. Trump has claimed — without evidence, naturally — that “many” federal workers have urged him to “stay out until you get the funding for the wall.” This seems unlikely considering that a recent poll by Reuters/Ipsos found that only a quarter of all Americans support the shutdown. Only 35 percent said they favored including money for the wall in a spending bill.This is, to put it mildly, not a broadly popular policy point on which the president is holding the nation hostage.Not that Mr. Trump seems much interested in either the public will or the public good. For him, this shutdown is a self-declared point of pride — a gaudy display of his boldness, his manliness and his political steadfastness. After all his bluff and bluster, if the president backed down now, he would incur the wrath and ridicule of hard-right pundits like Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, who seem to call the shots in this White House, as well as die-hard supporters who still think a concrete wall — or at least some “artistically designed steel slats” — will Make America Great Again. During a Wednesday cabinet meeting, just hours before sitting down with congressional leaders, Mr. Trump doubled down on his intransigence, rejecting a compromise proposal for $2.5 billion in wall funding that his vice president, Mike Pence, had floated to Democrats. This is the second time Mr. Trump has torpedoed a negotiation attempt by Mr. Pence, raising the question of why the vice president even bothers. Mr. Trump accused Democrats of playing politics with “an eye on 2020,” even as he re-upped his false claim that former President Barack Obama has a high wall around his “compound” in Washington, D.C. Resolving the impasse, he said, “could be a long time, or it could be quickly.”But there is likely to be a limit to how much Mr. Trump can make Americans suffer for an empty political gesture. The realities of a divided government may provide him with an opportunity — or an excuse — for a fresh start. The new Democratic House is set to vote Thursday on a spending plan to end the shutdown without more wall money, leading to the kind of intense negotiations that he has not faced in two years of single-party control of Congress.If there’s a minimum of grandstanding on everyone’s part, Mr. Trump might get a lesson in how to make a deal."
500,"WASHINGTON — President Trump threatened on Friday to keep the federal government partly closed for “months or even years” if he did not get $5.6 billion for his wall at the southern border, and he warned that he was considering declaring a national emergency to build it without congressional approval.Mr. Trump and Democratic leaders emerged from a two-hour meeting in the White House Situation Room without a deal to reopen government agencies that have already been shuttered for two weeks, and the two sides offered sharply contrasting views of where they stood. By day’s end, the two sides appeared to be still locked in a stalemate.Democrats called the meeting “contentious” while the president and Republican leaders in the House called it “productive.” And while Mr. Trump announced that he had assigned Vice President Mike Pence to lead a “working group” to negotiate with Democrats over the weekend, Democrats said the phrase “working group” was never discussed.“We told the president we needed the government open,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, told reporters outside the White House. “He resisted. In fact, he said he’d keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.”[President Trump took the public stage this week clearly intent on framing the conflict on his own terms.]Appearing in the Rose Garden later, Mr. Trump confirmed the remark. “I did say that. Absolutely I said that,” he said, flanked by Mr. Pence; Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary; and House Republican leaders. “I don’t think it will, but I am prepared.”The impasse, heading into its third week, has closed parts of nine federal agencies, including the Interior Department and the Internal Revenue Service, and left 800,000 federal employees either furloughed or working without pay. Mr. Trump expressed little concern for their plight, telling reporters on Friday afternoon that when he hosted members of the Border Patrol union — his political allies — on Thursday at the White House, they told him not to worry about them, and that he was doing “a great thing for our country.”Friday’s effort to jump-start talks was an early test of the new political dynamic in Washington, where Democrats have just taken control of the House for the first time in eight years. Mr. Trump, trying to seize control of the narrative, followed the session with his rambling Rose Garden appearance. There, he said he told Democrats he wants $5.6 billion for the wall — a figure that is a nonstarter for Democrats, who insist he will get no funding for the barrier at all.Ever the real estate developer, Mr. Trump offered his vision for what the wall would look like, saying it would be either solid concrete or solid steel, though “steel is actually more expensive,” he said.The president then boasted that its construction would be a boon for American industry: “All of the border things that we’ll be building will be done right here in the good old U.S.A. by steel companies that were practically out of business when I came into office.”As to invoking his emergency powers to build it, “I may do it,” Mr. Trump said. “But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly. And it’s another way of doing it. But if we can do it through a negotiated process, we’re giving that a shot.”But if Mr. Trump is showing no signs of backing down, the pressure may be building on Republicans in Congress. Two Republican senators have said they want votes to reopen the government, and more than a half-dozen House Republicans joined Democrats on Thursday night to do just that.The president was asked if he was still “proud to own” the shutdown — a reference to a comment he made last month during a televised Oval Office meeting, when he said he would be proud to shut down the government over border security.“I’m very proud of doing what I’m doing,” he replied. “I don’t call it a shutdown. I call it ‘doing what you have to do for the benefit and for the safety of our country.’”The White House later said it has scheduled a meeting for Saturday morning with aides to House and Senate leaders; it was unclear whether Mr. Pence and the others would be involved.Behind the scenes, there were some indications that a search for a way out of the impasse was underway. Some conservative commentators, including Sean Hannity of Fox News, who is close to Mr. Trump, may have signaled a path out, suggesting that the president resurrect the old Democratic notion of twinning wall funding with protections for the young immigrants brought illegally to the country as children who are known as Dreamers.Such immigrants are currently protected by Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival, or DACA, a program created by President Barack Obama that Mr. Trump has moved to rescind. On his way to the White House meeting, Representative Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader, seemed open to such a deal.“We can find common ground,” Mr. McCarthy told reporters. “DACA is a problem, border security is a problem and anything that can make sure that we can get everything together and move forward, I’m willing to discuss.”Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, has also suggested that Democrats could give Mr. Trump an additional $1 billion to fortify ports of entry rather than a border wall.But while Mr. Trump said DACA was raised during the White House session, one Democratic aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private talks, said it came up only fleetingly. And in the news conference, Mr. Trump made clear that he did not want to address the DACA issue — which is now the subject of several lawsuits that are working their way through the federal courts — until the Supreme Court renders a final decision on whether Mr. Trump’s order to rescind the program can stand.Mr. Trump also raised the issue of ports of entry for immigrants, but again, he eventually stuck to his demand that any strengthening of controls at such ports needed to be complemented with a wall.The president said he invited Democrats to send negotiators to meet over the weekend with three high-ranking officials — Mr. Pence, Ms. Nielsen and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser — to negotiate a deal to strengthen security along the border. Democrats told reporters after the meeting that they implored the president to first reopen the government so they could negotiate without holding federal operations and employees hostage.No matter what happens, the government will remain partly shuttered at least through Tuesday because both houses of Congress are adjourned until then.On Friday, the president also sent a letter to Congress that was an unsubtle rebuff to Democratic leaders with whom he had previously met on Wednesday. According to a person in that earlier meeting, Representative Nancy Pelosi, who was then on the verge of becoming House speaker, cut off Ms. Nielsen as she reeled off statistics about the border. In his letter, Mr. Trump said that “some of those present did not want to hear the presentation at the time, and so I have instead decided to make the presentation available to all members of Congress.”On Thursday, under Ms. Pelosi’s leadership, the House passed a two-bill package to reopen the government. The first measure combines six bills that have already garnered bipartisan support in the Republican-led Senate; they would reopen nearly all of the shuttered agencies and fund them through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.The second is a stopgap spending measure to fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8 — a date that Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, proposed toward the end of last year in a measure that passed the Senate by voice vote, but which the president rejected. In their last meeting, Mr. Trump rejected reopening the government while wall talks continued, telling the group, “I would look foolish if I did that.”For his part, Mr. McConnell has refused to take up the House package, insisting that he will not bring anything to the floor that Mr. Trump will not sign. Democrats argued in the meeting that Mr. McConnell should at least pass the cluster of appropriations bills while continuing to negotiate over border security. But Mr. Trump again rejected that idea on Friday.Mr. McConnell has largely absented himself from the talks, insisting that it is up to Democrats to resolve the impasse, and one person familiar with Friday’s meeting said that Mr. McConnell said very little. But he is beginning to face pressure from Republicans who are seeking re-election in 2020 and are targeted by Democrats.Two senators from Democratic-leaning states, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine, have already expressed misgivings over their leaders’ intransigence. Mr. Gardner called on his party to end the shutdown, even if it meant not funding the wall, and Ms. Collins — who took a leading role in ending a previous shutdown — said she would support measures to fund the government in already approved appropriations bills."

Ms. Pelosi has said the wall can’t be part of any deal.President Trump has invited congressional leaders of both parties to a briefing on border security today.

But he added that it “won’t be good” if the U.S. doesn’t make “corresponding measures.”News analysis: Mr. Kim has essentially returned to where things stood when Mr. Trump took office, indicating that their meeting in Singapore in June altered the optics of their relationship more than the reality.

That is the usage thought to have inspired the meaning of temporary (and often benefit-free) work.Some of us just use it to mean “job.” And with that, this reporter is off to her day gig to write about The Times crossword."
502,"President Trump leaned hard on the strength of the American economy during his second State of the Union address on Tuesday, but with a blend of precise statistics and gauzy superlatives that are much more difficult to measure.He also returned to a theme that dominated the second year of his presidency — a quest for a border wall with Mexico to cope with what he said is a crisis of crime and drugs in the United States caused by illegal immigration.The two issues dominated his address, which in tone was more measured than his biting Twitter feed, but in substance contained numerous claims that were false or misleading.Here is what Mr. Trump said and how it stacked up against the facts. [Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]“The U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world.”The American economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in the third quarter of 2018. Growth in Latvia and Poland was almost twice as fast. Same for China and India. Even the troubled Greek economy posted stronger growth. And a wide range of economic analysts estimate that the growth of the American economy slowed in the fourth quarter, and slowed even further in the first month of 2019. “We recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods — and now our Treasury is receiving billions and billions of dollars.”Since Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on certain imports from China — and imported steel and aluminum from around the world — federal tariff revenues have increased. Revenues from customs duties, which include tariffs, rose by $13 billion in the third quarter of 2018 compared with a year earlier, the Commerce Department reported. Technically, that money is paid by Americans who bring the goods across the border, and it is often passed on to American consumers in the form of higher prices.“My administration has cut more regulations in a short period of time than any other administration during its entire tenure.”The Trump administration has slowed the pace of adopting new rules, and it has moved to roll back some existing or proposed federal regulations, particularly in the area of environmental protection. The White House claimed that as of October, a total of $33 billion worth of future regulator costs had been eliminated. But experts say the scale of the rollbacks in the Trump era still does not exceed extensive cuts in federal rules during the Carter and Reagan administrations, when rules governing airline, truck and rail transportation were wiped off the books, among other changes. “We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs — something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.” The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that since January 2017, when Mr. Trump took office, the economy has added 4.9 million jobs, including 454,000 jobs manufacturing jobs. Far from being “impossible,” that is closely comparable to the pace of job creation during some two-year periods during the Obama administration, and significantly slower than the pace of job creation in manufacturing in the 1990s.Wages were “growing for blue-collar workers, who I promised to fight for. They are growing faster than anyone thought possible.”Wages are rising faster for construction and manufacturing workers than workers in service occupations, according to the Labor Department.“More people are working now than at any time in our history.”While the total number of people working in the United States is higher than ever, it is not because of the president’s policies. It is because more people than ever live in the United States. “The border city of El Paso, Tex., used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation’s most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country.” El Paso was never one of the most dangerous cities in the United States, and crime has been declining in cities across the country — not just El Paso — for reasons that have nothing to do with border fencing. In 2008, before border barriers had been completed in El Paso, the city had the second-lowest violent crime rate among more than 20 similarly sized cities. In 2010, after the fencing went up, it held that place.“San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country. In response, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.” Border apprehensions decreased by 91 percent in the San Diego sector between the 1994 fiscal year, right after the original border fencing was completed, to the 2018 fiscal year. But, according to the Congressional Research Service, that fence alone “did not have a discernible impact” on the number of immigrants crossing the border into the United States illegally. “As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States.”At the end of January, a new caravan of thousands of migrants from Central America was headed north, and some of the travelers said they intended to try to cross into the United States. But many in the caravan have said they plan to remain in Mexico, thanks in part to policies put in place by the new Mexican government. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has made it easier for Central Americans to get visas and work in Mexico. President Trump’s warnings of an imminent invasion from new caravans is overstated.“I hope you can pass the U.S.M.C.A. into law, so we can bring back our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words: Made in the U.S.A.”The revised trade deal with Canada and Mexico, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, does include provisions that are intended to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States — like minimum wage provisions for some auto manufacturing. But some economists have said those provisions could ultimately push more manufacturing — and jobs — outside North America. The deal does allow American farmers to sell more dairy products to Canada. But the trade pact has yet to be approved by Congress, and both Democrats and Republicans say that is unlikely to happen without significant changes.""When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Just two years ago. Today, we have liberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters.” The Defense Department reports that the Islamic State now controls only around 20 square miles of territory in Syria, down from 34,000 in 2014. But many of the gains against the Sunni extremist caliphate began under President Barack Obama, with the Trump administration continuing Obama administration policy. And the top American military commander in the Middle East told a Senate hearing on Tuesday that the Islamic State could return if the United States and its allies abandoned the fight. In December, Mr. Trump announced he was withdrawing American troops from Syria.“We condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.”This has become a popular talking point among American conservatives. It is true that the rule of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela has brought that country to economic ruin. Inflation is at astronomical rates, and ordinary people are struggling to get basic food and health supplies. Three million citizens have fled. Some of the collapse can be traced to Mr. Maduro’s economic policies, which do fall under the broad label of socialism. But analysts say that corruption, the lack of rule of law and the absence of democracy — all the hallmarks of a dictatorship — have played just as big or larger roles. “If I had not been elected president of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea.""In 2016, at the end of the Obama administration, there was no sign that the United States and North Korea were about to go to war, though Pyongyang had been conducting nuclear tests and Mr. Obama had continued economic sanctions. In Mr. Trump’s first year in office, he increased tensions with North Korea by attacking its leader, Kim Jong-un, in a series of Twitter posts, which prompted hostile statements from Pyongyang. Mr. Trump wrote that North Korea’s actions would be met with “fire and fury” and called Mr. Kim “Little Rocket Man.” Analysts said at the time that the chances of war between the two nations had grown because of these exchanges.“Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments from birth.”On Jan. 22, the 46th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s landmark decision Roe v. Wade, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, Democrat of New York, signed the Reproductive Health Act. The new law ensures a woman’s right to an abortion in New York if Roe v. Wade were to be overturned. It does not broadly allow abortions until shortly before birth, as Mr. Trump suggested. Instead, it will allow for an abortion after 24 weeks to protect the mother’s health or if the fetus is not viable. Under the prior law, abortions were allowed after 24 weeks only if the woman’s life was in jeopardy.“We had the case of the governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth.”In an interview last month, Gov. Ralph Northam said that he supported a late-term abortion bill that would loosen restrictions on the procedure, and allow women to consult with a doctor on an abortion up to, but not including, the time of birth.The governor, a pediatric neurologist, also talked about some of the dangerous medical emergencies that pregnant women could face, such as carrying a nonviable fetus. He said that in such a case, the mother would deliver the infant and then, “the infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.” While Mr. Northam was talking about an end-of-life care discussion in the case of a child that would not live, Republicans seized on his remarks as evidence that Mr. Northam supported killing babies after their birth.Reporting was contributed by Eileen Sullivan, Michael Tackett, Linda Qiu, Edward Wong, Eric Lipton, Eric Schmitt, Adam Liptak, Binyamin Appelbaum, Caitlin Dickerson, Charlie Savage, Coral Davenport, Glenn Thrush, Helene Cooper, Jim Tankersley, Julian E.

503,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said on Friday that it was suspending one of the last major nuclear arms control treaties with Russia, following five years of heated conversations over accusations by the United States that Moscow is violating the Reagan-era agreement.The decision has the potential to incite a new arms race — not only with Russia, but also with China, which was never a signatory to the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, widely known as the I.N.F.It also comes as the United States has begun building its first long-range nuclear weapons since 1991, a move that other nations are citing to justify their own nuclear modernization efforts.Taken together, the two moves appear to signal the end of more than a half-century of traditional nuclear arms control, in which the key agreements were negotiated in Washington and Moscow.It is unclear whether President Trump plans to replace the I.N.F. or to renew another major treaty, called New Start, which drove American and Russian nuclear arsenals to their lowest levels in nearly 60 years. That accord expires in 2021, just weeks after the next presidential inauguration.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the decision to suspend the accord, declaring that “countries must be held accountable when they break the rules.”“We can no longer be restricted by the treaty while Russia shamelessly violates it,” Mr. Pompeo said, adding that the United States would terminate the accord in six months unless Russia destroyed its growing arsenal of intermediate-range missiles and launchers.Mr. Trump said later that “I hope we’re able to get everybody in a big, beautiful room and do a new treaty that would be much better.” He did not define what he meant by “everybody.”The Russian government counteraccused the Trump administration of looking for any excuse to end the Cold War-era agreement. Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, said the United States failed to negotiate in good faith.“On the whole, the reluctance of the Americans to listen to reason and to hold any kind of substantive talks with us shows that Washington decided to crush the treaty a long time ago,” Mr. Peskov told reporters.In a series of public and private comments, the president and Trump administration officials have made clear they are seeking a new strategy that would revive the treaty — but only if all countries that now field such weapons are willing to curb or eliminate them. The current agreement applies only to Russia and the United States.That would be an enormously ambitious task. It would require China, India, Pakistan, Iran and North Korea to sign on to the same agreement. That is much tougher than negotiating a bilateral treaty between Russia and the United States, which still possess, by far, the world’s largest nuclear arsenals.While the administration has not yet formally announced any such effort, a range of officials pointed to language used by Mr. Trump at the Pentagon last month to embrace a new missile defense strategy. “For too long, we have been held back by self-imposed limits while foreign competitors grow and they advance more than we have over the years,” he said.Some experts are skeptical.“Nobody in the administration has laid out what the action-reaction cycle looks like as the United States makes all these moves — building new warheads, withdrawing from treaties, pursuing new missiles,” said Jon Wolfsthal, a nuclear expert on the National Security Council during the Obama administration.“The enemy gets a vote,” he added. “The idea that we’re going to do these things, and they’re going to stand still, is nonsensical. They’re going to respond for both political and military reasons.”One thing is clear: If a new arms race begins, it will be expensive. While the makeover of America’s aging nuclear arsenal and laboratories began during the Obama administration, the ambitions to remake the United States’ nuclear capabilities have accelerated under Mr. Trump.For the next 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office said in January, the cost of nuclear upgrades has increased to $494 billion, or 87 times the amount Mr. Trump is seeking for his border wall. Over the next 30 years, the estimate is $1.2 trillion.The move on Friday to suspend and likely end the I.N.F. treaty, once considered the gold standard of arms control agreements, was telegraphed months ago.The United States began accusing Russia of violating the treaty in 2014, when it revealed that Moscow was developing a new missile that would violate the range limits. The Russian government maintains that missile battalions it has deployed near European borders would not fly far enough to violate the treaty’s terms.Russian officials have raced to portray the United States as the nation at fault.They charge that American missile defense interceptors in Eastern Europe could be easily refashioned into offensive weapons, and that the rise of armed drones, which had not been invented when the treaty was signed, now threaten to provide Washington with similar intermediate-range ability without violating the precise wording of the treaty.American senior national security officials, notably John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, have made no secret of their desire to leave arms control agreements that limit American action.During the administration of President George W. Bush, Mr. Bolton was a major force behind the withdrawal fromthe Antiballistic Missile Treaty with Russia. Last year, he pressed Mr. Trump to end the 2015 Iran nuclear accord with world powers. In the I.N.F. treaty, Mr. Bolton had an easy target: Even President Barack Obama had considered exiting it.The question now is whether the United States will begin to deploy new weapons to counter China’s efforts to cement a dominant position in the Western Pacific and keep American aircraft carriers at bay. Much of Beijing’s growing arsenal currently consists of missiles that fall into the ranges — land-based missiles able to fly 300 to 3,400 miles — that are prohibited by the treaty.China was still a small and unsophisticated military power when Ronald Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the last leader of a rapidly weakening Soviet Union, negotiated the I.N.F. agreement.The decision to leave it took American allies by surprise when word of the decision first leaked in October. Since then, European capitals have been caught between their fears of Mr. Trump’s unilateral instincts and their recognition that Mr. Putin poses a growing threat.The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the military alliance that was created to counter the Soviet threat 70 years ago, said on Friday that Russia was “fully responsible” for the breach of the treaty.“The United States is taking this action in response to the significant risks to Euro-Atlantic security,” said Jen Stoltenberg, the secretary general of the Atlantic alliance.Mr. Trump’s critics in Congress, however, immediately condemned the decision and pledged to introduce legislation seeking to stop the country from withdrawing from the treaty in six months.Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who focuses on nuclear issues on the Foreign Relations Committee, called the treaty’s suspension “a tragedy that makes the world less safe.”“President Trump and his war cabinet have yet again decided that America should go it alone, this time, by paving the way for a dangerous arms race,” he said.It seems unlikely that Mr. Pompeo’s announcement will result in a flurry of last-minute negotiations with Moscow, and it could accelerate the Cold War-like behavior among the United States, Russia and China. American intelligence agencies’ warned this week that Russia and China were “more aligned than at any point since the mid-1950s.”The fate of the treaty has quickly become a test of the struggle inside the Trump administration, and with its allies, over how to handle an increasingly aggressive Russia.Mr. Trump campaigned on remaking Washington’s relationship with Moscow; the open investigation by the Justice Department’s special counsel is, at its core, about whether he and his campaign aides promised to relieve sanctions and other impediments to Russia in return for financial or electoral benefits from Mr. Putin’s government.Russia was first to have second thoughts about the I.N.F. treaty. It complained to the Bush administration 12 years ago that newer nuclear powers, chiefly China, were not constrained by its terms. They proposed expanding it to include other major nuclear states.That logic, said Graham Allison, a Harvard professor known for his studies of nuclear strategy dating to the Cuban missile crisis, “is correct.”“But whether the Chinese and others would agree — I doubt it,” Mr. Allison said.If China refused, so would India, which feels threatened by Beijing’s nuclear fleet. If India failed to sign on, Pakistan would reject the limits.Complicating the diplomatic issue is another, less publicized announcement that recently came from the Energy Department: For the first time in 28 years, the United States began producing a new warhead for a strategic weapon — the long-range weapons devised to reach Russia, China or North Korea.The announcement was not entirely surprising. In early 2018, the Trump administration indicated in a nuclear strategy review that it would develop a new warhead for an unspecified number of Trident missiles, which are carried aboard submarines. The first of those weapons — called a W76-2 — is now being assembled at a weapons plant near Amarillo, Tex.In an emailed statement on Wednesday, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which runs the country’s atomic weapons complex, said it was “on track” to complete the initial order and deliver the new warheads to the Navy by the end of this fiscal year. The number it is producing has been kept a secret.The exact power of the weapon is also secret, but it is widely estimated to be roughly half the Hiroshima blast — what the Trump administration calls a “low yield” weapon.The Trump administration has argued that it must match Russian strides in low-yield weaponry to deter conflict, by helping “ensure that potential adversaries perceive no possible advantage in limited nuclear escalation.”But critics see the new class of strategic weaponry as making unthinkable outcomes far more likely — not less. If an American submarine ever fires a Trident missile with a low-yield warhead, critics predict that could provoke a nuclear retaliation before impact.The cost of the W76-2 and the administration’s other new weapons are raising the price of making over the nation’s nuclear arsenal.Last week, the budget office updated its projections to account for the coming decade though 2028, lifting its estimate by $94 billion.The House, now under control of the Democrats, is vowing to review that budget. The buildup could result in a new global arms race; it might also be used as a bargaining chip to produce an arms control breakthrough.Last year, when Defense Secretary Jim Mattis testified on Capitol Hill about the administration’s new arms policy, he alluded to a benign outcome. “We have to give our negotiators,” he said, “something with which to negotiate.”"
504,"Good Tuesday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)China’s premier said today that his government would respond to an economic slowdown by cutting taxes, easing burdens on the private sector and giving markets a bigger role, Keith Bradsher and Chris Buckley of the NYT write.2019 is a “crucial year” for China’s economy, Premier Li Keqiang, the second-ranking official in the country after President Xi Jinping, said at the opening of the National People’s Congress in Beijing this morning. He said the trade war with America had “had an adverse effect,” adding, “We must be fully prepared for a tough struggle.” China has lowered its growth target for this year. Mr. Li said that the nation was now aiming for gross domestic product growth of 6 to 6.5 percent, down from a target of 6.5 percent over the past two years.Other policy changes include a reduction in value added tax, which is expected to boost corporate earnings. And Mr. Li said the government would “act with resolve to hand matters it shouldn’t manage over to the market.”But Mr. Li’s speech “did not go as far as domestic or foreign critics would have liked,” Mr. Bradsher and Mr. Buckley write, adding that “economic anxieties have come to dominate policy in China” over the past year.And China may just need to accept the new normal. A gradual decline in an astonishing growth rate is “what happens when you become a big, maturing economy,” Daniel Moss of Bloomberg Opinion writes.More: China is getting ready to overhaul to its laws on foreign investment in order to ease its trade dispute with the U.S.A Tokyo court ruled today that the former auto industry leader Carlos Ghosn could post bail, months after he was charged with financial misconduct. The court set the bail at 1 billion yen, or about $9 million.It was Mr. Ghosn’s third bail request, but the first led by his new legal team, including the high-profile defense lawyer Junichiro Hironaka. Prosecutors previously argued that Mr. Ghosn was a flight risk and might tamper with evidence.The court imposed strict limits on Mr. Ghosn, including a ban on leaving Japan, surveillance outside his Tokyo residence and a pledge not to contact people beyond his legal team. “The bail conditions are severe, but we will make sure to comply,” Mr. Hironaka said.The battle for bail highlighted Japan’s use of what critics call “hostage justice.” The FT writes that it “prolongs the detainment of defendants who, like Mr. Ghosn, assert their innocence and refuse to make a confession.”Mr. Ghosn isn’t free yet. Prosecutors have appealed, and his own legal team says he’s unlikely to be released today.The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Jerry Nadler, issued a flurry of document requests yesterday to all corners of President Trump’s world. It’s the most sweeping effort yet by Democratic lawmakers to investigate the president for alleged misdeeds.Mr. Nadler requested information from 81 people and agencies, including the Trump Organization, the Trump campaign, the Trump Foundation, the inaugural committee, the White House, and family members and aides. Other House committee chairs have requested documents related to Mr. Trump’s communications with President Vladimir Putin of Russia.Democrats are looking into possible violations of campaign finance law and use of office for personal gain, particularly where it might violate a constitutional ban on foreign emoluments. They’re also investigating claims about hush money payments to the porn star Stormy Daniels and attacks against critics.They clearly won’t wait for Robert Mueller. The NYT notes that the House has “a different standard of evidence not wedded to a criminal indictment.” Republicans accused their colleagues of laying the groundwork for impeachment proceedings.But hurdles remain. Unlike Mr. Mueller, House Democrats can’t compel document production by convening a grand jury. And the White House could assert executive privilege to block some requests — though Trump administration officials said they would cooperate when possible.The telecom giant finally unveiled its new structure for what was once Time Warner yesterday, days after it beat the Justice Department’s effort to block the acquisition. Warner Media, as it now is, has been reorganized to better fight old rivals (like Verizon) and new ones (like Netflix).Who’s in? Bob Greenblatt, the former head of NBC and Showtime, will be chairman of Warner Media Entertainment. Jeff Zucker, the current CNN chief, will oversee news and sports. And Kevin Tsujihara will continue to lead the Warner Bros. movie studio, along with a new division for family and kids’ programming.The battle has two fronts. AT&T hopes 24-hour news and content like “Game of Thrones” will help it fend off telecom competitors. But it also wants to compete in streaming against giants like Netflix and Amazon. John Stankey, the head of Warner Media, told the NYT that the reorganization would speed the development of a new online video service.The man in the hot seat is Mr. Greenblatt, who as HBO’s new boss replaces Richard Plepler, the much-admired former C.E.O. who resisted AT&T’s desire to make the network more like Netflix. Mr. Greenblatt defended AT&T’s approach, telling Vanity Fair that HBO would have to increase its output “because now we live in a volume world, and there’s no way to really avoid that.”More: The New Yorker reported that in the summer of 2017, President Trump ordered Gary Cohn, then his economic adviser, to push the Justice Department into blocking AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner.After the Great Depression, the Glass-Steagall Act forced lenders to separate their commercial and investment banking operations. Now, Representative David Cicilline, who leads the House antitrust subcommittee, wonders if something similar could apply to tech.“It’s an interesting idea whether there would be a way to think about separating what platforms do versus people who are selling products and information — a Glass-Steagall for the international” tech companies, Mr. Cicilline told the FT.His views hold weight. Mr. Cicilline has been an outspoken voice in the Democratic Party about tech regulation — he previously said that “Facebook cannot be trusted to regulate itself” — and his committee position is a powerful one.Others in Washington are making similar noises. Last week, the F.T.C. announced a new Big Tech task force, and its director of competition, Bruce Hoffman, said that some companies could be forced to “spin off” previous acquisitions.Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle want to limit companies’ ability to buy back their shares. But Josh Bolten, the C.E.O. of the Business Roundtable, and Ken Bertsch, the executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, write in an NYT Op-Ed that such efforts could hurt the economy.• Restricting buybacks and dividends, the two write, could force companies “to sit on cash or waste it on projects with a low potential for success.”• “Some critics of buybacks miss this point: Money returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends does not disappear from the economy,” Mr. Bolten and Mr. Bertsch add, citing individuals making big purchases, angel investments in new businesses and loans as potential uses of such cash.• “While there was a substantial increase in buybacks and dividends last year, business investment also increased substantially and grew at the fastest rate since 2011.”• “Not only do buybacks and dividends support a stronger and more dynamic economy, they also contribute to Americans’ retirement security,” Mr. Bolten and Mr. Bertsch write, citing widespread stock ownership in American households.• The two concede that buybacks could be abused and advocate companies having strong corporate governance. But they argue federal limitations “would stifle innovation and opportunity in America.”A recent Google study into pay equality at the company found — to the surprise of just about everyone — that men were paid less than women for doing similar work, Daisuke Wakabayashi of the NYT writes:• “The study, which disproportionately led to pay raises for thousands of men, is done every year.”• “In response to the study, Google gave $9.7 million in additional compensation to 10,677 employees for this year. Men account for about 69 percent of the company’s work force, but they received a higher percentage of the money.”• “Critics said the results of the pay study could give a false impression. Company officials acknowledged that it did not address whether women were hired at a lower pay grade than men with similar qualifications.”• “A more difficult issue to solve — one that critics say Google often mismanages for women — is a human resources concept called leveling. Are employees assigned to the appropriate pay grade for their qualifications?”More: Some employees reportedly believe that the company continues to work on a censored search engine for China.PepsiCo promoted Laxman Narasimhan to chief commercial officer, a new position.Andreessen Horowitz hired David George from General Atlantic as a partner focused on later-stage venture capital investments.Deals• Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, is reportedly exploring a bankruptcy filing to limit its legal liabilities.

505,"Good Tuesday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)DealBook exclusive: The energy company plans to announce today that it has given $5 million to Catalyst, a nonprofit focused on making corporate America more hospitable toward women.It’s funding Men Advocating Real Change, a Catalyst campaign that teaches male executives how to improve diversity and inclusion at their companies. (Among its tactics: lessons on unconscious bias.) Lorraine Hariton, Catalyst’s C.E.O., said it was the single biggest grant in the nonprofit’s 50-year history.Chevron has been a longtime supporter of Catalyst. It began working with the nonprofit 20 years ago, and Mike Wirth, the oil and gas giant’s C.E.O., helped introduce this program to the company two years ago. It now runs in seven Chevron offices worldwide.Diversity and inclusion has improved at Chevron. In 2010, only 6 percent of its board and 11 percent of its management committee were women. Now, it’s 36 percent for the board and 20 percent for the management committee. “I think the business case for this is compelling,” Mr. Wirth told Michael de la Merced of DealBook, saying more diversity has improved innovation.But there’s still a lot to do. Mr. Wirth said that oil and gas needed far more women in engineering and technical roles. And Ms. Hariton said that while companies have been hiring more women, the number of top female executives remains too small.President Trump is facing increasing pressure from Republicans, Democrats and even some of his own advisers to win the kind of large concessions that Beijing has long resisted, Alan Rappeport of the NYT writes.Mr. Trump has softened his threats against China. “Citing ‘substantial progress’ in talks between the United States and China, Mr. Trump on Sunday evening halted plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods at the end of this week,” Mr. Rappeport explains.But the Chinese may be dangling false promises, some top Democrats say, in hopes of ending a trade war that is damaging their economy, as well as hurting American farmers. Some Republicans fear that Mr. Trump may settle for a deal that simply reduces the trade deficit and offers relief to Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant.Many big sticking points remain, including China’s state subsidies for its businesses. Beijing also still appears to be falling short of the administration’s demands over intellectual property and cybertheft.“The blowback from both directions may leave Mr. Trump little choice but to keep the threat of tariffs alive so that he can continue to claim he’s being tough on China, analysts said,” according to Mr. Rappeport.More: The FT imagines what a trade deal might look like. Trade war is only one of the threats worrying President Xi Jinping of Chin. U.S. companies are planning their lowest rate of expansion in China since 2016. And a delay on further tariffs probably staved off inflation in America.The Securities and Exchange Commission says a series of tweets Elon Musk published last week violate its agreement with Tesla, and wants him held in contempt of court.Mr. Musk got in trouble last year by tweeting that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private, when that wasn’t exactly the case. Tesla settled, promising the S.E.C. that it would set up “mandatory procedures to oversee and preapprove Mr. Musk’s Tesla-related written communications.”Then last week, he tweeted about a manufacturing triumph, saying Tesla would make “around 500,000” cars this year, up from a target of 400,000. He soon corrected himself and repeated the target of 400,000 deliveries. Tesla’s lawyers conceded that Mr. Musk hadn’t had his tweets reviewed, but argued “the substance” of his post had already been vetted and publicly disclosed. Mr. Musk followed up by needling the S.E.C., tweeting that it “forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript,” in which he forecast production of between 350,000 and 500,000 cars. “How embarrassing,” he added.“This is not an innocuous tweet,” Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School, told the NYT. “Insiders have to be careful about revealing misleading information to the public.”Punishments the S.E.C. could seek, Ms. Roiphe said, include a fine, more restrictions on Mr. Musk’s social media use, or even his removal as C.E.O.With just over a month to go before Britain is scheduled to leave the E.U., Prime Minister Theresa May could U-turn on her commitment to keeping to schedule. And the opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, under heavy pressure, has promised to support a second public vote.Mrs. May is letting her cabinet think the unthinkable. The prime minister, who has repeatedly insisted that Brexit will occur on March 29, will allow her colleagues “to discuss extending the deadline” today, according to Bloomberg, which sets out what she’d be risking and why:• “On one hand, it would avert mass resignations from pro-E.U. ministers in May’s team, and potentially a defeat in Parliament this week.”• “But it would also risk a destabilizing backlash from Euroskeptic Conservatives.”And Mr. Corbyn has made a big concession to pro-Europeans. He had long resisted a second Brexit referendum, but has had to reconsider after several pro-E.U. lawmakers quit his Labour Party. Stephen Castle of the NYT explains what the reversal means:• “At the moment, it is unlikely that a second vote would win a majority in Parliament because most lawmakers still oppose the idea.”• “But if Mrs. May’s Brexit plan is rejected next month for a second time, then the calculation in Parliament could change.”Dozens of current and former employees of a company called Cognizant, which reviews content for the social network, spoke to the Verge. The investigation makes for grim reading:• “Employees described a workplace that is perpetually teetering on the brink of chaos. It is an environment where workers cope by telling dark jokes about committing suicide, then smoke weed during breaks to numb their emotions.”• “In stark contrast to the perks lavished on Facebook employees, team leaders micromanage content moderators’ every bathroom and prayer break,” and employees “have been found having sex inside stairwells.”• “They are pressured not to discuss the emotional toll that their job takes on them, even with loved ones, leading to increased feelings of isolation and anxiety.”• “Moderators told me it’s a place where the conspiracy videos and memes that they see each day gradually lead them to embrace fringe views. One auditor walks the floor promoting the idea that the Earth is flat.”• “Moderators in Phoenix will make just $28,800 per year — while the average Facebook employee has a total compensation of $240,000.” Facebook’s response: In a statement yesterday, it said it was “putting in place a rigorous and regular compliance and audit process for all of our outsourced partners to ensure they are complying with the contracts and care we expect.”Bank of America plans to erase the Merrill Lynch name from its investment banking and trading arms. They’ll go by “BofA Securities” rather than “Bank of America Merrill Lynch,” and its wealth-management unit will be “Merrill.”It’s the end of an era. Merrill Lynch was one of the best-known names on Wall Street when Bank of America bought it during the 2008 financial crisis. At the time, Bank of America was a big lender, built from years of acquisitions — but a minnow in high finance.The combined firm struggled with culture clashes. Longtime Merrill employees were proud of “Mother Merrill” and the “thundering herd” that was its wealth-management arm. The WSJ reports that Bank of America backed away from changing the name before.But now it wants a seamless identity. “We are continuing to unify the company, continuing down the road we started on a decade ago,” Bank of America’s C.E.O., Brian Moynihan, told the WSJ. (He has also pushed the firm into safe businesses, de-emphasizing the risk-taking that left Merrill needing a buyer.)The only place where staying as Merrill made sense was in wealth management. Mr. Moynihan called it “the No. 1 brand there is.”Last year, President Trump replaced Janet Yellen with Jerome Powell as head of the Federal Reserve. Since, Mr. Trump has broken with precedent by publicly criticizing Mr. Powell for raising interest rates. Ms. Yellen has now made clear what she thinks of all that in an interview with Marketplace.• When the host of Marketplace, Kai Ryssdal, asked if she thought the president “has a grasp of macroeconomic policy,” Ms. Yellen replied, “No, I do not.”• When asked to elaborate, she said, “Well, I doubt that he would even be able to say that the Fed’s goals are maximum employment and price stability.”• “He’s made comments about the Fed having an exchange rate objective in order to support his trade plans, or possibly targeting the U.S. balance of trade,” she added. “And, you know, I think comments like that shows a lack of understanding of the impact of the Fed on the economy, and appropriate policy goals.”Amazon added the former PepsiCo C.E.O.

506,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.When people talk about the emerging 2020 Democratic primary field, it can sound an awful lot like the opening lines of a children’s book.One candidate, two candidates Old candidates, new candidatesSome are slightly left, some are farSay! what a lot of candidates there are.But there’s one thing many leading Democrats seem to agree on: Kamala Harris is a formidable contender. When you ask 2020 candidates, likely candidates and members of their teams what possible opponent they worry about, the California senator’s name comes up frequently.Those concerns only grew on Monday when Ms. Harris formally announced her presidential bid: She matched Senator Bernie Sanders’s record by raising $1.5 million from 38,000 donors in the first 24 hours of her campaign.So why is a first-term senator, with little experience outside California state government, making Democrats so nervous?• She doesn’t fit into a neat ideological lane. As my colleague Astead Herndon wrote on Monday, Ms. Harris comes out of the Bay Area’s Democratic establishment. But since joining the Senate in 2017, she’s embraced elements of a Sanders-lite liberal agenda, backing “Medicare for All” and rejecting most corporate donations. As a result, her team argues, she can appeal to a wide array of factions in the party.• She would make history. Should she prevail in the primary season, Ms. Harris would be the first African-American woman and the first person of Asian heritage to be a major party nominee. As a graduate of Howard and a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the oldest black sorority, Ms. Harris has deep ties to the black community.• The primary map favors a candidate who can win strong support from black voters — and California. It’s no accident that Ms. Harris is making her first campaign stop on Friday in South Carolina, where African-Americans will likely make up a majority of the electorate in that state’s early primary. The rising popularity of early voting also means that primary voters will start casting ballots in her native state of California on the day of the Iowa caucuses; in diverse states of Illinois and Ohio, voters can start casting early ballots before New Hampshire holds its primary.After Iowa and New Hampshire, the race moves to potentially favorable terrain for Ms. Harris: Nevada, which borders California and has a large Latino population, then South Carolina. Then, on Super Tuesday, California will be among the states voting, as will four southern states where black voters made up more than a quarter of the 2016 primary electorate.Even with these advantages, Ms. Harris still has plenty to worry about. Already, she’s fending off attacks on the “tough-on-crime” positions she took as a prosecutor in California. In her first remarks after announcing her campaign, Ms. Harris described the criminal justice system as “horribly flawed.” And her liberal bona fides may be found lacking by an insurgent wing that is ascendant in the party.Obviously Ms. Harris does not have anything locked down. (Need I take you back to the winter of 2007, when Hillary Clinton led primary polls by double digits.) We’re in the early stages of what will likely be a very, very long primary contest. A lot can happen.Just ask Howard Dean.____________________Advisers to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. are circulating a document to his supporters that outlines a rationale for him to run for president and rebuts potential lines of attack — the latest indication that Mr. Biden is leaning toward a 2020 bid but has not yet fully committed.The talking points, which were sent to The Times’s Jonathan Martin by an ally of Mr. Biden, reflect some of his core arguments he would make if he does enter the Democratic primary. He and his advisers contend that his long experience in politics — he served in the Senate for over 35 years — would represent an appealing contrast to President Trump’s erratic style.“In a time of almost unprecedented political chaos under a President whose first and last thought every day is about himself, his image, and using the most powerful office in the world to enrich himself, Americans are reacting to — and looking for — the trustworthy, compassionate leadership that Joe Biden has brought to the national and international stage his entire career,” the document states.But what is more revealing about the 10-paragraph document is that Mr. Biden and his small circle of aides feel the need to sketch out his message before he announces his candidacy. It is, a Biden ally said, “a distillation of his thinking.” The decision to put these thoughts on paper while other Democrats are announcing full-blown campaigns indicates Mr. Biden is still eager to gauge reaction to his candidacy before taking the plunge.To that end, the talking points attempt to grapple with some of the most frequent critiques of Mr. Biden:• That his initial lead in some Democratic primary polls is simply based on name identification and will melt once other candidates become better known?“He is passionate, he is empathetic, he is trustworthy — and voters know these things about him,” the document states. “It’s why he’s atop so many polls — it’s not because voters know his name, it’s because they know his character.”• That he is too moderate for today’s Democratic voters and will struggle with liberals?“He was outspoken on LGBTQ rights even when every pundit around said that it was a political mistake,” according to the talking points, adding that he also sought to address climate change early in his career and is an unwavering ally of organized labor.• At 76, Mr. Biden may be too old to run for president?He campaigned for nearly 70 candidates, across the ideological spectrum, “across 26 states in the last two years.”Stay tuned, folks.____________________Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers.

More videos later emerged that complicated the story, showing the encounter had been preceded by African-American protesters, who identified themselves as Hebrew Israelites, shouting slurs at the students.The incident has emerged as a kind of Rorschach test for views on politics, race and the Trump administration.We talked to Elizabeth Dias, The New York Times religion correspondent who was in Covington, about what she discovered about our political culture.Lisa: Why did this video touch such a nerve? Elizabeth: There are these flash points now in our political culture. This one was particularly polarizing because it touched every nerve — race, President Trump and the behavior of young white men.As a religion reporter, I’ve covered a lot of sensitive topics and the level of vitriol and aggression from the right and the left about every part of this story is remarkable. Some of the people involved in the videos have been experiencing threats of violence all weekend. So what did you learn about the context for these videos? When you actually are on the ground, in the kids’ community, you start to get an idea of the cultural context behind these kinds of inflamed moments. The school is in an overwhelmingly white, heavily Republican and Catholic area. The boys in the video, their school is known around town as the “Colonel Crazies” for their intense school pride and their all-male brotherhood. And now the Catholic community and the parents of these kids are joining together to protect them.The last time the country was this intensely focused on Catholic high school boys was during the Kavanaugh hearings. This time we’re seeing it in a pocket of the country that fueled Mr. Trump’s election.And with the videos, there’s now this fight over whose narrative wins out.What does this incident tell us about our political culture?So Covington, where this happened, is right across the river from Cincinnati. The Covington area voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, while the Cincinnati area has become increasingly blue. They are very close, but may have very different realities of what it is to be American.How have politicians tried to capitalize on this episode?Mr. Trump jumped into the fray praising the Covington Catholic boys and used the moment to attack the media. I wouldn’t be surprised if the kids get a visit to Washington or the White House or even the State of the Union, if it happens. The right already sees this as part of their narrative — that Christians are under attack.____________________• Furloughed federal workers try to join the gig economy. One woman’s haul on Uber?

507,"Good Wednesday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)Aviation regulators will testify before Senate subcommittees today on the crashes of two Boeing 737 Max 8 Jets, while Boeing meets with airline executives to update them on a fix for the software thought to be responsible for the accidents.The F.A.A.’s acting chief will defend the agency’s practice of delegating some plane safety checks to Boeing as “critical” to the success of the certification process. The official, Daniel Elwell, will argue that the process for the Max 8 was “detailed and thorough.”Senators are expected to ask about long-running doubts about the process. The NYT reports that F.A.A. employees and a Transportation Department watchdog worried over the years that the agency had “too close a relationship” with Boeing officials. Lawmakers will also ask why an update to the jet’s anti-stall software is still not ready.Boeing’s response to the crisis is also being questioned, particularly since its C.E.O., Dennis Muilenburg, has largely remained silent. “Their comments have been very engineering-esque,” Richard Levick, a communications expert, told the NYT. (The company’s public response has become more assertive since hiring the crisis communications firm Sard Verbinnen.)The company will meet today with 200 pilots and airline representatives at the factory where the Max 8 is made. It’s expected to offer some updates on the anti-stall software.More Boeing news: A Max 8 made an emergency landing in Orlando yesterday, though the incident is not thought to be connected to malfunctions that may have led to the two recent crashes.The European Parliament voted yesterday to pass a new copyright law requiring technology platforms to sign licensing agreements with musicians, authors and news publishers in order to post their work online, Adam Satariano of the NYT reports.“The new law is meant to force tech firms to aggressively remove unlicensed copyrighted material from their websites proactively, rather than waiting for complaints to come in before acting,” Mr. Satariano writes.The policy is deeply divisive. Digital rights activists and the tech industry say it could result in censorship. Media organizations say it should protect Europe’s creative industries and ensure companies pay for content they share online.Some digital business models could be affected, because website owners will take on more responsibility for what ends up on their platforms. Sites may find the law too expensive or cumbersome to police: Even Google shuttered its News service, which would require licenses from publishers under the new rules, when a similar initiative was introduced in Spain.Smaller organizations may be hit hardest. These websites contend that giant tech platforms already have the resources to comply with the law, Mr. Satariano writes.Purdue Pharma, the drug maker behind OxyContin, said yesterday that it will settle a lawsuit by Oklahoma’s attorney general over its role in the opioid crisis, Jan Hoffman of the NYT reports.Purdue and its owners will pay $270 million, far more than they have paid in previous settlements. The payout helps Purdue avoid a televised trial that was scheduled to begin on May 28.But many more legal battles await. A federal judge in Cleveland alone is overseeing a consolidated collection of 1,600 lawsuits, and 35 other states have sued Purdue as well.The settlement raises questions about a Purdue bankruptcy. The company has contemplated filing for Chapter 11 protection to help contain the cost of defending or settling its legal fights. In bankruptcy, lawsuit claimants would most likely get only a fraction of any court-determined payout.Chapter 11 weighed heavily in the Oklahoma case. The state made a bird-in-the-hand decision, and other plaintiffs may need to make a similar choice. “The concern is that counties and states may settle on the cheap early to avoid getting little to nothing later on,” Elizabeth Chamblee Burch, a law professor at the University of Georgia, told the NYT.New data about Wall Street compensation shows that the financial sector’s huge pay has widened the national disparity between white men and women and people of color, according to a new report from the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal think tank.New York City’s financial sector bonus pool fell last year by 14 percent from the previous year, to $27.5 billion. But that is still three times bigger than the combined annual earnings of all U.S. full-time minimum-wage workers.A majority of financial workers are white men, especially at the top ranks, according to the institute. No less than 68 percent of senior managers at the five largest U.S. investment banks are white men.But they make up just 37 percent of America’s minimum-wage workers, who have full- or part-time jobs that pay $7.25 an hour. “Due to Washington inaction, the federal minimum wage continues to be a poverty wage, while the reckless bonus culture is alive and well on Wall Street,” the report concludes.As at least 80 patent fights between Apple and Qualcomm trickle through courts around the world, both companies scored victories yesterday, the WSJ reports.Some iPhones now face a U.S. import ban after an International Trade Commission judge issued an initial ruling yesterday finding that Apple had infringed a Qualcomm patent.But Apple scored a bigger victory when another I.T.C. judge ruled that the phone maker had not infringed a Qualcomm patent relating to power efficiency in mobile phones. That overturned a previous court finding.“Qualcomm is hoping a victory, particularly an import ban, could give it greater leverage in technology licensing negotiations,” Bloomberg explains. “Qualcomm says it’s due billions of dollars in unpaid royalties on the iPhone.”“Apple denied infringing any of the patents in the two cases and claimed Qualcomm is trying to shut its only U.S.-based competitor out of the market, something Apple argues will hinder the development of the fifth generation of mobile communications,” Bloomberg adds.Corporate America set a record for stock repurchases last year, even as lawmakers proposed curtailing the practice.Companies bought back $806.4 billion worth of their own shares, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, with $223 billion of that coming in the fourth quarter alone. The previous high was $589.1 billion, set in 2007.The biggest buyer was Apple, which repurchased $101 billion of its stock.The buyback boom was fueled by the Trump tax cuts, with companies preferring to use their savings to repurchase shares and bolster their stock prices, rather than issue dividends or make new investments.And it came despite opposition from Congress, with lawmakers from Senator Bernie Sanders to Senator Marco Rubio arguing in favor of limits on the practice.But a repeat is unlikely this year, as the sugar rush from the tax cuts wears off.In 2013, Google started an ambitious and flashy effort to create robots under the control of Andy Rubin, who later left the company amid accusations of sexual harassment. Now, the company has overhauled the effort with more modest goals — but subtly advanced technology, Cade Metz of the NYT reports.Google’s first robot push was all about advanced machines, and was built on a series of acquisitions. Some of the companies that Google bought relied on humanoid robots, but the tech giant failed to capitalize on them, and sold off or shut down the companies over time.Now the focus is on making robots smarter by injecting them with machine-learning software. “The company is developing ways for these robots to learn skills on their own, like sorting through a bin of unfamiliar objects or navigating a warehouse filled with unexpected obstacles,” Mr. Metz writes.“Google is tight-lipped about how it hopes to deploy the technologies it is working on,” Mr. Metz adds. That’s probably because most researchers see robots being used in warehouses and distribution centers around the world, raising questions about how automation will erode jobs.DealBook exclusive: The Brunswick Group plans to announce this morning that it has hired Michael O’Looney, most recently head of communications at Elliott Management, as a partner in New York and Courtney Chiang Dorman, who previously was the C.O.O. of the law firm Wilson Sonsini, as a partner in San Francisco.JC Penney hired Bill Wafford, most recently the chief financial officer of The Vitamin Shoppe, as its C.F.O.Simon Sutton is reportedly stepping down as HBO’s chief revenue officer.Deals• Lyft reportedly plans to raise the price range of its I.P.O. amid strong investor demand.

509,"Gail Collins: Well, gee, Bret, happy new year. How do you think 2019 has been going so far? I mean, except for the fact that the government is shut down. And Donald Trump is still president.What do you think’s going to happen next?Bret Stephens: And happy new year to you, Gail. My predictions, as our readers know, are unfailingly accurate. I predict that Democrats will fold over the shutdown, Mexico will agree to pay for the wall, House Republicans will vote for impeachment, the Rams will win the Super Bowl and Donald Trump will win the Nobel Prize. For Literature.Gail: Not economics? For his pathbreaking work in demonstrating that governments don’t need to be funded?Bret: “The Collected Tweets of Donald Trump” is surely a worthy successor to the work of William Golding, the 1983 laureate and author of “Lord of The Flies,” in its depiction of adolescent cruelty. Sorry, go on.Gail: I want to know what you think should happen next. Presuming our president doesn’t have a visit from an angel who tells him that instead of building a wall he should concentrate on building — oh, I don’t know, a stairway to the stars? A re-creation of the hanging gardens of Babylon?It looks like the current options, short of actually being rational, are declaring a national emergency, stealing money from the Army Corps of Engineers or just going on like this forever. What’s your pick?Bret: My guess is that he’ll declare a national emergency and allocate Pentagon funds for the border wall. That’s bad news for the country, precisely because it sets a precedent future presidents will abuse for their own partisan purposes. And it will alienate a lot of traditional Republicans, like Senator Marco Rubio, precisely for that reason.But that won’t stop Trump, who isn’t exactly the sort of guy to worry about institutional precedents. He understands that if he folds on wall funding, his presidency is effectively over. It means he will have failed a test of strength against the despised Nancy Pelosi while betraying his core political promise. As when George H.W. Bush broke his campaign promise and raised taxes in 1990 as part of the budget agreement, it will be his “Read My Lips” moment.But could I be wrong? Of course. Predicting what Trump will do is like trying to guess which way the goldfish swims next.Gail: Since you’re presuming the president behaves irrationally, hard to say you’re wrong. My prediction would be that the whole thing winds up in court, creating endless litigation, screwing up the economy and making it impossible for Congress to do anything about anything else.One of the many, many problems here is that the Democrats are just at the beginning of their presidential selection process, so you’ve got around 20 people waving their hands, none of whom have the stature to speak as the opposition. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are both very good at their jobs, but the talents you need to get a bunch of legislators to work together on a party agenda are not the talents you need to rally the country.It’d be nice if we heard some Republicans speak out, but all we’re getting is Lindsey Graham scrambling to win the Best Boy award from the White House. Any signs of a more promising voice? I’m getting kinda tired of patting Jeff Flake on the back. Really, he’s gone.Bret: Our new junior senator from Utah, Mitt Romney, seemed like he might be volunteering for the post of semi-courageous Republican with that op-ed he wrote for The Washington Post. I’m somewhat allergic to Romney because he’s such a transparently calculating politician. But I think he deserves support. The healthiest thing that can happen in 2020 — other than Donald Trump losing the presidency — is a Republican primary challenge to the president from someone like Romney or John Kasich, if only to serve as a reminder that not everyone on the political right has lost his mind. And, of course, we shouldn’t discount the possibility that Trump won’t be on the ballot next year.Gail: Deeply, deeply cynical as I am about Mitt Romney, I would never argue that he wouldn’t be 10 times better a president. And while it’s true I once made fun of Romney’s dog, we have to remember that we now have the first president ever who has never had a pet in his entire life. That says something.You know, we’re agreeing way too much. Let me ask you something that might spark a divide. We just had a story about the veterans’ hospitals and the conservative desire to move all the veterans out of the old system and into private hospitals. What do you think?Bret: For it. The V.A. system has been a scandal-ridden mess for years, with endless stories about substandard medical and nursing care and scandals over hidden waiting lists. It’s one of the reasons Americans should be wary of ever embracing government-run health care as the norm. According to The Times’s own story, “private care could mean shorter waits, more choices and fewer requirements for co-pays.” The whole purpose of a V.A. system is to assure our vets the best possible care, not the worst.I know there are arguments against it, including that it will threaten existing V.A. hospitals and strain the private system. Those arguments remind me a bit of the case against school choice. But the point is that we have these systems to help veterans (or students), and not to maintain the systems for their own sake. What do you think?Gail: In a way it really is like school choice. It’s great when you have a lot of good oversight and citizens are getting more quality options. But we’ve seen examples — Betsy DeVos’s Michigan school privatization efforts come to mind — where all you do is replace deeply imperfect public schools with really terrible privately operated ones. Which cost more and protect the public less.When it comes to things like health and education, privatization only works when you have excellent government monitors. And I am absolutely certain this administration will never find them.Bret: I’m not against regulation, so long as it’s intended to prevent abuses rather than simply impose costs and restrict innovation. But I can’t think of many areas where the private sector doesn’t do a better job than government of providing a service, from delivering mail to running an airline to providing a better quality of education. This is a point I sometimes find myself making to Park Slope progressives who, for ideologically mysterious reasons, somehow wound up sending their kids to private schools like Poly Prep or St. Ann’s instead of their local public schools.Gail: I’m generally fine with, say, giving parents the option of sending their kids to charter schools that have been carefully monitored for quality. But you need very serious oversight. There are too many examples of privatization leading to either lower quality or higher prices for me to be comfortable with just presuming that profit-making services are better than the ones the government offers.And, of course, I’m totally uncomfortable if the folks doing the privatization are reporting to Donald Trump. Hey, I tried to find a non-Trumpian issue for us to discuss and he sneaked back in. Is there any place we can go where he won’t poke his orangy head?Bret: Hmm. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia just voted to rename itself Republic of North Macedonia. Maybe that? Or, wait, the Osiris-Rex space probe is now orbiting the asteroid Bennu. Surely Trump doesn’t have strong views about our space probes.Gail: Bet he thinks the Space Force could have done it better.Bret: Ha! It really is astonishing how completely Trump infects everything. He’s like that guy with a bad flu, coughing and sneezing on a packed subway car. I consider it a point of pride that my first four columns of 2019 mention him only glancingly. I think we’d be serving our readers, and our profession, better if we resolved to try to write about him a lot less this year. Otherwise, as Frank Bruni pointed out in his latest column, we run the risk of becoming his accomplices in amplifying his voice when we should be trying to diminish it.Gail: Frank was so right. But boy this guy is hard to ignore.Bret: By the way, speaking of people who are sucking up a lot of media oxygen, can we discuss the freshman representative known to all by her initials, A.O.C.? Her habits of bending the truth to suit her ideological preconceptions and delight her base have an echo in you-know-who.Gail: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is somebody I was prepared to leave alone for a while. I mean really, she’s 29, a neighborhood organizer who suddenly vaulted into Congress by defeating a very senior and stale member of the Democratic leadership. She deserves a little media vacuum while she’s adjusting. But she’s not going to get it and pretty clearly doesn’t want it anyway.Still, I think you’re underestimating her. She did make some factual errors about military spending and she did bristle when the fact checkers came after her. But then she figured the whole thing out pretty quickly, and thanked the fact-checking community for their good work. That’s the furthest thing from Trumpian.Bret: Fair point. And I’m mindful that she’s a rookie politician who’s bound to make rookie mistakes. Though what mainly bothers me aren’t her misstatements of fact but rather the unworkability of her proposals. The last person to try a 70 percent-plus tax on the rich was François Hollande, the one-term former president of France, and it quickly proved an economic and political fiasco. Is it too much to ask even a young politician to be aware of recent history?This is a country that desperately needs to rediscover its center. Republicans abandoned it when they went with Trump, and I fear Democrats might be tempted to do the same by embracing the proposals of people like Ocasio-Cortez.Gail: Well, it isn’t as if she’s proposing a coup. I say let all the Democrats run their ideas up the flagpole and see what happens. No fair muttering anything about ideas that flap in the breeze."
510,"WASHINGTON — By the time a Republican challenged Representative Steve King of Iowa in the 2016 party primary, Mr. King had already courted far-right foreign leaders, proposed electric wiring atop a border wall to treat illegal immigrants like straying livestock, and said young migrants had “calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.”But in that race Mr. King had the help of fellow Republicans like the then-Gov. Terry Branstad and Senators Charles Grassley and Joni Ernst. Each of those Iowa Republicans overlooked Mr. King’s history of racist remarks and divisive conduct — well before his recent comments about “white supremacy” — and backed Mr. King’s re-election in the state’s most heavily conservative district.Mr. King won handily.“They didn’t care too much about Steve King — it was about the primary voters Steve King represents,” said the former state senator Rick Bertrand, the G.O.P. challenger in that race.He described the support for Mr. King as an act of “self-preservation” by Republican politicians who did not want to cross the hard-line voters in Western Iowa’s conservative heartland. “But now the reality is we may actually lose the seat, so Steve has finally fired Steve,” Mr. Bertrand said.One day after House G.O.P. leaders stripped Mr. King of his committee assignments, Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking Republican, pushed him toward the exits, Iowa Republicans began a “super PAC” aimed at unseating him in 2020 and Ms. Ernst said voters in Iowa would make “the correct choice moving forward” about Mr. King, it was becoming clear that the nine-term lawmaker may finally be facing the ultimate political consequence for his remarks.“It’s racist, we do not support it or agree with it, and I think he should find another line of work,” Ms. Cheney told reporters Tuesday, going even further than the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, about Mr. King’s comment to The Times: “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?”The House also voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to endorse a resolution that rejected white nationalism and white supremacy as “hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people of the United States.” Even though it was aimed at the Iowa Republican, the broadly worded resolution was less than some lawmakers wanted to bring up, and even Mr. King spoke in favor of it.Representative Bobby Rush, an Illinois Democrat, wanted to formally censure Mr. King and drafted a measure to do just that.“My resolution lets Steve King know if he continues this type of behavior, then the next level would be expulsion for him,” said Mr. Rush, who was the only no vote.The confluence of his closer-than-expected re-election, the devastating losses House Republicans suffered with educated and minority voters in November and the blunt-force nature of what he does not deny saying has made Mr. King toxic in his party’s caucus.Yet even as it became clear that his fate may be sealed, many Democrats and, more quietly, some Republicans were wondering why he survived as long as he has given his 15-year record of making what were at a minimum racially provocative comments.His drift toward nativism may have seemed of little consequence when he was a junior lawmaker in George W. Bush-era Washington and Republicans were more sympathetic to immigration.But no other member of Congress has so aggressively sought to develop relationships with white nationalist groups abroad, and those groups became empowered at about the same time the then-candidate Donald J. Trump was making a hard line on immigration his signature issue.As a result, Mr. King’s inflammatory remarks have gained more attention — both because of how they reflect on him and how they cast a brighter light on Mr. Trump and the Republican Party.Some congressional Republicans saw the path Mr. King was on: Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, the chairman of the House campaign arm last year, surprised some in the party by speaking out against Mr. King shortly before the election. Mr. Stivers called Mr. King’s conduct “completely inappropriate” and said “we must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms.”Still, for the most part, G.O.P. officials looked the other way or offered one-off condemnations of Mr. King as his flirtation with nationalist figures like Geert Wilders of the Netherlands deepened and he made increasingly incendiary remarks about, for example, the impossibility of sustaining “civilization with somebody else’s babies.”The tolerance of Mr. King’s conduct — and he did seem emboldened by Mr. Trump’s takeover of the party — stands in contrast to how an earlier generation of Republicans addressed public displays of racial bigotry or racial insensitivity. Bigots like the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke were shunned by party officials, and when the former Senate majority leader Trent Lott used Strom Thurmond’s 100th birthday party to seemingly praise segregation, it cost him his leadership post.So why would Republicans wait until Mr. King flatly defended white supremacy to punish him?“I haven’t been following every utterance of Congressman King. I certainly followed this one, and I think the House Republican conference did the right thing,” Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, told reporters Tuesday.Asked the same question, Mr. McCarthy shot back: “Have I been leader for years?”He said he had been the top House Republican for only “a short amount of time” and was now “in a position to take action.”But one former adviser to the last Republican leader, the former Speaker Paul D. Ryan, pointedly noted on Tuesday that Mr. McCarthy and Steve Scalise, his second-in-command, were not as vocal as Mr. Ryan when it came to Mr. King’s eruptions.Of course, Mr. Ryan never sought to punish Mr. King as severely as Mr. McCarthy did Monday.Former aides to Mr. Ryan and John A. Boehner, another former House speaker, said both admonished Mr. King, but noted that he was a backbencher of little consequence in the Capitol and argued that he had not said anything nearly as incendiary as what he did last week.“Along with public pushback, Paul admonished King directly several times about his behavior,” said AshLee Strong, who was a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan. “These latest comments warrant harsh consequences, and he believes McCarthy did the right thing by booting him.”David Schnittger, a former aide to Mr. Boehner, recalled that his ex-boss called Mr. King’s comments about young migrants smuggling marijuana “deeply offensive and wrong” and pointed out that the then-speaker had privately used an obscenity to describe Mr. King in the aftermath of those remarks.Another former aide to Mr. Boehner, Michael Steel, said Mr. King’s behavior had reached “a tipping point” but conceded that congressional Republicans also face a political imperative.“If you’re going to win back the majority by winning suburban districts in places like California and New Jersey, it’s important to take a firm line against this sort of thing,” Mr. Steel said.But he said publicly what many Republicans say privately: that excommunicating Mr. King will matter little if Mr. Trump is the nominee in 2020.“Whatever we do on Steve King is on the margins compared to what the president says and does,” Mr. Steel said.In Iowa, Mr. King’s longtime supporters said they felt that he was unfairly treated by the media and that the warm and engaging lawmaker they saw in the largely rural district was nothing like the caricature they read about.But after defeating a little-known Democrat by only just over three percentage points and increasingly shifting his attention from the soybean rows and hog processing plants around Sioux City to the fringe nationalist politics in other countries, Mr. King’s defenders started to lose their patience.“Who cares who the mayor of Toronto is when you’re from northwest Iowa?” said Mark Lundberg, the former chairman of the Sioux County Republican Party, alluding to Mr. King’s endorsement last fall of Faith Goldy, a white-nationalist candidate in Canada’s largest city. “It was just a constant.”While calling Mr. King “a good guy,” Mr. Lundberg said that he crossed a line with his comments on white supremacy and that it was time for the district to rally behind a candidate “without all the controversy.”Echoing Mr. Bertrand, Mr. Lundberg acknowledged that there was “great concern” in the party about how close Mr. King’s re-election was — leaving little doubt that what is partly driving the calculation to nudge him out is that he may imperil the party’s hold on what is otherwise a safe Republican seat.Republicans there have created a super PAC called Iowa Four, named after the district, to target Mr. King, according to an Iowa Republican involved with the planning. And the conservative Club for Growth PAC has made inquiries in the state about finding a potential alternative to the incumbent.Mr. King already has two Republican opponents, and Mr. Bertrand did not rule out another bid.“The day of reckoning has come, and now it is just a matter of how the story ends,” crowed Nick Ryan, an Iowa Republican strategist who has long sought to oust Mr. King.For the first time since 1899, Mr. Ryan noted, Iowa does not have a member on the House Agriculture Committee.And two of Iowa’s largest newspapers, The Des Moines Register and The Sioux City Journal, each published an editorial Tuesday urging Mr. King to resign.But he has given no indication that he will resign. He said on the House floor Tuesday that he “understands and recognizes the gravity of this issue” and insisted that he rejects white supremacy.But his critics in Iowa were already testing out their attacks, suggesting voters would not return a lawmaker to office who is too controversial to even serve on any committees.“He has been rendered impotent,” Mr. Bertrand said. “The national folks are forcing the local hand.”"
511,"Good Friday. Want this by email? Sign up here.Amazon yesterday canceled its plans to build a huge corporate campus in New York City.• The decision was an abrupt turnabout after a yearlong search for a second headquarters. The tech giant ultimately decided to open two new sites — in Queens and in Virginia. Each would have gained an estimated 25,000 jobs.• But Amazon faced a backlash in New York from lawmakers, activists and union leaders who said it didn’t deserve nearly $3 billion in government incentives.• “The company made its decision late Wednesday, after growing increasingly concerned that the backlash in New York showed no sign of abating and was tarnishing its image beyond the city,” J. David Goodman of the NYT writes.• “Looking at the opposition and the timeline we decided we don’t want to work in this environment in the long term,” Jodi Seth, the head of policy communications for Amazon, told NBC News.This could be a turning point for corporate-civic relations. It will surely change how companies think about doing business in certain states and cities. It’s also likely to make political leaders — especially in Democratic regions — reconsider offering tax incentives to lure business. (One big question here: Should states and cities be allowed to offer subsidies to business in the first place?)It’s also a clear sign that leftist views are gaining traction. The news is a short-term win for progressive politicians like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who are championing what they say are socialist messages. (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez appeared to revel in the decision on Twitter, saying that “anything is possible.”) But in the longer term, those lawmakers may face a backlash if the loss of those 25,000 jobs in Long Island City hurts the local economy.And it raises questions about the wider understanding of finance. “N.Y.C. wasn’t handing cash to Amazon. It was an incentive program based on job creation, producing tax revenue,” Andrew tweeted. “There isn’t a $3 billion pile of money that can now be spent on subways or education.”More: The news came as a shock even to some of the labor groups that opposed the plans. Here’s what people are saying about the decision in New York City. Real-estate brokers are in despair. And tech could keep gaining ground in the city regardless.President Trump looks set to sign a bipartisan deal as soon as today to provide funding for border security and the federal government. But he’s also expected to declare a national emergency to get more money to build his long-promised border wall.Everything nearly fell apart yesterday. “The president was frustrated after a briefing by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and others on details of the final deal to avoid a shutdown,” the WaPo reports, citing unnamed officials involved in the discussions. But assertions by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, that the president had actually beaten Democrats helped sway Mr. Trump.By declaring a national emergency, Mr. Trump is hoping to gain access to billions more in federal funds. Combined with the spending bill and other ways of diverting money, he expects to get about $8 billion. (He originally asked for $5.7 billion from Congress.)There are huge concerns about the declaration. “Mr. Trump’s willingness to invoke emergency powers to circumvent Congress is likely to go down as an extraordinary violation of constitutional norms — setting a precedent that future presidents of both parties may emulate to unilaterally achieve their own policy goals,” Charlie Savage of the NYT writes.What next? House Democrats will probably try to terminate any declaration and the Senate may follow suit, Nicholas Fandos of the NYT writes. But Mr. Trump would veto that legislation, and it’s unlikely that Congress could override him. The White House could face legal battles over the declaration for years.The social network is in talks with the Federal Trade Commission to settle allegations of privacy violations. It could lead to a record multibillion-dollar fine, Cecilia Kang of the NYT writes:• “The company and the F.T.C.’s consumer protection and enforcement staff have been in negotiations over a financial penalty for claims that Facebook violated a 2011 privacy consent decree with the agency.”• The investigation began shortly after the Cambridge Analytica data scandal came to light in March 2018.• “Some F.T.C. officials have pressed for maximum penalties because of several new reports of potential privacy breaches since the start of the investigation. The agency can seek up to $41,000 for each violation found by the agency. In the case of Cambridge Analytica, 87 million people were affected.”• “The current talks have not yet reached the F.T.C.’s five commissioners for a vote and it is unclear how close the two sides are to wrapping up the nearly 11-month investigation.”More Facebook news: The social network reportedly uses its apps to track people that it believes are risks to its employees.Negotiators concluded talks today with no official announcement of an agreement, Keith Bradsher of the NYT reports. That leaves the state of the negotiations uncertain ahead of a deadline in two weeks.• “The two sides have been struggling with more than 100 issues raised by the United States in a lengthy statement given to Chinese officials in May.”• Expectations for the talks were low, though some progress was made in the prelude to this week’s discussions. For example, China agreed to disclose more of its government subsidies to the World Trade Organization.• But big hurdles remained, Mr. Bradsher writes, including “the Trump administration’s desire to put meaningful restrictions on China’s ability to keep investing enormous sums of money from the government, and from government-affiliated financial institutions, in a wide range of advanced manufacturing sectors that compete with American industries.”• “The United States had given China a March 2 deadline toward reaching a deal and threatened to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent. But Mr. Trump suggested this week that he could give China more time if the talks showed progress.”• It’s unclear whether the talks went far enough for that extension to be granted.The British Prime Minister suffered an embarrassing defeat over Britain’s exit from the European Union last night, Stephen Castle of the NYT reports.Her current plan lacks support. “By a margin of 303 to 258, lawmakers failed to support a motion endorsing the government’s battered strategy,” Mr. Castle writes, noting that “a fragile truce within her Conservative Party collapsed.”That could undermine her negotiations in Europe. “Mrs. May has assured European negotiators that she can get a majority for a revised Brexit plan, if they make some concessions,” Mr. Castle notes. But yesterday’s vote suggests that lawmakers still can’t coalesce around a single plan, leaving the E.U. with little incentive to budge.What now? British officials are “preparing to compromise on their demands for a rewrite of the Brexit agreement,” and may not ask the E.U. to reopen the existing withdrawal agreement, Bloomberg reports, citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter.But she’s short on time. On Feb. 27, lawmakers are expected to try again to take control of the process out of Mrs. May’s hands. That gives her two weeks to develop a plan that Parliament likes. Given the lack of progress to date, that looks like a tall order.More Brexit news: Brussels rejected calls for dual-listed shares in London and the E.U. in the event of no deal. The New York Stock Exchange took the S.E.C. to court yesterday over a so-called Transaction Fee Pilot program that sorts listed stocks into categories with varying price controls. In a WSJ op-ed, Stacey Cunningham, the exchange’s president, explains why:• “The new rule amounts to an unnecessary exercise in government price-setting that will add a new layer of complexity to equity markets.”• “The Transaction Fee Pilot imposes government control on the incentives that public markets can offer. Market-maker benefits will be sharply reduced for some securities and fully eliminated for others.”• “The N.Y.S.E. voiced its concerns to the S.E.C. during its public-comment period. We argued that the pilot will undermine the ability of market forces to drive capital formation and will fail at its goal of measuring broker conflicts.”• “The S.E.C. freely admits it has no idea whether its pilot program will help or harm investors.

512,"WASHINGTON — President Trump declared a national emergency on the border with Mexico on Friday in order to access billions of dollars that Congress refused to give him to build a wall there, transforming a highly charged policy dispute into a confrontation over the separation of powers outlined in the Constitution.Trying to regain momentum after losing a grinding two-month battle with lawmakers over funding the wall, Mr. Trump asserted that the flow of drugs, criminals and illegal immigrants from Mexico constituted a profound threat to national security that justified unilateral action.“We’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and we’re going to do it one way or the other,” he said in a televised statement in the Rose Garden barely 13 hours after Congress passed a spending measure without the money he had sought. “It’s an invasion,” he added. “We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country.”But with illegal border crossings already down and critics accusing him of manufacturing a crisis, he may have undercut his own argument that the border situation was so urgent that it required emergency action. “I didn’t need to do this, but I’d rather do it much faster,” he said. “I just want to get it done faster, that’s all.”The president’s decision incited instant condemnation from Democrats, who called it an unconstitutional abuse of his authority and vowed to try to overturn it with the support of Republicans who also objected to the move.“This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a joint statement.Mr. Trump’s announcement came during a freewheeling, 50-minute appearance in which he ping-ponged from topic to topic, touching on the economy, China trade talks and his coming summit meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. The president again suggested that he should win the Nobel Peace Prize, and he reviewed which conservative commentators had been supportive of him, while dismissing Ann Coulter, who has not.Sounding alternately defensive and aggrieved, Mr. Trump explained his failure to secure wall funding during his first two years in office when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress by saying, “I was a little new to the job.” He blamed “certain people, a particular one, for not having pushed this faster,” a clear reference to former Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, a Republican.Mr. Trump’s assertions were replete with misinformation and, when challenged by reporters, he refused to accept statistics produced by his own government that conflicted with his narrative.“The numbers that you gave are wrong,” he told one reporter. “It’s a fake question.”On point after point, the president insisted that he would be proved correct. “People said, ‘Trump is crazy,’” he said at one point, discussing his outreach to Mr. Kim. “And you know what it ended up being? A very good relationship.”[President Trump declared a national emergency. What happens now?]Mr. Trump acknowledged that his declaration of a national emergency would be litigated in the courts and even predicted a rough road for his side. “Look, I expect to be sued,” he said, launching into a mocking riff about how he anticipated lower court rulings against him. “And we’ll win in the Supreme Court,” he predicted.Indeed, Public Citizen, an advocacy group, filed suit by the end of the day on behalf of three Texas landowners whose property might be taken for a barrier. California and New York likewise announced that they will sue over what Gov. Gavin Newsom of California called the president’s “vanity project,” and a roster of other groups lined up to do the same. “Fortunately, Donald Trump is not the last word,” said Mr. Newsom, a Democrat. “The courts will be the last word.”Among those predicting a flurry of judicial decisions against Mr. Trump was George T. Conway III, a conservative lawyer and the husband of Kellyanne Conway, the president’s counselor. “If he knows he is going to lose,” Mr. Conway, a vocal critic of Mr. Trump, wrote on Twitter, “then he knows he is violating the Constitution and laws he has sworn to uphold.”The House Judiciary Committee announced Friday that it would investigate the president’s emergency claim, while House Democrats plan to introduce legislation to block it. That measure could pass both houses of Congress if it wins the votes of the half-dozen Republican senators who have criticized the declaration, forcing Mr. Trump to issue the first veto of his presidency.The emergency declaration, according to White House officials, enables the president to divert $3.6 billion from military construction projects to the wall. Mr. Trump will also use more traditional presidential discretion to tap $2.5 billion from counternarcotics programs and $600 million from a Treasury Department asset forfeiture fund.Combined with $1.375 billion authorized for fencing in the spending package passed on Thursday night, Mr. Trump would have about $8 billion in all for barriers, significantly more than the $5.7 billion he unsuccessfully demanded from Congress.The president opted not to tap hurricane relief money from Texas or Puerto Rico, an idea that had generated angry complaints from Republicans. But he expressed no concern that diverting military construction money would delay projects benefiting the troops like base housing, schools and gyms. “It didn’t sound too important to me,” he said.Neither the White House nor the Pentagon had yet identified which projects may be shelved as a result, but Pentagon lawyers and other officials planned to work over the weekend to identify which construction funds would be diverted.The declaration also provided that land may be transferred to the Defense Department from other federal agencies or from privately purchased or condemned land. The next step would be to secure those lands, where the Pentagon would erect barriers. The declaration gives Patrick Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, broad latitude to carry out this process.Most Americans oppose Mr. Trump’s emergency declaration, according to polls. One released this week by Fox News found 56 percent against it, including 20 percent of Republicans.Mr. Trump’s desire for approval by Fox and other conservative news outlets was on display when he identified various pundits as supporters, naming Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Tucker Carlson and Rush Limbaugh, although he insisted that “they don’t decide policy.”But Ms. Coulter, who has viscerally attacked Mr. Trump for caving on the wall, has clearly gotten under his skin. “I don’t know her,” he said before quickly correcting himself. “I hardly know her. I haven’t spoken to her in way over a year.” He noted, though, that she was an early predictor of his election victory. “So I like her, but she’s off the reservation,” he said. “But anybody that knows her understands that.”Ms. Coulter fired back shortly afterward. “The only national emergency is that our president is an idiot,” she said on KABC radio in Los Angeles.White House officials rejected criticism from across the ideological spectrum that Mr. Trump was creating a precedent that future presidents could use to ignore the will of Congress. Republicans have expressed concern that a Democratic commander in chief could cite Mr. Trump’s move to declare a national emergency over gun violence or climate change without legislation from Congress.“It actually creates zero precedent,” Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, told reporters. “This is authority given to the president in law already. It’s not as if he just didn’t get what he wanted so he’s waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money.”Presidents have declared national emergencies under a 1970s-era law about five dozen times, and 31 of those prior emergencies remain active. But most of them dealt with foreign crises and involved freezing property, blocking trade or exports or taking other actions against national adversaries, not redirecting money without explicit congressional authorization.White House officials cited only two times that such emergency declarations were used by presidents to spend money without legislative approval — once by President George Bush in 1990 during the run-up to the Persian Gulf war, and again by his son, President George W. Bush, in 2001 after the terrorist attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.In both of those cases, the presidents were responding to new events — the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and Al Qaeda’s assault on the United States — and were moving military funds around for a military purposes. Neither was taking action specifically rejected by Congress.In Mr. Trump’s case, he is defining a longstanding problem at the border as an emergency even though border apprehensions have actually fallen in recent years, to 400,000 in the last fiscal year from a peak of 1.6 million in the 2000 fiscal year. And unlike either of the Bushes, he is taking action after failing to persuade lawmakers to go along with his plans through the regular appropriations process.[Read the first edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up for it here.]The spending package passed Thursday by Congress included none of the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump demanded for 234 miles of steel wall. Instead, it provided $1.375 billion for about 55 miles of fencing. Mr. Trump signed the package into law on Friday anyway to avoid a second government shutdown after the impasse over border wall funding closed the doors of many federal agencies for 35 days and left 800,000 workers without pay.For weeks, Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky urged Mr. Trump not to declare a national emergency, but the president opted to go ahead anyway to find a way out of the political corner he had put himself in with the failed effort to force Congress to finance the wall.Mr. McConnell privately told the president that he would support the move despite his own reservations, but warned Mr. Trump that he had about two weeks to win over critical Republicans to avoid having Congress vote to reject the declaration.Mr. Trump was among those Republicans who criticized President Barack Obama for using his executive authority to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation after failing to persuade Congress to do so. “Repubs must not allow Pres Obama to subvert the Constitution of the US for his own benefit & because he is unable to negotiate w/ Congress,” Mr. Trump tweeted in 2014.But Mr. Trump sought to drive home the personal toll of illegal immigration, inviting to the Rose Garden several relatives of Americans killed by people in the country without authorization. Some of the relatives, known as “angel moms,” stood up holding pictures of loved ones who had died.“Matthew’s death was preventable and should have been prevented,” one of the women, Maureen Maloney, said in an interview after the event. Her son Matthew Denice, 23, was killed in 2011 in a motorcycle accident in Massachusetts after colliding with an automobile driven by an undocumented immigrant. “He should have never been here in the first place,” she said. “If he wasn’t here, it wouldn’t have happened.”"
513,"Good Monday. Want this by email? Sign up here.Bipartisan negotiations to forge a border security deal broke down yesterday, potentially setting up the federal government for another shutdown ahead of a Friday deadline.What happened? “The impasse appears to center on Democratic demands for a limit on the number of unauthorized immigrants already in the country who could be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, according to aides familiar with the talks,” according to the NYT. Republicans wanted an exception to the cap for criminals; Democrats said a proposed 16,500-bed cap left more than enough room for them.What’s at stake? The last shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, cost the American economy $11 billion and tanked President Trump’s political standing with the public. Another shutdown could cause more economic harm, hitting the I.R.S. just as tax season starts.What’s next? Lawmakers could pass another short-term spending bill, though many are reluctant to punt on a final budget agreement again. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump is preparing to hold a rally for supporters in El Paso. (Many in the city aren’t happy with that.) But he really has only two choices, according to Axios: shut down the government or declare a national emergency to get border wall money, and “both options are horrible.”The Amazon founder risked embarrassment by going public with what he said was an extortion attempt by The National Enquirer. So far, he’s scoring big points (“Saturday Night Live” jokes aside).His disclosure has gotten results. Federal prosecutors are reviewing his extortion claim, the NYT reports, citing unnamed sources. If The Enquirer’s parent company broke the law, it would be in violation of a nonprosecution agreement over its paying hush money to help President Trump in 2016. (A lawyer for the publisher’s chairman said yesterday that the company committed no crime.)And he’s winning the P.R. battle. At a time when billionaires are reviled, Maureen Dowd of the NYT writes, “the richest dude on earth has managed to come through a traumatic week inspiring admiration.” (Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept counters that it would be odd for Mr. Bezos to gain pity, given that Amazon “is a critical partner for the U.S. government in building an ever-more invasive, militarized and sprawling surveillance state.”)Where did The Enquirer go wrong? Danny Westneat of The Seattle Times points out that it picked a fight with the head of a company so powerful that it got Seattle to change its tax policies and won $3 billion in tax incentives from New York for office space. “You don’t pressure Amazon. It only goes the other way around,” Mr. Westneat writes.But Mr. Bezos could still lose. Jon Swartz of Barron’s notes that Amazon shares fell 2.6 percent on Friday. “His hands-on management is considered crucial to the success of the company and anything that pulls his attention away from day-to-day management is at least a concern for investors,” Mr. Swartz writes.Fears that Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U. could roil economies have now officially spread across the Atlantic.Wall Street has been warned about Brexit’s impact. “With less than seven weeks to go before the U.K. is due to leave the E.U., several S&P 500 groups have for the first time put Wall Street on formal notice of the risks should London and Brussels fail to reach a divorce deal,” the FT reports. Companies like Lockheed Martin, McCormick, Expedia and Cadbury have all spoken out.Driving the concern are fears that a depressed pound could make American goods unaffordable in Britain, while the costs of imported British goods could rise. There’s also a fear about the broader effect of Brexit on global political and economic stability.American banks are also nervous. “While U.S. banks want Britain to maintain the closest possible ties with the EU after Brexit, U.K. banks and insurers are anxious they don’t become beholden to new laws made by Brussels,” Bloomberg reports.More Brexit news: The E.U.’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said that he “will not reopen” the existing Brexit deal, but is open to reworking the political declaration that accompanies it. The British government is trying to secure an extra two weeks in which to win concessions from Europe by promising lawmakers another vote on Britain’s withdrawal options. And Prime Minister Theresa May has also offered concessions to the opposing Labour Party to break the current impasse in Parliament.Americans are getting a rude surprise: Their refunds appear to be getting smaller, despite President Trump and Republicans passing a huge set of tax cuts over a year ago.How big is the drop? “The average refund of $1,865 was 8.4 percent smaller than the average refund in the period last year,” Reuters reports, citing figures from the I.R.S. Heather Long of the WaPo adds that the number of people receiving a refund has fallen by nearly 25 percent so far. (The I.R.S. warns not to read too much into the figures, because this is just part of the data — a result of delayed processing due to the government shutdown.)Why is this happening? It’s not actually a sign that Americans are paying more in taxes. “People generally got a piece of their tax cut last year gradually in the form of lower withholding on their paychecks,” Joseph Rosenberg of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center told the WaPo.People are angry nonetheless. The WaPo reports: “People have already taken to social media, using the hashtag #GOPTaxScam, to vent their anger. Many blame President Trump and the Republicans for shrinking refunds. Some on Twitter even said they wouldn’t vote for Trump again after seeing their refunds slashed.”The last class of tech companies that gained valuations of over $1 billion, including Uber and Airbnb, remade entire industries. Don’t expect the next wave to be nearly as flashy, according to Erin Griffith of the NYT.Who are they? They have names like Benchling, Checkr and Zola, and many create software for specific industries — including data analysis systems for farmers and background checks for gig workers.Why aren’t they as exciting as their predecessors? Ms. Griffith points out that Uber, Airbnb and their peers “built global empires by simply taking existing businesses — like taxis, food delivery and hotels — and making them mobile.” Easy opportunities to disrupt traditional businesses have dried up, forcing new companies to find smaller niches.But don’t underestimate their potential. “Maybe it’s not as sexy as the companies in the first wave,” the venture capitalist Kirsten Green conceded to the NYT. But Anand Sanwal of the data provider CB Insights said they were still growing fast, adding, “If you are one of those high-momentum companies, investors are going to be beating down your door because there is so much interest in investing in the next big winner.”Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned yesterday of a global economy “that is growing more slowly than we had anticipated.”She sees four big risks. “Trade tensions and tariff escalations, financial tightening, uncertainty related to Brexit outcome and spillover impact and an accelerated slowdown of the Chinese economy” are all “clouds” on the horizon, she told the World Government Summit in Dubai.And they could spell trouble. “When there are too many clouds,” she added, it takes just one lighting bolt “to start the storm.”But the I.M.F. thinks the Fed is playing smart. “The fact that the Fed has put a pause on raising rates is going to provide a lot of support to the economy,” Gita Gopinath, the I.M.F.’s top economist, told the FT. “We endorse the Fed view of having a data-driven approach.”President Trump is expected to sign an executive order today meant to spur the development and regulation of artificial intelligence, Cade Metz of the NYT writes.The news: Mr. Trump is to introduce the “American A.I. Initiative,” which aims to better educate workers in the field, improve access to the cloud computing services and data needed to build A.I. systems, and promote cooperation with foreign powers.Context: “A.I. experts across industry, academia and government have long called on the Trump administration to make the development of artificial intelligence a major priority,” Mr. Metz writes, adding that they are “concerned that China could surpass the United States” in the development of such technologies.But: “The order does not set aside funds for A.I. research and development,” Mr. Metz adds, “and the administration provided few details on how it will put its new policies into effect.”Steve Mandel has stepped down as the head of the hedge fund Lone Pine Capital.Among the reasons Santander rescinded its offer to hire the investment banker Andrea Orcel?

514,"WASHINGTON — Ebullient Democrats assumed control of the House on Thursday and elected Representative Nancy Pelosi of California speaker, returning her to a historic distinction as the first woman to hold the post. They then moved to defy President Trump and passed bills that would open government agencies shuttered by an impasse over his insistence on funding for a border wall. Both measures are almost certain to die in the Senate.On the first day of divided government in a reordered Washington, Ms. Pelosi, now second in line to the presidency, and Mr. Trump clashed from their respective ends of Pennsylvania Avenue almost from dawn until dusk.The California Democrat began her day by suggesting that a sitting president could be indicted. Late in the day, Mr. Trump made an attention-getting appearance in the White House briefing room with a belligerent demand for a wall on the border with Mexico, drawing a rebuke from the newly installed House speaker, who said she would give no more than a dollar to fund what she branded “an immorality.”In between, as the start of the new House showcased a younger and more diverse majority in the staid corridors of the Capitol, Ms. Pelosi pledged to run a “unifying” Congress that would bridge partisan divides and heal rifts in a polarized country.“Our nation is at a historic moment,” she declared. “I pledge that this Congress will be transparent, bipartisan and unifying, that we will seek to reach across the aisle in this country, and across divisions across our nation.”In ascending to the speakership, Ms. Pelosi finds herself at the fulcrum of a bitterly divided body politic, poised to do battle with and demand accountability from an increasingly combative Mr. Trump in ways that the Republican Congress of the past two years refused to. With Mr. Trump, his presidential campaign and his businesses all under federal and state investigations, Ms. Pelosi’s approach to confronting him — both through investigation and legislation — will probably define the 116th Congress.She wasted no time in doing so on Thursday, hours after being sworn in. The late-night, nearly party-line votes on reopening the government began a pattern in an era of divided control, with a Democratic House passing legislation that has no chance of being signed by the Republican president, and the Republican Senate running interference to protect Mr. Trump. The White House had also issued an official statement threatening a veto.“Let’s not waste the time,” said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader.Mr. Trump used his abrupt appearance in the White House briefing room — his first since taking office — to talk about the importance of the wall; he was flanked by border agents who echoed his message.The president congratulated Ms. Pelosi on her election and said he had high aspirations for the new Congress. But he turned immediately to making the case for a wall that Democrats have uniformly rejected, saying, “Without a wall, you cannot have border security.” Mr. Trump also used social media to press his message, posting on his Instagram account a photograph of his face with the text “The Wall Is Coming,” a take on an advertisement for the cable TV series “Game of Thrones” that bore the ominous slogan “Winter Is Coming.”As afternoon turned to evening and the votes to reopen the government approached, Ms. Pelosi told reporters sarcastically, in response to a question, that she would give him $1 — but only that — for the wall.“We’re not doing a wall,” Ms. Pelosi said sternly outside the House chamber. “Does anybody have any doubt that we’re not doing a wall? So that’s that.”That capped a day that began with a warning shot to Mr. Trump, suggesting that a sitting president could be indicted.“I think that is an open discussion in terms of the law,” Ms. Pelosi said in an interview on NBC.In a statement that served as a two-pronged warning, both to her left flank and to the president, she said that the House would not move quickly to impeach Mr. Trump, but would not shy away from doing so if it were warranted.“We have to wait and see what happens with the Mueller report,” Ms. Pelosi said, referring to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. “We shouldn’t be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn’t avoid impeachment for a political reason. So we’ll just have to see how it comes.”[Read here for all of the day’s events.]By early afternoon, partisan politics were put aside, if only briefly, for a transition of power from Republicans to Democrats, as a majority of lawmakers rose in turn from their seats on the House floor to utter Ms. Pelosi’s name and formally award her the gavel she gave up in 2011.Ms. Pelosi ascended to the marble dais in the center of the House chamber with Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the incoming Republican leader, who handed her the wooden gavel.“To the speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi,” he said, “I extend to you the gavel.” The room erupted into applause as she held it aloft.Moments later, with a “Come on, kids!” Ms. Pelosi invited the children and grandchildren of representatives on the floor of the House to surround her as she took the oath of office, becoming the first person since Representative Sam Rayburn more than 60 years ago to reclaim the speakership after losing it.“I now call the House to order on behalf of all of America’s children,” Ms. Pelosi said after she was sworn in.But even in its pledges of unity and a new bipartisan spirit, Ms. Pelosi managed some subtle swipes at the president and his party. At one point while discussing immigration, she quoted President Ronald Reagan.“He said, ‘If we ever close the door to new Americans, our leadership role in the world will soon be lost,’” Ms. Pelosi said, drawing a standing ovation from Democrats in the well of the House, but grim-faced silence from most of those seated on the Republican side.“You don’t applaud for Ronald Reagan?” she scoffed.The scene was strikingly different on the other side of the chamber, where some Democrats wore the traditional clothing of their communities — a Palestinian thobe, a Muslim hijab or head scarf, a Pueblo dress. It was a visual change in a chamber that has for centuries been overwhelmingly white and male.As promised, Democrats approved bills intended to reopen the government and to remake rules of the House. One of the spending bills would fund most shuttered departments and agencies through Sept. 30 and the other is a stopgap measure to restart the Department of Homeland Security for a few weeks.Earlier, they approved a suite of new rules that will set the tone for their majority, including a measure — opposed by liberal members — to require that any policy mandating new funding be accompanied with corresponding tax increases or spending cuts. Another change would automatically raise the statutory limit on the national debt when the House approves a budget, avoiding politically difficult votes each time the ceiling is reached, which dogged Republicans and led to a series of fiscal cliffhangers during their years in the majority.Also included were revisions to ensure that bipartisan proposals could be more easily considered, pushed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers billing themselves the Problem Solvers Caucus.Ms. Pelosi’s election was not without dissent. Having spent more than 15 years at the helm of her party and been demonized by Republicans during the midterm congressional elections as the face of far-left radicalism, Ms. Pelosi, 78, spent the weeks after Democrats won putting down a rebellion over her leadership in Democratic ranks and consolidating support through a combination of deal-cutting and cajoling.She suffered more than a dozen defections: the freshman representatives Anthony Brindisi of New York, Jason Crow of Colorado, Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, Ben McAdams of Utah, Max Rose of New York, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey and Jared Golden of Maine, as well as Representatives Jim Cooper of Tennessee, Ron Kind of Wisconsin, Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania, Kurt Schrader of Oregon and Kathleen Rice of New York.Many of the newly elected members had campaigned calling for change in Washington and for a new generation of leadership for their party, and had promised not to vote for Ms. Pelosi. As part of a final deal to shore up support, Ms. Pelosi agreed to limit her speakership to four years.But two of the ringleaders of the squelched effort to depose Ms. Pelosi, Representatives Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Tim Ryan of Ohio, ultimately voted for her.With her re-election, the biggest Republican super PAC — and the one that arguably tried the hardest in 2018 to link Democratic candidates to Ms. Pelosi — practically celebrated. “Democratic candidates spent the last two years promising voters that they’d be different — they wouldn’t stand for the same old leadership and the same old way of doing business in Washington,” the super PAC, the Congressional Leadership Fund, said in a statement. “Yet with the very first chance they got, they broke their word and their bond with the voters who elected them.”The National Republican Congressional Committee, the party’s House campaign arm, wasted no time in targeting Democrats in competitive districts who voted for Ms. Pelosi, sending voters in their districts texts immediately after the vote, saying that their representatives “are once again ignoring your voice.”“Fight back NOW!” the texts read.The swift political broadsides drew condemnation from Ms. Pelosi’s team.“They threw everything but the kitchen sink at Nancy Pelosi, and her strategy powered by her fund-raising turned 43 red seats blue,” said Drew Hammill, her spokesman. “They wasted tens of millions failing from coast to coast in a tired strategy that did nothing to save their majority.”But amid that partisan acrimony, the spirit of a new generation of Democrats was in evidence in the well of the House. Several lawmakers bounced or rocked infants as they cast their votes for speaker, while Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, at 29 the youngest person to be elected to the House, made a heart sign with her hands at loved ones in the gallery above. Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, voted for Ms. Pelosi for the “future of our children,” she said, while her own two children dabbed beside her."
515,"EL PASO — At a migrant shelter near the Mexican border, three girls from Guatemala — sisters aged 10, 9 and 6 — coughed and sniffled. One of them clung to both a teddy bear and a large bottle of Pedialyte, to soothe her dehydration and flu.The girls’ mother, Nelcy, 28, said her daughters got sick not during their long journey to the border in the back of a pickup truck, but during the 12 days they spent at two crowded government detention facilities before arriving at the privately run shelter in Texas. “It was very cold, especially for the children,” said Nelcy, who would only be identified by her first name. “My children got sick. They gave us aluminum blankets, but it wasn’t enough.”[President Trump warned that he was considering declaring a national emergency to build the border wall.]The shelter network here run by the nonprofit Annunciation House is now receiving roughly 200 new migrants a day, the same number it saw in an entire week only a year ago. The number of migrants traveling as families crossing the border from Mexico exceeded 25,000 in November, the highest numbers ever recorded.Like Nelcy and her daughters, the new arrivals from Central America are coming in much sicker, after being held far longer than ever before in bare-bones government detention facilities never intended for children. Asylum seekers bottled up in Mexico are jumping fences and throwing rocks at officers, who are firing tear gas to push them away. Hundreds of migrants have been released on city streets in recent weeks, uncertain of where to go. Two sick migrant children have died while in custody.A crisis of the kind President Trump has long warned of is beginning to take shape along the country’s 1,900-mile border with Mexico. A border security network built over a period of decades to handle large numbers of single men has in the past several years been inundated with women and children, and as the number of families has peaked in recent months, the system has increasingly been unable to accommodate all of them.Much of the growing chaos, say many of those who work along the border and in some of the government’s own security agencies, is a result of a failed gamble on the part of the Trump administration that a succession of ever-harsher border policies would deter the flood of migrants coming from Central America.It has not, and the failure to spend money on expanding border processing facilities, better transportation and broader networks of cooperation with private charities, they say, has led to the current problems with overcrowding, health threats and uncontrolled releases of migrants in cities along the border.“It’s the complete, 100 percent focus on harsher options that will deter the influx, with a disregard for managing what’s happening,” said a Department of Homeland Security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of being fired. “We have a lot more families, a lot more unaccompanied children, and the focus has just been on how can we deter, rather than how can we handle.”Mr. Trump has made it a priority to end what he calls the practice of “catch and release,” but the policy of holding large numbers of migrants in detention has led to capacity problems. The Obama administration had a policy of releasing migrants who were considered safe and likely to appear in court in order to make room for others who were a higher priority for detention, but the Trump administration has largely eliminated that practice.The number of detainees at Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities has reached its highest point ever, according to figures provided by the agency, with an average daily population of 45,200 single adults and family units.The result is the recent need to release large numbers of migrants, many simply dropped off at bus stations. About 600 migrants were dropped off with no advance planning in El Paso during the last full week in December. Similar releases have happened in recent days and weeks in Arizona and California.The homeland security official said the administration could have done more to improve the situation and avoid the recent mass drop-offs, such as working more closely with nonprofit groups. “They could have put more resources down there, either monetary or physical,” the official said. “There are things you could do to manage it so that it’s not just, ‘We’re overwhelmed. We’re releasing them.’”The administration blames Congress and the courts for creating a system that encourages families who do not qualify for asylum to apply for the status anyway, often living in the country for months or years as their applications move through the courts. Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, has been critical of court rulings that make it difficult to hold migrants with children in detention for long periods — creating what officials say is a loophole that is encouraging migrants to bring their children on long, treacherous journeys from Central America.“Secretary Nielsen has been saying for over a year to anyone who would listen — especially members of Congress — that our frontline men and women don’t have the adequate resources needed for the number of aliens we are apprehending,” Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, said in a statement. “This humanitarian crisis is driven by activist court rulings and poorly written laws that incentivize the smuggling of illegal immigrants under the age of 18.”At the direction of the White House, the Department of Homeland Security has churned out a series of aggressive initiatives aimed at discouraging migrants from coming. Most of them have been quickly blocked by the courts.Last year, the government announced it would arrest close to 100 percent of all those who crossed the border illegally and separate them from their children — a measure that was blocked by the courts and rescinded. Later, the administration tried to prevent migrants from applying for asylum anywhere but at legal border crossings, and then limited the number of migrants it would process each day at those border stations. That policy created logjams and escalating tensions at border stations from Texas to California, though part of it, too, was enjoined by the courts.Some of those involved in the policymaking said that there was open acknowledgment within the government that the newest policies under development — a plan that would require asylum seekers to wait in Mexico through the duration of their immigration cases, and one to build tent cities along the border to house more families — were either likely to face an immediate court injunction or were so costly that they could not be justified to taxpayers. But the officials said they were under orders from the White House to push forward.“It’s like, ‘O.K., why are we working on this if it’s just another lawsuit in the making?’” said a second Homeland Security official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Everybody knows that it’s going to be challenged in the courts and likely struck down. I don’t think the people at the top feel like they have a choice. They just do what they are asked to do.”The situation has become more tense in recent weeks as ICE authorities, who in the past were careful to coordinate with volunteer shelters when releasing migrants, have instead begun dropping them in large numbers in the streets in Texas, Arizona and California, forcing city officials and charity groups to scramble.“We’re dealing with the symptoms of the root cause, which is the lack of a rational immigration policy from Washington, and both sides are culpable,” said Dee Margo, the mayor of El Paso.City officials have been told that the government may soon increase the number of migrants released in El Paso to 500 daily. “That may be a killer, that may be a real challenge for us to be able to deal with,” Mr. Margo said.The government itself is dealing with some of the most acute problems — housing large numbers of families in border processing centers built to handle single men.In Yuma, Ariz., 87 percent of migrants apprehended in the current fiscal year were traveling as a family, and 50 percent of them were children. Expenditures have shot up 600 percent since last year, with the money being spent on diapers, feminine care products, snacks and juice, said a Border Patrol official in the state who was not authorized to speak on the record.While the Yuma office was approved for some overtime funding and additional agents, requests for a modular facility to house children and families have been denied, the official said. The new building would add more showers to the current number, which is three, as well as add beds and play rooms for children.The administration’s aggressive focus on deterrence has built up the frustration of the migrants themselves. After trying to jump the fence at Tijuana and fleeing a wave of tear gas on New Year’s Eve, Fernando Duarte, a 22-year-old Honduran, was among those hurling rocks at Border Patrol officers. He said he was determined to try again.“They are very wrong if they think tear gas will keep me from trying,” Mr. Duarte said. “I am trying to get a better future and a little gas won’t stop me.”Nowhere has the growing desperation of migrants been more apparent than in Tijuana. The high volume of migrants from Central America arriving there has collided with the Trump administration’s decision to ration the number of asylum requests processed each day. Private shelters in Tijuana managed by local Christian and Catholic groups are near capacity, pushing new migrants into tent cities and improvised shelters that lack proper sanitation.“The ones that are waiting for the door to open, they’re waiting three or four months,” said Victor Clark Alfaro, the director of the Binational Center for Human Rights in Tijuana. “Others are getting desperate and prefer to try to cross illegally.”In November, municipal leaders in Tijuana opened an improvised shelter at the Benito Juarez Sports Complex that turned, as Mr. Clark Alfaro put it, into a “Central American ghetto.” The conditions there grew increasingly dismal as winter brought cold weather and rain, and about 6,000 people were crowded into the stadium at one point, far beyond its capacity of roughly 2,000. The city shut down the shelter. As a replacement, the government opened a new shelter in El Barretal on the east side of Tijuana.The Barretal shelter is a large compound where hundreds of sleeping tents are lined up on the clean concrete floor. Freshly laundered clothes hang from balconies and staircases.Inside, Isabel Lázaro Díaz, 30, finished the meal she had waited in a long line for: grilled chicken, rice and beans.“On the way here, I regretted it a thousand times,” she said of her decision to leave her native Guatemala with her 5-year-old son, adding of Mr. Trump, “What he is doing is making us feel frustration and despair and putting us in a closed box with four closed walls, no entry or exit.”"
516,"The weekend traffic in the center of Athens was awful on the late January day I decided to visit the site of Plato’s Academy. Each of the narrow, slightly dog-legged streets in Plaka, the old city, was completely jammed, because recent angry protests, some of them violent, had forced the closing of roads around Syntagma, or Constitution Square.Still, pedestrians were out in impressive force, filling the streets, intent on enjoying their Saturday shopping. Athenians take their weekends very seriously. Pantelis, my cabdriver, threaded his way delicately around people suddenly lurching, seemingly semi-oblivious, into the street and the constant chorus of motorcycles appearing out of nowhere and disappearing noisily into the distance.Once past the clogged junction at Monastiraki Square, we pushed more easily along Ermou Street and headed northwest. We came to an area scattered with warehouses and former factories. The cab stopped by a huddle of abandoned buses. Ahead of us was what looked like an open area of greenery. Pantelis pointed and said, “Akadimia Platonos.” This must be the place, I thought.Plato’s Academy is now a public park in a not particularly nice part of town. It is just next to Colonus, Sophocles’ birthplace and, according to the legend he helped to invent, the final resting place of Oedipus. The day was cool and sunny, but the previous 48 hours had been filled with storms, strong winds and intense rain.As I entered the park from the south, the ground was muddy with large puddles. My boots slipped and slid underfoot as I made my way past a man talking loudly on a cellphone in what I think was Bengali. A couple were playing in the distance with their dog. There was an empty playground and a rather nice gravel area for playing pétanque, which is apparently popular with the locals. It was also deserted.I oriented myself with notes and guidebooks and made my way to the ruins of Gymnasium, which is thought to have been the main building of the Academy. A large grassy hollow indicated the site of a former archaeological dig. I peered through some trees into the open, green area of the ruins. There was a solitary man standing, very reflectively, smoking a huge joint with what appeared to be a bottle of water at his feet. In fact, the only people I saw around the various ruins were doing exactly the same thing as this man: quietly getting wasted on a Saturday lunchtime. I began to doubt whether the liquid was water or some kind of clear alcohol, as these men didn’t have the appearance of compulsive Brooklyn yoga hydrators. Ah, the sacred groves of academe!After a moment’s hesitation, I walked down into the ruins, exchanged a brief “ya sass” (hello) with the man, who didn’t seem to care in the slightest that I was there. It was very quiet, and all around was a calming, low chatter of birds. No riots here.I began to try to imagine the Academy.The school, founded by Plato around 387 B.C.E., was named the Hecademia and later Academia after the nearby sanctuary dedicated to the hero Hecademus. In Plato’s time, the area occupied about 1.5 hectares (about 3.5 acres) and was reached by leaving the city of Athens by the Diplon gate and walking along a road flanked by a public cemetery. The Gymnasium was a rectangular complex, approximately 200 feet long and 100 feet wide. Standing in the ruins, the scale of the building felt larger than I had anticipated. The site was excavated in 1929-39 and a plan of the main building was published.An open courtyard or atrium was surrounded on three sides by a single-story, roofed colonnade or peristyle, which may have provided shelter for academicians engaged in reading and copying papyri or perhaps just passing the time. In the middle of the atrium stood a cistern, which supplied water, and farther north are the remains of a pedestal on which stood statues of the nine muses, the protectresses of the arts and letters.The Academy is literally a museum, a temple or a sacred space, an association that is continued in Aristotle’s Lyceum and on into the most famous library of the ancient world: the Museum of Alexandria (which contained its famous and famously destroyed library), founded by the Ptolemies after 297 B.C.E.Behind the muses was the main building of the Academy, divided into a number of rooms. We are not exactly sure of their function, but it is highly likely that they were used for teaching and were equipped with boards, writing materials, geometric instruments, globes and celestial spheres. But the center of the Academy was the library, well stocked with texts, stacked papyri, possibly with labels, on which the titles were inscribed. The library was the first of its kind in Athens.To delve a little deeper, here’s an intriguing question: What was on the shelves of Plato’s library? What had he read and what did he give his students to read? We can only guess, but it’s likely there would have been writings on mathematics, geometry and medicine, volumes by Homer and Hesiod. From the evidence of the Dialogues, it is clear that Plato had read the long-lost works of pre-Socratic thinkers like Heraclitus (“On Nature”) and Anaxagoras (“Nous”), and texts by the Eleatic thinkers like Parmenides. It is also said that Plato made an extremely expensive purchase of three works by Pythagoras. There would also have been works by the Sophists, whom Plato loathed, and possibly the widely read works of the atomists, like Democritus, whom Plato completely ignored, possibly out of envy.In addition to the bookshelves storing these texts, there was possibly a wooden dais for the readings, lectures and discussions that took place daily. Most intriguing perhaps in the design of the Academy is the House of the Reader, or anagnostes. It is said that a young Aristotle served as Reader or Lector during his 20 years in the Academy. Apparently, he was nicknamed Nous or Mind by Plato, which seems appropriate. It would appear that the agnostic Reader was responsible for reading aloud every treatise submitted for publication in the Academy.What is striking is the wholly geometric nature of the design of the Academy, which my new friend, Mr. Staikos, thinks was due to the influence of the Pythagorean school that Plato encountered on his trips to Sicily and that had been revived by Archytas of Taras, a friend of Plato’s and some say the model for the philosopher king described in the Republic. Legend has it that the motto of the Academy, written over the entrance, was “Let no one ignorant of geometry enter.” For the Academy is not just a building. It is an idea, in accordance with Plato’s theory of the forms, but also the Pythagorean view that ultimate reality is expressed by number.But the Academy was also a privately funded research and teaching facility, situated outside the city. Most of us have a rather whimsical idea of philosophy as a bunch of men in togas having a chat in the agora. And we think of Socrates as a gadfly, philosophizing in the street and somehow speaking truth to power. It’s an attractive idea. But this is the literary conceit of philosophy — one that is still in circulation today. It is the fiction that Plato wants his readers to believe.Behind that fiction stands the library, the editing and copying rooms, and the entire research engine of the Academy, which was devoted to the careful production and dissemination of knowledge through texts and teaching. Much as we may flinch at the idea, philosophy has always been academic and linked to the activity of schools since its inception.At this point, a rather vulgar question comes to mind: Who paid for the Academy? According to Mr. Staikos, the cost of construction is estimated at 25 to 30 talents. As a wild modern-day estimate, we could say that the Academy cost a couple of hundred thousand dollars to build. How did Plato get this money? We don’t know. It is said that he was captured on his return trip from Sicily in 387 and sold as a slave on the island of Aegina, which Athens was at war with at the time. According to one account, Anniceris of Cyrene paid a ransom of 30 minas. But he refused to be paid back after Plato was returned to Athens, and the money was used to pay for a plot of land where the Academy was built.Although the splendidly unreliable Diogenes Laertius says that Plato possessed no property other than what is mentioned in his will, he received a large sum of money from Dionysius I. Plato had a significant fund of money at his disposal (the exorbitant figure of 80 talents is mentioned). Indeed, Plato is also said to have had a banker called Andromedes. In other words, Plato was rich and had wealthy patrons and very probably wealthy students.We are less attracted to the idea of the wealthy Aristocratic philosopher sequestered in his research facility and making occasional overseas trips to visit foreign tyrants than the image of the poor, shoeless Socrates causing trouble in the marketplace, refusing to be paid and getting killed by the city for his trouble. But our captivation with this image, once again, is overwhelmingly Plato’s invention.And behind his extraordinary inventiveness, Plato performs a characteristic disappearing trick. Truth to tell, we know very little about Plato. According to Plutarch, he was a lover of figs. Big deal! Plato is mentioned only a couple of times in the many dialogues that bear his name. He was present at Socrates’ trial but — in a beautifully reflexive moment that he describes in the Phaedo — absent from the moment of Socrates’ death, because he was sick.In fact, we don’t even know that he was called Plato, which might have been a nickname. Laertius claims that he was actually called Aristocles, after his grandfather. “Plato” is close to the word “broad” in Greek, like the broad leaves of the platanos or plane tree under which Socrates and Phaedrus sit and talk about eros. Some think that Plato was so called because he was broad-shouldered because of his prowess in wrestling.I began to ponder and wandered from the Gymnasium, across the park and a street to the scant remains of another building in the Academy complex, which is approximately 130 feet square. It has the typical dimensions of a palaestra, or wrestling school. In my mind’s eye, I saw an elderly Plato sitting watching his academicians wrestle, occasionally offering coaching advice and encouragement.Sometimes the less we know, the more space is open to the imagination.Plato worked at the Academy until his death in 347 B.C.E., interrupted only by two more extended trips to Sicily. The Academy survived for a few more centuries until it was destroyed by the Roman general Sulla in 87 B.C.E. during the sack of Athens. The buildings were probably burned along with many other sanctuaries, and the trees from the grove of academe were felled to provide timber for his siege machines. So it goes, I thought.A faint but clearly perceptible smell of urine hung in the air of the palaestra. On the corner as I looked up, two men were rummaging carefully and quietly through a baby-blue refuse bin.What was striking was how exposed and all these remains were: no fences, no border walls and no security cameras.It was time to go. On the corner of Hodos Platonos, Plato Street, I noticed a bar unsurprisingly called Platon. I thought about having a quick glass of red wine in Plato’s honor, but lost courage, took two photos, and left."
517,"Good Monday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)The future of Boeing’s 737 Max 8 plane is in question after an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed yesterday, killing 157 people.The Ethiopian Airlines flight was the second disaster involving the jet in five months, after a Lion Air crash in Indonesia killed 189 people in October. It’s rare for two planes of the same model to be involved in accidents in such a short time span, the NYT reports.The 737 Max is core to Boeing’s business. It’s the company’s best-selling model (list price: $120 million). Since its introduction in 2017, 350 planes have been delivered, and 5,000 more are currently on order. Chris Bryant of Bloomberg Opinion notes that its success is why Boeing shares are near a record high — though shares were down sharply in premarket trading.China and Indonesia have grounded the Max 8 jets. China’s airlines had been enthusiastic customers of the new model, but as of this morning they’ve been flying 737-800s instead.Concerns may give rivals a leg up. The 737 Max was created to counter Airbus’s latest A320 variant. Meanwhile, the Chinese plane maker Comac has been testing the C919, a rival of those jets, and has hoped to find buyers beyond China.Undeterred by a recent loss to Democrats, President Trump is expected to ask for $8.6 billion to finance a border wall in the next White House budget, which is to be sent to Congress today.• The proposal also includes $3.6 billion to replenish military construction funds that were diverted under a national emergency declaration.• “I would just say that the whole issue of the wall and border security is of paramount importance,” said Larry Kudlow, the president’s top economic adviser.• Democrats rebuffed the proposal. “Congress refused to fund his wall, and he was forced to admit defeat,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement. “The same thing will repeat itself if he tries this again.”The request is largely for show. As the NYT notes, the White House budget “will serve more as a statement of values and a vehicle for political positioning than a plausible outline for how the government will actually raise and spend money.”Don’t expect the budget to be balanced, regardless of whether the wall funding is included.[Sign Up for the DealBook Newsletter and make sense of major business and policy headlines.]In a push to strike a trade deal, the U.S. may be at risk of signing a watered-down agreement.A potential compromise could enable a deal to be reached this spring, Keith Bradsher and Ana Swanson write.• Washington has been pushing Beijing to agree to a so-called enforcement mechanism that would allow the U.S. to monitor China’s behavior and impose penalties for violations.• Wang Shouwen, China’s vice minister of commerce for international trade negotiations, said on Saturday that China would be amenable to an agreement that gave each side an equal right to take trade actions.But China’s promises not to manipulate its currency don’t seem to be particularly original, Mr. Bradsher writes:• American negotiators want China to avoid devaluing its currency to achieve a competitive advantage for their exports.• But “currency provisions of the evolving trade agreement are essentially a reaffirmation of the statement that the G-20 economies, including China, issued” in 2016.The bigger picture is a growing concern that, as the NYT Editorial Board points out, the Trump administration “may settle for an ephemeral victory at the expense of America’s long-term economic interests.”Tomorrow, the British Parliament is to vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal for leaving the E.U. Right now, its chances for approval don’t look good.Talks between Britain and Brussels are deadlocked, according to Mrs. May’s office. Negotiators have been trying to secure last-minute changes to win over British lawmakers, after a previous version of the agreement was overwhelmingly rejected by Parliament.Some hard-line Brexiters say defeat is “inevitable.” And a former Brexit secretary, David Davis, has said that even a proposal for Mrs. May to step down in exchange for support of her deal would “not get the vote through.”Meanwhile, those who want to stay in the E.U. have “wind in the sails,” according to the British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who said over the weekend that there is a real risk of “losing Brexit.” If Mrs. May’s deal is rejected, lawmakers would vote on whether to reject a no-deal Brexit and delay the withdrawal process. That could increase the chances of a second referendum.More: Brexit has reportedly spurred financial firms to move $1.2 trillion in assets and funds out of Britain. And the Bank of England has told some British lenders to triple holdings of easy-to-sell assets to weather a no-deal Brexit.The Fed chairman gave a rare interview to “60 Minutes” about the economy, future interest rate increases — and whether President Trump could dismiss him.On job security: Here’s the exchange between Mr. Powell and Scott Pelley of “60 Minutes”:On the U.S. economy: Mr. Powell said that America was in “a good place,” with a favorable outlook on inflation. The Fed’s interest rate policy, he added, is “appropriate.” (Translation: Don’t be surprised if the Fed keeps rates steady until it has a better idea of the outlook for the year.)On the global economy: Mr. Powell feels more concerned, telling Mr. Pelley, “We’ve seen increasing evidence of the global economy slowing down.” The biggest potential shocks to the U.S., the Fed chairman said, could come from slower growth in China and Europe, as well as Brexit.More: How central bankers around the world are taking cues from the Fed by reducing interest rate increases to cushion slowing economies.We’re now a decade into one of the great rallies in stock market history, which has seen the S&P 500 surge 305 percent and the creation of $30 trillion in wealth. Matt Phillips tried to explain why  most Americans are subdued after the latest rally:• “To buy stocks, you need money. After watching their fortunes — and retirement funds — shrivel, few Americans were in a position to take a fresh flier on beaten-down stocks.”• “Even those who are invested are behaving differently, both in how they invest and what they’re doing with the proceeds.”• “In 2017, 43 percent of all the money in American stock market funds was in index funds. Back in 2007, only 19 percent of stock market assets were in these passive strategies, a style of investing that acknowledges that, for most people, trying to beat the market through savvy trading is a mug’s game.”• “The psychological and financial damage inflicted by the 2008 financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession continue to weigh heavily.”• Research suggests that “enduring financial traumas at a relatively young age can shape people’s behavior for decades.” That could mean that younger Americans “are unlikely to be eager to take big risks in the stock market any time soon.”A year ago, Twitter’s C.E.O., Jack Dorsey, said that he wanted the company to make the conversations on its platform healthier. Kurt Wagner of Recode finds that the effort is failing.• “There’s no widely adopted way to quantify the health of human interaction, especially at the internet’s scale.” But the measures that Twitter and researchers are considering include a “toxicity” metric and one that takes note of civility, receptivity and constructivity, helped by researchers from Oxford and Leiden Universities.• “The research teams that Twitter announced last July to help them work on this project haven’t even started. One of the two teams has abandoned the project altogether. Internal metrics Twitter is building on its own are still in the ‘experimentation’ phase and aren’t being tested in the wild.”• “Lawyers for Twitter and Leiden haven’t been able to solidify the data-sharing and privacy details for the partnership, which means the researchers are simply waiting.”In an op-ed for the FT, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., writes that it’s time to overhaul international corporate tax rules:• “The ease with which multinationals seem able to avoid tax and the three-decade-long decline in corporate tax rates compromise faith in the fairness of the international system.”• One solution, she says, is to create minimum-tax schemes. “Reduce the scope for shifting profits to low-tax locations,” she suggests, or “allow low-income countries to retain more revenue by imposing minimum withholding taxes on cross-border payments.”• Another is to “create a system that fully taxes routine profits — something like a normal return on investment — on basic activities in the country in which they take place, while splitting any remaining profits among all the relevant nations.”Sam Altman stepped down as president of Y Combinator, but remains chairman of the start-up incubator.Bill Shine stepped down as White House communications director to take a position on President Trump’s re-election campaign.Bank of America named James Robertson and Peter Luck as co-heads of investment banking for Britain.DealsNvidia agreed to buy the chip maker Mellanox for about $7 billion.

518,"Good Tuesday. Want this by email? Sign up here.President Trump plans to nominate David Malpass, the under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, to head the World Bank, according to administration officials.He’s likely to land the gig. “The nomination must be ratified by the bank’s board,” writes Peter Baker of the NYT, “but by tradition, the United States, the largest shareholder, has long named its president.” Mr. Trump is expected to announce his pick tomorrow.And he could shake things up. “Like Mr. Trump, he has questioned the scope and mission of international institutions such as the World Bank, saying they have grown ‘more intrusive’ and need to be refocused,” Mr. Baker writes. “The larger trend toward multilateralism, he has said, ‘has gone substantially too far.’”That makes him a contentious choice. “The prospect of such a steadfast critic of multilateral lenders leading the World Bank has already sparked concern and dismay within the institution and among international and former U.S. officials who deal with global finance and development,” write James Politi and Sam Fleming of the FT.There were less controversial options. Indra K. Nooyi, the former C.E.O. of PepsiCo; Ray Washburne, the president of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation; and Heidi Cruz, a Goldman Sachs executive and the wife of Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, were all reportedly considered.After the government shutdown postponed his annual address to Congress, President Trump will finally deliver the speech tonight. (His theme? “Choosing Greatness.”) Here’s what’s coming up:A trade plea. He will call on Congress to back the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement, meant to replace Nafta. A draft of the speech described Americans as suffering “decades of flawed trade deals.”Plus one for infrastructure. He’s also expected to urge lawmakers to find budget space for repairing and upgrading roads, bridges and more. But the WSJ reports that Mr. Trump feels iffy about some elements of his previous proposals, including private-public partnerships.Border wall demands. Mr. Trump still plans to request money to pay for a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, though he lost support during the shutdown. He is still considering declaring a national emergency to get it, despite an expected challenge from Democrats and growing opposition among Republican senators.And the rebuttal. Democrats’ response will come from Stacey Abrams, a rising star who narrowly lost last year’s race for Georgia’s governorship. (Many in the party want her to run for Senate next year; she may do so.)For decades, Bill Gross was a titan of finance. He turned the investment firm Pimco into a $2 trillion giant. But by the time he announced his retirement yesterday from Janus Henderson Investments — the firm he joined in 2014 after a dispute with Pimco — he was at a low point.The numbers prove it. “Pimco Total Return, the fund he once ruled, returned 2.54 percent, annualized, in the three years through Friday, trouncing the paltry 0.95 percent returned by his new fund, Janus Henderson Global Unconstrained,” Jeff Sommer of the NYT writes. His Janus fund shrank from a peak of $2.2 billion to under $1 billion last year. Mr. Gross was an icon of the bond world. He drew investors by combining mathematical models and broad economic analyses. He advised the Treasury Department during the 2008 financial crisis and gained a reputation as a quirky oracle of the financial world.But he made one fatal error. Robin Wigglesworth of the FT asks whether Mr. Gross was more lucky than brilliant and how much of his success was owed to former colleagues. He picks brilliance, but adds, “Even investing stars need a supporting cast to excel, and forgetting this can be hazardous.”Need evidence that U.S. law enforcement is taking potential thefts of American technology seriously? Look no further than a report by Bloomberg Businessweek about an F.B.I. sting operation targeting Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant.How it went down: An American start-up, Akahn, claims to have developed glass that can make smartphone screens nearly indestructible, and has shopped it around smartphone makers. But Huawei took suspicious liberties when testing a sample. The F.B.I. got involved, ultimately organizing a sting on Huawei executives in Las Vegas last month.Businessweek got a ringside seat. Erik Schatzker, the article’s author, writes that he watched the sting operation from 100 feet away, “in front of a gelato stand.”What now? Unclear. “It’s possible that the government will conclude there aren’t grounds for an indictment,” Mr. Schatzker writes. “If that’s so, it raises a question about the broader U.S. crackdown on Huawei: Is it based on hard evidence of wrongdoing or driven by a desperation to catch the Chinese company doing something — anything — bad?” But an indictment “would show just how far and wide Huawei is willing to go to steal American trade secrets.”More Huawei news: Some telecom companies are standing by the company despite all the scrutiny. And Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany set out conditions that Huawei must meet to build 5G networks in her country.Automation is changing work, flushing people without a college degree out of productive industries like manufacturing and high-tech services and into low-wage dead-end jobs, Eduardo Porter of the NYT writes:• “There is a small island of highly educated professionals making good wages at corporations like Intel or Boeing, which reap hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit per employee.”• But “the employment footprint of highly productive industries, like finance, manufacturing, information services and wholesale trade, has shrunk over the last 30 years.”• “That island sits in the middle of a sea of less educated workers who are stuck at businesses like hotels, restaurants and nursing homes that generate much smaller profits per employee and stay viable primarily by keeping wages low.”• “Recent research has concluded that robots are reducing the demand for workers and weighing down wages, which have been rising more slowly than the productivity of workers.”Democrats in New York State’s Senate are fighting Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s $3 billion plan to bring Amazon offices to Queens — and may have the power to halt it altogether.What happened: The Senate named Senator Michael Gianaris, who has called the incentives promised to Amazon “offensive,” to the little-known Public Authorities Control Board.Why that matters: The board, as Mr. Cuomo has noted, will vote on Amazon’s so-called HQ2 plan, and could veto it. (It helped block Michael Bloomberg’s plan to build a stadium in Manhattan’s West Side 14 years ago.)What’s next: The governor could reject Mr. Gianaris’s nomination, but it would lead to a political fight. Mr. Cuomo’s office said that the nomination put the self-interest of a flip-flopping opponent of Amazon “above the state’s economic growth.” Mr. Gianaris said he wouldn’t use the position to seek concessions from Amazon: “I’m not looking to negotiate a better deal.”More Jeff Bezos news: Washington Post employees aren’t happy that their company’s owner paid over $10 million for a Super Bowl ad.The Federal Reserve’s chairman spent the evening of his 66th birthday dining at the White House with President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.On the agenda: “Recent economic developments and the outlook for growth, employment and inflation,” according to a Federal Reserve statement. “He did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook.”And on the menu?

519,"Good Friday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.President Trump might keep some tariffs on Chinese goods even if Beijing and Washington reach a trade agreement, he told the NYT yesterday, after delegates from both countries wrapped up another round of negotiations.“Without the tariffs, we wouldn’t be talking,” he said in an interview.How were the discussions? According to Mr. Trump’s posts on Twitter, they went well, “with good intent and spirit on both sides.” He hosted the negotiators in the Oval Office and suggested that President Xi Jinping of China was willing to welcome more American companies and to buy more American products — including five million tons of soybeans. The Chinese representatives, led by the American-educated vice premier, Liu He, said that the two sides had made “important progress” and had “candid, specific and fruitful” talks. Robert Lighthizer, the top American trade negotiator, was less sanguine. “We did not come off the rails,” he said. “That’s significant.”What’s next? The two sides hope to reach an agreement by early March, before Mr. Trump plans to increase tariffs after a 90-day truce. Mr. Lighthizer and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, will go to Beijing after the Chinese New Year holiday this month to prepare for  talks between the two presidents. Mr. Trump said that summit meeting would happen “in the near future” and that it would address “some of the long standing and more difficult points.” According to Myron Brilliant, the head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, “we are in the fifth inning of a nine-inning game.” He also used another sports analogy to describe the negotiations:____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Facebook’s 35,000 employees got a reminder this week of Apple’s power over their day-to-day routines. So did workers at Google.After Facebook and Google ran afoul of Apple’s rules for distributing apps, Apple hit back by blocking the two Silicon Valley giants from using the internal apps and updates that run on iPhone software.Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, told the NYT that the offending app had not been a secret and had operated with users’ consent. Apple eventually restored access for both Facebook and Google, but its point had been made: Cross us at your peril.The tension with Apple was not Facebook’s only concern.• The social network, in a collaboration with Twitter, said that other countries appeared to be following the Russian playbook for using social media to disseminate propaganda and disinformation. One campaign, from Iran, touched on the conflict in Syria and conspiracy theories about the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Facebook said it had removed 783 pages, groups and accounts with ties to Iran, while Twitter said it had taken down more than 2,000 accounts.• Facebook, already being investigated by the authorities in Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York, is also said to be the target of several more inquiries, including in Connecticut, Illinois and Pennsylvania, over its mishandling of user data.Deutsche has been in a lot of trouble for a very long time. Now, it’s looking increasingly probable that the German government will step in to combine it with its smaller, but also struggling competitor, Commerzbank.Deutsche reported its first full-year net profit since 2014 today but still failed to meet analysts’ expectations. Its fourth quarter showed continued weakness.The bank has lurched through various failed restructuring efforts, has been hit with fine after fine and was recently raided by prosecutors pursuing a money-laundering investigation. Its stock price has more than halved in the past year. If it is unable to recover on its own, it is thought a merger with Commerzbank may occur by midyear.But that may not be wise, writes Elisa Martinuzzi of Bloomberg:The Labor Department will release its monthly estimate of hiring and unemployment at 8:30 a.m. But there’s even more uncertainty than usual, writes the NYT’s Ben Casselman. Here’s what to look for:Crucial time: The United States’ decade-long expansion could be nearing its end, and the partial government shutdown has added to those fears. Not all the effects will show up in the jobs data, but they will make the report unusually hard to interpret.Potential impact: There is one place the shutdown will probably show up: the jobless rate. Unemployment could go up by one- or two-tenths of a percentage point.Solid foundation: The job market is strong, however. Claims for unemployment insurance recently hit a nearly 50-year low, and paychecks are growing.Investors looked to earnings reports yesterday from two bellwethers of the U.S. economy: Amazon and General Electric. Both seem to be struggling with growing pains.Stiff competition: The latest quarterly results suggested that Amazon’s retail business not only faced more competition, it was also maturing, as growth slowed from its usual breakneck pace. But the company compensated by expanding its highly profitable cloud and advertising businesses. Its revenue guidance fell short of expectations, sending shares down sharply in after-hours trading.Seeking a turnaround: G.E.’s fourth-quarter results pointed to the depth of the company’s challenges, despite a strong performance by the company’s jet engine business. G.E. made no forecast for what its profit and revenue would look like this year, and its chief executive, Lawrence Culp, said that 2019 was “still very much a work in progress.” The company also said that it had reached a $1.5 billion settlement in an investigation of its role in the 2008 financial crisis, reassuring investors.More earnings news: Nintendo shares dropped more than 9.3 percent after it cut its full-year target for sales of its Switch video game console.Intel named its interim chief executive, Robert Swan, as its permanent leader, ending a seven-month search.

520,"Bret Stephens: Gail, the word is that Robert Mueller may soon send his report to Attorney General William Barr. Do you expect a bombshell, a dud — or just a lot more confusion, depending on what Barr makes public and what Congress chooses to do with its conclusions?Gail Collins: Well, we’ve already got indicted minions. As to Trump himself, I feel very safe voting for “a lot more confusion.” Just on general principles. The Trump presidential campaign was knee-deep in conflicts of interest, many of them involving Russia. But given the man’s general disorganization, I find it hard to imagine the report picking him out as the sinister, canny leader who was orchestrating everything behind the scenes.Still feeling that the real disaster for Trump is going to come with the investigations into his business practices in New York. How about you?Bret: That’s my guess, too. Trump’s $100 million inauguration committee looks like a giant pay-to-play scheme. I still think his alleged campaign-finance violations in connection to the Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal payoffs are criminal and impeachable. And who knows what else Mueller’s investigation have dredged up about Trump family values.Gail: The family that stays together preys together …Bret: And vice versa. That said, if Mueller finds no clear and credible evidence of collusion or cooperation between the Trump campaign and Russia, it will be a major political victory for the president and a liability for his detractors. Fairly or not, it will call all the other investigations into question, however credible or serious they may be.That’s one of the reasons I’ve been leery of investing too much political capital in wondering what Trump might have done behind people’s backs. It’s what he does every day in plain sight that is much more concerning.Gail: Even if the Mueller investigation fails to produce, we’ll still have a bunch of congressional committees digging up dirt. But I know that’s not as satisfying for a conservative Trump-hater. You’re right that there’s plenty to investigate in his normal day-to-day life. Which horrible things the president has done lately seem most appalling to you?Bret: Well, that list is long. But let me start by praising Trump on a couple of fronts. I think he’s shown moral leadership on Venezuela, by getting much of the world to recognize Juan Guaidó as the legitimate president and drawing attention to the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding under the Maduro regime. And I’m also glad he’s partially reversed course and will keep at least some troops in Syria. I hope he winds up withdrawing none of them so long as they can help protect our Kurdish friends and deter our Syrian, Iranian, Russian and Turkish foes.O.K. Now to the rest. His declaration of a national emergency over border-wall funding is a threat to constitutional government and the separation of powers and sets a precedent that both sides will abuse if the Supreme Court doesn’t stop it.Gail: No disagreement on the national emergency. The fact that you haven’t seen a major uprising of Republicans over that is proof that there’s no real Republican Party anymore, only Trumpism.And I’m looking forward to the next Democratic president declaring that climate change is a national emergency …Bret: His unloading on The New York Times as “a true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE” is an assault on the First Amendment and the safety of journalists, including us. His hankering for a deal — any deal — with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un so that he can win a Nobel Peace Prize is a danger to peace and stability in Asia.Gail: Our publisher really called Trump out on the danger he is creating for journalists. It’s perilous enough reporting from trouble spots around the globe without having the president of the United States cheerleading for the enemies of a free press.Bret: His desire to start another trade war with Europe, this time over cars, is a threat to global growth and another nail in the coffin of trans-Atlantic unity. His nonstop lies and exaggerations and demagoguery about the purported evils of illegal immigration are an insult to our intelligence and devastating to the G.O.P.’s chances of ever again being a majority party.Gail: I love it when you get on a roll like this. Keep going.Bret: And his overall comportment continues to be a foul stain on the office of the presidency, a moral embarrassment to a majority of Americans, and a blot on the record of liberal democracy. How about you?Gail: Well, you’ve kind of run the table. But I’d add his attempts to undermine women’s reproductive rights. The assault on Planned Parenthood isn’t just about abortion, it’s about the far right’s hatred of anything that gives women the power to decide if and when they want to get pregnant. Can’t tell you what a deep irony it is to have this guy leading that crusade.Bret: I’d call it hypocrisy, not irony, but I’m being pedantic.Gail: And everything about guns and domestic violence. Many people have taken note of the fact that the president tweeted out about the Smollett scandal and the suit against The Washington Post by the Kentucky high school student who was involved in that incident with a Native American in Washington. But not a twittery word about the white supremacist Coast Guard officer who has been accused of stockpiling weapons to murder newscasters and liberal politicians. When reporters asked him about it, all Trump could come up with was, “I think it’s a shame.” That’s the kind of thing you say when a politician gets caught cheating on his wife, not when you’re talking about a self-declared white supremacist intent on a politically inspired mass slaughter.Bret: The Smollett and Covington High stories are fascinating in a cultural sense, mostly for what they tell us about our current culture of victimhood and the assumptions too many people, including too many in our profession, make about who is the victim based on current stereotypes. But the case of the Coast Guard officer is genuinely terrifying given that it comes on the heels of the Florida mail bomber, the Pittsburgh mass killer and the California man charged last year with phoning in death threats to journalists. That’s a terrifying reality of the culture war from which most of the right prefers to look away.Gail: Not long before he announced that he was running for president, Trump went to an N.R.A. convention and got a wild, massive reception. Right then I knew he was going to be a huge gun-rights supporter, no matter what he had believed before.When he was running against Hillary Clinton I thought he was terrible, but not nearly as terrible as he turned out to be. Kind of amazing. Did you foresee all of this?Bret: Partly. I wrote more than a dozen columns for The Wall Street Journal during the last presidential campaign, denouncing his bigotry, lawlessness, ignorance and demagoguery. He vindicates my first impression with his every foul tweet. I think he’s debasing our political culture in ways we will be living with, and suffering from, for at least a generation. And he’s becoming a role model of sorts for other populist demagogues around the world, from Brazil to Italy.Gail: Well, I wrote a lot about what a jerk he’d been in New York for the last 30-odd years. I guess I didn’t take him seriously enough because he’d always behaved like such a fool.Bret: On the other hand, the world didn’t end with his presidency. The economy is robust, we haven’t stumbled into a catastrophic war (yet), and democracy is still alive and well considering all the Democrats planning to run against him. That isn’t to say things might not still go horribly wrong, only that the habit of comparing Trump to despots of yore is off the mark and undermines the case against him.Gail: Right. He’s our own special unique despot wannabe.Bret: But can I switch the subject? Last week The Times ran an eye-opening story on Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, basically to the effect that she is a truly horrible boss, with some of the highest staff turnover in the Senate. From a policy standpoint she’s my favorite Democrat in the race, but this is a serious issue for her candidacy. How do you think voters should factor that into their considerations?Gail: I’m playing the wait-and-see card. We’re undoubtedly going to find out unpleasant things about a lot of the candidates as we go along. But that story about her using her comb to eat a salad on an airplane and then giving it to her aide to wash is going to … resonate.Your position is that you’ll vote for whoever the Democrats nominate, even if it’s a modern-day Attila the Hun, right?Bret: Definitely not! Of course I can’t vote for Trump under any circumstance. But I would never vote for Bernie Sanders, who seems to think bread lines are a good thing because they’re egalitarian. I couldn’t vote for Elizabeth Warren, either; she’s too far to my left and her prevarications about her ancestry are morally insulting and intellectually embarrassing. I have personal reservations about Cory Booker, stemming from his deceits as mayor of Newark, and Kamala Harris, stemming from her behavior as a prosecutor. If any of them is the nominee, I will probably write in Bill Weld or John Kasich or Larry Hogan — middle-of-the-road Republicans or former Republicans who know how to win over Democrats and could govern from the center.Gail: Ah, I remember many Republicans who had those sentiments: Trump was appalling and impossible to support, but Hillary Clinton was too far a bridge to cross. And so they voted for people like Gary Johnson, the Libertarian. Which meant they helped put Trump in office.Bret: I voted for Hillary Clinton, even though I had plenty of reservations. But there’s no way I’m going to follow Democrats jumping off the cliff on the left because I’m angry at Republicans for jumping off the cliff on the right.Gail: Really, I have to warn you. If I hear any Trump-hater talking about writing in his mother’s name or the Green Party name or Howard Schultz I immediately decide this is a person who would rather have four more years of Donald Trump than compromise his principles by voting for a deeply imperfect Democrat.Bret: I’m already compromising many of my usual political principles by voting for centrist Democrats, never mind the real lefties. I could vote for Joe Biden, though I doubt he’ll get the nomination, or Senator Michael Bennet from Colorado (our boss’s brother), or any other middle-of-the-road Democrat. That category included Klobuchar, but I have a problem with people who are horrible bosses and don’t have the good sense to use their fingers to eat the way I do.But let’s talk about something our readers really care about: the Oscars. Did you watch? Did your favorites win?Gail: I believe this is the first year ever that I’ve seen all the movies nominated for best picture, and best actress and best actor — and pretty much everything. This is all about avoiding Donald Trump. Since he’s been president I’ve instinctively organized my life around trying to forget about current events for at least a few hours a day. It’s the same reason I’ve been watching football for the first time in my life.But about the winners — I like watching people be genuinely surprised, so I really enjoyed seeing Olivia Colman win for playing the dotty queen in “The Favourite.” How about you?Bret: I saw only a few of the films. But I was thrilled with the win for “Free Solo,” the documentary about climber Alex Honnold that I wrote a column about last year. And I was deeply moved by “Roma.” I grew up in Mexico City, and the movie perfectly captured a world I know very, very well. Nice to see that in this accelerated age of ours there’s still appreciation for a film that takes it slow and goes deep.Gail: And while we’re talking about awards that made me happy — congratulations on winning the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, Bret! I’m so glad your fight for immigrant rights is being recognized. You deserve it. And as a bonus, I can’t think of anything that would irritate Donald Trump more.Bret: Thanks, Gail. Of course I’ll be bringing my mom to the ceremony. This year will be her 69th as an immigrant in this country."
521,"Good Friday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.It went viral. Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, told Andrew on CNBC that he didn’t quite understand why unpaid workers, some of them now turning to Uber and Lyft for income after missing their second paycheck, were visiting food banks. They should just borrow some money, he said:The comments reflect a “ ‘let them eat cake’ kind of attitude,” said Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has emerged as a powerful opponent to President Trump.Federal workers, many of them wary of taking on more debt, might also struggle to access credit. The credit union affiliated with Mr. Ross’s department advertises a shutdown loan with a rate higher than some other commercially available loans.As the shutdown drags on, lawmakers are scrambling to find a compromise after two proposals to reopen the government fell flat in the Republican-controlled Senate. Mr. Trump’s plan, which included funding for a border wall, garnered less support than the Democrats’ recommendation, which omitted the wall.The strain intensifies: • Low- and middle-income home buyers in rural areas are left in the lurch without an affordable mortgage option offered by the Agriculture Department.• Tyson Foods donated 685,000 meals to federal workers.• The shutdown threatens to taint the appeal of public service, which “will make it harder to recruit and hold onto the experienced and talented,” Campbell Robertson writes.• Patent handling may have to cease in mid-February.• James Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, said a prolonged shutdown would “have an extremely damaging effect.” Economists from J.P. Morgan said that, already, the stalemate had taken a toll on the U.S. economy.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in Davos, Switzerland; Stephen Grocer in New York; and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________The mood at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort is “subdued, cautious and apprehensive,” a reflection of the broader outlook, Fareed Zakaria writes in the Washington Post:The reason: Mr. Zakaria points to a noticeable absence of leadership from defenders of democracy. President Trump scrapped plans to attend to focus on domestic problems, as did Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and President Emmanuel Macron of France.The worry: The leaders of smaller countries described the world as lacking a collective purpose, he writes. Many yearn for a greater U.S. presence on the global stage, but with nobody shoring up the international system, will it weaken and eventually crumble?The warnings: Michael Sabia, who runs the $270 billion Canadian pension fund Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec, complained that capitalists had forgotten their purpose as backers of corporate investment. “Too many equity investors are tourists; they’re not interested in building a business,” he said. And in a provocative speech, the billionaire philanthropist George Soros criticized President Xi Jinping, saying that China’s technological advancements made Mr. Xi a “dangerous opponent of open societies.”Complacency toward the trade tensions between the U.S. and China are misplaced, according to the Economist, because the rift is compounding a gradual shift in the world economy. Globalization, so the argument goes, has given way to a new era of sluggishness, or “slowbalization.”The back story: In the golden age of globalization, from about 1990 to 2010, commerce soared as the cost of transporting goods fell, tariffs were cut and the financial system became liberalized.The shift: Trade is suffering, and companies are changing their long-term investment plans. “Slowbalization” is expected to lead to stronger ties to regional blocs as supply chains seek sources closer to home.Why it matters: Emerging countries will struggle to trade their way to riches. Climate change, migration and tax-dodging will be even harder to solve without global cooperation.The effect is being felt around the world:• Germany’s industrial slump worsened at the start of 2019, casting a cloud over the eurozone economy.• Norway’s central bank said it was prepared to raise interest rates as soon as March, but warned of “considerable uncertainty” as it moves to wind down its stimulus plan.• Starbucks put its recent sales slump behind it, beating analyst estimates in crucial regions, but the company’s growth in China is at a crawl.The utility was cleared of responsibility in the 2017 blaze that chewed through a wide swath of Northern California, leading some to question whether the company should move ahead with its plans to file for bankruptcy by the end of the month.The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said that private electrical equipment in a home caused the Tubbs Fire in Sonoma County, which killed 22 people and destroyed more than 5,600 buildings. PG&E’s stock, which has plunged dramatically in recent months, surged 75 percent after the news on Thursday.But the company is still facing billions of dollars of potential liabilities. State officials blame PG&E equipment for at least 17 of 21 major wildfires in 2017.Bankruptcy, however, may not be the best course of action, according to many investors and analysts who say that PG&E has plenty of assets it could leverage against claims.From high above the Earth, a brigade of satellites can track the number of cars parked outside Sears stores, identify illegal logging operations, sense activity from cellular towers and snap infrared images of factories in Guangdong, China.Nowadays, it’s not only superpower governments that can gain access to the trove of information. Start-ups working with human rights groups and businesses looking for a competitive edge are moving rapidly into high-altitude surveillance, Cade Metz writes.Satellites have become cheaper to build, launch and operate, with 2,220 Earth observation units expected to head into orbit over the next decade, compared with about 730 satellites launched in the past decade.Though some say that spying from the sky is a “narrow niche,” Mark Johnson, the chief executive of the start-up Descartes Labs, said the development could have major ramifications.“Businesses will not be able to hide from competitors or regulators or watchdogs,” he said. “They need to realize that their traditional competitive advantage — information — will be available to everyone.”David Giordano will become BlackRock’s global head of renewable power, replacing Jim Barry, who will remain global head of real assets.

522,"Good Wednesday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.Negotiations between Washington and Beijing seemed to be in a precarious place on Tuesday, after the FT reported that the Trump administration had canceled meetings with Chinese vice ministers.The officials had offered to come to Washington to prepare for meetings scheduled later this month between China’s trade czar, Liu He, and the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, the FT said.Larry Kudlow, the head of the National Economic Council, denied the report to CNBC. He added that negotiations would only be successful if the Chinese honored their commitments:China may agree to buy up to seven million tons of American wheat. But Chinese officials are reportedly chafing at U.S. requests for regular reviews of changes to their trade policies. And two influential American business groups still see reason to be unhappy, saying China is engaged in “a deep, concerted and continuing effort” to establish dominance in technologies such as robotics and electric vehicles.Beijing is also trying to play down Belt and Road, its vast infrastructure initiative spanning Asia, Europe and Africa: Senior government officials have avoided the topic at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the NYT reports.The effects of trade tensions continue to spread. The stock market started the year strong but sputtered on Tuesday. Japan’s exports last month sank the most in more than two years. Chinese finance officials promised more stimulus. Experts are predicting that “the good times are over” for American companies reliant on Chinese consumers.But not everyone is complaining: Lobbyists have enjoyed a surge of business from companies and trade groups hoping to influence the Trump administration’s tariff decisions. Indonesia’s doing all right, too: Its industry minister says it’s exporting more steel to the U.S. and also attracting Chinese textile and footwear companies.Other Chinese news: The founder of a Nanjing-based meat supplier, one of several Chinese executives at Hong Kong-listed companies who have mysteriously disappeared in recent years, returned to his family. Several Chinese companies are circling Japan’s largest operator of oyster restaurants.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in Davos, Switzerland; Stephen Grocer in New York; and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________The Senate descended from the spectator stands to plan two competing votes to fund the government on Thursday. One involves President Trump’s latest proposal: $5.7 billion for a border wall, now accompanied by temporary protections for certain immigrants. The other, from the Democrats, would open the government until Feb. 8.But neither is expected to draw the 60 votes needed to advance. This means that the Trump administration is likely to continue as a one-ring circus, focused on the wall to the exclusion of other presidential duties.Here are ways the shutdown is still straining the system:• Reserve security workers are being flown into airports, because as many as one in 10 transportation security officers are failing to show up for work.• Delays in reports about home sales, construction, trade and manufacturing threaten to create a data vacuum, just as the economy may be slowing down.• SNAP food stamps help feed some 40 million Americans.

523,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.A lot has been made of the new Democratic majority in the House. They’re young. Female. Diverse. Outspoken.All the focus on Democrats made us curious about what being in the new Congress looks like from the other side of the aisle.Representative Dan Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL with no prior experience in elected office, has emerged as one of the stars of the new Republican class. He survived a crowded primary race and a runoff for the Republican nomination last year, en route to winning his Houston-area district.But real fame came shortly after the election, when Mr. Crenshaw, who wears an eye patch because of an injury he suffered in Afghanistan, appeared on “Saturday Night Live” to rebut the comedian Pete Davidson, who had mocked Mr. Crenshaw as looking like a “hit man from a porno movie.” The two offered a sincere plea for civility, and a political star was born.Since then, Mr. Crenshaw’s staunch support for President Trump’s border wall and his fiery presence on social media have some Republicans calling him the conservative answer to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.We recently talked with Mr. Crenshaw about the wall, social media and civility in politics. The interview was conducted before Mr. Trump agreed on a border deal, but we decided to leave in those parts of the conversation, because the debate over the wall isn’t going away anytime soon. As usual, our interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Lisa: You came into Congress in the middle of the shutdown. Was that frustrating? I mean, you’re here to make a difference, presumably, and you enter in a stalemate. Dan Crenshaw: The frustrating part for me is why we were shut down. You can’t just be mad at a shutdown. You do have to take a side. And in the end, this shutdown boils down to $5 billion over basically extending the authorizations we’ve had in the past. That’s what’s frustrating, that we’re actually arguing over that.Well, it’s about the wall, right? Sure. To me, it’s frustrating that we can’t come to a deal. I mean, the idea of a government shutdown, it’s a consequence of our system. The president is under no obligation to sign the spending bills that Congress gives to him. And once that happens, once he says no, then you’re supposed to negotiate. So the frustrating part was to see how the Democrats refused to negotiate.That didn’t really make it out into the media very much because — I mean, we can say it all we want, but the media, generally speaking, the CNN pundits and The New York Times, will generally call it the “Trump shutdown,” because he owned it initially. I get that. But once he owned it, he asked to negotiate, and I think that’s a pretty fair ask. He did not have anyone to negotiate with. So that was frustrating, to watch that play out from the inside.Now, it looks like maybe the deal will be less money for the wall, or some kind of fencing.The semantics over wall versus fencing, first of all, are highly misleading. Trump’s plan has been what normal people would describe as fencing for a long time now. I get that he still calls it a wall. But that’s because in our English language a normal person would go up to what we have on the border right now and say it’s a wall, or a fence, and they’d both be right.What we’re actually talking about is steel bollard fencing. Again, it’s a mass misinformation campaign by the other side on this. And that’s been amplified by a lot of the media, is that we’re just talking about 2,000 miles of, like, concrete wall. It’s so unbelievably false.I want like a giant reset button to be like, “O.K., let’s start the debate over,” because I wasn’t here when we started the debate. Now I am. I’d like us to be very honest about what we’re talking about.Sounds like you’re describing a messaging problem for Republicans. I don’t have all the answers, but I think the way I’d describe the right way to message is to help people understand the “why” behind the “what.” It’s like, why do I believe we need extra fencing down the southern border? And in a deeper “why” than just, “Hey, it’s security and murders and crime.” Some of that’s true, but it leads us into a debate about how much crime and how much drugs.The “why” is: We enforce our laws, and because we believe in our own sovereignty, and I believe that illegal immigrants shouldn’t be able to cut in front of legal immigrants. That’s a better “why.”Traditionally in Washington, there was an idea that as a new member you come in and keep a low profile. You — and other freshmen — are clearly taking a different approach. Why? There was no, like, decision point. They listen to me because I just have a large following, and yeah, I got famous on national TV.There’s a sequence of events that drew us here. It’s like, you know, why is A.O.C. [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] famous? It’s just that story of beating Joe Crowley. Once that hooks people, and you’ve got that following, that’s sort of self-perpetuating. There isn’t really a rule, necessarily, that the leadership tries to keep freshmen from talking.You’ve used some of that platform to call for a return to civility. What does that look like for you? It just looks like, don’t question the other people’s character.You can be pretty sharp, particularly on Twitter.Yeah, I can be sharp. But what I never say is, you know — let me give an example of what they do to us all the time. “You can’t say that because you’re a white Christian man.” That’s not civil. That’s avoiding the debate of ideas and attacking a person because of who they are. That’s not O.K.I will attack ideas very hard. I am not shy about that one bit. So I don’t want people to think that because I had a call for civility that that means I shy away from debate and that I’m agreeable. That’s not the case. What is the case is that I will not question who you are as a person.You can say that your ideas are bad for America, and frankly un-American, but don’t say the person is a traitor. That’s the line that we should aspire to, at least in the short term.Do you think the president crosses that line?Well, let’s see. I’m trying to think of some examples.Lyin’ Ted, Liddle Marco, Horseface. I can keep going.Yeah. Those are examples. Sure.So name-calling, in general, is bad, and then what I see from the other side is like, if you’re calling someone a racist, bigot, homophobe — and they have their list, right? And that’s terrible. You know what, with everything happening in Virginia right now, are we all on social media calling him a racist? No, actually, we’re saying you did something racist. See, that’s the difference. To say someone is a racist, versus saying you did something or said something that could be perceived as racist.You think there’s a way to unwind this new tone?Just be part of the solution and not part of the problem. That’s the only way.[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter from The Times about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]____________________Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers.

524,"Good Tuesday. Breaking: Karl Lagerfeld, the influential fashion designer and longtime creative director of Chanel, has died at 85. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)As McKinsey & Company advised some of the biggest companies in the world, the NYT reports, it may have had a vested interest in the outcome, through a little-known in-house hedge fund that holds stakes in some of the firm’s clients.Little about the fund, the McKinsey Investment Office, is public. A large part of its approximately $12.3 billion in holdings is “concealed behind a tangle of shell companies in an island tax haven in the English Channel,” the NYT reports. As a result, “any intersections between McKinsey’s consulting work and the fund’s investments are largely hidden.”The office took a stake in Valeant, the drug maker that was advised by McKinsey and is accused of improperly raising pharmaceutical prices. It also invested in Puerto Rican bonds while the firm advised the island on how to deal with its debt.McKinsey says there’s no conflict of interest.  It insists the office is run separately from its consulting operations, and that 90 percent of its funds are run by outside managers.But it faces increasing skepticism about that from Congress and in various lawsuits. “A federal judge in Virginia last month reopened a coal-company bankruptcy case after learning that McKinsey had not disclosed, as required by law, that it was also among the company’s secured creditors, through MIO,” the NYT reports.A coalition of 16 states, including California and New York, sued the Trump administration yesterday over his plan to use emergency powers to spend billions of dollars on a border wall, Charlie Savage and Robert Pear of the NYT report:• “The clash raises questions over congressional control of spending, the scope of emergency powers granted to the president, and how far the courts are willing to go to settle such a dispute.”• “Xavier Becerra, the attorney general of California, said in an interview that the president himself had undercut his argument that there was an emergency on the border.”• “The lawsuit, California et al. v. Trump et al., says that the plaintiff states are going to court to protect their residents, natural resources and economic interests.”• “Plaintiffs will need to establish standing by showing that they are suffering some particular injury from what Mr. Trump is doing. Several of the lawsuits involve people who own land or represent communities along the Mexican border in Texas, where Mr. Trump has put the focus of his emphasis on the need for more barriers.”After a series of discussions between America and China in Beijing last week that President Trump called “very productive,” negotiators reopen their conversations in Washington this week.What’s happening: Negotiations kick off today. Then on Thursday and Friday, Vice Premier Liu He of China will meet with the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, according to Bloomberg.What to expect: The Trump administration “is racing to strike a deal that will result in long-term reforms,” according to the WSJ, which notes that such a pact would “prove that tariffs are an effective battering ram to open markets around the world.”But it’s not done yet. Despite Mr. Trump tweeting that “big progress being made on soooo many different fronts!” in these trade negotiations so far, the WSJ reports that “people briefed on the negotiations said big outstanding differences remain.”More trade news: Why Mr. Trump may want to keep car tariffs in his back pocket. HSBC says the U.S.-China trade war is why it missed its profit targets. With just over a week to go before a crucial vote, the British prime minister is facing shifting groupings in Parliament and a difficult diplomatic mission to the E.U.Britain’s parties are splitting. Seven lawmakers have left Labour, the main opposition party, and formed a new Independent Group that might push for another referendum on Brexit. While initial reactions were largely unimpressed, the Telegraph reports that their ranks could swell, and that some members of Mrs. May’s Conservative party may also join.And Mrs. May is running out of time. There are nine days left until a parliamentary vote that could seize control of the Brexit process from her. So this week, Bloomberg reports, she is mounting a last-ditch diplomatic push:• “The British prime minister is planning to meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker this week.”• “Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will travel to Berlin, Brussels and Copenhagen, while Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay is continuing his dialogue with the E.U.’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.”• “Attorney General Geoffrey Cox — a key voice in the Brexit debate inside Cabinet — will set out in a speech expected on Tuesday how the most contentious part of the Brexit deal, the so-called backstop plan for the Irish border, could be changed.”But the E.U. isn’t budging yet. “We are happy to revisit anything that would clarify the situation without reopening the withdrawal agreement,” a spokesman for the European Commission, Margaritis Schinas, said.More Brexit news: The Japanese automaker Honda plans to close its plant in Swindon, England, which employs 3,500 people, though it didn’t blame Brexit. Wall Street banks are moving out of London — but not to any single European financial capital.A British parliamentary committee issued a scathing report yesterday that accuses Facebook of breaking data privacy and competition laws and calls for tighter regulations, Adam Satariano of the NYT reports:• “The parliamentary report recommends the creation of a British watchdog to oversee the technology industry, similar to the country’s approach to regulating media companies.”• “Companies like Facebook should not be allowed to behave like ‘digital gangsters’ in the online world, considering themselves to be ahead of and beyond the law,” the report argues.• Mr. Satariano also notes that the report “suggested legally requiring Facebook and other large internet platforms to remove what the government determines to be harmful content, or risk fines or other punishments.” Facebook may not be worried. The committee can’t change regulations on its own, Mr. Satariano notes, while Alex Webb of Bloomberg Opinion points out that “Britain’s divorce from the European Union could seriously impair its capacity to rein in the giants of U.S. tech.”More Facebook news: Why it’s getting serious about building its own A.I. chips. And why researchers are worried about how Facebook promotes Groups.Index funds, with low fees and broad exposure to the markets, are supposed to be one of the best ways to play the stock market. But Robert Jackson Jr., an S.E.C. commissioner, and Steven Davidoff Solomon of the University of California, Berkeley, point out problems with those funds in an NYT Op-Ed:• “The firms that devise these indexes face little regulatory scrutiny and can face significant conflicts of interest, which have the potential to harm American investors.”• “There certainly exists potential for manipulation. Index providers generally have wide leeway when choosing the individual companies that make up their indexes and how they are weighted.”• “That’s why we’re calling on the Securities and Exchange Commission to study this issue and make recommendations, if necessary, to Congress. Lawmakers must take a more active role in overseeing how index providers shape how trillions of Americans’ investment dollars are allocated.”Independent venture capital funds like Sequoia and Andreessen Horowitz may grab headlines, but corporate investment funds have quietly been investing faster than ever, according to a report by CB Insights. Here are some highlights:Corporate V.C.s broke records in 2018, putting $53 billion into 2,740 deals worldwide, a high on both measures.They tended to spend more than noncorporate V.C.s. The average corporate venture deal size was $26.3 million, compared to $21.8 million for a standard V.C. transaction.Companies are rushing to set up funds. The number of corporate V.C. funds investing for the first time reached 264 last year, up 35 percent from 2017 and over 300 percent from 2013.China is playing a big role. Two of the top five most active corporate V.C. funds last year were Baidu.ventures and Legend Capital, despite trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. (The most active was GV, Alphabet’s early-stage venture arm.)The law firm Kasowitz Benson Torres will announce as soon as today that it has hired Kevin Arquit, a leading antitrust lawyer in the U.S., from Weil, Gotshal & Manges to lead its antitrust and competition team.Mr. Arquit’s background: He worked at the Federal Trade Commission from 1986 to 1992, where he eventually become the director of its bureau of competition. Then he went into private practice, working on matters like DirecTV’s sale to AT&T and the defense of the poultry producer Pilgrim’s Pride in a price-fixing lawsuit.What’s ahead in antitrust: Mr. Arquit told DealBook that he thinks things are going to become more aggressive.• He sees more companies going to court against regulators like the Justice Department and the F.T.C., which he says have become more demanding.• “In some of those cases, it’s become so extreme,” he said, pointing to the Justice Department’s handling of the AT&T-Time Warner deal.

525,"Good Wednesday morning. Breaking: Sears and Edward S. Lampert have reached $5.3 billion deal that would keep its stores open for now. Want this by email? Sign up here.Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain suffered a crushing defeat yesterday, after Parliament rejected her plan to withdraw the country from the European Union.The result thrusts the country further into political chaos 10 weeks before it is scheduled to leave the bloc, write Stephen Castle and Ellen Barry.The response: Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, called the defeat “catastrophic.” The European Union said it was stunned by the defeat but said there was no option to renegotiate. “Time is almost up,” said the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker.The markets: The uncertainty of a deal will weigh on investors. Analysts say some sectors will be especially sensitive, including homebuilders, commercial real estate, banking, retail and leisure.What’s next? Mr. Corbyn called for a no-confidence vote, which will be debated today. The measure is expected to fail, but Mrs. May has little time to regain momentum, and must present new plan by Monday.Lawmakers may opt for a softer exit, the FT’s Robert Shrimsely writes:____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________The partial government shutdown has been marked by theatrics. Democrats spurned an invitation by President Trump to a lunch of steak and potatoes at the White House. Legislators marched across the Capitol to confront a top Republican — who was not in his office. Kraft Heinz announced that it would distribute free food to federal workers.But as the stalemate enters its 26th day, economists are warning that the damage is real and growing, writes Jim Tankersley. The Council of Economic Advisers said that each week of the shutdown reduces quarterly economic growth by 0.13 percentage points as furloughed employees and contractors sit idle, steadily scaling back their spending.Business and consumer confidence — already burdened by signs of slowing global growth, trade tensions with China and the waning effects of the 2017 tax overhaul — could suffer. With no end to the standoff in sight, the economy could slip from what appears to be the strongest year of growth since the financial crisis into a stall, or worse. According to Michael L. Corbat, the chief executive of Citigroup:Other shutdown news:• The Trump administration said it would call tens of thousands of employees back to work, without pay, to prepare for the tax-filing season, oversee air travel safety, and sell oil and gas drilling leases.• Unpaid federal workers said that they deserved to be paid immediately for working during the shutdown or be allowed to take jobs elsewhere. A federal judge disagreed.• The Liberty Bond program appealed to Americans’ sense of patriotism to raise funds during World War I. Two Republican lawmakers hope a similar tactic would pay for a border wall.Members of the Sackler family, which owns the company that makes OxyContin, were accused in court documents of being directly involved in efforts to mislead doctors and patients about the dangers of the painkiller.The evidence, revealed a Massachusetts lawsuit filing, appears to tie the Sacklers to decisions made by the company, Purdue Pharma, about the aggressive marketing of OxyContin, Barry Meier writes. The promotion of the drug helped set off the opioid epidemic.The Sacklers are one of the richest families in the U.S., with much of their wealth derived from OxyContin sales. In a statement, Purdue Pharma, rejected suggestions of wrongdoing by the company or members of the Sackler family.Apollo Global Management is close to a deal to buy Arconic, an aerospace-parts maker, for more than $10 billion, the WSJ reports.The news: Apollo would pay $21 to $22 per share for Arconic, which has a market value of about $9.3 billion. The price would represent a premium of 5 percent to 10 percent above the closing price of Arconic’s shares on Tuesday. The deal is likely to be announced this week.The back story: Several buyout firms have shown interest since last summer in acquiring Arconic, which was formed from the break up of Alcoa in 2016.The context: A deal would be one of the largest leveraged buyouts in recent years and another sign of a thaw in debt markets. Last week, Targa Resources became the first issuer to sell junk bonds since November, ending a 40-day stretch without a high-yield bond sale.A takeover bid for Gannett could complicate its pursuit of Gizmodo Media, which owns Deadspin and Jezebel as well as its namesake technology website.The news: Gannett is a serious bidder for Gizmodo Media in an auction that has also drawn attention from the owner of Gawker.com, the WSJ reported, citing anonymous sources.

526,"WASHINGTON — The meeting of President George Bush’s cabinet on Jan. 8, 1991, was even more high-stakes than usual. Iraq had invaded Kuwait. Half a million American troops were deployed and ready to attack. But many lawmakers were demanding a vote before any war.Rejecting mainstream constitutional views, William P. Barr, the deputy attorney general, told Mr. Bush that he wielded unfettered power to start a major land war on his own — not only without congressional permission, but even if Congress voted against it.“Mr. President, there’s no doubt that you have the authority to launch an attack,” Mr. Barr said, as he later recalled.Ultimately, Mr. Bush was cautious about invoking that maximalist theory of executive power and asked lawmakers for support anyway — a prudent step that Mr. Barr, whom Mr. Bush soon elevated to attorney general, also recommended. Congress’s vote ensured the Persian Gulf war was lawful.Nearly three decades later, President Trump has nominated Mr. Barr to return as attorney general. But unlike the self-restrained Mr. Bush, Mr. Trump revels in pushing limits — a temperament that, when combined with Mr. Barr’s unusually permissive understanding of presidential power, could play out very differently for the rule of law than it did last time.“There are concerns about his independence, given his longstanding and expansive views of executive power,” said Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, which will hold Mr. Barr’s confirmation hearing starting Tuesday. “So the question is, Is he right for this time, and can he really be independent of this president and the White House?”Mr. Trump ousted his administration’s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, in November, after long excoriating him for having followed ethics officials’ advice that he recuse himself from overseeing what became the investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Trump said that he needed an attorney general who would protect him and that he would not have appointed Mr. Sessions if he had known he would recuse himself. The two-day hearing for Mr. Barr, 68, will play out against the backdrop of swelling rule-of-law turmoil, from Mr. Trump’s pressuring the Justice Department to curtail investigations into his associates and to open them into his opponents to his threat to invoke emergency powers to circumvent Congress on border-wall funds, to coming oversight fights with House Democrats.Democrats have demanded that Mr. Barr protect Mr. Mueller as he completes the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, including whether Mr. Trump sought to obstruct the inquiry on behalf of Moscow. Democrats have also focused on whether Mr. Barr would turn over to Congress any report Mr. Mueller compiles.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the new Judiciary Committee chairman, told reporters after meeting with Mr. Barr last week that the nominee had said he saw no reason to fire Mr. Mueller and had pledged to “err on the side of transparency” about any report. But neither statement addressed what he would do if Mr. Trump ordered him to act otherwise.Mr. Barr is likely to be confirmed because Republicans control the Senate and because defeating him would leave in place the acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, a Trump loyalist whose installation in that role Democrats see as illegitimate and a threat to Mr. Mueller. Ethics officials advised Mr. Whitaker to recuse himself from the Russia case, but he refused.But Mr. Barr has already drawn scrutiny over the revelation last month that he sent an apparently unsolicited 19-page memo to the Trump legal team in June arguing that Mr. Mueller should not be permitted to investigate Mr. Trump for criminal obstruction of justice.Mr. Barr’s argument derived from his broad view of executive power: The Constitution, he claimed, does not permit Congress to make it a crime for the president to exercise his executive powers corruptly — even if he were to fire a subordinate, pardon someone or use what Mr. Barr termed his “complete authority to start or stop a law enforcement proceeding” to cover up crimes by himself or his associates.The claim that the framers of the Constitution empowered presidents to impede investigations for corrupt ends goes too far, many legal scholars say. But Supreme Court precedents offer few definitive guideposts, giving the attorney general broad latitude.“The interpretive approach of Justice Department lawyers to the Constitution is very important because many separation-of-powers issues never wind up in court,” said Peter Shane, an Ohio State University law professor. “Barr’s method is not uniquely his, but it does represent a particularly aggressive school of executive power thought.”Mr. Barr started his career as a C.I.A. analyst before becoming an agency legislative affairs official in the mid-1970s, during the post-Watergate and post-Vietnam War era when a congressional investigation dragged decades of intelligence abuses into the light over the executive branch’s objections.After going to law school, he joined the Reagan White House and worked on domestic policy with C. Boyden Gray, the counsel to then-Vice President George Bush. At the time, the administration was battling Democrats in Congress over its push for deregulation. The conflicts helped spur the Reagan legal team to develop new executive power theories that would diminish the influence of Congress.Their legal policy innovations intensified in Mr. Reagan’s second term, after Mr. Barr had returned to private practice and senior administration officials were caught steering aid to anti-Marxist militants in Nicaragua despite a law forbidding such assistance. The scandal, known as Iran-contra, set off investigations by Congress and an independent counsel.Amid the fallout, the Reagan legal team called into question the legitimacy of both the law barring aid and one allowing for prosecutors the president could not fire. The president’s lawyers saw them as congressional encroachments on the president’s rightful powers, though the Supreme Court upheld the independent counsel law in 1988.The next year, when Mr. Barr returned to public service in the new Bush administration, he took up the executive power mission as the head of the Office of Legal Counsel, the powerful agency within the Justice Department that evaluates the legality of proposed executive branch actions. Mr. Gray, who had become White House counsel under Mr. Bush, “was intent on getting someone in that position who believed in executive authority,” Mr. Barr later recalled.Normally, the Office of Legal Counsel waits to be asked a specific legal question about a particular dispute before weighing in. But among his first major acts was to write an apparently unsolicited 10-page memo to top lawyers across the executive branch, urging vigilance against any attempts by Congress to limit presidential power.“Only by consistently and forcefully resisting such congressional incursions can executive branch prerogatives be preserved,” he wrote.Mr. Barr denounced lawmakers’ pursuit of sensitive administration information for oversight investigations and the creation of legal limits on the president’s power to fire certain officials in order to give them a degree of independence. “The power to remove is the power to control,” he wrote.As Mr. Bush’s term progressed, Mr. Barr not only argued that the president could unilaterally launch the gulf war without Congress — echoing a move by President Harry S. Truman, to enduring legal controversy, in the Korean War four decades earlier — but also sought to push the boundaries of presidential flexibility in many other ways, large and small.In 1990, for example, Mr. Barr asserted that the Bush administration could lawfully choose to disregard a law in which Congress, as a condition of funding a diplomatic delegation, required that a representative from a congressional panel be included. Arguing that Congress had no authority in the area of foreign affairs, he asserted that it was therefore “self-evidently” true that lawmakers could not enact a law influencing the president’s choices of diplomatic agents.That same year, he argued more broadly in a panel discussion that even with the power of the purse, lawmakers lack the authority to influence policy by placing conditions on appropriations for government activities that fall under the president’s executive powers. Ultimately, Congress only has the power to provide a “lump sum” to the president in those cases, he said.After Mr. Bush lost the 1992 election and before he left office, he pardoned half a dozen officials caught up in the Iran-contra affair just before one, Caspar Weinberger, was about to go to trial. Foreshadowing the controversy over Mr. Trump’s dangling of potential pardons in the Russia investigation, the prosecutor accused Mr. Bush of a cover-up that could have implicated his own conduct. Mr. Barr later said that he had personally urged Mr. Bush to pardon the officials because he thought they had been “unjustly treated.”In the years after the Bush administration ended, Mr. Barr became a top lawyer for the telecommunications company that evolved into Verizon, working mainly on business and regulatory issues. But he also continued to play a role in legal policy debates over executive power and national security, especially after the Sept. 11 attacks.After Congress enacted the USA Patriot Act to loosen restrictions on government surveillance that grew out of the 1970s oversight investigations, he testified that the new statute had been a good first step but did not go far enough.In 2005, after the George W. Bush administration’s detainee abuses started coming to light, he defended Mr. Bush’s power to declare that prisoners in the war on terror were not protected by the Geneva Conventions and so could be lawfully subjected to coercive questioning.“Generally, under the laws of war, absent treaty, there is nothing wrong with coercive interrogation, applying pain, discomfort and other things to make people talk,” he said, pausing, then adding, “as long as it doesn’t cross the line and involve the gratuitous barbarity that’s involved in torture.”Later that year, Congress tightened laws against treating detainees in cruel or degrading ways, but Mr. Bush claimed he had constitutional power to do so anyway. In 2006, the Supreme Court ruled that the Geneva Conventions did require humane treatment of terrorism detainees, contrary to the Bush legal team theories that Mr. Barr had echoed.Mr. Barr also repeatedly defended Mr. Bush’s decision to create the ill-fated system of military commissions instead of civilian courts to prosecute terrorism suspects. In fact, it was Mr. Barr who privately suggested to the Bush White House that it create a tribunals system, an idea he had considered as attorney general during the investigation of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. Two Libyan suspects were indicted in civilian court in 1991.Mr. Barr has recounted a story about that case that may resonate with Democrats’ expressed concerns about whether he will maintain Justice Department independence against political interference by Mr. Trump. When prosecutors were preparing to indict the Pan Am 103 suspects, Mr. Bush cautiously asked his attorney general “would it be O.K.” to brief the National Security Council on the situation. Taken aback at Mr. Bush’s hands-off attitude, Mr. Barr made clear that he saw the president as excessively deferential — and invoked the notion, popular among executive power maximalists, that the president, not the attorney general, is the prosecutor in chief.“Would it be O.K.? Well, I work for you; you’re the top law enforcement officer. Of course it’s O.K.,” Mr. Barr recalled marveling. “The attitude was, You have to be very careful with pending matters of justice.”"
527,"Good Thursday. Want this by email? Sign up here.JPMorgan Chase this morning announced the first cryptocurrency to be rolled out by a major U.S. bank.How will it be used? The new tokens, each of which represents a U.S. dollar, will help settle some payments between the bank’s clients. CNBC reports that the new digital coin will enter testing “in a few months.” It will facilitate a “tiny fraction” of its wholesale payments business.What’s the point? “Money sloshes back and forth all over the world in a large enterprise,” Umar Farooq, the head of JPMorgan’s blockchain projects, told CNBC. “Is there a way to ensure that a subsidiary can represent cash on the balance sheet without having to actually wire it to the unit? That way, they can consolidate their money and probably get better rates for it.”It also gives JPMorgan first-mover advantage. This will be one of the world’s first real-world crypto applications for banking, and the biggest move into the sector yet by an American lender. It also sets the bank up for a future in which crypto could be an integral part of the financial sector.The bank has come a long way on crypto. Its C.E.O., Jamie Dimon, famously declared Bitcoin a “fraud” in 2017 and said he would fire any employee caught trading it. (He later regretted his comments and added that he believed in the value of blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies.)Congress is expected to vote on a bipartisan border deal this evening that would ward off another government shutdown.President Trump may be resigned to signing it. “I don’t want to see a shutdown,” he told reporters yesterday. “A shutdown would be a terrible thing.”A lot of people need to be persuaded. Congressional leaders acknowledged that the bill doesn’t allow for the wall that Mr. Trump and his allies want. (White House aides spent yesterday pitching the legislation to the likes of Lou Dobbs and Sean Hannity.) But it assigns more money to border fencing and immigration detention than left-wing Democrats would like.Still, no one sees a better option. “As with all compromises, I say to people, ‘Support the bill for what is in it,’ ” Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters yesterday. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, warned his colleagues against letting “unrelated cynical partisan plays get in the way of finishing this important process.”It’s not done until Mr. Trump puts pen to paper. CNN reminds us that he backed out of a previous compromise at the last minute, triggering the longest-ever government shutdown. This time, he could try to find further border funding from elsewhere in the government to claim some sort of victory.After three days of what Reuters calls “deputy-level meetings” in China, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, will embark on high-level trade negotiations in Beijing today.China is stepping up. The U.S. officials will meet today with Vice Premier Liu He, President Xi Jinping’s top economic adviser. According to the South China Morning Post, Mr. Xi himself may attend tomorrow.So far, it’s unclear what progress is being made. President Trump has said only that discussions are “going well,” adding that Chinese negotiators were “showing us tremendous respect.” Beijing has offered few details.But a deadline extension could help. America is scheduled to increase tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent if a deal isn’t reached by March 1. Mr. Trump has said he might let that slide; Bloomberg puts the possible deadline extension at 60 days.Relations between Washington and Brussels soured yesterday after the E.U. added four American territories to a blacklist of money-laundering regions, Jack Ewing and Alan Rappeport of the NYT write.On the list: Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands joined an ignominious group that includes North Korea, Libya, Yemen and Saudi Arabia. European banks must apply greater scrutiny to any transactions in those areas.The E.U.’s rationale: “Dirty money is the lifeblood of organized crime and terrorism,” Vera Jourova, the European commissioner for justice, said yesterday. “It was high time for Europe to act.”The Trump administration’s response: The Treasury Department condemned the list as flawed and unnecessary, and complained that it “was not provided any meaningful opportunity to discuss with the European Commission its basis for including the listed U.S. territories.”Where things get tricky: “The deteriorating relationship between the longtime allies will complicate a resolution on trade,” the NYT notes. “Talks between the European Commission and the White House are on the back burner while the Trump administration focuses on resolving its trade war with China. But trade talks are expected to intensify in the coming months.”Airbus will cease production of its A380 passenger jet, Amie Tsang of the NYT reports:• “Citing reduced orders from Emirates Airline, a major customer, and an inability to find other buyers, the company said it would halt deliveries of the jumbo jetliner in 2021, although it said it would continue to support existing A380s.”• “The decision will lead to job cuts at Airbus, possibly as many as 3,500 over the next three years, and Airbus said it would start discussions in the next weeks about the consequences for its work force.”• “The A380 “was built for a time when crowded airports would demand that planes carry more people to reduce congestion. But flight traffic instead shifted to smaller planes, which are cheaper to maintain, flying to regional airports, a move that reduced demand for larger aircraft.”Federal authorities yesterday charged Gene Levoff, a former senior director of corporate law at Apple, with illegally trading on inside information, according to Dai Wakabayashi of the NYT:• “The S.E.C. said Mr. Levoff violated insider trading laws three times from 2015 to 2016. On one occasion, Mr. Levoff sold roughly $10 million of Apple stock — nearly his entire holdings — from his personal brokerage account four days before Apple announced quarterly earnings on July 21, 2015.”• “The company’s stock price fell 4 percent after the earnings report, in which Apple revealed it had fallen short of analysts’ estimates for iPhone sales. Mr. Levoff had already seen a draft of the announcement and avoided about $345,000 in losses by dumping his Apple shares before the official announcement, the S.E.C. said.”• The S.E.C. said Apple cooperated with its investigation, and that Mr. Levoff was placed on leave in July and fired in September.• A lawyer for Mr. Levoff said in a statement, “Gene Levoff was a trusted Apple executive for many years, and has never before been accused of wrongdoing of any kind.”The state of negotiations on Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U. is still divided and confused, and Brussels doesn’t like what it sees.British lawmakers still don’t like Theresa May’s plan. They will debate and vote today on a series of amendments to her proposal. The main focus: a bid to rule out leaving without a deal. (Mrs. May insists that remain an option.)Britain’s opposition party, Labour, is divided. “Moderate Labour MPs are plotting to form a breakaway political party within weeks,” the FT reports, if their leader, Jeremy Corbyn, doesn’t back an amendment calling for a second referendum on Brexit.Surprise! Europe remains unimpressed. “E.U. leaders are still waiting for a signal from British Prime Minister Theresa May on the next steps in negotiating a critical divorce deal,” the WSJ reports. “In the meantime, they are losing confidence in her capacity to deliver a majority in her own parliament for any agreement.”More Brexit news: Britain so far has rollover arrangements for only about £16 billion, or $21 billion, of the £117 billion in E.U. trade deals it benefits from. Potential chaos could cause a surge in market abuse, according to a British financial watchdog. Switzerland will set quotas on British immigration in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Analysts and investors think that BB&T’s proposed $28 billion takeover of SunTrust will spur a wave of bank consolidation. Such mergers would probably be completed more quickly than in the past, thanks to recent changes at the Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, Lalita Clozel of the WSJ writes.How much faster? “The median time the Fed takes to approve or reject a bank merger receiving opposition from community groups — common in large deals — dropped to 3.8 months in the first half of 2018, from 5.6 months in the first half of 2017 and 7.0 months for all of 2015, according to a Fed report,” Ms. Clozel writes “At the O.C.C., the average time for handling all mergers dropped to 1.9 months in 2018, from 2.6 months in 2016, the agency said.”What changed? The Fed and the O.C.C. now review deals differently. One example: The O.C.C. says previous enforcement actions aren’t necessarily red flags that could kill a transaction.Banking deal makers are happy. “We were very pleased with the efficiency of the regulatory approval process,” said Kessel Stelling, the C.E.O. of Synovus, whose deal to buy FCB Financial Holdings won Fed approval in just four months.Others are not. Community groups, who usually press merging banks to increase lending in underserved areas, think they’re being sidelined. And Democratic lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren worry that the new review regime may lead to “a wave of bank consolidation to the detriment of consumers and the financial system.”BlackRock has hired Stanley Fischer, the former vice chairman of the Fed, as a senior adviser.Deals• Levi Strauss plans to go public again, potentially giving its founding family a multibillion-dollar windfall.

528,"Good Friday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)A fight has broken out between TPG and Bill McGlashan, the senior executive caught up in a huge college bribery scandal, over how he left the $103 billion investment giant, Michael de la Merced of DealBook reports.Mr. McGlashan had initially been put on leave by TPG after being accused of collaborating with William Singer, who ran the college preparatory business at the center of the scandal. Prosecutors say that Mr. Singer advised the financier to claim that his son had learning disabilities, and that Mr. McGlashan paid $50,000 to Mr. Singer’s charity.TPG said it fired him for cause yesterday. “We believe the behavior described to be inexcusable and antithetical to the values of our entire organization,” the firm said in a statement.TPG told employees and partners that it learned about the accusations against Mr. McGlashan only after prosecutors unsealed their case, according to an internal note reviewed by DealBook.But Mr. McGlashan said that he had already resigned. “I am deeply sorry this very difficult situation may interfere with the work to which I have devoted my life,” he wrote in a note.Emails between Mr. McGlashan and top TPG executives, provided by his spokesman, appear to confirm that. Mr. McGlashan emailed his resignation at 1:02 p.m. yesterday, according to the correspondence. At 2:03 p.m., Jon Winkelried, one of TPG’s co-C.E.O.s, replied, acknowledging receipt of the resignation — but he also included a notice of termination.At 2:20 p.m., Mr. McGlashan responded, “I am perplexed by your attempt to terminate me because, as you acknowledged in your email, you had already received my resignation.”It’s unclear what is at stake financially for Mr. McGlashan in terms of his TPG severance. In his email, Mr. Winkelried wrote to Mr. McGlashan, “We will be in touch to advise you of the economic consequences of the termination of your employment.”A spokesman for TPG declined to comment on the emails.More: The man who tipped off authorities to the college admissions scandal was reportedly a financier who was being investigated in a securities fraud case. And here’s a reminder why paying bribes to get your child into college is a federal crime.Last week, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would pivot toward privacy. With two of the company’s top executives leaving just days later, it appears the change has had an immediate impact.The two executives — Chris Cox, Facebook’s chief product officer, who is widely regarded as the company’s No. 3, and Chris Daniels, the head of WhatsApp — announced yesterday that they were to leave the company. Their departure comes “after disagreements with Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, over the social network’s future direction,” according to Mike Isaac of the NYT.“The differences stemmed from Mr. Zuckerberg’s asserting control over his company and its apps — Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger — by rolling out a plan to integrate the services into a single privacy-focused platform, according to six people involved in the situation,” he adds.Several executives at Facebook feared that knitting together the apps could take a toll on the popularity and growth of their individual products, according to Mr. Isaac. They were also reportedly worried that they could lose autonomy and power. Traces of those sentiments could be seen in a public statement issued by Mr. Cox.“Facebook has become Zuckerberg’s company now more than ever,” Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Opinion writes. “Whether that’s good for the company or for the company’s billions of users — we’ll see.”In the wake of two fatal crashes within five months that involved its 737 Max airplanes, the company is reeling.Boeing will suspend delivery of its 737 Max jets, it announced yesterday, but continue to produce them. It currently builds 52 aircraft a month, many of which are Max models, and entirely shutting down production would prove costly.But the policy may only last so long. Boeing’s production facility in Renton, Wash., has only limited capacity for storing the airplanes, according to the WSJ. Boeing may, however, be able to apply for special permits to fly the planes to other storage sites, according to Reuters.Meanwhile, big questions hang over the Max’s software. Pilots from Southwest Airlines and American Airlines requested software updates for some of the 737 Max’s automated systems last year, reports the NYT. They were promised updates within six weeks, one pilot said, but they have still not arrived. Similarities between the two recent crashes point to potential problems with the automated system that requires the update.And the U.S. Air Force has also lost trust in Boeing. In a case unrelated to the Max debacle, Air Force officials said that quality control issues with a new aerial refueling tanker caused it to suspend deliveries in February.British lawmakers yesterday voted to postpone the country’s departure from the E.U., but narrowly failed to wrest control of the Brexit process from Prime Minister Theresa May’s government, write Ellen Barry and Stephen Castle of the NYT.“Mrs. May fended off — by just two votes — a remarkable power grab by lawmakers frustrated at months of political deadlock that has left the country in limbo with just 15 days to go before its scheduled departure from the bloc. They later voted by 412 to 202 for a motion that means that Britain will almost certainly not leave the E.U. as scheduled on March 29.”“What remains unclear now is how long the delay will be. Mrs. May plans to hold a third vote on her unpopular plan for withdrawal, despite have suffered two staggering defeats on it already. If the prime minister should succeed in a third attempt, she would then request a short delay — no more than three months — from E.U. leaders.”“But the motion noted that should her plan go down to defeat once again, Mrs. May might have to ask European leaders for a much longer delay, with unknown consequences.”More: Brexit’s importance to the global economy may have been overstated.Tulane’s Corporate Law Institute, a conference held every spring in New Orleans, is where the mergers-and-acquisitions world gathers to talk shop.

Last year’s $4.2 trillion in global announced deals was the third-best year ever, according to Citigroup. Nearly every industry enjoyed a rise in deal-making.And M. & A. should keep rolling on. Mark Shafir, the co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Citigroup, and others at the conference noted that takeover financing remains cheap, shareholders seem to support sensible deals and shareholder activists are continuing to push companies into transactions.But “there is no doubt that we are in a much less bullish environment for M. & A. than a year ago,” Mr. Shafir said. Among the pressures on deal-making:• There are fears about a potential recession, the ongoing trade wars and the persistent worry that the stock market will suffer like it did late last year.• Regulators are a big issue too, especially the concern that they could be used as political cudgels. One of the big topics at the conference was the growing importance of overseers like Cfius, the American government panel that reviews cross-border deals for national security concerns.• And then there’s the natural cycle of deal-making. Booms tend to be followed by big drops in volumes, and this cycle has gone on longer than most, Mr. Shafir said.The Connecticut Supreme Court cleared the way for a lawsuit against the companies that manufactured and sold the semiautomatic rifle used in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, Rick Rojas and Kristin Hussey of the NYT report.The ruling allows a case, brought by victims’ families, to go around the immunity that Congress granted gun companies to shield them from litigation when their weapons are used in a crime. That leaves open the potential for Remington, which made the rifle used in the attack, to be held liable.Lawyers for the families argued that advertising campaigns for guns appeared to be “courting” troubled young men, like Adam Lanza, who carried out the Sandy Hook shooting. In a 4-3 ruling, justices “found that the sweeping federal protections did not prevent the families from bringing a lawsuit based on wrongful marketing claims,” Mr. Rojas and Ms. Hussey write.“The decision represents a significant development in the long-running battle between gun control advocates and the gun lobby,” Mr. Rojas and Ms. Hussey add. And it could chart a “possible legal road map for victims’ relatives and survivors from other mass shootings.”President Trump appears to have reeled in his claim on Wednesday of being “not in a rush whatsoever” to reach a trade deal with China.“We’ll have news on China. Probably one way or the other, we’re going to know over the next three to four weeks,” Mr. Trump told reporters yesterday, according to CNBC. He added that China had been “very responsible and very reasonable.”Such optimism may have been helped along by the news that China made “last-minute changes to a proposed foreign-investment law,” in an attempt to “address U.S. complaints about forced technology transfer,” according to the WSJ. Intellectual property concerns have been a major part of the trade dispute between America and China.But a final agreement is still some way off.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said yesterday that a proposed meeting between Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China won’t happen this month because there is still more work to do. Sources tell Bloomberg it could happen in April.Elon Musk last night unveiled a new seven-seat compact sport-utility vehicle called the Model Y, Neal E. Boudette and Raymond Zhong of the NYT write:• “The Model Y will be available beginning next year, the company said, at prices ranging from $39,000 to $60,000, depending on the model, with a $2,500 deposit.”• “A long-range version will be able to drive 300 miles on a single charge, it said, while the $60,000 Performance model will have a top speed of 150 miles per hour.”• “‘It has the functionality of an S.U.V., but it will ride like a sports car,’ Mr. Musk said. ‘This thing will be really tight in corners.’”The unveiling “comes as Tesla confronts sales challenges,” Mr. Boudette and Mr. Zhong write. Sales of the Model S and Model X have been flattening, and its push to sell the Model 3 for $35,000 remains shrouded in uncertainty as the company works out how to cut costs to make that pricing possible.Andrew Weissmann, one of Robert Mueller’s top deputies, is said to be leaving the special counsel’s office.Lee Fixel, a partner at Tiger Global Management, is leaving the hedge fund in June.The meat-substitute start-up Impossible Foods hired Dennis Woodside, who was Dropbox’s C.O.O., as its president.Tesla named Vaibhav Taneja as its new chief accounting officer.Goldman Sachs plans to cut 65 jobs because of “economic” factors.Deals• Uber reportedly plans to publicly disclose its I.P.O. prospectus in April.

529,"Good Friday morning. Want this by emai? Sign up here.President Trump traveled to the southwestern border yesterday, where he reiterated the demand for a wall that has led to a bitter political impasse and a government shutdown now in its 21st day. He used the visit to blame the shutdown on Democrats and suggested that he might declare a national emergency to bypass Congress.White House officials considered diverting emergency aid to build a border barrier. Among the options: moving $13.9 billion allocated last year after devastating hurricanes and wildfires.Some Senate Republicans came off the sidelines to seek a deal that would reopen the government. But negotiations collapsed before they could gain momentum.The fallout continues to spread:• President Trump canceled a planned trip to the glittering economic conference held annually in Davos, Switzerland, citing what he called the Democrats’ “intransigence.”• Farm country has stood by the president, but some farmers say the loss of crucial loans, payments and other services could change that.• The leaders of unions representing air traffic controllers and aviation safety inspectors warned of potential risks to air travel.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Donald J. Trump’s management style as a businessman — impetuous, impolitic, sometimes immature — worked when he ran his private company, writes the NYT business columnist James Stewart.But now Mr. Trump is running a much larger enterprise, and the management traits that may have propelled him into the White House are not serving him well now that he’s there.With the government shut down over Mr. Trump’s demand for border wall funding, the loss of a Republican majority in the House and scant legislative achievements beyond the 2017 tax cut, Mr. Stewart argues, his presidency is emerging as a case study in how not to govern.Sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying are rampant in economics, a field that regularly isolates and dissuades women and minorities and that has only recently begun to address its entrenched culture of exclusion, write Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley of the NYT.The issue arose often last weekend at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in Atlanta, they report, where women from Ivy League schools told stories of wearing khakis and loafers to fit in with their male colleagues and new research was released showing that only 10 percent of tenured finance professors are women.Ben Bernanke, the former Fed chairman and the group’s president, said at the event that “economics certainly has a problem” and “a reputation for hostility toward women and minorities.” Janet Yellen, who was the Fed’s first chairwoman and will head the association next year, said that dealing with misconduct and discrimination “should be the highest priority.”Last month, the NYT wrote about harassment accusations against Roland G. Fryer Jr., a prominent Harvard economist, who had been expected join the association’s executive committee this month but was asked to resign.A #MeToo lawsuit: The board of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is being sued in California over the departure of Andy Rubin, a senior executive known as the “father of Android.” The shareholder lawsuit alleges that directors knew about an investigation into a sexual harassment claim against Mr. Rubin but nevertheless played an “active and direct role” in approving a $90 million severance package for him. The NYT reported in October that Google made the payout after a female employee accused Mr. Rubin of coercing her into performing oral sex.Negotiations between China and the U.S. are advancing, with China’s vice premier and economic chief, Liu He, heading to Washington on Jan. 30 and 31. He will meet with the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, according to the WSJ.The next-level gathering, unless it is stymied by the government shutdown, will continue three days of midlevel discussions in Beijing that wrapped up on Wednesday with a sense of progress but few specific resolutions.This fight does have some winners: Tariffs on Chinese and American cars could bolster automakers in Japan. Restrictions on American soybeans could help farmers in Brazil and Canada.But investors want resolution. The standoff has shaken global markets, and signs of optimism from negotiators lifted stocks this week. Today in Asia, the Hang Seng, Nikkei, Kospi and Shanghai Composite indexes all closed higher.Espionage in China: A Chinese employee of Huawei and a Polish employee of the French telecommunications company Orange have been arrested in Poland, charged with spying for the Chinese government.Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the central bank would evaluate the health of the economy before any further interest rate increases, using the word “patience” four times in his remarks. Financial markets have shown signs of anxiety about the economic outlook, but Mr. Powell said 2018 was “a very good year for the economy.” The Fed, he said, saw signs of continued momentum.In other Fed news: Most private economists expect it to hold interest rates steady at least until June, according to a WSJ survey. Last summer, the Fed’s policy of quantitative tightening was expected to lift bond yields, but in the topsy-turvy world of Wall Street, the reaction has reversed in just a few months.The forecast on Wall Street calls for plenty of pessimism, as a slew of companies slashed their financial predictions and announced cost-cutting measures yesterday:• American Airlines said a measure of fourth-quarter revenue would gain just 1.5 percent, after previously promising as much as 3.5 percent. Delta, which will report its earnings on Tuesday, made a similar announcement earlier this month.• Ford said it would cut thousands of jobs in Europe, as it faces declining demand and increasingly stringent emissions rules. Jaguar Land Rover said it was cutting 4,500 jobs because of “multiple geopolitical and regulatory disruptions.”• BlackRock, which will report its earnings on Wednesday, will show 500 employees the door in the next few weeks. The world’s largest asset manager blamed “market uncertainty.”• Macy’s suffered the biggest single-day sell-off in its history after scaling back its sales and earnings guidance.• Holiday sales at Kohl’s were disappointing, rising 1.2 percent last year from the year before, compared with a nearly 7 percent boost in 2017. Barnes & Noble said it might slash its outlook by as much as 10 percent because of higher spending on advertising and promotions.• Bed Bath & Beyond was one of the few bright spots, saying it was ahead of some of its financial goals.Many more businesses are scheduled to report results next week, with JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo earnings coming on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America on Wednesday, and Netflix and Morgan Stanley on Thursday.But how long will it take the market react to the secrets likely buried in the “dreary and repetitious” prose that makes earning reports so “mind-numbingly boring”? Months, probably, writes the NYT’s Jeff Sommer.• Peter Weinberg, who helped found the financial services firm Perella Weinberg Partners in 2006, will reportedly become its chief executive as it prepares for a potential I.P.O. (Bloomberg)• KKR, the investment firm, hired David Luboff from the Macquarie Group to head its Asia Pacific Infrastructure group. (Business Wire)• Keisuke Sueyoshi, previously the head of mergers and acquisitions at Deutsche Bank in Tokyo, joined Goldman Sachs as managing director in its investment banking division. (Bloomberg)• Gary Levine and Jana Winograde will become the presidents of entertainment at Showtime, reporting to David Nevins, the chief executive and chairman. (NYT)• Yasuo Takeuchi, the vice president of the Japanese medical equipment and camera maker Olympus, will replace Hiroyuki Sasa as chief executive in April. The company was also forced by ValueAct, an activist hedge fund, to bring on three foreign directors. (FT)Deals • A record number of companies faced activist campaigns like Third Point’s proxy fight with Campbell Soup last year: 226, up from 188 in 2017.

530,"Good Wednesday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.President Trump escalated the border wall fight in a televised speech last night, at the cost of leaving the government partly closed. He criticized political opponents for blocking the wall, although Democrats have offered $1.3 billion for border security measures like surveillance and fencing.The effects of the shutdown have begun to ripple across the economy, with mortgage applications delayed or canceled, public companies unable to complete deals and the well running dry for many federal employees.• Payday would have come this week for many of the 800,000 federal workers affected. With no paychecks on the way, their savings are evaporating and their credit cards are being maxed out.• The impasse is being felt elsewhere in the economy, including in home sales. Buyers are pulling out because of “economic uncertainty,” according to a National Association of Realtors survey. And closings are being delayed or canceled because customers’ mortgages were backed by federal agencies.• Several regulators are down to a skeleton staff, and companies are telling investors that their pending takeovers and stock sales could be delayed.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Trade talks in Beijing wrapped up today, as Chinese and American negotiators hurry to strike a deal before March, when the Trump administration has threatened to raise tariffs again.In recent weeks, the Chinese have made some concessions, resuming purchases of American soybeans, dropping retaliatory measures on U.S.-made cars. China has also offered to welcome more foreign investors and help limit forced transfer of overseas companies’ technology to Chinese businesses.Yesterday, President Trump wrote on Twitter that the discussions were “going very well!”But in Washington, many are sounding a note of caution: Are China’s promises too vague? Are they enforceable? One scholar described Beijing’s compromises as “a modest adjustment” when the U.S. and other countries want a “great leap in liberalization.”The Kim surprise:  Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, stepped off a train in Beijing yesterday to meet with President Xi Jinping, at the Chinese government’s invitation. China said the timing of his arrival was coincidental, but his presence was a reminder that the U.S. needs China’s cooperation to exert pressure on North Korea.Scheduling issues: The Trump administration has said that if negotiations fail, it will raise tariffs on Chinese goods on March 2. But there are several other key dates in play.• Mr. Trump will attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which starts Jan. 22. But the U.S. is reluctant to set up formal trade negotiations there, possibly because the president plans to use his State of the Union address, on Jan. 29, to demand broader powers to raise tariffs.• But China wants progress before the Lunar New Year on Feb. 4, which is generally preceded by a surge in consumer spending.China has reason to rush: The trade tensions are hurting its economy.• The World Bank said yesterday that Chinese growth would slow to 6.2 percent this year from 6.5 percent last year. Global growth is predicted to fall to 2.9 percent from 3 percent in 2018.• Corporate insolvencies are expected to increase faster in China than in any other major economy this year, growing by a fifth in 2019.• Chinese bond yields are at a two-year low. Its central bank loosened credit conditions five times in the past year.• Signs of progress in the talks drove markets higher in the U.S. yesterday and in Europe and Asia today.The struggling retailer reached a deal yesterday to stay alive after a flurry of last-minute negotiations, the NYT’s Michael Corkery writes. Sears’s chairman, Edward Lampert, a hedge fund manager who took control in 2005, now has the opportunity to sweeten his $4.4 billion bid for the company. He is expected to enter an official bid at a court-supervised auction next week.Sears’ largest creditors are in the driving seat, and they have two options. They can let Mr. Lampert try to maintain it as a “going concern” or force it to liquidate by selling all its real estate, inventory, intellectual property and other assets.Other retail news: In the first retail holiday update, J.C. Penney reported yesterday that adjusted comparable sales fell 3.5 percent during the crucial shopping period. The department store chain, based in Plano, Tex., also said it would close three stores and may announce more as its new chief executive, Jill Soltau, attempts a turnaround.The media tycoon Sumner Redstone, 95, settled a long-running legal conflict with Manuela Herzer, writes Edmund Lee of the NYT. It was ostensibly focused on her right to his holdings, but it drew interest because of the salacious details it disclosed and the questions it raised about his mental state.Mr. Redstone and his daughter, Shari Redstone, run the private theater chain National Amusements, through which they control the CBS television network and a portfolio of companies at Viacom that include MTV and Paramount Pictures.Ms. Herzer, who is at least four decades younger than Mr. Redstone, had been named as a beneficiary of his will until he stripped her from the document in 2015 and forced her out of his mansion in Beverly Hills.Fallout from the ensuing court battle led Mr. Redstone to scale back his involvement in CBS and Viacom, and prompted a succession struggle that put his daughter at the top of the media empire.Court filings show that Ms. Herzer must now pay back $3.25 million in gifts and money received while she was Mr. Redstone’s companion.Investment bankers at the embattled financial institution are steeling themselves for a double-digit cut to their bonus pool, according to the FT.Deutsche has been battered by bad news in the past year: Its stock price hit record lows, competitors are gobbling up its market share, and top-level employees are jumping ship as it fires thousands of others.

531,"WASHINGTON — There was a brief moment in Nancy Pelosi’s life when she worried she had too much power. She had so many titles in the California Democratic Party, including chairwoman, that she told Lindy Boggs, a Louisiana congresswoman, that she was thinking of giving some up.That was in 1984, and Ms. Boggs “said, ‘Darlin’, no man would ever think that. Don’t you give anything up,’” Ms. Pelosi said in a recent interview, leaning forward as she mimicked Ms. Boggs’s Southern accent. “And then she said, ‘Know thy power.’”More than three decades later, Ms. Pelosi is all but assured on Thursday of reclaiming her former title as speaker of the House, the first lawmaker in more than half a century to hold the office twice. With the gavel in hand, she will cement her status as the highest-ranking and most powerful elected woman in American political history.The story of her rise, from the well-mannered daughter of a Baltimore mayor to a savvy legislator and prolific fund-raiser who is as much feared within her caucus as she is admired, is, in some ways, the story of the women’s movement itself. It is also a comeback story; after losing the speakership eight years ago, she will now usher in a new era of divided government in Washington.And in the era of #MeToo, Ms. Pelosi, a mother of five and grandmother of nine, will be the public face of the opposition to a president who won the White House after disparaging women, and paying hush money to a Playboy model and a pornographic film actress who said they had extramarital affairs with him.But Ms. Pelosi, 78, long a target of Republicans who have demonized her as a San Francisco liberal, is also coming to the speakership with self-imposed constraints. To quell an uprising among Democrats who wanted a younger generation of leaders, she has agreed to limit her term to four years. Some say that could weaken her — a notion she dismissed.“I’m used to, shall we say, enthusiasms from all elements of the party — I can roll with that,” she said.Republicans do not underestimate her. “She is a skilled adversary and a master at keeping all Democrats in line,” said Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.Ms. Pelosi knows that this speakership will be defined by how she handles President Trump. The last time she was speaker, from 2007 to 2011, legislative accomplishments made her reputation. She muscled through bills that bailed out Wall Street and helped arrest an economic free-fall, allowed gays to serve in the military, overhauled the nation’s banking laws and expanded access to health care for an estimated 17 million people. Many say passage of the Affordable Care Act is her signature achievement.But divided government, an unpopular president and wide-ranging, possibly criminal investigations into Mr. Trump, his presidential campaign and his businesses have changed her role drastically.“This is legacy-building time,” said Jennifer Lawless, an expert on women in politics at the University of Virginia. “If she can be the person who is remembered for holding Trump accountable, or not letting him put forward facts that are not facts, if she can be the one who just calmly sits there and hold his feet to the fire, in a lot of ways, that’s just as important as anything else she does.”On a recent Saturday morning, Ms. Pelosi ducked into a closet in her office and retrieved a T-shirt that a colleague had given her, bearing the quote that she used to smack down Mr. Trump during a televised Oval Office meeting on his border wall: “Don’t characterize the strength that I bring.”“You know, it’s really sad. Nothing he said was true — nothing,” Ms. Pelosi said of that December meeting.Her power stride out of the White House that day, in dark sunglasses and an orange coat, turned Ms. Pelosi into a fashion trendsetter; ever mindful of the messages she sends, she frets that she needs to retire the coat: “If I show up with that coat, doesn’t it look a little like — hey, look at me?”Ms. Pelosi has long governed with a touch of gender-consciousness. When she became speaker the first time, she surrounded herself with her grandchildren and the children of other lawmakers on the podium inside the House chamber. A woman was in charge.This time Ms. Pelosi seems to be casting off maternal imagery. “I put on a suit of armor, eat nails for breakfast,” CNN quoted her as saying.One good friend, former Senator Barbara Boxer of California, said Ms. Pelosi seemed “very liberated” after surviving the challenge to her speakership, and coming off the meeting with Mr. Trump. “They tried to kick her down, and I don’t think she ever got down,” Ms. Boxer said.A generation of young feminists is taking notice.“She’s unapologetic about her ambition, she’s insulting Trump’s manhood and storming out of the White House in orange coat and sunglasses,” said Amanda Litman, 28, and a founder of Run for Something, which recruits and supports young liberal candidates. “It’s very authentically her in a way that I’m not sure she was able to do in past decades.”Most accounts of Ms. Pelosi’s rise begin with her father, Thomas D’Alesandro Jr., an old machine politician who doled out favors from their living room in Baltimore’s Little Italy. But her mother, Annunciata, was an equally powerful role model.“Big Nancy,” as she was known, was a strategist, an organizer of Democratic women and the keeper of what the family called “the favor file.” From her, Ms. Pelosi learned the power of social networking and the personal approach to give and take in negotiations.“Nancy knows how to listen; she learned that from her mother,” said former Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a Baltimore native who was a few years ahead of Ms. Pelosi in their all-girls Catholic high school.Young Nancy D’Alesandro had dreams of becoming a lawyer, but by the time the women’s liberation movement was in full swing, she was married to her husband, Paul, and raising children.“We missed the burning bra,” said Rita Meyer, a college roommate and close friend. “We missed the marijuana.”Even when she was pushing strollers, Ms. Pelosi said, she was active in Democratic politics and pushing her own children to get involved. With her husband growing ever more successful in business, they opened their large home on one of San Francisco’s most exclusive streets for Democratic events.A turning point for Ms. Pelosi came in 1976, when she got behind the presidential campaign of Gov. Jerry Brown of California. She persuaded him to compete in the Maryland Democratic primary, drawing on her ties (her brother Tommy had also been Baltimore mayor) to help engineer his victory, a setback for Jimmy Carter.“I had no direct knowledge of anybody or anything in Maryland,” Mr. Brown, wrapping up his second stint as governor, said in an interview. “It was her idea. Just to think of that is a bold move.”Ms. Pelosi then was chairwoman of the California Democratic Party and helped organize its 1984 convention. Then, in 1987, Sala Burton, the incumbent congresswoman from San Francisco who was dying of cancer, summoned Ms. Pelosi to her bedside and asked her to run to fill her seat.There were 23 women in the House — 12 Democrats and 11 Republicans — when Ms. Pelosi arrived. Ms. Boxer, who was then serving in the House, recalled an event where a colleague — she could not recall who — introduced his fellow members.“He goes through everybody, and then he gets to us and he said, ‘And then there’s Nancy and Barbara,’” Ms. Boxer recalled. “She and I never forgot it.”Ms. Pelosi carved out a niche as an advocate for human rights, particularly in China, and for AIDS patients, a significant part of her San Francisco constituency. She sought, and eventually landed, a seat on the powerful Appropriations Committee and a national security post on the Intelligence Committee.She was forceful about her ideas, said George Miller, a retired congressman and close friend, adding, “I don’t know that leadership was all that excited” to hear them. At a Democratic retreat after the party lost the majority in 1994, Ms. Pelosi planned a presentation on how Democrats in California picked up seats. Almost nobody came.“She said, ‘These boys just don’t know how to win,’” Mr. Miller remembered.In 2001, Ms. Pelosi was elected Democratic whip, beating her longtime rival, Representative Steny D. Hoyer of Maryland, to become the first woman to hold that post. The next year she was elected Democratic leader, the first woman to lead a party in Congress. At her swearing in, she distributed buttons that read, “We’ve waited more than 200 years for this day.”Ms. Pelosi was swept into power as speaker in 2007 on a wave of revulsion over President George W. Bush and the war in Iraq. But she proved that she could work with Mr. Bush when needed; as the country faced economic collapse in 2008, she delivered the necessary votes to pass a Wall Street bailout plan — after Mr. Bush’s Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., got down on one knee and begged. (“I didn’t know you were Catholic,” she wryly said to him.)She was relentless in gathering votes, even when it put her members in jeopardy. If her own pressure campaigns and horse-trading did not work, she would call in outsiders. Henry A. Waxman, a former California congressman, recalled Ms. Pelosi’s effort to win over a nervous young member, Zack Space, on a climate change bill that had almost no prospects in the Senate. Mr. Space had Greek roots.“She had a woman, a leader in the national Greek community, talk to him,” Mr. Waxman said, “and then this woman came and sat in the front row while the vote was taking place.” Mr. Space got the message, voted yes, then lost his re-election.But she is most remembered for passage of the Affordable Care Act, without a single Republican vote. Norman J. Ornstein, who has studied Congress for decades at the American Enterprise Institute, called it “as masterful a piece of legislating as I have ever seen.”It may have been matched only by her remarkable talent for raising money. Ms. Pelosi has raised $728.3 million for Democrats since 2002, her office said.Now, after an election that ushered a record number of women into Congress, Ms. Pelosi is determined not to let another history-making moment pass. She is marking her return to power with a string of events, including a women’s tea, a dinner at the Italian Embassy featuring the singer Tony Bennett and a town hall-style meeting, televised on MSNBC.Asked if she considers herself Mr. Trump’s equal, she replied, “The Constitution does.” She frowned at the memory of a dinner at the White House last year when men talked over her, and she asked, “Doesn’t anybody listen to a woman in the room?”“Hopefully that will become a thing of the past now that we have so many women in Congress — and with the gavel,” Ms. Pelosi said. “The gavel makes a big difference.”"
532,"Good Thursday. Want this by email? Sign up here.American and Chinese officials have reportedly begun to hash out documents that could form the basis of a trade deal, but there are growing concerns that leaders of both nations are softening on key demands. More on the progress from Bloomberg, citing an unidentified source:• Several memorandums of understanding “would cover areas including agriculture, non-tariff barriers, services, technology transfer and intellectual property, said the person.”• “The enforcement mechanism remains unclear, but would likely be a threat that tariffs would be reimposed if conditions aren’t met, the person said.”• “No breakthrough is expected during this week’s talks,” though an extension to a March 1 deadline is still a possibility.But there’s a new fear surrounding the deal. According to Lingling Wei and Bob Davis of the WSJ, there are “growing concerns on the home front” in both America and China that their leaders — and President Trump in particular — are “going to cave in to the other side”:• Some officials reportedly believe Mr. Trump is “tiring of the trade dispute and is poised to cut a deal that won’t lead to fundamental changes by China.”• “American Enterprise Institute China scholar Derek Scissors said that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a China hawk, holds significant leverage over Mr. Trump to keep to a hard line — including, potentially, the threat of resigning if the deal falls short.”More trade news: Mr. Trump reportedly continues to consider E.U. car tariffs — levies that Volkswagen says could cost it billions of euros per year. And is the clothes maker American Giant, which makes all its products in the U.S., a model for Mr. Trump’s ambitions?Hedge funds and investment banks think they’ve found a big new moneymaker, according to Matt Goldstein and Jim Tankersley of the NYT: so-called opportunity funds, part of President Trump’s tax package to steer money to poor areas by offering large tax breaks.• “More than 80 of the funds have sprung up since January 2018, even though the Trump administration has not finalized regulations governing them.”• The pitch to potential investors: outsize returns while fighting poverty.• The provision that created opportunity funds “lowers capital gains taxes — potentially dramatically — for investors who finance projects in about 8,700 so-called opportunity zones spread across the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.”• The financial benefit? “An investor who keeps money in such a fund for 10 years is able to exclude 15 percent of the original capital gain from taxation. And — potentially much more lucratively — the investor would not owe taxes on any gains that accrued if the investment increased in value in that time.”• “Skeptics worry that the funds will mostly target real estate and other projects that probably would have attracted investment even without the tax break, and may not deliver the returns being dangled.”The British prime minister was in Brussels yesterday to press for changes that could save her Brexit deal. She may finally be making some headway, though she still needs to convince lawmakers of any changes to her plan.She made her case to the E.U. In discussions with the European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, she pressed for “legally binding changes” to her existing deal that she hopes will make it palatable to British lawmakers. Britain’s attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, and Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, are expected to propose wordings for those legal tweaks today.Some progress may have been made. “A Brexit agreement is already being hammered out in Brussels, according to Spain’s foreign minister, as the bloc seeks reassuring language that can convince British members of Parliament to back the deal,” Bloomberg explains.But the E.U. may demand that any changes are first approved in Britain. The E.U. “doesn’t want to call leaders for a summit to sign off on changes that are then rejected by the U.K. Parliament,” Bloomberg reports, adding that “once there’s an agreement, it should be tested in Parliament, and only after that will leaders be asked to sign off on it at a summit.” And it is far from clear that lawmakers would approve.More Brexit news: Nine more Conservative party lawmakers have reportedly said that they could resign from the party in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The credit agency Fitch may downgrade Britain’s double-A rating over concerns about Brexit. The White House has spent the last year trying to convince Europe that the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei is a national security threat and shouldn’t be given any role in developing new wireless networks. So far, that plan doesn’t appear to be working.British officials don’t seem to agree with the White House. “Ciaran Martin, who leads Britain’s National Cyber Security Center, expressed confidence at a conference in Brussels that any security risks Huawei posed could be managed,” Adam Satariano of the NYT reports.Nor do those in Germany. The news follows a WSJ report yesterday that said “the German government is leaning toward letting Huawei Technologies Co. participate in building the nation’s high-speed internet infrastructure.”“If Britain does not ban Huawei, it would be a defeat for the White House,” Mr. Satariano writes. “Because Britain belongs to the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance with the United States, whatever it decides on Huawei is likely to affect how other countries treat the company.”The German lender suffered one of its biggest-ever trading losses from a decade-long wager on a municipal-bond investment that spiraled out of control, the WSJ reports, citing unnamed sources.• The bank bought $7.8 billion worth of municipal bonds in 2007, later covered with insurance purchased from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.• The WSJ says Deutsche Bank “resisted for years reducing the value of those bonds and related derivatives on its books to a level that markets suggested they were worth,” and dismissed concerns from auditors.• “Internally, the bank acknowledged losses on the trade only incrementally. After it finally liquidated the position nine years after buying the bonds, bank executives debated whether to restate past financial results, but never did so.”• Deutsche Bank finally liquidated the position in the summer of 2016, after its C.E.O. at the time, John Cryan, demanded the trade be wound down.• “The prolonged struggle over how to handle the investment sheds light on cultural and financial challenges inside one of Europe’s biggest banks that have hampered its ability to compete with stronger U.S. rivals.”More Deutsche Bank news: Executives were reportedly so worried about the Trump Organization defaulting on $340 million in loans during the Trump presidency that they discussed extending repayment dates until 2025.The Swiss bank was hit by one of France’s biggest-ever financial penalties yesterday for helping wealthy French clients hide money from the authorities.The judgment was seven years in the making. French authorities began investigating after whistle-blowers tipped them off. According to the NYT, prosecutors said that UBS bankers in France eager for big bonuses “had alerted their counterparts in Switzerland to potential ‘big potatoes’ ” — French citizens with assets of at least €500,000, or about $560,000.Bankers used “James Bond” methods to hide their work. They “followed a UBS ‘security governance manual’ that included instructions for using encrypted computers, using business cards without the bank’s logo and switching hotels frequently,” according to the NYT.UBS will appeal. The firm said that the case was “based on the unfounded allegations of former employees,” and its C.E.O. derided the verdict as “superficial” and “astounding.”Major companies including Nestlé and Epic Games said yesterday that they had stopped buying ads on Google’s video platform. The reason, the NYT reports: Pedophiles were swarming the comment sections of children’s videos.The companies acted after a user posted a video that pointed out that innocent videos of youngsters were being overrun with suggestive comments aimed at the children.The video’s creator, Matt Watson, accused YouTube of “facilitating the sexual exploitation” of children. He added that the site’s recommendation system guided predators to other videos featuring minors.A Google spokeswoman said the company had taken action by deleting accounts and offensive comments. “Any content — including comments — that endangers minors is abhorrent and we have clear policies prohibiting this on YouTube,” she said.At this point, the blood-testing company is over. But Nick Bilton of Vanity Fair writes that in its final months, Theranos’s founder, Elizabeth Holmes, tried to abandon a high-spending lifestyle and attempted to convince employees that everything was O.K.:• “Holmes had a hard time weaning herself off certain luxuries. She still had her own personal security detail, drivers, personal assistants and a personal publicist who was on retainer for $25,000 a month.”• “By late 2017, however, Holmes had begun to slightly rein in the spending.” She agreed to give up her private-jet travel, and moved the company’s premises from Palo Alto to Newark, to premises that former employees called “crummy.”• “Yet through all of this, former employees of the company have told me, Holmes had a bizarre way of acting like nothing was wrong. Even more peculiarly, she appeared happy. ‘The company is falling apart, there are countless indictments piling up, employees are leaving in droves, and Elizabeth is just weirdly chipper,’ a former senior executive told me.”Those in the upper echelon are hoarding money and privilege to a degree not seen in decades. But that doesn’t make them happy at work, Charles Duhigg writes in the NYT:• “A surprising portion of Americans are professionally miserable right now. In the mid-1980s, roughly 61 percent of workers told pollsters they were satisfied with their jobs. Since then, that number has declined substantially, hovering around half, according to data collected by the Conference Board, a nonprofit research organization.”• “Even among professionals given to lofty self-images, like those in medicine and law, other studies have noted a rise in discontent.”• “Why? Based on my own conversations with classmates and the research I began reviewing, the answer comes down to oppressive hours, political infighting, increased competition sparked by globalization, an ‘always-on culture’ bred by the internet — but also something that’s hard for these professionals to put their finger on, an underlying sense that their work isn’t worth the grueling effort they’re putting into it.”Dane Butswinkas is stepping down as Tesla’s general counsel, only two months after joining the carmaker from the law firm Williams & Connolly.Keith Rabois, the veteran investor, is leaving Khosla Ventures for Founders Fund, the venture capital firm run by his longtime friend Peter Thiel.Robin Phillips, a co-head of HSBC’s global banking division, will reportedly step down this summer.Serena Williams joined the board of Poshmark, an online retailer.Deals• Lyft plans to begin its I.P.O. roadshow on March 18, paving the way to begin trading publicly on the Nasdaq stock market by early April.

533,"Good Thursday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.Larry Fink, who oversees nearly $6 trillion of investments at BlackRock, wrote a letter to chief executives last year declaring that businesses must make “a positive contribution to society.”It was seen as a turning point in the debate over the state of global capitalism, Andrew writes in his column. Some business leaders bristled, but others began talking about their companies’ “purpose” in mission statements and official documents.Yesterday, Mr. Fink sent chief executives another letter, arguing that businesses cannot merely have a purpose; they must be leaders in a divided world:It’s a continued explanation of the stance that last year prompted Barron’s to call Mr. Fink “the new conscience of Wall Street.” Not everyone agrees with him, but he has helped further a conversation that is undoubtedly positive, Andrew writes.“I don’t see a recession coming”: Mr. Fink told the FT that skittishness among investors was natural, given the developments that buffeted markets toward the end of last year. But he added that he saw few signs of a global downturn.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Goldman Sachs is orchestrating a campaign to discredit one of its former partners and minimize its role in the looting of Malaysia’s big state investment fund, write Matthew Goldstein, Emily Flitter and Kate Kelly.The news: In recent presentations to regulators and law enforcement authorities, Goldman Sachs has depicted Tim Leissner, a former top investment banker, as a master con man, according to people familiar with their contents.The background: The scorched-earth tactics reflect just how worried the Wall Street bank is about the criminal investigations into its role in the theft of at least $2.7 billion from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad sovereign wealth fund, known as 1MDB.What’s at stake: Goldman recently disclosed that it set aside an additional $516 million to cover potential legal and regulatory penalties, including those related to 1MDB. And executives said the bank could owe another $2 billion.More banking news: Goldman reported a rise in fourth-quarter profit to $2.54 billion, or $6.04 a share, from a year ago, easily beating analysts’ expectations. That, along with strong earnings from Bank of America, helped push major indexes higher and suggested that investors had underestimated the health of the economy.John Bogle, a longtime advocate for investors’ rights, founded Vanguard in 1974 and helped build it into a giant asset manager that today handles $4.9 trillion, making it second in size only to BlackRock. He had esophageal cancer, his assistant told the NYT.Mr. Bogle stepped down as chief executive of Vanguard in 1996 and as its chairman at the end of 1999. Last year, his net worth was estimated at $80 million — far less than many of his peers.His constant push to cut the costs of investing put him “squarely into an American tradition of iconoclastic discounters like Henry Ford of Ford Motor, Sam Walton of Walmart and Michael Dell of Dell Inc. — men who built giant companies by selling directly to the consumer at rock-bottom prices,” the WSJ said.Warren Buffett, himself an investing legend, told CNBC that Mr. Bogle “did more for American investors as a whole than any individual I’ve known,” adding:Late last year, in an interview with Barron’s, Mr. Bogle noted “clouds on the horizon” in 2019 in the form of massive sovereign and corporate debt, “great upheaval” in global trade and “the mystery of Brexit.”“A little extra caution should be the watchword,” he said.Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote to President Trump suggesting he cancel or postpone his State of the Union address, scheduled for Jan. 29 before a joint session of Congress and a prime time television audience, or that he deliver it in writing instead. She cited security concerns created by the partial government shutdown, the longest in history, which entered its 27th day today.The president has said he won’t compromise with Democrats, telling aides that his determination to build a border wall will be remembered long after the shutdown is forgotten. In moments of frustration, however, he has privately complained about “getting crushed,” write Maggie Haberman and Annie Karni of the NYT.Some other shutdown fallout:• Many of the jobs affected are the best available in their communities, coming with pensions, union membership, vacation days and guaranteed pay increases. Average pay since 2000 has grown twice as fast for federal workers as for private sector employees.• Several hundred thousand government employees are being asked to work without pay, including 2,500 at the Department of Agriculture who are being called back today, Friday and Tuesday. They have little choice but to comply, because of legal challenges, anti-strike laws and their emotional investment in their work.• World Central Kitchen, founded by the celebrity chef Jose Andres, opened an emergency “Chef for Feds” pop-up in Washington that has served more than 2,000 meals. Nate Mook, the nonprofit group’s executive director, called the shutdown a “man-made disaster.”Prime Minister Theresa May narrowly survived a vote of no confidence on Wednesday, allowing her to keep her job and helping Britain avoid a general election as it struggles to prepare for its fast-approaching withdrawal from the European Union.The motion was brought by Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, minutes after Parliament roundly rejected Mrs. May’s Brexit withdrawal plan on Tuesday. He is expected to heavily influence Brexit planning in the following weeks.The gridlock feels almost American. Bucking a long British tradition of lawmakers falling in line with their leader, more than 100 of Mrs. May’s party members rebelled in choosing to vote against her Brexit proposal.Could Brexit invalidate business contracts? In one of the first legal cases to explore how the split will affect deals, an E.U. regulator that is relocating to Amsterdam is claiming that the 25-year lease for its site in London has been “frustrated” by Brexit.Contingency plans for a no-deal departure. Tesco, the largest British supermarket group, is renting refrigerated containers in case of supply disruptions.Federal prosecutors in Seattle are investigating accusations that the Chinese technology giant Huawei stole intellectual property from American companies.The case covers some of the same issues raised in a suit between Huawei, which makes telecommunications equipment and smartphones, and T-Mobile. A jury found against Huawei in that suit in 2017.A bipartisan group of U.S. legislators proposed bills this week to prohibit U.S. chips and other technology being sold to Huawei, ZTE and other Chinese companies said to violate U.S. sanctions or export control laws. Lawmakers have also said that solar panels from Huawei could be hacked, potentially disrupting the flow of electricity in the United States.A Chinese official described the legislation as “hysteria.”Recently, Huawei invited foreign journalists to tour the sprawling campus it’s setting up in Dongguan, which features towns modeled after Paris, Verona and other European cities — an architectural assertion of the company’s global ambitions. Its secretive research unit will occupy a replica castle.Microsoft is putting up half a billion dollars to build more affordable homes in the Seattle area, saying that the tech industry has a responsibility to help people in communities transformed by its growth. It promises housing for the company’s non-tech workers, as well as for teachers, firefighters and other middle- and low-income residents, writes Karen Weise.Less than a year ago, Amazon successfully pushed to block a new tax in Seattle that would have made large businesses fund homeless services and affordable housing.Microsoft has been at the vanguard of warning about the potential negative effects of technology, and executives hope other companies will follow its lead on housing.Diego De Giorgi, Bank of America’s head of global investment banking, is said to be stepping down, four months after the departure of his boss, Christian Meissner, the head of corporate and investment banking.

534,"Good Tuesday morning. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.)Silicon Valley is captivated by a new concept that could eliminate student debt, Andrew writes in his column.Students were saddled with $1.5 trillion in debt last year, a record high. An idea called Income Share Agreements has been talked about for years as a way to alleviate that burden. Under this system, tuition is free, but students agree to pay back a percentage of their income for several years if they get good jobs after graduation.Lambda School, an online learning start-up founded in 2017 with the backing of Y Combinator, has $30 million in funding today from venture capitalists to make the concept a reality.Andrew writes:The Lambda model is being closely watched. It’s meant to treat students as investments rather than cash cows — and potentially lift their crippling debt load.But it also comes with risks.Programs seeking safe investments might reverse the strides made in expanding educational opportunities for higher-risk students; and institutions might move away from degrees that lead to noble, but lower compensated, professions.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Senior Chinese officials offered to bail out the troubled Malaysian government fund known as 1MDB in exchange for deals, a WSJ investigation found. Documents and interviews with current and former Malaysian officials show some of the political forces at work behind China’s One Belt, One Road infrastructure initiative and the country’s efforts to strengthen its position overseas.Five takeaways from the investigation:• In secret meetings, Chinese officials told Malaysian officials that China would try to fend off investigations by the U.S. and other countries into multibillion-dollar fraud accusations at the fund.• The Chinese also offered to bug the homes and offices of WSJ reporters in Hong Kong.• Malaysian officials suggested that some of the infrastructure projects be financed at above-market rates to generate cash for other needs.• In return, Malaysia offered lucrative stakes in railway and pipeline projects.• The infrastructure deals made Malaysia the second-biggest recipient of One Belt, One Road funding after Pakistan.SoftBank is increasing its stake in WeWork, a bet on continued growth in co-working. But the investment is smaller than the one originally considered.The news: SoftBank is planning to invest $2 billion in WeWork, the leading co-working company, the NYT’s David Gelles reports. The money comes from the conglomerate itself, not from its nearly $100 billion Vision Fund. It values WeWork at $47 billion, and brings SoftBank’s total investment in the company to about $10.5 billion.What could have been: Under one possibility, SoftBank would have spent $10 billion to buy out all of WeWork’s other investors and injected $6 billion more in the company. Several factors led to a smaller deal, including market volatility and the reluctance of investors to sell shares to SoftBank.The back story: SoftBank, one of WeWork’s biggest boosters, has made multiple investments in the company. Much of its capital in WeWork is from the Vision Fund, which is largely backed by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. But the relationship between SoftBank and WeWork is under growing scrutiny.Carlos Ghosn, in his first public appearance since being arrested in November, declared today that he was innocent of the allegations of financial wrongdoing that led to his ouster from the vast Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi automaking alliance.Handcuffed, with a rope around his waist and plastic slippers on his feet, Mr. Ghosn told a packed courtroom in Tokyo that he had “always acted with integrity.” He added:Mr. Ghosn, 64, a celebrity in Japan since pulling Nissan back from the brink nearly two decades ago, was arrested on Nov. 19 after arriving in Tokyo on a corporate jet. In jail, he has not spoken to his family, who believe he is the victim of a corporate coup, and he can be visited only by diplomats or his Japanese lawyer.He is accused of underreporting millions in compensation and improperly transferring personal losses to Nissan’s books.

And such work still takes a back seat to the standard single-employer job, according to more recent evidence, including a study from the Labor Department released last year.Why the disparity? Mr. Krueger and Mr. Katz say that:• After the recession, the labor market was on shaky ground. Workers needed odd jobs to stay afloat. But rather than shifting permanently to gig work, they returned to more stable, long-term roles once the economy recovered.• This gray layer of the work force, where people hold multiple jobs and move fluidly and frequently between them, is difficult to track.

535,"MCALLEN, Tex. — It was dark in the stash house where they kept her, the windows covered so no one could see inside. At first, the smugglers had her cook for the other migrants who had recently crossed illegally into the United States. Then they took her to a room upstairs, locked the door and began taking turns with her.It was the summer of 2014, and Melvin, a 36-year-old mother of three, had just completed the journey from her native Guatemala, crossing the Rio Grande on a raft before being led to the house in the Texas border city of McAllen.For weeks in that locked room, the men she had paid to get her safely to the United States drugged her with pills and cocaine, refusing to let her out even to bathe. “I think that since they put me in that room, they killed me,” she said. “They raped us so many times they didn’t see us as human beings anymore.”On America’s southern border, migrant women and girls are the victims of sexual assaults that most often go unreported, uninvestigated and unprosecuted. Even as women around the world are speaking out against sexual misconduct, migrant women on the border live in the shadows of the #MeToo movement.[Read: In a Border Courtroom, a Migrant Woman Confronts Her Biggest Fear]The stories are many, and yet all too similar. Undocumented women making their way into American border towns have been beaten for disobeying smugglers, impregnated by strangers, coerced into prostitution, shackled to beds and trees and — in at least a handful of cases — bound with duct tape, rope or handcuffs.The New York Times found dozens of documented cases through interviews with law enforcement officials, prosecutors, federal judges and immigrant advocates around the country, and a review of police reports and court records in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. The review showed more than 100 documented reports of sexual assault of undocumented women along the border in the past two decades, a number that most likely only skims the surface, law enforcement officials and advocates say.In addition, interviews with migrant women and those working with them along the border point to large numbers of cases that are either unreported or unexamined, suggesting that sexual violence has become an inescapable part of the collective migrant journey.[Read the Newsletter: Yes, There Was Duct Tape: The Harrowing Journeys of Migrants Across the Border. Sign up for Crossing the Border here]President Trump has used the threat faced by migrant women to make his case for a border wall. “One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico,” he said in January — an estimate that appears to have originated from some limited surveys, one of them by Doctors Without Borders, of women traveling through Mexico.But less understood is that the violence that befalls migrant women happens not just during the perilous journey through Mexico: Much of it happens after women reach the supposed safety of the United States.In July, a 23-year-old Honduran woman told the authorities that she was sexually assaulted in a bedroom closet by a smuggler who had helped her and her sister cross into the South Texas city of Mission. The following month, a sheriff’s deputy in San Antonio was charged with sexually assaulting the 4-year-old daughter of an undocumented Guatemalan woman and threatening to have her deported if she reported the abuse. In 2017, a guide leading a group of migrants through the Tohono O’odham Nation’s reservation in Arizona raped a woman from El Salvador twice during a seven-day desert hike, threatening to leave her stranded if she resisted. “I hope I leave you pregnant so you have one of my kids,” he said, the woman told the authorities.In 2016, a migrant woman fled a stash house in the South Texas city of Edinburg, where she said she had been raped by a smuggler who brandished a machete. In West Texas that same year, two teenage girls reported that they had been sexually assaulted by a Customs and Border Protection officer, who they said forced them to strip, fondled them, then tried to get them to stop crying by offering chocolates, potato chips and a blanket. In an unusual turn, the girls filed legal claims against the federal government, which settled the case in 2018 for $125,000.At least five of the women who were assaulted — in one case, bound with duct tape, raped and stabbed — were attacked not by migrant smugglers, who are often the perpetrators, but by on-duty Border Patrol agents and Customs officers.Experts say the actual number of sexual assaults is almost certainly much higher than those documented by prosecutors and the police, because most attacks are never reported. And such attacks don’t end at the border. Women have reported being assaulted in immigration detention facilities, and the federal government over a recent four-year period has received more than 4,500 complaints about the sexual abuse of immigrant children at government-funded detention facilities.The Times interviewed eight migrant women from Central America who were sexually assaulted between 2013 and 2016 — women still struggling with nightmares, depression and in some cases, thoughts of suicide. One reported that she was attacked in Mexico; six said they were assaulted in South Texas. One said she was attacked in both Mexico and South Texas. The oldest victims were in their early 40s when they were attacked; the two youngest were 14.Most of their attackers were never prosecuted or identified, and The Times was not able to independently verify the women’s accounts. But all eight women either gave sworn testimony or submitted statements under penalty of perjury to the federal government in order to qualify for visas, and cooperated with the police in the investigation of their cases.They described a netherworld of fear that coexists with the bustling life of American cities up and down the border. One woman told of being held prisoner in a house that had been turned into a makeshift brothel in McAllen, a city of 143,000 in the Rio Grande Valley. “Nueva carne” — new meat, the smugglers said as she and other migrant women were led into the house, said the woman, Lucy, 45, a migrant from Honduras who, like others interviewed, did not want her last name used.She said a series of men came into the house over the next several days and raped her. “Because I didn’t want to let them, they tied my feet together and my hands behind my back,” Lucy said.Gladys, 45, a mother of four from Guatemala, said she was kidnapped by armed smugglers after crossing the border and jumped out of a car to escape, but was captured again. For days, she was held prisoner at a stash house in McAllen and forced to have sex with six men. “I thought it would be better if I died when I fell from the car,” she said.Law enforcement officials on the border said they had made arrests in many of the cases brought to them and would pursue more if they could. But the majority of women who have been assaulted do not report it, often because their attackers threaten to expose their immigration status — or worse — if they do. One woman, raped repeatedly at gunpoint in a stash house in Phoenix in 2005, said her attacker threatened to sell her 3-year-old daughter if she reported him. Those who do go to the authorities may not know the names of their attackers, or even where the assault occurred. Smugglers make sure their clients are unsure of their whereabouts; if they are detained by Border Patrol, they won’t be able to pinpoint where they were held.[Read: Open Wounds, Head Injuries, Fever: Ailing Migrants Suffer at the Border]The women are powerless by almost any measure. Most of the eight interviewed now live in the United States after receiving the victim-related visas. They work in stores, restaurants and factories, most barely making a living. Their English is limited. Many of them have not even told their families what happened.“They don’t have many defenses,” said Jesus R. Romo Vejar, an Arizona lawyer who has represented many migrant women victimized by sexual assault. “Undocumented women and children are the most unprotected of human beings.”Here are some of their stories.Lucy, 45, was raped while being forced to work at makeshift brothels, first in Mexico and then in McAllen. When we got to the house, there were many women. It was a big house. I couldn’t see everybody’s face, but there were different women in different rooms for prostitution. I wanted to flee but I was afraid they were going to kill me. They just told us, “You guys don’t have money, so you have to pay with your body.”When we crossed the river, there was a man waiting, a white guy with tattoos. He was in a truck. We got into the truck. He brought us into a house in McAllen. When we got there, the guy started talking and he said that I was new meat.When they wanted to have sex with me they had to tie me up because I wasn’t cooperative. They tied my feet together and my hands behind my back and then they’d have sex with me from behind.Before, I could not talk about this. I would have panic, really serious panic. I didn’t want to leave the house. I didn’t want to talk to anybody. I thought that everyone in the world saw me as a prostitute. I come from a poor family but a very decent family.It has affected me, yes. But not anymore. I’m kind of enraged. Those guys have mothers and daughters. What they did to us is what they did to women.Melvin, 36, was raped and forced into prostitution in a locked room at a stash house in McAllen.I lost count of how long I was there for. It wasn’t me anymore. I think that since they put me in that room, they killed me. They have no mercy. They don’t care that you’re a mother, that you have family. They see someone who doesn’t matter to them.And I still remember while I was with them there, it was my birthday, and I didn’t want to, not that day. And I remember that he grabbed me and at one point bit me, and when I arrived at the detention center, I still had the bite marks. I told them that it was my birthday. And according to them, the rape that day was for my birthday.I tried to commit suicide three times. Because you can’t live with all of that. And every time I closed my eyes, the men would appear. You’d shower. You’d close your eyes. They were there. I didn’t want to live with that in my head anymore. But here I am.J.E., 19, and two other migrants were kidnapped in South Texas by a Border Patrol agent, Esteban Manzanares, when J.E. was 14. He raped her in his apartment in Mission, Tex., and later committed suicide.He took me and tied me up to a tree. He said he would come back. I was thinking about my little brother, who’s in Honduras, and I’d never see him again. He was about 10, I think. It was hours.He undid me from the tree and put me in the car. In the apartment, there were two beds on top of the other, children’s bunk beds, and ropes there, too. They were shoelaces. For my wrists and my feet.My mind was blank. I was trying to understand everything. I didn’t know what to do. My feet were tied up. I would look at him and he had a gun. And that frightened me. I asked him why, and he answered me that he was doing this to me because I was the prettiest one of the three.There are people who sort of discard you when they know what happened to you. But the majority of my girlfriends do know so they can understand what I went through, and they support me.V.E.M.L., 39, was raped in the South Texas brush by a smuggling guide. She was apprehended, detained at the Hutto detention center in Taylor, Tex., and later deported.I knew that they were the ones who were going to take me across, so I knew that I had to stay with them. I never learned his name. I felt nervous about him. He was very strange. I wasn’t sure if he was on drugs. He always stood up and sat down, and stood up and sat down.The older one walked ahead. The younger one said, “Come with me.”I said, “Where are we going?” And he said, “We’re going to catch up with them ahead.”He bit my mouth so I could not cry out. I was scared that it might occur to him to kill me.Afterwards, he told me to hurry up or he would leave me there on the ground. The guys in the group start saying, “Immigration! Immigration!” I ran toward Immigration. I wanted to get away. But then when they took me and put me in the car, I felt frustrated and alone. I just felt like I couldn’t stop crying. They were all men agents. They kept asking me why I was crying and I couldn’t explain.When they brought me to Laredo, I told a doctor what happened. He said, “Don’t feel like you’re the only one that this happened to. This has happened to many other women.”Cindy, 26, and her son Samuel stayed at a stash house in Mexico while waiting to cross the border. She and another woman were raped by a smuggler, and she learned after being apprehended by Border Patrol that she was pregnant. Samuel is now 8. His little brother, to whom Cindy gave the biblical name of Adonai, is 2.When he entered the room, he had the gun. He took the children out. He had the gun and he pointed the gun at my head when he was attacking us. First he abused me and then he abused her. We’re in his power and we feel like we’re disposable. We can’t do anything because it’s like they tell us, they can kill us and nobody will say anything.It wasn’t until that test that I knew I was pregnant. In that moment, it was like I had been marked. I had been marked because of what had happened to me, that violation.I wanted to kill myself. Going to the psychologist, that’s what helped me heal. She told me that we had to talk about it, we had to think about it, and we had to learn to live with our lives moving forward, even with what happened.My son, I realized he was an innocent bystander in this situation and that it wasn’t his fault. My motivation to keep going in life are my two kids. I thank God because everything that I suffered, they’re the happiness that came out of that."
536,"Good Thursday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.Evidence continues to mount that China’s economy is slowing faster than expected.The latest data point comes courtesy of Apple. A significant slowdown in iPhone sales in China forced the company to reduce revenue expectations for its most recent quarter. The company said yesterday that it expected revenue of about $84 billion in the quarter that ended Dec. 29, down from a previous estimate of $89 billion to $93 billion.It was the first time Apple had lowered its quarterly forecast in 16 years. The NYT’s Jack Nicas and Keith Bradsher write:Apple’s announcement is the latest warning from corporate America about the impact of the trade war, which may be harder to defend now that the collateral damage includes one of the country’s most recognizable brands. Companies like FedEx and Starbucks are already struggling in China. And other American businesses, especially tech players and Detroit automakers, could suffer as well.More: The optimistic narrative about Apple’s iPhone business is falling apart, writes Bloomberg Opinion’s Shira Ovide.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Apple’s announcement added to investors’ concerns about slowing global growth and reawakened the stock market’s bears. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures tumbled more than 1 percent overnight.Shares of Apple dropped more than 9 percent in after-hours trading, a loss that was reflected in a wider range of companies. Chip makers like Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia, Skyworks and Qorvo were among the hardest hit, down more than 3 percent. The electronics retailer Best Buy slipped 2 percent, and companies with big business in China such as Boeing and Caterpillar fell 2 percent.Markets across Asia fell today, as investors shed technology stocks. European markets opened lower as well.Apple wasn’t the only company to spook investors yesterday, as Tesla broke records in its fourth quarter but failed to impress the market.Good numbers, but not good enough: The automaker said it delivered 90,700 vehicles in the period, surpassing its earlier high. Of those, 63,150 were Model 3 sedans, a 13 percent improvement on the prior three-month span, but nonetheless below Wall Street’s expectations. The growth rate for the Model 3, Tesla’s first mass-market offering, fell short compared with the third quarter, when sales more than doubled amid a rush of initial orders.Demand concerns: Investors were especially perturbed by Tesla’s announcement that it was cutting prices of all models in the U.S. by $2,000 per car. The automaker said it was adjusting to a Jan. 1 reduction of a federal electric-vehicle tax credit for Tesla buyers to $3,750 from $7,500. But what the market saw was a warning that, after a surge of early interest in the Model 3, buyers may be waiting for a more affordable option, writes Bloomberg Opinion’s Liam Denning:Tesla shares ended trading nearly 7 percent lower.Thousands of low-wage workers in China are trawling the internet in search of forbidden content in a lucrative new industry: censorship factories.Playing it safe: For Chinese companies, staying on the safe side of government censors is a matter of life and death. Adding to the burden, the authorities demand that companies censor themselves, spurring them to hire thousands of people to police content. “It helps cleanse the online environment,” one worker said.Little tolerance: China has built the world’s most extensive and sophisticated online censorship system. It grew even stronger under President Xi Jinping, who wants the internet to play a greater role in strengthening the Communist Party’s hold on society. More content is considered sensitive. Punishments are getting more severe.Rising influence: China’s vision of a government-supervised internet reverberates in other countries. Even in Western Europe and the United States, traditional bastions of free expression, companies are examining their digital limits. Platforms like Facebook and YouTube have said that they would hire thousands more workers to better monitor their content.China may have missed the starting gun in the international space race, but said today that it was the first to land a lunar probe on the far side of the moon.The Chang’e-4 vehicle, named after the lunar goddess in Chinese mythology, landed in the moon’s oldest and deepest crater and sent back the first close-up images of a region that perpetually faces away from earth.The China National Space Administration, which hopes to put astronauts in a lunar base by the end of the next decade, called the feat “a new chapter in humanity’s exploration of the moon.” The mission could help advance understanding of the moon’s origins and evolution, and better position China to tap minerals and other resources discovered there.China landed a rover on the moon in 2013, decades after a Soviet Union spacecraft reached the surface in 1959 and the United States successfully sent its Apollo 11 team in 1969. China’s future plans in space involve sending astronauts to Mars and a probe to Jupiter, according to the WSJ.“The world got better last year, and it is going to get even better this year,” Greg Ip writes in the WSJ. Problems like illiteracy, poverty and violent deaths have been dropping worldwide, Ip writes, but the news has received little attention because the decline has been slow and steady.The gradual progress is coming about through basic rules of growth:This has lead to momentous change: Half the world is now middle class.Halliburton named Jeff Miller its chairman after David Lesar retired on Monday following a 25-year career with the company.

537,"As the luncheon dishes were placed down, the master of ceremonies kicked off a boisterous round of Lindsey Graham trivia. “What is the senator’s middle name?” she asked the ballroom of meatloaf-eating Republicans in Greenville, S.C. “What’s the name of the bar the senator’s family owned?”For those of you playing along at home, Lindsey Olin Graham grew up around his parents’ beer-and-pool joint, the Sanitary Cafe, in working-class Central, S.C., where he played the child mascot to the regulars. “I was conscious,” he wrote in his 2015 memoir, “that I was giving a performance.”When it came Graham’s time to speak, he started out in this long-ingrained lounge-act mode. “I’m from the federal government; I’m here to help,” he said — a Ronald Reagan joke that has been Graham’s preferred icebreaker for years. But after a few minutes of breezy repartee, his tone assumed an edge. “To every Republican, if you don’t stand behind this president, we’re not going to stand behind you,” he said. As the room fell silent, Graham’s voice grew soft, even grave. “This is the defining moment of his presidency,” he said. “It’s not just about a wall. It’s about him being treated different than any other president.”He continued: “This is a fight between the people who are so smart and the rest of us.” Heads bobbed over unfinished plates of function-room meat drowned in barbecue sauce. The continuing debate over the border wall, he went on, was not just over funding for a barrier, in the same way that the brawl over Brett Kavanaugh, whose Supreme Court appointment had been delayed over allegations of sexual assault, was not merely about a judge.Nothing of late has enhanced the senator’s standing as a Trump loyalist, or disgust with him among former Democratic collaborators, more than his showstopping speech at the September hearing where Christine Blasey Ford, a high school acquaintance of Kavanaugh’s, accused the future justice of sexually assaulting her at a party. “What you want to do is destroy this guy’s life,” Graham exploded at Senate Democrats, many of whom he had worked with closely for years. Senator Chris Coons, the Delaware Democrat, told me that his longtime colleague is “hysterically funny” and “personally engaging.” But the personal nature of Graham’s outburst at the hearing left him stunned. “It was unprecedented,” Coons said, adding that he and Graham did not speak for several weeks afterward. “I am still struggling to renew my working relationship with Senator Graham,” he added.In Greenville, Graham framed the Kavanaugh melee as a proxy battle over President Trump — and placed himself on the Trumpian side of an us-versus-them divide. The Democrats and the national news media, he said, are engaged in a singular mission to thwart the president. “Why? ’Cause they hate him,” Graham said of Trump. “They hate us,” he added, and repeated the call: “They hate us.”It can be jarring to watch Graham enact, in real time, the broader shift the Republican Party has undergone under Trump. The conversions tend to fall into a few basic categories. There are the elected Republicans who once had little use for Trump but would prefer to keep their heads down and hope that their Trump-loving constituents forget the terrible things they said about the future president during the 2016 campaign. There are the Republican leaders, like Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, and until recently Paul Ryan, the former speaker of the House, who might have little use for the president in private but can’t risk alienating him. And there are once-dubious Republicans who have not only come around to supporting Trump but who have also caked their about-faces in ostentatious heaps of flattery for “my president.”And then there is Graham, who would seem to occupy his own distinct category of Trump-era contortionist. Certainly he embodies elements of the other groups: a desire to carve out his own parallel universe of work on certain issues that have always been important to him, especially on foreign policy; an instinct to avoid the distraction of weighing in on every Trump offense (“Don’t chase every barking dog,” he says); and a personal library of readily surfaceable aggressions from the 2016 campaign, in which Graham called the future president a “kook,” “crazy” and “unfit for office,” among other things — and which are easily juxtaposed today with Graham’s sycophantic raves about the president’s stellar golf game and reminders that Trump “beat me like a dog” in the 2016 presidential primary (no doubt delighting Trump with his nod to the president’s canine-themed pejoratives).Graham’s rush to Trump’s side is particularly baffling because not long ago, he was best known for his bipartisan deal-making on issues like climate change and immigration. He subscribed, at least theoretically, to the country-over-party credo of his departed Senate co-conspirator John McCain. McCain’s diagnosis of brain cancer and eventual death coincided approximately with Graham’s emergence as Trump’s most prominent Senate defender and whisperer. This combination of factors gave rise to the “What happened to Lindsey Graham?” question, which has become synonymous enough with the South Carolinian’s national political identity that he felt compelled to own it on the stump.“What happened to me?” Graham asked in Greenville. “Not a damn thing.” The crowd gave him a standing ovation.What did happen to Lindsey Graham? I raised the question directly to him the following afternoon in his Senate office in Washington. Graham was collapsed behind a cluttered desk, sipping a Coke Zero and complaining of exhaustion.“Well, O.K., from my point of view, if you know anything about me, it’d be odd not to do this,” he said.I asked what “this” was. “ ‘This,’ ” Graham said, “is to try to be relevant.” Politics, he explained, was the art of what works and what brings desired outcomes. “I’ve got an opportunity up here working with the president to get some really good outcomes for the country,” he told me.An outcome of particular interest to Graham, at the moment, is getting re-elected to a fourth Senate term in South Carolina, where Trump owns commanding approval numbers, especially among the hard-core Republicans who in the past questioned Graham’s devotion to their conservative cause. Sure, Graham allowed, you might emphasize some things more than others when you’re trying to appeal to the party base. “You just showcase your issues, right?” he said. During his last re-election campaign, in 2014, Graham asserted his base bona fides by railing against President Barack Obama’s White House “scumbags” and warning that “the world is literally about to blow up.” He has always been conservative, he emphasized. “But in our business, you’re not defined by the 80 percent agreement. You’re defined by the 20 percent” that the base might object to. (His relatively liberal position on immigration once led Rush Limbaugh to dub him “Lindsey Grahamnesty.”)Graham reminded me that when McCain was facing re-election in 2010, he turned himself into “the most conservative member of the U.S. Senate.” That was the race in which McCain claimed that he never embraced the “maverick” label, and people were asking, “What happened to John McCain?” Graham chuckled at the memory.In acknowledging this, Graham was speaking to me as a fellow creature of Washington, fully versed in the election-year “showcasing” he is now engaged in — one of the “people who are so smart” that he derided the day before. “If you don’t want to get re-elected, you’re in the wrong business,” he said.Graham would shortly head over to the Capitol for Trump’s State of the Union address, about which the president called him a few hours earlier, seeking input. “Should I go conciliatory or to-hell-with-it?” Trump asked him, according to Graham. “What kind of tone should I take?” In recounting this latest exchange, Graham shook his head and half shrugged. “I have never been called this much by a president in my life,” he told me. His tone reflected a mixture of amazement and amusement, with perhaps a dash of awe. “It’s weird, and it’s flattering, and it creates some opportunity. It also creates some pressure.”Graham has always gravitated toward larger-than-life figures. He worshiped his father and followed him everywhere. “I came along late in my dad’s life, and he made the most of our time together,” Graham wrote in his memoir, “My Story.” “Whatever he did, he did it with me.”Graham’s parents died when he was in his early 20s, and he legally adopted his younger sister, Darline. He never married or had children of his own, which has forced him throughout his career to deflect the inevitable insinuations that arise about a 63-year-old bachelor in the United States Senate. Graham says he has dated numerous women over the years, but he usually lands on some variation of the married-to-my-job explanation for his lack of a partner. In the same way that he described the regulars of the Sanitary Cafe as members of his extended family growing up, Graham has relied on the Senate as a kind of surrogate brood in his adulthood.Graham’s Senate colleagues sometimes describe him as a kind of sitcom sidekick with a knack for finding himself in goofy situations. It struck many people who know him as particularly apt that Trump, as a presidential candidate in 2015, would decide to yell out Graham’s cellphone number at a campaign event after Graham called Trump a “jackass.” Kelly Ayotte, the former Republican senator from New Hampshire, recalls Graham’s tagging along around this time to see “Despicable Me” with her and her son, Jacob, who was 8. As they entered the theater, Graham handed his constantly buzzing phone over to Jacob for screening. “He said to the callers: ‘Who are you? Why are you calling him?’ ” Ayotte told me. Graham would later make a video dramatizing all the ways to destroy a cellphone. After their eventual détente, he told Trump that the entire episode was “the highlight of my campaign.”Nearly every Graham story of the last two decades involves McCain. When you enter the waiting area at NBC’s “Meet the Press,” there is a framed photo of McCain and Graham sitting together on the set, like a portrait of the extended family of the Washington green room. “They were inseparable,” Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine, told me. “John’s death really left a hole in his heart. It seemed like Lindsey had lost a father.”Graham, who served in the United States Air Force and the South Carolina Air National Guard, likens McCain less to a father figure than to an older brother, or perhaps commanding officer. “What I miss was the collaboration,” Graham said. “It was a political marriage.”I asked Graham if his “collaboration” with Trump, such as it was, was in any way akin to a political marriage. “Oh, gosh, no,” he said. “I personally like him. We play golf. He’s very nice to me.”Graham’s contempt for Trump in the 2016 campaign was such that he could not bring himself to support the Republican nominee. “I voted for Evan — whatever the guy’s name is,” Graham said, referring to the third-party candidate Evan McMullin, who wound up winning 0.54 percent of the popular vote. But after Trump became president, Graham said, forging a relationship with him served his conjoined interests of staying relevant in Washington and getting re-elected in South Carolina. Graham told me that McCain understood his willingness to make peace with Trump, though the extent of Graham’s ingratiation bothered him a bit — especially Graham’s over-the-top praise for Trump’s golfing abilities.But McCain, more than anyone, knew the value of reconciliation. Like Graham, he was a mostly reliable Republican vote in the Senate and supported Trump’s agenda on most issues besides repealing the Affordable Care Act. Aside from McCain, Graham said, “I never met anyone in my whole life that could hold a grudge and move on at the same time.” And McCain, he said, understood better than anyone that few things are more potent in politics than having access to a president, regardless of which one.“Relevance,” Graham said, returning to the word as if it were a mantra. “That was John McCain’s word.”The price of relevance, for Graham, has been a willingness to defend the president on television and speak out on issues that he knows might be of minor consequence in the scheme of things but clearly animate Trump. In recent weeks, for instance, Graham — in his capacity as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee — has demanded a briefing on such Fox News snack food as whether the F.B.I. acted with too heavy a hand in its arrest of the longtime Trump political adviser Roger Stone. Graham also vowed to investigate a claim made by Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director of the F.B.I., that top Department of Justice officials had discussed circumstances in which Trump could be removed from office via the 25th Amendment. “An administrative coup,” Graham said ominously on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”When I asked Graham whether he ever worried about being seen as a toady to Trump, his voice assumed a slightly clipped edge. “No, here’s what I worry about,” he told me. “That we’re going to get it wrong in Syria and Afghanistan. I worry more about the policy stuff. And I have more influence than I’ve ever had.”Graham credits his relationship with Trump with the president’s slowing down his decision to withdraw from Syria. He noted that Trump asked him whether the United States should use force in Venezuela. Graham said that he preached caution and that Trump became exasperated, or pretended to be. “He said to me, ‘You want to invade everywhere except where I want to invade,’ ” Graham said, laughing. And Trump, he insisted, knew where he stood on the special counsel’s Russia investigation. “I told the president that if you colluded with the Russians, if your campaign sat down and worked with foreign intelligence operatives to manipulate the results of the election, that’d be the end of us, ” Graham said.Graham says he has achieved graduating levels of relevance with Trump. “I went from, ‘O.K., he’s president’ to ‘How can I get to be in his orbit?’ ”— “orbit” is another favorite Graham word — “to ‘How can I have a say in what’s going to happen today, tomorrow and next week?’ ” he told me.I asked Graham if he considered himself part of the wider Trump orbit or the more select one. “Well, I’m getting into the smaller orbit now,” he said. I asked him who else was in that precinct of the Trump solar system. He mentioned Melania, Ivanka, Jared. “He’s got a bunch of old friends that still have a say, New York types,” Graham said. “But the circle is small.”Trump is an entertainer and an agitator, which Graham says he can relate to, in a way. “The point with Trump is, he’s in on the joke,” Graham said. I asked Graham if he is in on the joke, too. “Oh, 100 percent, 100 percent.” He laughed. “Oh, people have no idea.” I asked him to explain the joke to me. “If you could go to dinner with us. … ” he said, shaking his head.At the end of our second interview, in mid-February, I asked Graham if he trusted Trump. Graham’s eyes seemed to bulge for a split second. He sat back in his chair and paused. “That’s a good question,” he told me.He paused some more. “Do I trust him?” he said at last. “I trust the president to want to be successful,” he said. The president’s mercurialness, he acknowledged, could be a problem. “He will change his mind in a New York minute,” Graham said. “You never know where he’ll be. I mean, I woke up one day, and we’re pulling out of Syria.”But to this point, he and Trump have been able to work together. “He’s asked me to do some things, and I’ve asked him to do some things in return,” Graham said. Then, as if looking wistfully over his shoulder at his old maverick-sidekick days, he offered, “There’s sort of a Don Quixote aspect to this.” It was an odd thing for a man who was espousing the median Republican-circa-2019 position to say.“At the intersection of all this theater is that he wants to be a successful president,” Graham said of Trump, “and I want him to be successful under terms that I think are good for the country.” Understood, but unspoken, was that these terms would also be good for Lindsey Graham."

Desfilan por la calle con sus carritos de golf. Se aventuran a ir a México para comprar medicamentos más baratos, hacerse pedicuras o tratamientos dentales de bajo costo y beber margaritas en copas enormes.Se les conoce como Winter Texans (texanos invernales) y se concentran principalmente en el valle del río Grande, la región templada al sur de Texas que también es la zona por donde pasan la mayor cantidad de migrantes desde Centroamérica (el presidente Donald Trump ha declarado una emergencia nacional en la frontera y ha apostado a soldados del Ejército para ayudar a controlar la creciente afluencia ). Uno de sus campamentos base estaba a menos de un kilómetro del centro vacacional Victoria Palms en Donna, adonde llegan muchas personas mayores para ocupar cinco canchas de pickleball, un juego que es una mezcla de bádminton, tenis y ping pong.La invasión anual de los residentes del Medio Oeste —y unos cuantos canadienses— ha disminuido en años recientes, pero siguen representando una importante fuerza económica y cultural. Unos 106.000 visitantes invernales gastaron alrededor de 528 millones de dólares en el valle durante la temporada de invierno de 2017-18, según una encuesta realizada por la Universidad de Texas Valle del Río Grande. Los restaurantes tex-mex montan pancartas para recibirlos. Hay periódicos para texanos invernales, parques para remolques con restricciones de edad mínima, exposiciones, cruceros, producciones teatrales y calcomanías de parachoques. Una camioneta en la ciudad fronteriza de McAllen tenía dos: “Texano invernal de Iowa” y “Estoy jubilado. Rebásame”.“Me permite escapar de los bancos de nieve”, dijo Dean Miller, de 58 años, residente de Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, quien durante el invierno vive y trabaja en el centro vacacional Winter Ranch en Álamo, Texas. “Vas a un evento aquí y te encuentras a tu vecino de allá”.La mayoría de los texanos invernales son de raza blanca y tienen 70 años o más. Muchos de ellos votaron por Trump en 2016, y su mera presencia contradice la afirmación que hizo el presidente acerca de que la frontera está en crisis. Vienen a la región desde hace años —en algunos casos, siguiendo la tradición de sus padres— y la dinámica política y la retórica de la emergencia nacional no afecta cómo viven su jubilación, ni dónde lo hacen.“Nosotros no vemos lo que ustedes ven en la televisión”, dijo Terry Goss, director general de Victoria Palms, una de las comunidades más grandes de texanos invernales, con hasta 2500 jubilados.¿Qué es exactamente lo que les atrae a los texanos invernales?Conocer la vida fronteriza que no se parece en nada a lo que la mayoría de los estadounidenses imagina que es. Un viernes se celebró el cuarto evento benéfico de baile sock hop  en el centro Ranchero Village en Weslaco. Hubo almuerzos de pescado y recorridos en bote por el río, baile de cuadrillas y sesiones de karaoke, conciertos improvisados de bluegrass acústico y servicios religiosos ecuménicos.Un lunes por la tarde, en el centro vacacional Winter Ranch en Álamo, la compañía teatral de Winter Ranch agotó las entradas en su presentación de tres obras de un solo acto: The Ethel and Albert Comedies. En Victoria Palms, Goss habló de pie junto a un cartel que mostraba todos los espectáculos agotados en el salón de baile del centro; uno de ellos era el concierto de una banda tributo a The Rolling Stones. Victoria Palms es tan popular con los canadienses que casi todos los veranos se programa una reunión de los huéspedes de Victoria Palms cerca de Toronto.Margaret Hitzemann, de 63 años, habitante de Onamia, Minnesota, pasó los últimos dos meses en una casa en Port Aransas, cerca de Corpus Christi. Una tarde lluviosa, ella y su esposo cruzaron la frontera a pie hacia la ciudad turística de Nuevo Progreso, Tamaulipas. Compraron chapulines crujientes y fueron a una farmacia para comprar medicamentos baratos.“No tomamos muchas medicinas, así que pensamos: ‘Ah, vayamos allá y compremos un poco de Tylenol y Advil, y cosas así, por menos dinero”, dijo Hitzemann. “Pensé: ‘Cielos, esto vale lo mismo en Walmart’. Así que al final no compramos ningún medicamento”.En una región con una gran población latina y una actitud tolerante hacia la inmigración —muchas personas tienen familiares en ambos lados de la frontera— el choque cultural con los habitantes del norte es inevitable. El estudio publicado por la Universidad de Texas Valle del Río Grande incluyó mensajes sin editar enviados a funcionarios locales de parte de texanos invernales. Algunos de los comentarios más mordaces decían: “Sean más estadounidenses, menos mexicanos. ¡No estamos en México!” y “Hagan que el canal 5 respete a Trump” y “Poden el césped, recojan la basura y hablen inglés”.Ya ha comenzado el éxodo de regreso al norte. El final de la temporada llegó para muchos el jueves 21 de marzo, con el Día del Turista, una fecha anual de aprecio a los texanos invernales en Nuevo Progreso.Para algunos, la temporada nunca termina. Existen los texanos conversos, antiguos texanos invernales que se asentaron en el valle de por vida. Kristi Collier es originaria de McAllen y dirige una empresa hotelera y mediática que presta servicios a texanos invernales llamada Welcome Home, Rio Grande Valley. Ella organiza una fiesta anual de toma de juramento a los texanos conversos en abril.Entre los conversos se encuentran Ken y Lois Lane, originarios de Anchorage, Alaska, quienes empezaron a pasar sus inviernos en Victoria Palms en 2005. Ahora viven ahí permanentemente en una casa móvil.“Creo que el costo de vida aquí es muy razonable en comparación con muchos otros lugares”, opinó Ken, de 73 años, técnico electricista retirado que trabajaba para una compañía eléctrica.Él y su esposa visitaron Nuevo Progreso y recibieron a su hijo y a su familia cuando vinieron a pasar las vacaciones de primavera desde Iowa. La pareja encaja en una categoría única: son una suerte de texanos invernales a la inversa.“Conservamos la casa rodante y en el verano, cuando hace mucho calor, vamos al norte”, explicó Ken.—Manny forma parte del equipo de periodistas del Times que actualmente se encuentran en la frontera. Cada semana, ellos compartirán parte de su reporteo sobre la frontera y las personas que pasan tiempo en ambos lados de ella.¿Tienes preguntas sobre cómo es la vida en la frontera o sugerencias sobre este boletín? Escríbenos: crossingtheborder@nytimes.com—Mike McMahon, productor lechero en el norte del estado de Nueva York.Las granjas en el norte de Nueva York están a miles de kilómetros de la frontera sur, pero están muy cerca de Canadá, por lo que la Patrulla Fronteriza tiene jurisdicción en esa zona. La dependencia que tienen los agricultores de los trabajadores indocumentados ha convertido a la región en un punto focal del debate sobre las políticas fronterizas del gobierno de Trump, lo cual ha exacerbado las tensiones entre los políticos estatales de ambos partidos y los agentes federales que ejecutan las medidas severas del mandatario en contra de la inmigración ilegal.Esta semana, Christina Goldbaum, reportera sobre inmigración en la sección Metro de The New York Times, exploró en un artículo la historia de McMahon y la de los migrantes que trabajan en granjas como la de él. Lee más al respecto aquí.Esta semana, la KPBS, una estación de radio pública del sur de California, lanzó un nuevo podcast, “Only Here”, acerca de la vida y la cultura en San Diego y Tijuana. Buscan mostrar “el arte, la comida, las tradiciones y la cultura que existen debido a la frontera”. El primer episodio presenta la historia de un joven fotógrafo gay e indocumentado, y puedes escucharlo junto con otros episodios aquí.Los creadores del podcast, al igual que todos nosotros, se han sentido atraídos por las historias y las conversaciones relacionadas con la frontera. Si prefieres conocer estas historias en formato de audio, aquí te presentamos algunos programas que te pueden interesar:• “The Green Line”, producido por el sindicato de agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza. Los anfitriones, Art Del Cueto y Brandon Judd, son agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza que apoyan las políticas del presidente Trump, y ambos aparecieron a su lado en la sala de prensa de la Casa Blanca en enero cuando habló sobre una declaratoria de emergencia nacional para ayudar a la construcción de un muro fronterizo (el Times ya ha escrito artículos sobre ellos).• La primavera pasada, Radiolab de WNYC transmitió “Border Project”, una serie en tres entregas acerca de una política de la Patrulla Fronteriza que muy probablemente provocó un aumento, desde finales de los años noventa, en la cantidad de migrantes que morían al cruzar a Estados Unidos. También comparte las historias de algunos de los migrantes que emprendieron el trayecto a pesar de ello. Escucha todos los episodios aquí.• El episodio “The Border Wall”, de Radio Diaries de la PRX, se enfoca en las zonas recónditas de la frontera a las que una mujer se refiere como “tierra de nadie”, separadas de su país por una barrera que no siempre cumple con su propósito.• Nuestro propio podcast “The Daily” tiene muchos episodios [en inglés] acerca de la frontera. Empieza con la serie en dos entregas, “Dispatches From the Border” (la primera parte aquí y la segunda aquí), que sigue a Azam Ahmed, jefe de corresponsales del Times para México, Centroamérica y el Caribe, y otros periodistas en un viaje a lo largo de los casi 3200 kilómetros de la frontera con México.También está el episodio “The Scars of Family Separation”, acerca de un padre migrante que cruzó la frontera con su hija. Finalmente, el verano pasado se transmitió “How Separating Migrant Families Became U.S. Policy”, una entrevista con Stephen Miller, un asesor político de alto rango que ha ayudado al presidente Trump a estructurar su política de inmigración.• SE BUSCAN: Traductores de lenguas indígenas centroamericanas. Los tribunales estadounidenses encargados de resolver asuntos migratorios tienen un retraso de 800.000 casos y el aumento en la llegada de migrantes procedentes de Centroamérica ha empujado la situación al límite, según las declaraciones de abogados, activistas e intérpretes en este reportaje.Estados Unidos provee traductores en 350 lenguas de todo el mundo; sin embargo, no se da abasto en quiché, ixil o zapoteco, lenguas indígenas que están entre los veinticinco idiomas más recurrentes en las cortes migratorias. “Hay poblaciones enteras que se presentan con idiomas que no hemos visto antes en Estados Unidos”, dijo Odilia Romero, una intérprete de zapoteco y activista.• El linchamiento de latinos y la recuperación de sus historias. A principios del siglo XX, los mexicanos y otros habitantes de ascendencia hispana fueron linchados y masacrados en el sureste estadounidense por “delitos” como rehusarse a tocar el violín o gritar “¡Viva [Porfirio] Díaz!”. Ahora los descendientes de esas personas quieren que haya un recordatorio constante de las atrocidades desconocidas por muchos, así como de sus víctimas.• La novela “Lost Children Archive” ha sido una de las más esperadas en Estados Unidos. En parte porque se desarolla con la crisis migratoria de fondo. El libro explora la realidad de niños que cruzan la frontera, enfrentan la muerte, son detenidos y deportados sin la compañía de sus padres o de algún adulto que los cuide. La novela sigue el viaje en carretera de una pareja y sus hijos desde Nueva York hasta la frontera con México. Aquí puedes leer la reseña del libro en inglés y aquí una conversación con la escritora Valeria Luiselli en español.Gracias por leernos.

539,"On a Sunday morning at Beth Israel Worship Center in Wayne, N.J., a bearded pastor named Jonathan Cahn stood on an elevated platform, gazing over a full house. Stage lights shifted from blue to white as the backing band played a drifting melody. Two men hoisted curled rams’ horns and let out long blasts.“Some of you have been saying you want to live in biblical times,” Mr. Cahn said, pacing behind a lectern. Then he spread his hands wide. “Well, you are.”Sitting at the end of a sleepy drive an hour from Manhattan, Beth Israel may look like any common suburban church. But the center has a highly unusual draw. Every weekend, some 1,000 congregants gather for the idiosyncratic teachings of the church’s celebrity pastor, an entrepreneurial doomsday prophet who claims that President Trump’s rise to power was foretold in the Bible.Mr. Cahn is tapping into a belief more popular than may appear.A recent Fox News poll found one in four Americans believe “God wanted Donald Trump to become president.” Celebrities like the televangelist Paula White and Franklin Graham have boosted the idea. The president’s own press secretary suggested as much in a January interview. And on the opening day of the Conservative Political Action Conference this month, the millionaire businessman Michael Lindell took to the stage and declared President Trump “chosen by God.”Mr. Cahn was ahead of the curve.He has dedicated an entire book to this very thesis, an insight he claims to have received from God. “The Paradigm: The Ancient Blueprint That Holds the Mystery of Our Times,” in fact, is only the most recent installment of a best-selling series dealing with the supposed mystical meaning behind all manner of current events. In it, Mr. Cahn likens Mr. Trump to the biblical king Jehu, who led the ancient nation of Israel away from idolatry.With his growing stature, Mr. Cahn is also a rising figure in some quarters of conservative politics. In an email to congregants, Mr. Cahn shared his latest good news: This weekend he is making his first trip to the president’s vacation retreat, Mar-a-Lago. He is set to address a small gathering of activists and advisers.After worship on a recent Sunday, in a roped-off section flanked by security guards, Mr. Cahn signed piles of his books before a small crowd. At 59, Mr. Cahn cultivates a refined demeanor, rarely appearing without a signature all-black suit and tie. He laid his hands gently on one man’s shoulders and offered quiet counsel. “Be patient,” he said. “Keep praying for breakthrough.”Gail Greenholtz, an elder member, stood near the end of the line. “Many of us consider him a prophet of our time,” she said. “A visionary.”Michael Cooney, 58, had driven an hour to hear the pastor teach on politics and prophecy. “It’s all relevant for this moment,” he said. “He shows us that Trump was actually in the Bible.”Central to Beth Israel’s story is the unlikely rise of its pastor, a liberal Jew transformed into an end-times evangelist. The tale is also a step into a controversial and burgeoning layer of American religion, where commerce, supernatural belief and patriotism blend freely. Daniel Silliman, a Valparaiso University professor of religion, called Beth Israel and its pastor part of a long tradition of Americans “looking to prophecy as a way to absorb the chaos” of current events. “It can make someone feel that God is working through human history,” he said, “transforming anxiety into a sense of fullness.”The son of a Holocaust refugee, Mr. Cahn was raised in a nominally Jewish family in the New York suburbs. But from an early age, he was drawn to the more esoteric corners of belief.He devoured the writings of Nostradamus, the Virginia psychic Edgar Cayce and far-out conspiracy theories about ancient astronauts. Mr. Cahn soon stumbled on “The Late Great Planet Earth,” the 1970s best-seller that argued doomsday prophecies of the Bible were playing out with events like the Cold War and Israel’s Six-Day War. Mr. Cahn bought the book thinking it was about UFOs; instead he was given a crash-course in Christian eschatology.“I was just floored,” Mr. Cahn said. On his 20th birthday, after a near-death experience — and to the dismay of his Jewish father — he became a Christian.By the 1980s, Mr. Cahn was leading outreach for a hippy-style church in New Jersey. His hair and beard grown shaggy, he led services with a guitar slung around his neck. Mr. Cahn later broke off to lead an independent congregation, Beth Israel, and built his following through a slot on Christian radio, where his messages took on an end-times flavor.After the 2001 terrorist attacks struck Manhattan, Mr. Cahn adopted a sharp, even more apocalyptic focus.In sermons, he began comparing the attacks to the ancient warnings of the Bible, drawing largely from the book of Isaiah, where God vows to punish the disobedient nation of Israel.Mr. Cahn said abortion, gay rights and the perceived retreat of religion in the public square were all troubling signs that America, like ancient Israel, had lost its way.Once rolling with this comparison, Mr. Cahn began seeing patterns everywhere. As the Israelites turned away from their God, they were attacked by Assyrians; America, in modern times, was also attacked by a foreign army from the East, Al Qaeda terrorists. After the ancient siege, the Israelites vowed to replant a destroyed sycamore grove with new trees; near ground zero, a huge sycamore tree was also destroyed, as the towers fell.The supposed connections go on. Tenuous as they may seem, Mr. Cahn saw the links as compelling. His flock did too. “God revealed patterns,” he said. “I called it the download process.”Mr. Cahn eventually turned his thesis into a full-length book, “The Harbinger,” in 2012, put out by the publishing arm of the powerhouse Charisma Media, a Christian multimedia company that also runs a daily news site. The book climbed up best-seller lists and hovered there for months, alongside blockbusters like “Fifty Shades of Grey.” He followed his debut with a companion edition and three other titles, all embellishing on the same theme of prophecies replaying today.“None of us knew it would be so successful,” Mr. Cahn said. “It was the Lord’s hand, I believe that.”A charismatic preacher inveighing against imminent devastation is nothing new. America has long been fertile ground for would-be doomsday prophets, stretching back centuries.Matthew Sutton, a professor of history at Washington State University and the author of “American Apocalypse,” said Mr. Cahn fits a unique American mold. “In key historical moments, religious figures like this find a way to step in,” Mr. Sutton said. “They draw from apocalyptic theology and say, ‘We have this secret knowledge and can explain what’s going on.’ It fosters this sense that God’s judgment is hanging over your head.”Among several of Mr. Cahn’s recent predecessors of this ilk would be televangelists like the Christians United for Israel founder John Hagee, whose books include “Can America Survive?” and Jim Bakker, the controversy-prone preacher who now hosts an end-times TV program and sells disaster survival products.Mr. Cahn brings the tradition fully into the social-media age: many of his fans first saw him on Facebook; hundreds of posts and reposts of his sermons are uploaded on YouTube, slipped into the corners of the web where esoteric religion and conspiracy theories overlap.Into this mix came Mr. Cahn’s latest book, “The Paradigm,” which could be his most polarizing, tying his prophetic work to the election of Donald Trump.The book, published in the months after Trump’s win, again likens America to the ancient nation of Israel — two peoples, Mr. Cahn says, who have a unique relationship with God. He then argues that all sorts of figures in contemporary politics have biblical counterparts. Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, for example, are the modern-day analogues to wicked Ahab and Jezebel. Trump is the warrior-king Jehu, who took control of the nation and cast idols out of the capital. “Jehu also sought to drain the swamp,” Mr. Cahn said. Trump, “like his ancient predecessor,” Mr. Cahn writes in his book, was a “flawed vessel” being used by God. “The unlikely and controversial warrior was destined to become the new ruler of the land,” Mr. Cahn goes on. “The template would ordain that Donald Trump would become the next president.”Pointing to Trump’s possible rollback of abortion rights, appointment of conservative Supreme Court judges and the move of the American Embassy to Jerusalem, Mr. Cahn casts Trump as a heroic figure. “Trump is offering us a window for revival, a window to return to God,” Mr. Cahn said. “What happened in the election was not about Trump but about something much higher, the purposes of God.”Mr. Cahn promotes his work aggressively in Christian media, appearing regularly on “The Jim Bakker Show,” “Sid Roth’s It’s Supernatural!” and “The 700 Club,” where he draws upon his Jewish background, using the title of rabbi or wrapping himself in a prayer shawl emblazoned with the Beth Israel logo.He also has political aspirations. Mr. Cahn speaks at events in Washington alongside conservative standard-bearers like Michele Bachmann and James Dobson, where his portrayal of America as a cultural battleground falls on sympathetic ears. In 2016, he even addressed a United Nations gathering. Mike Huckabee, the Fox News commentator and former governor of Arkansas, once introduced Mr. Cahn as “soul-stirring and stunning, spellbinding.”Mr. Cahn likes to say he is surprised by his own success, preferring supernatural explanations. When speaking, he begins slowly but picks up pace, almost falling over his words with excitement. He also has a flair for the theatrical tale. Lounging in a back office at the church, surrounded by framed paintings of biblical landscapes, he sprinkled enchanted anecdotes in conversation.How did he raise money for his first church? “A mysterious American Indian appeared with a check for $150,000. They called him Wahoo. God instructed him to come to me.”How were his books received? “With the first book, a hurricane flooded our building. For the release day of the new one, my appendix exploded. People called it spiritual warfare.”He even presents his family life in magical terms. He has three children and describes his relationship to his Brazilian wife, Renata, as a “supernatural love story.” As Mr. Cahn’s star was rising, Beth Israel also mushroomed in size. The congregation more than tripled over the years and outgrew its humble perch in Bergen County.In 2008, Beth Israel moved to a cavernous old department store a half-hour away and remodeled the building to resemble the white-stoned city of ancient Jerusalem, recasting the drab industrial structure as a mystical suburban barracks. In the parking lot, massive Israeli and American flags billow in the breeze.Beth Israel draws from the Charismatic movement, which has roots in Pentecostalism, and also incorporates elements of Messianic Judaism. Congregants alternate between calling Mr. Cahn their pastor or rabbi, and their place of worship a church or synagogue.Services are also held on Friday evenings, at the start of the Jewish Sabbath, and Mr. Cahn arrives to the building just moments before worship begins. By the time he bursts on stage with a headset microphone, the crowd is fully primed. A dance troupe of women, dressed in red and waving scarfs, prance nearby as the crowd sways in song.During a recent evening service, some 500 congregants gathered as helpers lit traditional Shabbat candles near the foot of the stage. Mr. Cahn dropped Hebrew into his sermon, and at times, the crowd haltingly joined in to pronounce the foreign words themselves. In a middle row, one elderly woman pulled out a worn Bible with stickered pages, the margins filled with notes from previous lectures.“There are prophecies around us,” Mr. Cahn intoned from the pulpit. “We’re in deep and we’re going deeper. Open your mind, brace yourself.”Perhaps not surprisingly, as the church’s growth may have been swift, controversies around the pastor and his flock have also swelled.Progressive groups, like the website Right Wing Watch, have been tracking Mr. Cahn’s rise for years. Others have raised questions about whether his messages about Trump veer from protected religious expression to political endorsement. Churches are unable to participate in political campaigns on behalf of, or in opposition to, candidates; if they do so, they risk losing their tax-exempt status.Mr. Cahn shrugs at the charge. “I don’t tell anyone how to vote,” he said. “I say, ‘You need to consult God, and this is what God says on the issues.’”After a beat, he added, “They can read between the lines.”Others object to his claims to divine insight. In particular, Mr. Cahn has attracted the attention of a network of Christian critics who see him as part of a growing stream of over-the-top supernaturalism in the church.Tensions came to a climax in 2015, when Mr. Cahn suggested in a book and during several TV appearances that an imminent cataclysm was on the horizon.Leaning on arcane readings of the early books of the Bible, Mr. Cahn said that just as God visited judgments on the wayward Israelites according to a particular seven-year pattern — something called “the shemitah” — modern catastrophes might follow a similar pattern. In 2001 came terrorist attacks, in 2008 there was an economic crash. Mr. Cahn asked: could 2015 bring another disaster?But months passed, and the doomsday date came and went. He was dismissed as a grifter.One critic likened Mr. Cahn’s prophecy project to a “fragile house of cards,” set to tumble down. A Christian polemics site called Pulpit & Pen denounced Mr. Cahn in several posts. J.D. Hall, the site’s founder, called Mr. Cahn “the most prominent and successful omen huckster” working today. “Pastors should warn people away from Cahn,” Mr. Hall said recently. Mr. Cahn actually grows embarrassed discussing the doomsday fiasco. He insists he has always included disclaimers on his work and never set exact dates. Rather, Mr. Cahn wanted to warn that a cataclysm could happen, not that it would. “I always say: You can’t put God in a box.”Still, he appears to have learned from the brouhaha, growing even more cautious about making prognostications that could fall through.His latest book, for example, was released only after Trump had taken the White House and is largely backward-looking, giving biblical explanations to current events only after the fact.He also declined to weigh in on Trump’s 2020 chances. “The Bible doesn’t say one or two terms,” Mr. Cahn demurred.Meanwhile, Mr. Cahn’s success has come at a private cost he seldom discusses. Though not estranged, his Jewish family never fully knew what to make of his dramatic pastoral turn. They rarely, if ever, visit the church, and he remains troubled by the idea they will not be spiritually saved. “I don’t know where their hearts are at now,” he said. “It’s not something we talk about.”At times, Mr. Cahn appears to be a star in a show that has grown out of his control. Fans may take his project more seriously than he does himself. His debut book was originally billed as a work of fiction, for example, a nuance lost on most readers.“At first, people started to call me a prophet, and I would stop them and say, ‘No, no,’” he said. “But it always made for an awkward moment.”Instead, he stopped correcting them. It was just easier. “So, sometimes, I don’t say anything,” Mr. Cahn said. “I let it be.”Still, his book series marches on. The latest installment, titled “The Oracle,” is due in September. Like the others, it concerns biblical prophecies, with Trump again making an appearance.On a Friday evening this winter, deep into the government shutdown over the border wall, Beth Israel was packed, even though a snowstorm had been forecast. One man plucked a plaintive tune on a guitar as Mr. Cahn wound up the service, inviting the crowd to bow their heads. He guided the them in a soothing prayer.“Close your eyes,” he said. “If you haven’t been born again, today is your day.”There were murmurs through the room. Mr. Cahn concluded and then gently reminded the crowd about the booths in the back. Congregants could buy shawls, jewelry and apocalypse-themed calendars. Books were for sale, he said. New members could even get a gift copy, signed free of charge.After worship, congregants gathered near the canteen, where steam rose from platters of rice, beans and soup.Several worshipers described how they once attended other, more mainline churches before discovering Beth Israel. Some still have a home church elsewhere but come here for a supplemental dose of mysticism. Bob Keene, a 68-year-old school-bus driver, described the appeal. “Learning about prophecy puts me at ease,” he said. “The problems I’m having, the things I’m going through, those are also part of God’s plan.”Roxanne Mangal, a middle-aged woman in a flowery blouse, joined the table. She said the pastor had healed her of a terrible illness. Joining Beth Israel also brought wealth. “My income tripled,” she said. “It quadrupled.”Now she wanted to show Mr. Keene a more recent miracle she’d seen, captured on a cellphone photo, no less. After President Trump had moved the United States Embassy to Jerusalem — the subject of great excitement at the church — she believed she saw the New York skyline light up in heavenly sparks. “God did that,” she said, thrusting the phone forward.“Hmm,” Mr. Keene said, looking at the photo politely. “I thought it was a sunset at first.”"
540,"Late-night television comedy used to be exactly that: comedy. Sure, it was topical. Obviously, it dabbled in politics. But it wasn’t a running commentary — a gaping, keening, raging one — on the nation’s political life. It wasn’t a main crucible for Americans’ political angst. The election of Donald Trump changed that. The president gave Americans more angst to work out.He also gave hosts like Seth Meyers material and a challenge: How do you make fun of often grave events without making light of them? “Late Night With Seth Meyers,” which recently celebrated its fifth anniversary, does this distinctively and brilliantly, by folding barbed one-liners into more shapely structures, including “A Closer Look,” which is essentially a spoken essay, about 10 minutes long, that hews tightly to a discrete theme — one from mid-December mulled the tandem hooey of Trump’s philanthropy and his proposed border wall — and that Meyers does every few days. Each weeknight’s broadcast takes a similarly cerebral approach that extends to his selection of guests, which often includes writers and politicians.Meyers, 45, has a long history with Trump, who hosted “Saturday Night Live” for the first of two times in 2004 (the other was in 2015), back when the comic was in his third season as a writer and cast member on the show. Meyers was also the featured performer at the 2011 White House Correspondents’ Association dinner where he and President Barack Obama separately roasted Trump, who was in the audience. Some political observers have suggested that Trump’s presidential ambitions were fueled by his anger after that evening, when he sat stone-faced as Meyers made jokes like, “Donald Trump has been saying that he will run for president as a Republican, which is surprising, since I just assumed he was running as a joke.”Meyers lives in Manhattan, where “Late Night” is taped, with his wife, Alexi, a lawyer, and their two sons, Ashe and Axel, who are both under 3 years old. We spoke in early January at his studio at 30 Rockefeller Plaza and in a phone call a few weeks later. Frank Bruni: A colleague of mine at The Times who has spent more time with Trump than I have was just saying that when you’re in his presence, there is a charisma that helps explain how this all happened. Do you agree?Seth Meyers: Yes. It’s interesting, because when he hosted “S.N.L.” [in 2004], I didn’t find him to be particularly charismatic. Now, that was not him at his best — hosting a comedy show. My takeaway was that he was not unfriendly but he wasn’t particularly friendly either. His reaction to most of the comedy was that he liked it if it worked. It didn’t strike me that he had a taste for it.FB: So the audience is the arbiter of everything. That’s consistent with the Trump who went on to run for president.SM: We did this sketch called “Donald Trump’s House of Wings,” as in chicken wings. I’m as proud of it as almost anything that I was a part of. There was a line of sketches that had been on the show about bad restaurants: There was [the baseball player] Derek Jeter’s Taco Hole, [the Rev.] Al Sharpton’s Casa de Sushi. In Donald Trump’s House of Wings, it was him in a yellow suit with a yellow tie talking about having a chicken-wing restaurant, and the song was “Jump (for My Love)” by the Pointer Sisters (1983), but it was to “Trump.” And there was me and Amy Poehler, Kenan Thompson and Maya Rudolph dressed as chicks in eggs.We danced next to him. And there’s actually a moment when it’s crushing with the audience and he’s surprised, because he hadn’t liked the sketch the whole week. He does a thing that he does now all the time during rallies where he has no poker face, he just takes it in: Oh! Look at that! A hit! And then he starts to dance and enjoy it. He’s very good in the sketch.FB: That is such a perfect harbinger and illustration of his outsourcing of his judgment to whatever gets him applause. Like, “I’m going to build a wall and Mexico will pay for it.”SM: The difference is that he didn’t actually have to open the House of Wings. The other thing I remember is that he had cut out a page of Variety, just the column of the ratings, and he carried it around in his breast pocket and would show you how well “The Apprentice” had done.Looking back at that week, I want to make clear: It was fascinating to be around what was at the time this New York icon. I remember him saying, “Where are you from?” “Do you like working here?” “Have you seen the ratings of ‘The Apprentice’?” It was almost as though: I’ll ask two personal questions and then, having done that part of humanity, I’ll drop this interesting tidbit.FB: I have to ask: Do we have you to blame for Trump’s presidential campaign?SM: I blame Obama. (Laughs.) I think Obama was too rough on him [at the correspondents’ dinner]. What are you going to do: Run for president to show me up? Seems like a waste of time. I saw Trump a couple of days after that [roast] and went over to thank him for being a good sport. It was at the Met Ball, I think. He told me that my jokes were too rough, but I think that he thought it was pretty cool that he had been on the president’s radar enough that Obama poked fun at him.FB: I think your show and others like it play a distinct and important psychological role in the nation’s processing of this presidency.SM: I have personally found it cathartic to do this show. I hope it provides some catharsis for the audience as well. There is a sense now, certainly more than when we started the show in 2014, that we are all going through something together. At the end of the day, I don’t think that we are agents of change at “Late Night,” but I do hope we’re making this moment more pleasant to go through.FB: Aren’t there some Americans in this Balkanized information environment who get as much news from your show as from any other source?SM: I don’t know. I’m aware of the possibility. And if that’s the case, we try very hard to be fair. Although I do want to qualify that when I mean fair, I don’t mean one joke about them, one joke about them. We try not to say things that are untrue. If somebody should make what I believe is probably not the safest choice to get their news from us, we don’t want to lead them astray.FB: Do you see what you do as a form of journalism?SM: No. If you watch “A Closer Look,” we use so many clips of actual journalists to make our point. Most journalists don’t just show clips of other journalists. They actually go out and do journalism.FB: On a recent episode, you said, “The president is incompetent and unhinged. He’s virtually incapable of uttering a truthful or coherent thought about almost anything.” Nuanced! Do you believe every word of that?SM: Yeah. I remember doing an interview with someone who said, “You called him a liar. That’s a big word.” It’s actually not a big word to call somebody a liar. The definition is really simple. When somebody tells a bunch of lies, that’s the perfect word for it. Maybe you can say, “Wow, your definition of unhinged is pretty severe.” But I’ve got to be honest: I don’t think that was a crazy thing to say. He has shown us something about us that will be hard to forget.FB: What has he shown us?SM: That we will allow this to happen. Enough of us will say, “This is O.K.”FB: What have we deemed O.K.?SM: Vulgarity. Crassness. Mendacity. Just the litany of lies that you would have thought would be disqualifying for anybody else.FB: Is he racist?SM: I think he is racist. I think he could be friends with a black person, but he doesn’t think well of black people.FB: Is he amoral?SM: Oh, he’s amoral. That’s the easiest.FB: Are there things in the news that you feel you can’t joke about?SM: It’s case by case. We don’t have some overarching idea. But I will say that when you’re doing a show the day after Charlottesville or the day after a school shooting, those were cases where we spoke of it earnestly. There are other times — like the day after the [2016] election — when you’re honest about where you’re at but also trying to have jokes in there.FB: Your opening monologue right after the election was heartfelt and personal. You mentioned being a father; you noted that some parents out there would see their daughter become the first female president. How did those remarks come together?SM: There were just a few times on the show when I was lucky to be able to sit and talk off the top of my head, not off a script.FB: That was impromptu? So it could feel and be more direct?SM: I wrote it out, but it wasn’t on cue cards, the way a monologue usually is.FB: I also noticed that while you didn’t mask your being upset about the outcome, you extended a hand to, and spoke kindly of, Trump voters.SM: I never pretended that I wasn’t shocked by the outcome. But at that moment, I really did want to give the benefit of the doubt to everyone. There are people in other parts of the country that are not Manhattan who have a different set of fears than I would have.FB: What other subject matter, besides shootings, feels worth approaching with special care?SM: When you do stuff about the opioid crisis, it’s a lot harder to get comic traction. But I think we’ve managed. Those segments have been less of a laugh riot, but we’re lucky that we have an audience that’s willing to forgive the lack of jokes if they realize that the topic is serious.FB: What kind of joke about the opioid crisis does work?SM: When you can frame it in the absurdity of the fact that there was a town in West Virginia that filled enough prescriptions for painkillers to treat the entire Eastern Seaboard, you can make a joke off that. You can separate that from the real-world impact. This is something that’s absurd. It’s absurd that we allowed that to happen.FB: So absurdity is humor’s saving grace?SM: Yeah.FB: What do you worry most about in terms of the lasting damage of Trump’s presidency?SM: When I think of my kids, I worry the most — it feels clichéd to say — about climate change. I also want to stress that no matter who was president right now, I think that would still be a very scary thing. I don’t want to put that on Trump’s doorstep. Also, I want to live in a world where you can be kind to people and they can be kind to you if you have different political views. I do charity events every now and then, and there will be people who come up to me and say they voted for Trump. And we will have a nice conversation. I hope that’s not unique to me.FB: I have relatives who voted for Trump.SM: Can you still be kind to them and can they be kind to you?FB: I love them, and they help me not to see this in really reductive ways. So when people say, “Everybody who voted for Donald Trump is a racist,” I know that not to be true. Everyone who voted for Donald Trump perhaps averted their gaze from racism, and we can make moral judgments about that.SM: I agree with that 100 percent.FB: Do you ever worry, whether it’s your show or The Times, that because we’re seen as creatures of the coast, our criticisms and focus on Trump actually embolden his supporters?SM: I think he does a great job of framing himself as a victim, but I also think he would have done that no matter what. I don’t know how we don’t make fun of him based on the standards we had for making fun of people before he came to office. You can’t reframe the standards of what is deserving of mockery based on this three-dimensional chess game of Is this actually helping him? Because ultimately you want these standards — of what is mocked — to survive him.Certainly there are people on the right who will say that comics were easy on Obama. But I don’t think it’s a one-for-one because it’s not like Obama ever behaved like this. Also, I think Trump’s supporters are pretty emboldened to begin with. I don’t think they need any extra help to feel like he’s under siege.FB: How do you do justice to what is, frankly, the horror of Trump’s presidency without tearing at the fabric of the country so violently that it doesn’t repair?SM: We try very hard not to make fun of people who voted for Donald Trump. In the first months or so, I remember, we would have jokes like, “So I’m guessing if you’re a coal miner from Virginia, you must be thrilled.” We realized that it felt a little gross. We’re trying hard not to say that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is the same as Donald Trump.FB: Has the consumption of media and culture in this country become so fractured, in the way we set up our social-media feeds and such, that the idea of a changed mind is an anachronism at this point?SM: That worries me a ton. I try to follow conservative news sources as well, because I want to hear what they’re saying. I don’t know that my mind is changed.FB: I do feel like a healthy measure of humility is gained, though. Have you had many conservative writers on the show?SM: We’ve had people like Shepard Smith from Fox News, [the author of “Hillbilly Elegy” (2016)] J.D. Vance and [the Nebraska senator] Ben Sasse.FB: What is your own consumption of culture like?SM: I try to read the fiction of all the authors on the show.FB: Is there a risk with fiction writers in holding the audience’s attention?SM: We really have found not.FB: Did you decide from the start to include authors?SM: We thought that would be fun early on. I remember saying, “We’re going to have politicians and authors.” And in the end, authors have turned out to be so much better than politicians — so much better.Authors are genuinely great storytellers. There is still something a little magical to an audience about people who can write a book. Most people, the longest thing they ever wrote was a paper in high school, and they had to mess with the margins just to get it to 10 pages. And I just think that people like to hear authors talk. Whereas what I’ve found with politicians — and this is bipartisan — they’re just gonna answer the question they wish you’d asked and they’re going to say it the way they practiced it, and oftentimes it’s something they’ve said a bunch. So there’s the lack of the crackle you want during an interview.FB: At the photo shoot for this article, you told me you had just finished — under duress from your wife, initially — binge-watching all the seasons of HBO’s “Sex and the City.”SM: I underestimated it. My wife used to watch it when it aired last decade, and I’d often catch the last two minutes, and it’s very unfair to judge a show based on the narrative wrap-up, the voice-over of Carrie Bradshaw explaining the episode. But it’s wonderful: really great, three-dimensional characters that I felt very deeply about the longer the show went on. I thought it was just fascinating to see a show where the characters aged as they went through different parts of their lives.I also loved “Girls.” I should say my wife is part of four friends, very close. There were parts of “Girls” that really reminded me of them, and parts of “Sex and the City.”FB: So you know what question I then have to ask. Which character in each is your wife?SM: Well, my wife, I would say, is a Carrie-Miranda hybrid.FB: And if we’re using the “Girls” characters?SM: She’s Allison Williams — was it Marnie?FB: You realize you may not be paying her a compliment to call her Marnie?SM: She knows. We’re friends with Allison, and I’ve watched them talk about how many things that Marnie did were true to her.FB: What has most surprised you about fatherhood?SM: I had really high hopes for it — it’s matched them. I was so close to my father as a child, and I hoped it to be true for me and my boys, and it has been so far. I’m uncommonly close with my parents. They were and continue to be as close friends as I have.Here’s the thing. This was always my dream — beyond my dream — to be where I am now. I wanted to have a job in comedy. I wanted to have a job writing. And my favorite show as a kid was “Saturday Night Live.” I’m so much farther beyond what I had ever hoped for myself professionally, and yet, when I leave for work in the morning, my son gives me a running hug. So I walk out the door and even though I have this whole wonderful day ahead of me, I know for a fact that I’ve already had the best part of my day. And that, I guess, is kind of surprising.This interview has been edited and condensed."
541,"Early on the afternoon of Dec. 11, about an hour after an Oval Office meeting between President Trump, the Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and the incoming House speaker Nancy Pelosi devolved on live TV into a shouting match — a “tinkle contest with a skunk,” in Pelosi’s postgame grandiloquence — I pulled up to a McMansion in a gated community outside Las Vegas. I presented my ID and pre-issued bar-code pass to a security guard. Another guard emerged from a sedan in the driveway, instructed me to leave my rental car across the street and pointed me to the front door.“I put this out here because I knew you were coming,” Harry Reid, the former Senate leader, said, pointing to a large gold menorah on his desk. It was not clear whether Reid had someone buy the menorah especially for my visit or just keeps one lying around in case some reporter of (nominal) Jewish identity happens to drop by around Hanukkah. (Reid’s wife, Landra, was raised in a Jewish household in Los Angeles before she and Reid converted to Mormonism together, after they married.) Either way, Reid seemed both amused and pleased with himself, as if he could see that I was not quite sure how to receive this odd-duck gesture. During his time in office, he always got a kick out of embracing the awkward panders of political life, even if — especially if — they mocked the refinements of smoother politicians than him.Reid, who is 79, does not have long to live. I hate to be so abrupt about this, but Reid probably would not mind. In May, he went in for a colonoscopy, the results of which caused concern among his doctors. This led to an M.R.I. that turned up a lesion on Reid’s pancreas: cancer. Reid’s subdued and slightly cold manner, and aggressive anticharisma, have always made him an admirably blunt assessor of situations, including, now, his own: “As soon as you discover you have something on your pancreas, you’re dead.”I had planned to visit Reid, who had not granted an interview since his cancer diagnosis, in November, but he put me off, saying he felt too weak. People close to him were saying that he had months left, if not weeks. Valedictories were planned, and lifetime awards were bestowed. Efforts were underway to rename the Las Vegas airport in his honor, preferably before his own time of departure. Reid refuses to believe that this honor will ever happen. “When I practiced law, I did a lot of personal-injury work, and I never spent one penny until that check was cashed,” he explained to me.When I went to see him in December, he was confined to a desk near the front door of the house, unable to move without the aid of a walker that rested behind him. Still, he looked better than I thought he would. The last time I saw Reid, during the 2016 presidential campaign, he was wearing dark glasses and was still bruised from a freakish exercise-session mishap in early 2015, when an elastic band apparently snapped and propelled him into some cabinets, breaking ribs and bones in his face and blinding him in his right eye. The visible damage from this incident had abated at last. Wearing a tan sweater over a dress shirt, he looked about how he did a decade ago: roughly his current age, in other words.Reid’s health, even before the cancer diagnosis, was a factor in opting not to seek re-election for a sixth Senate term in 2016. Over the last few months, he has had chemotherapy and two back surgeries and has suffered a range of other ordeals, some related to the accident, for which Trump delighted in mocking him. “I think he should go back and start working out again with his rubber workout pieces,” Trump said in an interview with The Washington Post in September 2016.In fairness, Reid had dismissed Trump as a “spoiled brat,” a “con man” and a “human leech.” As Senate majority leader, Reid was essential to passing President Barack Obama’s legislative agenda, but his dead-eyed realism and morose tones always hung in contrast to the hope-and-change intoxications of those years. His den is adorned with a bright painted portrait of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. — one of his heroes, whose view that “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice” was often echoed by Obama. But Reid himself always seemed more predisposed to believing that the arc of the universe bent toward an ornery brawl.Reid once called the Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan a “political hack,” Justice Clarence Thomas “an embarrassment” and President George W. Bush a “loser” (for which he later apologized) and a “liar” (for which he did not). In 2016, he dismissed Trump as “a big fat guy” who “didn’t win many fights.” Reid himself was more than ready to fight, and fight dirty: “I was always willing to do things that others were not willing to do,” he told me.During the 2012 presidential campaign, he claimed, with no proof, that Mitt Romney had not paid any taxes over the past decade. Romney released tax returns showing that he did. After the election, Reid told CNN by way of self-justification, “Romney didn’t win, did he?” Reid took rightful criticism over this. Still, in retrospect, there’s something almost quaint about the outrage over the episode; Trump routinely surpasses Reid’s unscrupulousness with a few tweets before breakfast.Leaving Washington on the eve of Trump’s takeover, Reid insisted that he was happy to be escaping. Maybe, he allowed, it would have been different if Hillary Clinton had won. But “with this, no,” he told New York magazine at the time. “I’m not going to miss it.”And yet, two years later, it was easy to sense him pining for not just the political action but also the particular political action of Trump’s Washington. “No one would enjoy the fight with Trump like Harry Reid would,” said Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat who lost her re-election race in November. The president “is an inherently weak man,” she said. “Harry would smell the weakness and say, ‘Damn the consequences.’ ”In some ways, Washington, under Trump, has devolved into the feral state that Reid, in his misanthropic heart, always knew it could become under the right conditions. Politicians are always claiming to be eternal optimists; Reid is no optimist. “I figure, if you’re pessimistic, you’re never disappointed,” he told me.Reid has decided to live out his last years in Henderson, a fast-growing and transient Las Vegas suburb. His house is in the upscale Anthem neighborhood: a fortified village of beige dwellings of various sizes and otherwise indistinguishable appearances. There is a Witness Protection Program vibe to the place, accentuated by the security detail.Reid attended high school in Henderson, hitchhiking 45 miles each way from his hometown, Searchlight: a drive-through smudge of a town between Las Vegas and Needles, Calif., which, in his youth, boasted at least a half-dozen brothels and not a single church. His acidic outlook was informed by his childhood, during which he endured extreme poverty and dysfunction and substance abuse in his family. He took up boxing in high school and put himself through George Washington University Law School by working as a Capitol Police officer. Back in Nevada, he was schooled in the piranha bowl of Las Vegas politics. This education included a stint as Nevada’s gaming chairman in the 1970s, which placed him in the cross hairs of the Las Vegas mob. (Some of the plot of the film “Casino” was based loosely on Reid’s experiences.) There were numerous threats to his life and at least one actual attempt (a bomb discovered under the hood of his family car).The former F.B.I. director James Comey, after he was fired by Trump, compared Trump to the head of a mafia family, with its codes of silence and loyalty, its fear-based leadership style and fealty to a single godfather. “It’s not about anything else except the boss,” Comey said in a recent interview at the 92nd Street Y in New York. Others have drawn the same parallel, and I asked Reid if, given his unusually relevant professional experience in this area, it rang true. Reid expelled a quick and dismissive chuckle. “Organized crime is a business,” he told me, “and they are really good with what they do. But they are better off when things are predictable. In my opinion, they do not do well with chaos. And that’s what we have going with Trump.”Still, Reid added: “Trump is an interesting person. He is not immoral but is amoral. Amoral is when you shoot someone in the head, it doesn’t make a difference. No conscience.” There was a hint of grudging respect in Reid’s tone, which he seemed to catch and correct. “I think he is without question the worst president we’ve ever had,” he said. “We’ve had some bad ones, and there’s not even a close second to him.” He added: “He’ll lie. He’ll cheat. You can’t reason with him.” Once more, a hint of wonder crept into his voice, as if he was describing a rogue beast on the loose in a jungle that Reid knows well.The Trump era and Reid’s illness have occasioned an inevitable reconsideration of Reid’s legacy and all its contradictions. The Affordable Care Act, which Reid managed to navigate past the oppositional tactics of his persistent nemesis, the Republican Senate leader (and now majority leader), Mitch McConnell, has so far withstood McConnell and Trump’s efforts to dismantle the legislation. Reid was also prescient in urging the Obama administration and congressional Republicans to go public about the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election; the letter that Republican leaders agreed to co-sign weeks after they were briefed on the investigation did not identify Russia by name. “They did nothing — or nothing that I’m aware of,” Reid said.But McConnell’s and Trump’s own most substantial accomplishment to date, the appointment to the federal bench of an unprecedented number of conservative judges, including two Supreme Court justices who might well end up hearing a challenge to the Affordable Care Act, was made vastly easier by Reid’s decision, in 2013, to get rid of the filibuster for judicial appointments. Reid remains unrepentant about this. “They can say what they want,” he told me. “We had over 100 judges that we couldn’t get approved, so I had no choice. Either Obama’s presidency would be a joke or Obama’s presidency would be one of fruition.”Still, a certain nostalgia for the Senate leader has set in among Democrats, even those who had their disagreements with him. McCaskill was critical of Reid during their tenure together and did not back him for caucus leader in 2014. There are two major components of a Senate leader’s job, she said. “One is to make the trains run on time and getting things done that his caucus believes in,” McCaskill told me. “But the trains need to be bright and shiny while they’re running,” she added, referring to the communication and messaging part of the job that she said Reid was less well suited to.McCaskill told Reid at the time that she did not plan to vote for him and explained her reasons to him. He replied that she was the only one of his nonsupporters who had the nerve to tell him directly. “Oh, no, why would I?” Reid told me when I asked him if he felt betrayed. “And I won, didn’t I?”Reid’s successor is Chuck Schumer, his former caucus deputy who engineered much of the Senate Democrats’ communications and campaign strategy during Reid’s tenure. They had been close during Reid’s 12 years as Democratic leader, Reid serving as the arid desert yin to Schumer’s bombastic Brooklyn yang. When we spoke, Reid told me he did not wish to be seen as second-guessing Schumer. “My personal feeling should have nothing to do with it,” he said. But clearly Reid has more than a few of those personal feelings. He has told confidants that he felt Schumer was too eager to assume his job before Reid was ready to leave. Reid has also criticized, privately, Schumer’s instinct for accommodation with both McConnell and Trump.In our conversation, Reid seemed incapable of not constantly reminding me that he did not wish to talk about Schumer, as if this itself was something he wanted me to emphasize. “I do not call Schumer,” he told me. Then: “I call him once in a while — not weekly. Let’s say monthly I may call him.” This sounded straightforward enough until he added: “I talk to Nancy often. I love Nancy Pelosi. We did so many good things, and we still talk about that.” And just the day before, he said, he called Richard Durbin, the Illinois Democrat who, along with Schumer, was Reid’s top lieutenant in the Senate and is now Schumer’s Democratic whip. “We came to the House together in 1982,” Reid said of Durbin. “We had wonderful conversations.” (Schumer declined to be interviewed; his spokesman said in a statement that Schumer and Reid “have different styles but they complemented each other well. They are still good friends and talk regularly.”)In fairness, there’s little that any Democratic leader can do at a time when the opposing party controls the presidency and both houses of Congress, as Republicans did until this month. Durbin told me that he has sat with Schumer and Trump together at the White House. “They are discussing things at a New York level that most of us on the outside don’t understand,” Durbin said. “With Chuck, it’s his grandfather who had some business with Trump’s father or some darned thing. It’s a totally different ballgame.”I asked Durbin whether this approach had yielded any results. “The obvious answer,” he conceded, “is it hasn’t worked very well so far.”David Krone, Reid’s former chief of staff, is of the view that leaving Washington saved Reid’s life. “He wouldn’t be alive today if he had pancreatic cancer and he was still the Senate leader,” he told me. “He would not have made it.” Still, Krone said, “I think he misses it, definitely.”When he was in Washington, Reid used to spend an inordinate amount of time on the Senate floor. “I was always afraid that I would miss something,” Reid used to say and told me again in Nevada. In retirement, he said, “For me to sit here and say I don’t follow politics — you wouldn’t believe me, O.K.?”On the Friday afternoon before Christmas, just hours before the government shut down over Trump’s demands for more funding for a border wall, I called Reid to see how closely he was following this latest brinkmanship. “Landra and I have been watching the news; we have it on now,” Reid told me. The shutdown, he allowed, was “interesting.” Reid takes an anthropological interest in the changes that Trump has wrought on his old institution. “You can’t legislate when you have a chief executive who’s weird, for lack of a better description,” he told me. He said he could never understand how his former Senate colleague Jeff Sessions allowed himself to be so abused and humiliated by the president. “Why in the hell didn’t Sessions leave?” he said. “Same with Kelly,” referring to the departing chief of staff, John Kelly. “I’d say, ‘Go screw yourself.’ I could not look my children in the eye.”I asked him if he could identify at all with Trump’s dark worldview. “I disagree that Trump is a pessimist,” Reid said, as if to allow him that mantle would be paying him an undeserved compliment. “I think he’s a person who is oblivious to the real world.”One of Reid’s assets as a leader, when he was in office, was his willingness to feed the egos of his colleagues before his own; he was happy to yield credit, attention and TV appearances. Yet when I visited Reid in Nevada, I detected a whiff of, if not neediness per se, maybe a need to remind me that he has not been forgotten. He told me that he received a lovely call that morning from Barbara Boxer, the former Democratic senator from California. He gets calls from his former colleagues all the time, he said, and they tell Reid he is missed. He had a final conversation with John McCain over the summer, just before McCain died, punctuated with “I love you”s.Reading Reid can be difficult. Is he playing a game or working an angle or even laughing at a private joke he just told himself? When speaking of his final goodbye with McCain, he broke into a strange little grin, his lips pressed upward as if he could have been stifling either amusement or tears. It occurred to me that Reid, typically as self-aware as he is unsentimental, could have been engaged in a gentle playacting of how two old Senate combatants of a fast-vanishing era are supposed to say goodbye to each other for posterity.Reid seemed to recognize my puzzlement and shrugged. “As has been written since I left,” he told me, “I was kind of a strange guy.”"
542,"SAN FRANCISCO — Kamala Harris was three months into her tenure as San Francisco district attorney in 2004 when a gang member killed a police officer with a hail of bullets from an AK-47. Her announcement within three days of the murder that she would not seek the death penalty set off protests from her fellow Democrats as well as from the police.Senator Dianne Feinstein stood in front of thousands of mourners at the officer’s funeral at St. Mary’s Cathedral and urged her to change her mind; Jerry Brown, the once and future governor, was among those standing in ovation. The state attorney general threatened to take over the case, and Senator Barbara Boxer asked the Justice Department to prosecute it.Ms. Harris, the first person of color elected as this city’s district attorney, declared her decision a matter of principle: The death penalty, she believed, discriminated against poor and black people and would not deter more killing.But death penalty opponents wondered a decade later where that principle had gone when as California’s attorney general Ms. Harris appealed a judge’s decision declaring the state’s death penalty law unconstitutional. She said it was a matter of upholding the law; her critics asked whether she would have similarly defended segregation and statutes against interracial marriage.Now Ms. Harris is running for president as a “progressive prosecutor.” She says she sees no contradiction in the term, arguing that a tough prosecutor can also be a force for reforming the criminal-justice system. But already, mere weeks into her candidacy, she is facing a chorus of skepticism, especially from the left. The death penalty episode shows the tricky crosscurrents that she has had to weather — and that are likely to intensify as she tries to square that circle.In a dozen years as the top law enforcement official of the city and then the state, Ms. Harris was as much politician as prosecutor, appearing to try to be all things to all constituencies. More practical than ideological, she was defined most by resisting easy definition.She impressed Californians with her commanding presence — offering a preview of the senator the country would see pointedly questioning Republican nominees during confirmation hearings. But she developed a reputation for caution, protecting the status quo and shrinking from decisions on contentious issues.Years before ending mass incarceration became a bipartisan cause, she started programs to steer low-level drug offenders away from prison and into school and jobs. At the same time, she touted her success in increasing conviction rates, and as attorney general remained largely on the sidelines as California scrambled to meet a federal court order to reduce its swollen prison populations. She also repeatedly sided with prosecutors accused of misconduct, challenging judges who ruled against them.And while she summoned righteous anger toward the bank fraud that helped set off the Great Recession, holding out for more money for California homeowners in the National Mortgage Settlement, she said little when the governor diverted some of it to fill holes in his budget.“She played it very careful,” said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who served on an independent panel that investigated one of the cases of prosecutorial misconduct while Ms. Harris was attorney general. “She had her sights set on what her future might be, and she realized every day she was navigating a minefield, because she had law enforcement to deal with, she had the public to deal with, the minority community to deal with. I think she was trying to be very careful not to alienate.”She has also had to navigate the shifting politics of crime and race — and the expectations they bring with them.Ms. Harris began her career at a time when many African-American law enforcement officials were joining, even amplifying, law-and-order calls for stricter prosecution, to stop the drugs and violence victimizing their communities. When she became attorney general in 2011, crime was falling and the debate was evolving. Now, in the era of Black Lives Matter, many in the black community argue that the biggest law-enforcement problem is law enforcement itself, and her record is being assessed against calls for a wholesale reimagination of the criminal justice system — who should go to prison and for how long; indeed, should any but the most heinous criminals go to prison at all?At the other end of the political spectrum, President Trump has sought to frame the immigration debate around fear of rising crime, teeing it up as a campaign issue for 2020. In the waning days of the partial government shutdown over his demand for a border wall, he tweeted what he called a new Republican theme for the next two years: “BUILD A WALL & CRIME WILL FALL!”Ms. Harris scorns what she calls false choices, and says her critics are imposing them on her record. Those who have worked for her call her disciplined, a characterization she prefers to “cautious.” She describes her thinking — about criminal justice, but also about the other issues animating her presidential candidacy, like health care and economic inequality — as scientific. “It’s a hypothesis; this is how we can do things better,” she said in a recent interview. “You have to inform it with: Where’s the empirical evidence? Where is the data? Where is the detail?”She does not like to be boxed in.“The thing that drives Kamala Harris crazy above all other things is to get reduced to a demographic archetype,” said Sean Clegg, a longtime strategist for Ms. Harris and other California Democrats. “‘You are XYZ because you are a black woman; you are XYZ because you’re from San Francisco.’ She’s a complex person like all of us. She’s also been the first. That’s a lot more difficult than it looks.”Ms. Harris, now 54, confounded expectations just by becoming a prosecutor.She is the daughter of immigrants — her mother from India, her father from Jamaica — who met as civil-rights activists in graduate school at Berkeley and gave Ms. Harris what she calls a stroller’s-eye view of the demonstrations of the 1960s.Most of her law school peers went into civil-rights work, recalled Jeff Adachi, who was a tutor in Ms. Harris’s program at the University of California’s Hastings College of the Law and later faced off against her as San Francisco’s elected public defender.“You didn’t have a lot of minorities who were wanting to be part of law enforcement,” he said.She had to explain to family and friends before taking her first job out of law school, as a prosecutor in Oakland in 1990. As she described it in the recent interview, “When we want to reform systems, it shouldn’t and it can’t only be from the outside on bended knee or trying to break down the door.”She added, “Let’s try and do it from the inside and understand that those people are going to stand in a courtroom and ask for guilty verdicts for people who do harm to the community — and that’s consistent with all progressive values.”She earned a reputation as a sharp trial lawyer, and in 1998 became the managing attorney in charge of the career criminal unit in the San Francisco district attorney’s office. But she left within two years, frustrated by what she saw as the dysfunction of that office, which had the state’s lowest conviction rate and lacked basics like email and enough phones.She worked for the city attorney, and she prepared to run against her former boss, Terence Hallinan, in 2003.Ms. Harris had made political and social connections, dating Willie Brown, the powerful speaker of the California House, and serving on the board of the city’s Museum of Modern Art. But her polls showed she was a relative unknown.Mr. Hallinan, a former defense lawyer and a son of a Progressive Party presidential candidate, had infuriated the police department by winning indictments of top brass in a scandal involving the assistant chief’s son. Ms. Harris campaigned between Mr. Hallinan and a more law-and-order candidate, on a platform that ran the gamut: professionalizing the office and improving relations with the police, opposing the death penalty and creating programs to steer first-time nonviolent offenders away from crime.She brought a rare perspective — elected district attorneys are more typically white men; a 2015 study by the Women Donors Network found that just 1 percent are women of color. Communities of color, she argued, wanted tougher treatment for the drug dealers victimizing them; what they didn’t want from the police was excessive force.Almost immediately, her decision on the death penalty in the officer’s killing inflamed tensions with the police. But it was pragmatic as well as principled: She knew that San Francisco jurors rarely if ever returned death sentences. And despite the protests, polling showed that the public supported her.Some contend that the episode spooked her, that she spent the rest of her tenure trying to make amends with the police. Ms. Harris scoffs at the idea, pointing to her diversion program that allowed young low-level offenders to avoid incarceration if they enrolled in school full time and kept a job. “You think law enforcement was supportive of that?” she said.That  program was relatively small, with only about 300 graduates over eight years. Mr. Adachi and others complained that it took only the offenders most likely to succeed. But its recidivism rate was remarkably low: less than 10 percent, compared with 53 percent statewide.Arguing that students who skip school are the ones who end up in the criminal justice system, Ms. Harris also started an anti-truancy program. She described it as carrot-and-stick: It threatened prosecution for parents whose children were chronically absent, but also helped them with health care problems and other hurdles to getting their children to school.Critics, though, said it was more stick than carrot, and failed to grapple with the depths of the social problems parents were struggling against.Either way, the program reflected Ms. Harris’s approach to her job.“Fierce,” said Lateefah Simon, a onetime teenage shoplifter who became executive director of a center that helps lift young women out of lives of crime. Ms. Harris recruited her to work in the district attorney’s office, instructed her to lose the Pumas and track pants, bought her a suit and told her she needed to understand the penal code. Ms. Harris herself kept an immaculate desk, with little more than a notepad and a keyboard at her fingertips.Ms. Simon called Ms. Harris “the 1999 version of Olivia Pope,” the impeccably tailored, steely-in-a-crisis hero of television’s “Scandal.”“She’s not easy,” Ms. Simon said. “If you beat up a woman in front of her children, you are going to jail. At the heart, she is a prosecutor. She wants to hold people accountable.”Suzy Loftus, who started working for Ms. Harris as a campaign volunteer in 2003 and is now running for district attorney, recalls Ms. Harris’s instruction as she swore her in as a prosecutor: “When you go into court tomorrow,” she told her, “you look the judge in the eye and say, ‘Suzy Loftus, for the people.’” (“For the people” is now the slogan for Ms. Harris’s presidential campaign.)“It’s professional and it’s about dignity,” Ms. Loftus said. “But it’s also about giving dignity to people who are most impacted by the system.”But it was Ms. Harris’s success in increasing conviction rates that became a central boast of her campaign for attorney general in 2010.An article in San Francisco Weekly that year challenged the numbers, noting that most of the convictions had come from plea deals, and that the conviction rate for cases that went to trial was lower than Mr. Hallinan’s, and had dropped over the previous two years. Assistant prosecutors were quoted saying that Ms. Harris had pressured them to take weak cases to trial in an attempt to look tough on crime as she prepared to run beyond the liberal city.Her office defended her by noting that she had won stiffer sentences than her predecessors, by demanding prison time instead of probation for crimes including robbery and home burglary.Ms. Simon, who was awarded a MacArthur “genius” grant in 2003 for her leadership on juvenile justice and now leads the Akonadi Foundation, a racial justice organization in Oakland, says she fights with her “radical friends” who think Ms. Harris was not progressive enough on crime. “I say, I’d love to see you run for D.A. and run a better office.”Ms. Harris, she said, had to contend with expectations from all sides.“She instinctually but also strategically had to think about the way people saw her,” Ms. Simon said. “The expectations not just of a black woman elected, but with black folks, they expected so much of her to go and revolutionize the system in four to eight years, which is impossible.”Ms. Harris ran unopposed in 2007 for her second term — the only San Francisco district attorney to have done so in nearly two decades. And she became increasingly well known nationally, publishing her first book, “Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor’s Plan to Make Us Safer,” as she prepared to run for attorney general in 2010.She took office at the ideal moment for a prosecutor who wanted to rethink the criminal justice system.A panel of federal judges had ruled that overcrowding in California prisons amounted to cruel and unusual punishment — prisoners were stacked in triple bunk beds in gymnasiums and dying for lack of medical care — and ordered the state to reduce the population by about 40,000.The debate over prison crowding had been long-running and contentious, with victims’ rights groups and law enforcement officials opposing the idea of prisoner release. Ms. Harris stayed above the fray, as she would on a range of issues throughout her tenure, seeing herself less as a decision maker than as a lawyer serving a client.She had campaigned to the right of her Republican opponent on the question of easing the state’s tough three-strikes law. Once in office, she declined to take positions on ultimately successful ballot initiatives intended to reduce prison populations — one expanding opportunities for parole, the other reducing many nonviolent felonies to misdemeanors.She argued that because she was tasked with writing the descriptions of the initiatives that would appear on the ballot any public statements on the proposals might create the impression that she had a finger on the scale. This departed, though, from the practice of previous attorneys general.After the Supreme Court upheld the judges’ overcrowding order, the state promised to “promptly” release a significant number of nonviolent prisoners, giving credit for time served. A delay in meeting that promise drew a judicial scolding in 2014. The state’s response proved embarrassing, and unsuccessful: Reducing the prison population, Ms. Harris’s office maintained, would hurt California’s ability to fight wildfires by shrinking the pool of forced labor.“She really was a sideline player in all the decarceration efforts,” said Robert Weisberg, a law professor and co-director of the criminal law center at Stanford. “She didn’t stake out a strong position on what to do other than, ‘Let’s promote re-entry and anti-recidivism programs.’”The California attorney general’s office is large, about 5,000 lawyers, and Ms. Harris said she was unaware of the brief arguing for cheap prison labor. “A previous A.G. said to me, ‘You are going to inherit an office of 5,000 mistakes waiting for you every day,’” she said in the interview. “I have always owned that responsibility.”That was also her response to criticism that she had resisted appeals for DNA testing from Kevin Cooper, a death row inmate whose case had been taken up by groups including the American Bar Association and the American Civil Liberties Union. Ms. Harris said she learned of the case in a New York Times column last year — after which she urged testing.Beginning in the summer of 2014, the nation — and with it, California’s attorney general — was thrust into a debate over police brutality, by the deaths of black men in confrontations with the police in Ferguson, Mo.; Baltimore; and other cities.Ms. Harris won praise for releasing statewide data in a way that informed rather than inflamed the brutality debate: It included numbers on the use of police force but also on use of force against officers. She instituted body cameras for police agents who worked in her office, and offered implicit-bias training for police statewide.But she declined to support statewide regulations for the use of body cameras, agreeing with local departments that they should set their own standards. And she did not support a bill that would have required the attorney general to investigate police shootings.Her office was also forced to confront an uproar over prosecutorial misconduct, with judges disciplining local prosecutors for lying and tampering with evidence. It was an issue she had faced as district attorney in a scandal involving drug testing at the San Francisco Police Department crime lab.A technician had been skimming drugs to feed her own habit, and Ms. Harris’s chief drug prosecutor had warned that she was sabotaging evidence. Ms. Harris said she only learned of the problem several months later, when it was revealed publicly.A judge then ruled that the district attorney’s office had violated constitutional protections requiring prosecutors to turn over any information that might damage witnesses’ credibility, and criticized the office for failing to tell defense lawyers about crimes or misconduct on at least 60 police officers’ records.Ms. Harris responded by accusing the judge of a conflict of interest because she was married to a defense attorney who had handled a case involving the lab. (A court rejected her motion.)As attorney general, Ms. Harris defended prosecutors by appealing judges’ rulings — dropping one appeal, during her Senate campaign, only after a video of judges criticizing her office went viral.In a case in Orange County, a public defender had discovered that the district attorney’s office was strategically placing jailhouse informants, offering them leniency if they could coax confessions from fellow inmates. A judge found that the district attorney’s office had lied to him about the use of informants and withheld potentially favorable evidence from defense lawyers.When the judge disqualified the entire office from a death penalty case, Ms. Harris appealed, accusing the judge of abusing his discretion. While she opened an inquiry into the case at hand, she rejected repeated calls for a broad investigation of the prosecutor’s office.In the recent interview, Ms. Harris said her decision reflected her experience when others had tried to disqualify her from the San Francisco death penalty case. It was up to voters, not the attorney general, she said, to remove elected prosecutors. “I knew misconduct had occurred, clearly it had,” she said. “And it was being handled at the local level.”Frustrated by her refusal to investigate, Erwin Chemerinsky, then the law school dean at the University of California, Irvine, joined with a former attorney general to ask the Justice Department to examine what they believed was a pattern of civil rights violations in the prosecutor’s office. Their letter was signed by 25 prominent law professors, prosecutors and defense lawyers.“Twice Kamala Harris called on my cell and said she was on top of it and looking into it,” he said. “To my knowledge, the California A.G. never did anything with regard to the scandal.”Professor Chemerinsky emphasized that he admired Ms. Harris’s work as a senator. But, he said, her office’s decisions on Orange County were “outrageous.”“Their reaction ranged from silence to criticizing the judge who found the misconduct,” he said. “Never did they attempt to be a force for reform.”In September 2011, Ms. Harris announced that she would not sign the National Mortgage Settlement, negotiated by the Obama administration with the banks at the center of the foreclosure crisis. What happened next, Ms. Harris and her supporters say, illustrates her agility in balancing competing interests.The proposed settlement essentially gave the banks amnesty against further prosecution. Ms. Harris wanted to leave open the possibility of investigation and lawsuits, and promised Californians to lock up the bankers responsible for the fraud.As the top prosecutor for the state with the bulk of foreclosures, she had the power to determine the fate of the deal. The lobbying was intense — from housing groups, from homeowners, from the Obama administration. “It was a constant tension between speeding the relief quickly in the middle of the crisis or taking the time to go through this investigation, which could take years, while people were losing their homes every day,” said Brian Nelson, a deputy who helped Ms. Harris negotiate the deal.She did not kill the settlement. She emerged with a better one: The banks agreed to $18 billion in debt reduction that Ms. Harris said would allow California homeowners to stay in their homes, and the national agreement included $2.5 billion for a fund to provide educational counseling and other services for those in danger of foreclosure.But critics, especially on the left, have long said that the settlement was no grand bargain. It did not require banks to pay much out of pocket; $4.7 billion of the $18 billion in relief came from forgiving second mortgages, many of which the banks would have written off anyway because they were so severely underwater, and $9 billion came from homeowners selling their homes for less than the value of their mortgages, meaning that homeowners did not stay in their homes.Ms. Harris retained the right to investigate and pursue claims against the banks, winning $921 million against five institutions. But no one went to prison; she explained to voters that she was frustrated, too, but the state could go only “where the evidence took us.”And most of the $410 million California got to help at-risk homeowners never made it to them; a judge found that Governor Brown diverted $331 million to plug budget holes. Ms. Harris recused herself from defending the governor because of her role in the settlement. She rebuffed housing advocates’ requests to meet with her, offering little more than a brief statement that the money should go to homeowners.Her decision to fight the ruling that had struck down California’s capital punishment law in 2015 created similar disappointment among those who had applauded her refusal to call for the death penalty in San Francisco.“This was not a situation where they were compelled to respond,” said Hadar Aviram, a law professor at Hastings who started a petition against appealing. “They could have done nothing.”The public, however, had three years earlier rejected a ballot initiative that would have abolished the death penalty in California.In the interview, Ms. Harris said that as attorney general she had had to represent her client, the governor, who supported the death penalty appeal. Even so, she had cited her discretion in deciding which cases to pursue when she declined requests to defend Proposition 8, a successful ballot initiative defining marriage as between a man and a woman, in federal courts.Once again, she said, her critics were framing a false choice: She could defend the death penalty for a client and still be opposed to it personally.Just as a prosecutor can be tough but also progressive.“One human being kills another human being, a woman is raped, a child is molested — are we really saying there should be no consequence and accountability?” she said. “I believe it is consistent with knowing that there is bias in the system, knowing that there are deep flaws in the system, knowing that there has to be reform of the system.”She added: “Are we really saying that you’re either that, or you believe that there should be serious consequences for people who commit serious crimes? I am both.”"
543,"Happy 2019 and welcome back to Current Events Conversation!Thank you to classes from Beverly, Mass., Danvers, Mass., Hoggard High School and Silverton, Ore., for getting us off to a strong start this year with excellent comments on living without a phone, making career choices, facing rejection and more.To kick off the new year, in addition to our most popular writing prompts of the week, we’re also including a special bonus look at student predictions for 2019. We had so much fun reading them that we couldn’t not share them here.And though we usually only highlight comments from our writing prompts in this feature, this week we also want to acknowledge a class from Massachusetts, who left especially thoughtful responses to our Article of the Day, “Learning With: ‘Heroin Addiction Explained: How Opioids Hijack the Brain.’” As a student named Ilana wrote, “I’ve been told time and time again that opioids are highly addictive. But, that is the only thing I’ve been told, leaving the crisis of addiction to seem non-applicable to me. I never understood why anyone would take them in the first place but this article shed on light on the ‘euphoric first time’ [and] helps me understand the driving of force of their addiction.”Finally, welcome to new classes from Stevens Point, Wis., and Warsaw, Poland. We’re so glad to have you.Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted.__________At the beginning of every new year, we ask students to make predictions about the year ahead. What do they think will happen nationally, globally or locally? What’s in store for technology, sports, culture, food, economics and politics? What do they have to look forward to in their own lives?Only 10 students so far have told us what they think 2019 will hold, but we enjoyed both the range and the specificity so much we’re quoting much of what we got.

I’m hoping the U.N. will take some major strides to help the refugees displaced due to the raging war in Syria. After recently watching a documentary on it, you can really see how in need these people are and how little attention they get.

He wonders, if we were to forgo our smartphones in 2019, what else could we do with that money and time?We posed the question to students: Would they go a year without their phones? Could they? Commenters estimated that they spent anywhere from 30 minutes to 7 hours on their phones each day. Some said they would gladly give up staring at their screens all the time. Others, though, weren’t so sure it could be done.My phone is part of my lifeI honestly could not go a year without my smartphone, even though I wish I could. I hate my phone and what it does to my work ethic. It causes way too many distractions, causing me to either not do my work or forget about it …A main reason I could not go without my phone is because of communication. My parents like to use an app called Life360 that tracks where I am, so I need my phone with me at all times.I would be fine without social media, it would be good for all of us, but it is one of the only ways I keep track of my friends that go to different schools, make new friends, and make plans.Homework is also why I could not go without my phone for a year. Sometimes I don’t always have my laptop with me, and so I do my work on my phone. I watch the videos we have to watch for math on my phone rather than on my laptop because I find that I pay attention better since my phone isn’t sitting off to the side.I believe no one in todays time could go without their phone for a year because now, smartphones are apart of everyone’s lives, jobs, schools, and parents all have apps for everything.— Evan Barefoot, Hoggard High SchoolOn the average I spend about 7 hours a day on my phone, I will text friends, play games and check my social media. Could I go a year without my phone? No, not at all. I wouldn’t know what’s going on, i wont be able to text my friends. My phone is what i use to talk to people because its hard for me to talk to someone about my feelings face to face. When I want to hangout with my friends i use my phone, when I’m done doing my chores I go on my phone, I use my phone for music on the bus, when i’m playing my PS3, when i’m doing the dishes, and many more stuff. My phone is part of my life.— Kiara2019, SilvertonI should spend less time on my phone, but … Personally I’d say I spend about 1-2 hours on my phone everyday. The majority of the time spent on my phone is on Social Media and Music apps. I think if I wasn’t exposed to social media, and had another was of listening to music, I could go a year without a smartphone …I do think this article persuades me to give up my phone for a year because it showed me all the good I could do for myself and the world. The best examples given were the plant, purify, save, and heal. If I didn’t have a smartphone for a year, I would probably spend most of my time reading and growing my knowledge to do better in school and in life and going on adventures around the world.— Krystian30, SilvertonThe benefits that my phone has on my life is that I can easily get in touch with my friends and I can keep up with what’s going on with the world and other peoples life’s. Yes I think my phone does have a negative impact on my life. I am a very stressful person and I have heard that your stress levels go up when you use your smartphone. Also no amount of light hitting your eyeballs 1 foot away is good for eyes or your brain. I also tend to get really bad headaches from looking at my phone took much and that’s a major problem. Lastly I love my phone and the connection I can get with my friends over it, but I do think I need to spend less time on my phone and enjoy another persons company.— leialoha, silverton23I spend lots of time on my phone. On average maybe 30-40 hours per week. I am trying to cut down on the usage because I know I have more important stuff to do then just staring at my phone. When I heard what we could do to change this, I knew I needed to follow these …The benefits to not having a phone, (from my experience) is that you are in a better mood. You do more stuff with people and do more things that are active and healthy for you. I think it’s good to drop your phone once in a while to be more open. Open to the world, open to more activities. You are happier when not staring at your phone, and you are more talkative to a person. I think in general we should drop our phones for a week, and just experiment with the fun.— Madison2019, SilvertonA year without a phone? I could do it.The benefits my phone has for my life is that I can stay connected with a lot of my peers around Oregon or my friends at my school. My phone keeps me entertained and helps me contact anyone at any time if its crucial or really important, it also keeps me in reach with my parents so that they know where I am at all times.But, the negative affects my phone has in my life is that it draws my attention so that whenever I have homework or something really important to do I don’t do it because I’m so focused on my phone. I make excuses that I don’t have time, but usually I roughly have 2 hours of free time to get all my homework done but instead I just go on my phone. Also, I do many sports and I always use the excuse that school is to hard or that sports are making it difficult but it really is just me choosing that my phone is more important than my education.So, yes I do think that I could go a year without my cellphone and that it would benefit me to get all the things I need to get done so that I can be successful as I get higher and higher at school.— Melia, Silverton23I probably could go a year without my smartphone because I don’t use it that much. It benefits me because if my parents need to contact me or I want to reach my friend, I can with the smartphone. The disadvantages with it are mainly that I don’t pay attention to my surroundings when focused on the screen … If I were to spend a year without my phone I wouldn’t really miss it, considering most of my electronics time is spent on my laptop or console, rather then my phone. If I didn’t spend any time on electronics however I would probably spend more time with family.— Clayton, SilvertonI only spend around 30 minutes on my phone on a daily basis so most of the things said in the article don’t really matter as much to me …I could go a year without my phone because i don’t really use it for anything but texting and if i needed i could just talk to people in person. If i didn’t have a phone i guess the positive side would be that i wouldn’t be tempted to look at a screen constantly.— ashton, silverton23__________In “Does It Pay to Be a Writer?” Concepción de León reports that professional writing pays far less than it used to — barring many aspiring writers from pursuing their dream job. This sad news inspired us to ask students how important money is in their own career aspirations.The question revealed a deep philosophical split in teenage opinion: while some consider choosing a career just for the money to be a “death sentence,” others felt that blindly pursuing one’s passion was “no longer a viable life plan” in today’s economy. Many, however, are planning ahead to try to have it all — a career they love that also earns enough to pay the bills.Get real and choose a career that earns a reasonable wage“Do what you love” is cute advice for after school activities and hobbies, but when it comes to finding a job, especially in today’s economy where real estate prices and the cost of college is getting significantly higher, it becomes necessary to sacrifice a dream job (like being an author) to something with steady pay, even if you do not enjoy it as much.— Julie Kee, Danvers, Mass.While I personally revel in the practice of writing, I bar myself from entering a career as an author or journalist simply because it is no longer particularly financially lucrative as the Amazon business leviathan consolidates its hold over the publishing industry, and the influence of institutions such as newspapers and magazines wanes, a process detailed in Concepción de León’s article, “Does it Pay to Be a Writer?” In short, careers in creative spheres are no longer a viable life plan. While it is possible to achieve success, the probability of gaining true economic stability is dwindling.— Jake Hession, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, N.C.Our modern marketplace makes it very difficult to pursue certain careers, and insight like “just do what you love” teaches nothing but how out of touch a lot of us still are about these issues.— Vanessa Ellis, Danvers, Mass.I would not choose to go in a career if it did not pay well, no matter how much I was interested in it. Ultimately, the most efficient way to promote physical and mental well being is to have money - not in abundance, but a liveable salary is something hard to live without. I feel like the hassle of playing catch-up with bills, payments, etc., would spoil the fun of the interest anyways, since it attracts so many hardships. When thinking about a career, the advice I would give is to think practically. Career advice typically includes something around “following your passion” or your interests. But, interests change drastically through time.— Emily Whalen, MassachusettsDo what you loveA job should not just be for a source of income. Your career should give you a sense of fulfillment in what you are doing for the world. I know what I want to do and I am willing to put in my everything to get there. Are you willing?— Madison Kelley, Danvers, Mass.In today’s world, not many adults really enjoy their occupation as a part of their “lifestyle” or even “hobbie”. Most of the time, these people are seen walking around miserably on the weekdays, as they are solely focused on reaching the weekend.However, making not a lot of money comes with sacrifices. I would not be able to live as luxuriously as maybe preferred. I might not be able to have my dream car, or dream house, or dream vacations. Nevertheless, all of these things bought with large amounts of money can only take you so far in life. A “dream” car can take you all the same places a mediocre car could, and a “dream” house is the same four walls and a roof that a mediocre house could provide. Also, a “dream” vacation only lasts for so long, until you must return home. My goal is to have my weekdays be as enjoyable as my weekends because we only live for so long. If that means not making a huge amount of money, so be it.— Gabriela Ferullo, Danvers, Mass.You don’t need money to be happy in life, you just need to do something that makes you happy. That’s why people work lower-paying careers despite having opportunity to easily make more money. Teachers are another prime example. No one would become a high school teacher based on the amount of money they’re going to make, yet there are still enough people who want to be teachers in the world that schools can actually function. This is because people want to be teachers because they’re passionate about teaching. If I were offered two jobs—a job that I would love to do for low pay, and a job that I would absolutely hate for higher pay—I would take the former.— Jack Murray, Danvers, Mass.Waking up everyday to go to an average 9-5 job that I hate would be a death sentence. I’m only 17 years old, and I am a junior in high school. I really haven’t thought about money much in my life, so maybe its a little premature to say that I do not care about it much. However as I sit here an right this, I want to do what I love, and love what I do.— Tom Walfield, Danvers, Mass.I would rather live in a little hut on the water with only what I needed to live, go to work everyday that is something I love to do, and then go back to my little hut and surf.— Dan Rossitto, Danvers, Mass.I look at people who sit behind desks from 8-6, five days a week, counting other people’s money, or creating advertisements, looking at a computer screen all day long. And some of them are happy, and like their job. But if I were offered a job like that, even if it were for triple my original salary, I would have to turn it down. We sit behind desks for sixteen or so years, why would anyone want to do that for the rest of their lives.If I’m not doing something I love, I don’t try as hard.— Madeline Butler, Danvers, Mass.Can’t you have both?In my family, my single mother used to search endlessly for a job to provide for my sibling and I. Her current job wasn’t what she attended university for, but it would be enough for our home and necessities. Looking back at those times, I hope to find a career I love, but within reason. I have a wider scope of understanding that money needs to be made, but I have hopes that the field of journalism is still alive by the time I graduate. I fully intend to pursue what I love and is interesting to me: journalism. By reading this article I am faced with the reality that not everyone makes it into The New York Times or uncovers a scandal like the Spotlight team in 2001. There is still hope that I can write about the major stories of our society and support myself and a future family.— Grace Donahue, Danvers, Mass.I hope to go to college to become a pediatric nurse. The salary of this job was an important part in deciding this career choice. Working with children is something I am passionate about, but the nursing field was chosen based on the salary. I want to be able to support myself and my potential family without struggle.— Casey Masterson, Danvers, Mass.Ever since I first started thinking about what I wanted my job to be when I get out of college, it was always a mixture between what I want to do and how much I get paid for doing it.From an early age I’ve wanted to go into the medical field and as I got older my sights have been more focused on physical therapy. I knew that I wanted to be able to help people one way or another and physical therapy had seemed like the perfect fit for me. I want to be able to have a sustainable life while also being able to enjoy it at the same time. Overall, I don’t really think that there is a perfect job out there, but I do think that if you choose something that you’re good at, enjoy doing, and has a good salary that’s fit for you, then you’ll be able to lead a good and happy life.— Kathleen Dawe, Massachusetts__________In our most popular Picture Prompt of the week, “Facing Rejection,” we asked students to look at the illustration above and reflect on a time they were rejected or failed at something they had worked hard for. How did they handle it? Like the person in the picture? Or with a little more frustration?They told us stories of heartbreak, humiliation and, ultimately, resilience. Read on to see what advice they have for their future selves and others on how to deal with rejection.Turn failure into fuelWhen I was ten years old I fell in love with soccer. I worked hard and would look forward to every practice. When I was ten though, during tryouts the top ten girls would make an early travel team. This of course, became my big goal. I went to all three days and worked very hard, yet there was some girls who only showed up to two, one, and some who didn’t even go. The coaches in the end, picked them. I was the eleventh pick. When my father told me this the day after thanksgiving I was heartbroken. I had worked so hard and tried my best, how could girls who didn’t even come to tryouts get in, and not me?This was when I learned just how strong rejection can make you. I ended up working even harder the next few years to prove that I should not have been the eleventh pick … Getting rejected when I was young helped me become determined and pushed me to be a better player, a leader, and a better person. To my future self, turn the negative into fuel to do good things and become better. Do not beat yourself up if you don’t have your best race, or your best test. Prove to others and to yourself that you are better than what others may believe.— Gabrielle Sherrick, Danvers, Mass.I have faced rejection before. I was a little league baseball player when I was younger and wanted to really badly make the all star team. Sadly, I wasn’t accepted to the team and I grew angry because I thought that I was going to make the team for sure. It turns out that this rejection made me realize that hard work and dedication is what you need to put into something that you love to be good at it.A piece of advice that I would give somebody because of this would be If you think you are the best you could be then push yourself even harder because you can be better than you are already are it will just take commitment. I have told myself many times when I feel like I reached my max potential that I just feel like this, but I could still push myself harder and make it so I am even better than I thought I could be. It changed the way I look at things and how I act in my life.— Jacob Stone, United StatesDon’t take it personallyAs an aspiring actress, I have learned that rejection is a part of life. I have been rejected from theaters so many times that it is hard to count at this point, but I feel as if that has built me up to the person I am. When I was younger, I would respond to rejection by going up to my room, locking the door, and just crying for hours straight. I really just wanted to give up. At that age, you truly almost can’t control it. Even when I wasn’t auditioning, I would still go through these phases when I just felt hopeless …For me, trying to look at what I can improve on helps, but even so, there are so many factors that go into casting. From not being the right height to not having the right vocal range, so many things that go into it, and for me, learning to not take it personally is one of the most important things anyone can learn.— Sophia Buonanduci, Beverly, Mass.As a kid who plays three sports, I’ve been told no and been criticized a lot in my life. When I was younger I was always offended by the answer “no” and I saw it as a sign of negativity. I did and still do hold very high standards for myself. The only thing that’s changed is how I take the criticism, whether or not it’s delivered nicely with a warm and cozy feeling.When I get the answer “no”, get criticized, or get a bad grade, I look back on the test I failed or the moment on the field in which I messed up and I do some self reflection. I try to first identify the problem then decide how I can work on and fix that problem. As a matter of fact, now that I know how to take criticizm and no for an answer, I like to have friends and coaches who criticize me more so that I can continue endlessly working and self improving.— Ian, Beverly, Mass.Learn to move onThis situation may not seem like much, but I recall when I was about 8 years old, I had a Lego set that I got for Christmas. It was a star wars set that I had to build by following the instructions, and every time that I got to this one step, the whole thing would fall apart. It was really frustrating going through this process over and over again just to fail repeatedly. Obviously, being only 8 years old, I did not take this well, I would get angry and maybe even throw some of the pieces across the room.Looking back on it now, I can see that it was silly to be upset over Legos. But I think I did learn how to control my anger, after all of these failures, I started to ease into getting less and less frustrated …I was able to understand that if you get too frustrated from failure, you will never succeed. For the next time I face rejection, I would tell my future self to pull it together, not to get upset, and move on from that rejection so it doesn’t stick with you and drag you down.— Dillon McDermott, Danvers, Mass."
544,"We know teenagers have opinions about everything. That’s why our writing prompts touch on both the serious (Should anyone have $1 billion?) and the not-so-serious (How do you like your pizza?).But some of our favorite questions to ask are about issues that directly affect people this age, like What Are the Most Important Things Students Should Learn in School? and Should Parents Use Smart Devices to Spy on Their Children?Most of the Times articles we draw from are written by adults, so we’re happy that our prompts give students a space to share their experiences. They often provide sharp insights that add nuance to an author’s argument and personal stories that give a human face to the reporting. And always, they give us a deeper understanding of what it’s like to be a teenager today.We’ve gathered the responses to three such prompts below. This week, teenagers told us what it’s really like to grow up in a culture of online public shaming; shared how technology has shaped the ways they apologize; and wrote short stories and poems about what they imagine the future will look like.And though we don’t round up the responses to our Article of the Day and Film Club features here, we also want to acknowledge the many comments we received on an article and short film we featured honoring the Feb. 14 anniversary of the Parkland shooting. There, students shared their support for the victims and survivors of Parkland, as well as their own fears and anxieties about being a part of the “mass shooting generation.”Finally, thank you to the many new classes who added their voices to the conversation this week from: Booker High School; Burnt Hills Ballston-Lake in New York; Clymer, N.Y.; Etna, Calif.; Fairfield, Calif.; NHRHS, N.J.; North Hunterdon High School; Oak Grove; Oceanside High School; South Carolina; Wilmington, Mass.; and Voice Charter School.Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted.__________Outrage erupted online after Esquire Magazine released their March 2019 cover story earlier this month, portraying the quintessential “American Boy” a white, middle-class boy. People ridiculed not only the magazine, but also the subject of the story: 17-year-old Ryan Morgan. In a related Op-Ed, Robyn Kanner argues that online public shaming like this prevents people, especially teenagers, from being able to learn, grow and change.In this Student Opinion question, we asked students if they agreed with Ms. Kanner. They shared with us what it’s like to grow up in a culture of digital shaming, and the way it has both opened their eyes and scared them into silence.Should teenagers be held to the same standards as adults?As a very average teenager i believe that it is very unfair to judge someone for their thoughts and actions as a teenager. We often say without thinking and simply think what our peers think. We go with what everyone else is doing and that is why often times a lot of teens make bad decisions. We are pressured to do what everyone else is doing without even realizing the pressure is there.— Thomas, silverton30Teenagers are not oblivious and blind. They know their actions, and infantilizing and pitying them to avoid addressing their genuinely problematic actions is part of the problem. Not checking these actions in formative years paves the way for them to do the same as adults. While public shaming and dogpiling is extreme, you can’t brush over bad things by saying “he was just a kid.” Being a kid doesn’t change that you have to check and change problematic behavior.— Faye, ChicagoOur legal guardians influence us more than we realize, however adolescents should not be held to the same standard because we have more people around us during the day that shove their thoughts and beliefs on us. Therefore, we haven’t had a chance to figure out our own thoughts because we constantly have other people’s words impacting us when we don’t realize. It is unfair for us to compare adolescents to the standards of adults because of the countless influences adults don’t face, and we unrightly judge our peers because our society has justified it as a way of life.— Brooklyn Waller, Bryant High School, ArkansasI cannot say that all teenagers shouldn’t be judged or criticized by there actions and opinions. Although people can change, we cannot excuse harmful behavior or opinions at any age.— Caroline, NorthbrookAdolescence is a time for us teenagers to be exploring the world around us and developing our worldview, and throughout this process of growing up, I have witnessed the ideologies of my peers and I develop in nuance and maturity … Knowing the severity of digital shaming and the potential of teenagers to change, I do not believe it is fair to hold teenager’s online statements to the same level of scrutiny as adults as criticism online has a greater danger of hurting a teenager or promoting dogmatism instead of fostering growth.— Rachel Sweningson, Bryant, ArkansasIt is commonly said that teenagers are young and dumb and are just exploring their values and beliefs, but at what point does that turn from exploration to being disrespectful without having to be held accountable for one’s actions. I do believe that people should be held accountable for rude actions as a teenager, because those actions do not go away or change, they are just there, sitting in the past.— Lainey Broussard, Houston, TexasTo be a teenager in the modern era is still like being a teenager, you’re awkward, scared, and harassed for doing something different. The key difference is that now complete and total strangers are harassing teens now too, all thanks to the internet. I do fear being shunned for what I believe, as would any human. As such, I do try to be more thoughtful toward others. I worry so much that i might offend someone to the point i may just not talk.— Ben Smith, Hoggard High School (Wilmington, N.C.)The good and the bad of “call-out culture”I’m sure you’ve heard the saying “if at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” Think about all the times you’ve made mistakes, and how you’ve learned from those mistakes. What if you never got the chance to “try, try, again?” If the first time you made a mistake that was the only impression people had of you and you didn’t get the chance to learn and grow? That is what public shaming is doing to us.Since we Iive our lives so publicly, impulsively tweeting and posting whatever comes to our mind, a lot of our mistakes and not-so-proud moments are out there for the world to see—forever. Then our mistakes become the only view people have of us, an out-of-context snapshot that provides an incomplete, biased view of our character. Even if what we say doesn’t go viral, its just a google search of our name away. We don’t get the chance to explain ourselves, to grow and change as a person, or to develop our views and opinions because people will judge us before we’ve had the chance.— Gillian Konko, Houston, TexasCriticism is a big part of online culture, and for a very good reason. People will almost always want to say something about everything, and the allure of doing so without giving away your identity is often too strong to resist. Criticism, therefore, is very important, and I believe all people have the right to criticize and to be criticized. However, I believe that all criticism should be nuanced.— Thomas D., J.T. Hoggard High SchoolI am definitely more careful about what I post online because I know that it could offend or upset other people, which I don’t want to do. I think if people were kinder online in their critiques, then the teenager who posted something would be able to learn from it. However, usually the shaming is a complete bash of the person which could deter them from ever sharing again. This doesn’t help them learn anything; it just hurts them and makes them fearful. Kinder critiques and proper guidance for people would help them learn and change to become better people.— Maddy Chen, Northbrook, ILIf we obsess over people’s past then it’s possible they will be afraid to ever express themselves for fear of it coming back to haunt them … I purposefully don’t put anything controversial online because I know it will be permanent, and in case I change as a person later in my life I don’t want to have to worry about that. I think that it’s good for people to know that things they say on the internet can come back for them, but I also think it’s dangerous to have a culture where we immediately condemn people for parts of their past we find.— Dylan Thiessen, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NCI believe that the best way to counteract this problem is to simply work to persuade others rather than persecute them. There’s always a chance that someone could change, like Kanner did, and come to see your point of view. But forcing ideas upon others, even if they’re right, can mar your argument in the eyes of someone else, making all debate pointless. In conclusion, while it may seem that our rage-based internet culture is working to make progress, it might be hurting more than helping.— Ashley Anderson, Hoggard High School, NCPublic shaming forces an artificial change in people who want to avoid being the subject of constant harassment. For example, look at how arguments for Trump’s border wall play out. If you argue for the wall, you’re publicly shamed and called a racist bigot. So, to avoid that outcome, people (specifically teenagers, who are generally more worried about their public image) stay silent. Silence may feel good at the time, but silence doesn’t solve problems.Digital public shaming not only stunts the growth of the teenage mind and ideas, it also stunts the growth of fruitful and equal discourse on emotionally charged issues. Overall, I don’t want to live in a culture where ideas can be moderated through public harassment via social media; regardless of what I agree and disagree with, no one should have to be afraid to share their opinion to the general public.— Alex Mohler, Bryant High School… As a teenager growing up in a society like this, I agree that it restricts growth in a lot of ways. Ever since seeing hate comments left on videos as an eleven year old, I’ve had a lingering fear of having any social media presence, to avoid confrontation for a post I made or a comment I left. Due to this, I believe some part of my growth has been stunted; I’m often too scared to put myself out in the world because I believe backlash will be inevitable. I’m scared that I will upset someone, somehow. If I’m always worrying about pleasing everyone, when will I ever learn what I believe is right or wrong?— Michelle Lamas, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NCI believe that people can change, because I know that my views on multiple topics have changed over the course of months or years just based on the fact that I have become more knowledgeable on those topics. A large part of changing your views and even developing new ideas come from listening to what other people have to say and communicating your ideas with those people.— Matthew Miller, Hoggard High School, Wilmington NC__________In “How We Apologize Now,” Lindsey Weber writes about the growing phenomenon of digital apologies from celebrities. This inspired us to ask students about how they apologize now that we live in a world where we spend much more time connecting with people online than we do face-to-face.Their responses were mixed. Some said an apology is meaningful only if it’s made in person, while others argued that, in today’s digital world, an apology is an apology, no matter how you do it. They also shared helpful dos and don’ts for saying you’re sorry.A sincere and meaningful apology should be made in personI believe new technologies have made apologies less significant now too. A sincere apology should be given in person. If you are really sorry you should go look the person in the eye, admit to your mistake, and tell them you will try to change or not repeat the hurtful action. I believe digital apologies just don’t get the point across. The offended person will still be hurt and the offender can’t seen the person’s emotions that they have hurt.— Anonymous, Siskiyou CountyOne thing that makes an apology sincere, Is when it comes straight from the person mouth who is giving the apology. In my opinion apologizing over a screen is like breaking up with someone over text message, disrespectful and insincere. Although I can understand were each famous person is coming from when they are trying to apologize to millions, A video, or a live chat would be better then a caption or a screenshot from ones notes … Because apologies determine the trust we are receiving from a person, and how strong our relationship is. I would never sacrifice a strong relationship, because I wrote the apology over notes.— Isabella Clucas, Hoggard High school , Wilmington NCHonestly, I think digital apologies take away the point of and apology. An apology is to show sincerity in how sorry you are that something happened; it’s supposed to be from the heart, showing you actually care about the subject.I’ve received plenty of digital apologies, but I haven’t accepted many. It just tells me you don’t care enough about me to come to me in real life and exclaim your “sorrow”. Fixing a friendship, to me, is worth more effort than a text that took ten seconds to type and send.— Alexandra Pechlivanidis, Hoggard High SchoolI have received many digital apologies over the years and personally, for me, changed my view of the person who was apologizing to me. I am a very shy introverted person, so talking to people in person is hard for me. So, when I see someone taking their time to come up and apologize to me in person, I have a little more respect for them and I acknowledge the fact that they stepped out of their comfort zone. It makes me feel good about myself because it shows that this person obviously cares about me. This is not only benefiting you but also the person that is apologizing to you. They feel a sense of satisfaction that they wouldn’t receive when shooting an apology through text. With today’s society, it is getting so much harder for people to communicate face to face. By apologizing in person I believe this will make our generation stronger, and bring us all closer together.— Shelby, Etna, CaDigital apologies are acceptable — most of the timeOf course, little apologies like, “I’m sorry I ripped your paper” or “I didn’t mean to step on your foot” are reasonable ones to be digital. But big apologies like, “I’m sorry I yelled at you earlier” or “I shouldn’t have lied” should be genuine, and therefore given in person. I feel like in this world, more often than not, apologies are being digitally normalized. But I think we can all agree that’s not a great thing to normalize.— Sierra, EtnaPersonally, I have given my friends many digital apologies. I have a problem with confrontation and I can never find the confidence to speak to my friends about problems face on. I can definitely say its pretty obvious this way to tell when someone isn’t actually sorry … Face to face apologies are always best, but the start with a digital apology is a good way to begin.— Abigail Billings, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NCI personally apologize digitally because when I’m apologizing, I’m normally apologizing to one of my friends in my age group. And we understand each other better digitally. I do tend to use emojis as well when I apologize to show my regretness or whatever. BUT when I’m apologizing to someone like my parents, then I apologize face to face. In certain situations other alternatives could be taken. Personally apologizing digitally is more easier and better.— Oscar, FloridaIn the past, I’ve both given and received digital apologize, as most people nowadays have. It is not right and not just to call these apologies wrong, or worse than any other form like a face to face one. At the end of the day, it’s all just preference and overthinking whether or not someone is going to think that you are scared of facing your wrong and apologizing. But you are not, you’ve done it, and got the same message across in a more convenient way for the both of you, or at least that’s what most people believe in today, and do every single day. A good apology needs to face the wrong that you have done, and state how you are going to improve from here on out, becoming a better person each day.— Bogdan Taran, Northbrook, ILThe best apologies are heartfelt and well thought out such as the ones in the article. These noticeably took time, editing and most importantly sincerity. More people should write apology letters in a Notes app. This is a great starting place for developing apologies, creating more well-defined and concise messages due to the revision process. Like mentioned in the article, Taylor Swift, Drake, and Pete Davidson are the celebrities that use Notes app but didn’t screenshot a picture. They used the app as a starting point and then created the apology with clear thoughts and intentions.— Kathryn Meehan, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NCHiding behind a screenLike so many listed, I have to admit that I am guilty of this. I think that most apologies that are delivered digitally aren’t done so because they aren’t genuine, but because it’s so much easier to ask for forgiveness from the comfort of your couch, hiding behind a screen. When you’re face-to-face with that person, you either get too embarrassed to admit your mistake, or you’re too scared that it won’t be accepted. Somehow, whether it be to an offer of forgiveness or a dating request, people fear a corporal rejection more than a digital one, which encourages them to send these messages from a screen.— Diya Jain, New Jersey“Sorry.” Receiving that from a bubble over text has never relieved me from whatever situation led to it. I’ve always preferred an in-person apology, but I VERY rarely get those now. Living in the social media age has taken such a toll on the quality of our conversations that many are uncomfortable having in-person conversations. These awkward feelings towards face-to-face convos cause us to resort to typed characters on a screen to let out our thoughts and feelings. However, this method of communication is very dangerous …Our minds receiving that text can pick apart every detail. “Why did he capitalize that?” “She put a period … she’s obviously mad!” While the person on the other end may have had no intentions to send off “negative vibes.” Then, the argument begins: “Why are you mad at me?”So many arguments can be prevented with a phone call. Talking face-to-face allows for optimum communication. If I ever got into a situation with a person that ended in them having to apologize, I would 100% prefer a phone call or to be apologized to in person because one, it’s way more personal, and two, it gives me the peace of mind that they are being genuine.— Emma Coleman, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NCThe only struggle with apologizing face to face is sometimes it can be very nerve racking, and for some people who are not very social it can seem almost impossible to do. I think that is why so many apologies are sent through text. But I also think that for some people it is tough to face the truth. Most of the kids in our generation now do everything through their phone so that they can hide. They don’t want to feel the agony of being wrong so they apologize through text or phone call. But like I said earlier, the most genuine and most heartfelt way to apologize in my opinion is in person, and then after just shoot them a text just to tell them how sorry you are.— Trey Clucas, Hoggard High SchoolThe dos and don’ts of saying you’re sorry I think admitting that you made a mistake and then explaining what you are going to do to not make it again, really leaves no room for the apologizee (forgive my phrasing) to be mad, at least at the apology.In short, if you want an effective apology, start by acknowledging what you did wrong, explain what you will do to NEVER do this again, and finish by passive-aggressively insulting the one you are apologizing to for being so sensitive. The last part has … mixed results.— Justin Pfeifer, Hoggard Highschool Wilmington, NCI think that the best apologies are when the offender realizes what they have said has caused offense and they are genuinely sorry for being insensitive. With the observance of their offence, they now know not to do or say whatever it is they did that caused a negative reaction. A lot of people don’t care if they offend people, their apologies are in genuine and they continue offending others, making no changes.— Dana Mormando, Hoggard High School, Wilmington NCAn apology should consist of recognition of wrongdoing, and an expression of remorse for the event. Bad apologies are not sincere and often take the approach of blaming anything but self. Many times the wrongdoer will even guilt the recipient to make themselves feel better …Apologies are of importance because they can build and strengthen a relationship when an individual can take responsibility for their shortcoming or mistakes. It shows the love and respect one has for another when they can admit to their flaws, and hopefully aim to improve themselves. It can be corrosive, though, if one is only giving excuses or continuously having the same problem, promise to change, and producing no growth.— Hannah Jade, Etna, CAOn one school trip, a certain classmate of mine relished in taking every opportunity to make jokes at my expense or insult me. In addition, all the boys had to collectively sleep in the same area, including me and him. After dark, he would talk and talk about how stupid or how uncapable I was without relenting for all the others to hear — it was probably the worst couple days of my life.Fortunately, the counselors overheard him and asked him to stop. After a few days, the kid walked up to me and handed me a crumpled piece of paper silently. It read, without punctuation, something along the lines of, “i am sorry that you didn’t feel like you were at the center of your friend group it’s not like I was trying to make you feel bad or anything”. He then reverted to, “the age-old tendency [of getting] defensive, blowing out what should be a simple ‘sorry’ into a long and winding tale of excuses” (Weber). For me, it was an insult to receive that “apology”. It was fairly obvious that he had been forced to write it by the counselors and in his own way, he rebelled by making it as emotionally and grammatically inept as possible.— Andrei Mistreanu, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NCI think the best apologies are shown through actions rather than words and that’s why voicing your plans to change for the better make apologies better. If a celebrity says their going to educate themselves after making a racist remark, for example, they should ACTUALLY DO IT, and not just for show.— Marie, South CarolinaApologizing for something you’ve done wrong, is very vital to a good relationship. Whenever I verbally hurt one of my friends, usually due to stress or carelessness, I try my hardest to let them know I didn’t mean what I said. Most of the time I say something wrong to my friends, it’s usually because I am stressed out and don’t think that what I say and how I say it will affect anyone. We all have our bad days and sometimes when things aren’t going our way, we resort to taking it out on people we are closest to. That’s why it is important to make right what you’ve done wrong and apologize.— Mikhaila Floyd, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NC__________Our most popular Picture Prompt of the week, “Tech Gadgets,” invited students to use their imaginations to begin a short story or poem inspired by the above illustration.Many played off the same theme: the future. From a poem about how “the future is made” to tales of time travel, apocalypse and robots, each of these creative pieces left us wanting to know what would happen next.What the future might beThe projections of what the future might be, Are only based on our current reality, The future is made not by one view, But is an evolution of ideas all rolled into one, So the image you hold inside of your head, Of the gadgets, widgets or thingy mibobs, Are merely a potential fragment of what will become.— Julia, SpainMasterpieceIt was finally finished. The master cube. So much could be created with this masterpiece. It was amazing. It had created my new robodog almost instantly. Simply enter a blueprint and it becomes reality. My boss was really insistent on getting this project finished, even more so than usual. He must be excited for the things he can create. I know he has some blueprints already ready to go. I got up off the generator and packed up my tools into my bag. “Khanaki-1, guard the camp until I return” I say to my robodog, slinging my bag over my shoulder and picking up the cube gingerly. The metal dog gets up from his resting place and starts pacing the perimeter of my camp, watching over my generator and other possesions. “Good boy!” I say with a grin. He works perfectly.I head out to my bosses camp which isn’t too far. I see he has guests so I enter his huge office quietly, knowing he will want to know of this immediately. “— should be done any day now. Once we have the master cube we can simply give it the blueprint and it will generate our nuclear weapon arsenal to tenfold what it is now. No one will ever stand up to us again!” I overhear my boss say as I walk in. I suddenly want to turn around and walk right back out of this room. But I couldn’t, they had seen me. “Ah, Rikki, so nice of you to join us. And with the cube no less. Is it finished?” My boss had turned to me with a small smile, but his eyes were ice cold. A few people moved to block my exit. I wasn’t leaving.— Rebecca, Oak Grove2019, the year before the explosionSuki could feel the warmth of her electro-gloves and she pushed the button on her newest creation, a time machine. She saw the button glow yellow and shut her eyes in anticipation. She set the time back to the year 2019, before the explosion. She held the box tightly in her hands, trembling with fear and excitement. She could smell her grandmothers cookies that she used to make for her back when there were grocery stores to buy the ingredients. Finally, Suki opened her eyes and standing right in front of her was her grandma smiling at her with bright eyes. Behind her was a plate full of her delicious cookies.— Charlo, schoolThe incidentIt had been a while since Shana had any type of human interaction. She was left behind in the wreckage of the city that was built mainly of technology … but did that really matter now? Shana was ten when the incident happened, but as the years progressed, she lost track of her age. It was almost like the days before technology. Except for one thing. Her robot-dog, Robotus.He was the only thing left. Her family … who knew what happened to them. The only memory Shana had of her previous life was living in the outskirts of the advanced city, barely living off of whatever scraps her poor parents brought back every other night. For such an advanced society, it seemed that Shana’s family was always left behind. And finally … when the incident happened … escape shuttles only rescued the wealthiest of society; royals, if you will, and everyone that was related to important people of important blood.The rest were left to fend for themselves. Like Shana and her family. While her parents were out searching for food that night; the night of the accident; Shana tried to escape. And she managed to escape unscathed. But her parents … she never saw them again. The remains of the city appeared like a wasteland, and many pieces of technology were left behind. Shana felt in her heart her parents weren’t completely gone, and that’s why instead of counting the days until death, she would slowly build a vehicle to escape. And … possibly rescue her parents. If they were alive.— Ryley, Oak GroveRobotHaley was looking along the wreckage. The year was 3083, the year that a nuclear war broke out, and killed the Earth’s population. Only their belongings remained. Haley had a secret no one knew;she was a robot. The war didn’t faze her, instead it made her more powerful. For years, she planned to manipulate the UN, and turn everyone against each other. It worked, and now she was the only one on Earth. She dug deep into the Earth’s soil, and found her magical box. This crystal blue box held the key to the universe, and Haley could only retrieve the box after no humans could possibly disturb her.— Lucy, Oak GroveTime traveling cubeI have finally finished creating this masterpiece, and it is perfect. If I could have created this time traveling cube any other way, I wouldn’t. Now I am able to travel to when real dogs existed.— Brianna Kim, Northbrook, IllinoisThe year 4253The year is 4253, and the world is ending. People are scavenging for scraps to get material to leave earth. The woman is trying to build a space ship before the earth explodes.— Jason, northbrook, IlliniosGoing back in timeThis woman is a time traveler, and she is sitting on a box next to all of the things she has collected throughout time. Right now she is playing with a cube she got in 4000. After she traveled to far into time, all the people on earth were gone and she couldn’t figure out how to go back in time. Finally she has collected all of her things in one pile and is trying to figure out a way to go back into time.— Sidney Holman, Northbrook, ILThe making of EarthThe cube hovered patiently, glowing . How long had it been since she started? Seven days? More? It was hard to remember. All she knew was that it was the next in a long, long line of failed creations. The last one she had created had burst into shards of metal and rock. The one prior had twisted in on itself, like a swirling red eye. Even more failures, and no progress.She turned to her only companion, who sat idly by. He never said much, only speaking words of comfort when she felt lost. He had been with her through this entire endeavor. He was the only one that trusted in her experiments. The rest of them called her crazy, screaming that it would never work. Give up your dream! It’s not worth it!She sighed, releasing the upper corner of the cube. It’s colors shifted, a subtle green replacing some of the tranquil blue. Would this one work? How would she know? Whispers of failure echoed in her mind, but she persisted. She had to. It was what she was born to do.As the day turned to night, she made her final touches. Standing back, the cube was now a beautiful display of lights and color. It was good. Her heart swelled. This might be the one!She smiled at her friend. “What do you think we should call this one?”Her companion didn’t respond, instead walking to her side to marvel at her newest creation.”No suggestions?” She tapped her thick glasses, deep in thought. “Hmm … Let’s call this one … ”“Earth.”— Hoke Pollock, Hoggard High School, NCThe floating orb“This was Log Date 6.17.2053. Signing out for today”. The women with goggles said into her recording device as her companion walked beside her.“When are we going to find something interesting? Like a satellite to space or something. We have been searching for a couple of weeks and still found nothing.” She signed out, feeling the flow of air glide between her teeth. The dog, only having few responses, barked and trotted ahead.The girl followed her mechanical dog, pulling up a search engine on her handheld device. Her mind was distracted which resulted in her tripping over. “Hey! I told you not to sto-” The girl barked at her companion but soon stopped as she realized what she tripped over.It was a floating orb. It looked like it hovered over a platform.“Ugh, like I’ve seen those every spaceship wreck I’ve been too.” She remarked with sarcasm.Signing out, she went to search for her dog. Just as she did, the girl heard the dog’s robotic bark. Interested to see what stirred the dog, she walked over. Her eyes widened and sparkled with excitement.“Hello ….whst cna I help yuo wi..” The floating cube’s speech was mangled and hovered over the head of the dog.“Aww you poor thing! Your auditory systems are down!” She plopped down on a rectangular box and activated her gloves. She could barely contain herself as she scanned the cube for its technologically advanced features.“Let me fix you. Then you can join our fray and make this journey exciting!”— Kathryn Meehan, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NC"
545,"At sunrise, there it was: a red-tailed hawk, its gyre widening over the United States Capitol building in the Creamsicle-colored light, like the world’s least subtle literary reference. It was still there by midafternoon, drifting on the thermals over the mostly depopulated National Mall, wheeling occasionally past the window in the hallway outside the office where the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, sat on the 20th day of what would soon become the longest government shutdown in American history.That morning, Jan. 10, Washington’s principal chaos agent, the president of the United States, had given a typically accusatory and free-associative news conference on the White House lawn, reiterating his demand for $5 billion in funding for a wall along the Mexican border and his intention to continue the shutdown without it. Then he decamped to the border for some photo ops with Customs and Border Protection officials. Republican senators spent the lunch hour shuttling back and forth between Vice President Mike Pence and McConnell, sequestered in different quarters on the Capitol’s second floor. Now the last speeches of the day were being made, the reporters had mostly gone and McConnell sat in his office, reciting an unfamiliar tale: that of his own powerlessness.“I’ve been in the meetings,” McConnell, dressed in a pinstripe suit and a banker collar, said. “It’s just that I don’t have the votes that can consummate the deal.” Those votes could come only at the behest of Trump or the new House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, he insisted — and, McConnell continued, “it seems to me the principals, the only people who can make this deal, as of the moment we’re having this discussion, seem to both think they have a winning hand.”McConnell went through the motions of fully blaming Pelosi, as he did on the Senate floor that morning, displaying a poster with two identical pictures of a Southern border wall, one labeled “PRES. OBAMA” and the other “PRES. TRUMP,” under a legend reading, “WHAT BORDER FENCING DO DEMOCRATS SUPPORT?” But he knew as well as anyone that he had in fact negotiated at least a temporary escape from the looming shutdown with Paul Ryan, then the House speaker, in December, which would have funded the government through February, before “the president, let’s just say, changed his mind,” Ryan told me this month, laughing ruefully. “I spoke to him and tried to get the plan back on track, but that just wasn’t in the cards. And here we are.”Or here McConnell was, at least: marooned in a newly divided Congress, trying hard to stay out of the light. “He’s been very quiet,” Dick Durbin, the Democratic minority whip, who was in recent shutdown-negotiation meetings with McConnell and the Democratic Senate leadership, told me that afternoon, “and has said repeatedly that he’s not going to call any bill that the president doesn’t approve of. And that has basically been the sum and substance of his contribution.”McConnell, who has represented Kentucky in the Senate for 34 years and, as of last June, is the longest-serving Republican leader in Senate history, is one of Washington’s most famously inexpressive creatures. “You’ve got to see the gears turning behind the eyes, because the mouth isn’t moving very much,” Ryan told me. Still, his statements about Trump during the 2016 campaign, as the future president gradually cowed into submission the party to which McConnell had dedicated his entire adult life, managed to simultaneously leave everything and nothing to the imagination. When McConnell endorsed Trump in May 2016, after the last of his plausible challengers collapsed, he did it with a terse written statement in which the gritting of teeth was practically audible: “I have committed to supporting the nominee chosen by Republican voters,” it read, “and Donald Trump, the presumptive nominee, is now on the verge of clinching that nomination.” Speaking to a reporter from USA Today later that month, the most enthusiastic vision McConnell would allow of a Trump presidency was that it “would be fine.”“It would be hard to find two people by personality, or any inclination, that are more diametrically opposed than the president and Senator McConnell,” says Roy Blunt, the Missouri senator who heads the Senate Republicans’ policy committee. “Senator McConnell, very careful and thoughtful about what he says, deeply studied in the history of the country and how the federal government works. The president would not be offended if he heard somebody say he did not spend his time becoming that well versed in those things.” When I asked Elaine Chao, who is Trump’s secretary of transportation and McConnell’s wife of 26 years, if Trump and McConnell liked each other, she was silent for a full four seconds before replying, “You’ll have to ask the president that, and you’ll have to ask the leader that.” When I did ask McConnell, all he said was, “Yeah, we get along fine.”[6 Takeaways from this Mitch McConnell profile.]All of this made it more remarkable that, by the fall of last year, McConnell had emerged as one of the few unambiguous winners of the Trump presidency to date. When I first spoke with him, this past November, he talked of the preceding two years with a faint air of mystified amusement at his own fortune: as if a minor meteor had streaked through the window of the majority leader’s office, narrowly missing his head before exploding against the two-century-old marble fireplace, and then also turned out to be filled with candy and hundred-dollar bills. “I think even though we’re pretty different in every way you can think of,” he told me, clearing his throat, “we’ve had a good sort of team effort here to accomplish as much as we can.”He was the Trump administration’s indispensable partner in seating two Supreme Court justices and 83 lower-court judges: a generational remaking of the courts that has made McConnell, “in my view, the most consequential majority leader, certainly, in modern history,” says Leonard Leo, the conservative legal activist who serves as executive vice president of the Federalist Society and as an adviser to the Trump administration on the court appointments. Shortly after the midterm elections, McConnell’s longtime adviser J. Scott Jennings described to me how McConnell had “taken on this role as the principal enabler of the Trump agenda,” and he meant it as a compliment. There had been an improbable synergy between the two men: the president who covets power but has little sense or discipline in wielding it, and the legislator who has often seemed to consider the skillful exercise of power an end unto itself.Two and a half months later, however, the bargain McConnell made stood in somewhat bleaker relief. Trump had fired his attorney general, Jeff Sessions. His secretary of defense, James Mattis, had resigned over disagreements with his foreign policy; his chief of staff, John Kelly, was now gone, too. For weeks there had been an accelerating drumbeat of Russia-related guilty pleas and filings from the special prosecutor Robert Mueller.The shutdown distilled the essence of McConnell’s position in Trump’s Washington: a man of institutions and establishments whose own legacy was now tied to that of a president who seems hellbent on burning both to the ground. On Jan. 9, he stood stone-faced alongside Trump in a Senate hallway as the president suggested he would get his wall money by declaring a national emergency. “I don’t think much of that idea,” McConnell told me the following day. “I hope he doesn’t go down that path.” Still, he admitted, “I’m perplexed as to how this ends.”When Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court on Oct. 6, after McConnell played a key role in ushering him through a month of arguments over and investigations into allegations of sexual assault, the scope of the majority leader’s influence on American governance snapped into focus. Before McConnell, the small handful of towering Senate majority leaders left their legacies behind in the legal code. Lyndon Johnson passed the first two modern Civil Rights Acts in 1957 and 1960; Mike Mansfield oversaw the third in 1964, and the construction of Johnson’s Great Society; Howard Baker passed Reagan’s tax overhauls that shaped future debates about financing government. All of these accomplishments contained within them a heroic, idealized image of the Senate itself: a chamber where men and women rose from their centuries-old desks to debate the very idea of America, negotiating their way to laws of sweeping import to the country.McConnell is the first majority leader whose career has been built on the assumption that the Senate that could produce the great legislative works of his predecessors is a thing of the past — a fact that itself owes a great deal to McConnell. As minority and then majority leader during Barack Obama’s presidency, he fashioned himself as the essential impediment to Obama’s vision of a sequel to the Great Society, using tactics that were once the province of Senate factions as a strategic blueprint for the entire Republican caucus.Democrats, under the current minority leader, Chuck Schumer, have tried to use McConnell’s own playbook against him and Trump, but to lesser effect. This is in part because McConnell has expended less time and effort than previous Senate leaders on the legislative process that so bogged down Obama’s agenda and more on the Senate’s comparatively difficult-to-obstruct business of approving executive appointments. The unprecedented number of conservative-approved judicial nominees McConnell has waved through the Senate — a process for which he laid the groundwork before Trump was elected — stands to shift much of the burden of conservative policymaking away from an increasingly paralyzed Senate. In the coming years, battles over voting rights, health care, abortion, regulation and campaign finance, among other areas, are less likely to be decided in Congress than in the nation’s courthouses. In effect, McConnell has become a master of the Senate by figuring out how to route the Republican agenda around it.When I first approached McConnell’s office about interviewing him to discuss this legacy, shortly after the Kavanaugh confirmation, he agreed quickly, eventually obliging with several hours of conversations over the course of two months. He also encouraged a couple of dozen friends, colleagues, conservative pundits and members of Trump’s White House staff and cabinet to talk to me. The ways in which a subject tries to shape the reporting of his or her story — as canny subjects do — are revealing in their own right. During the interviews, there were the recurrent phrases: McConnell “can very quickly read the last page in the book.” He was “a listener by nature.” And in virtually every McConnell-authorized conversation, it was said that he was a “student of history.”He is — and also of his place in it. McConnell is atypically unconcerned, among senators, with his public profile. Even friends who attest to his dry wit and well-concealed sentimentality acknowledge a Man Without Qualities aspect to him: “He isn’t a jokester,” says Slade Gorton, the former Republican senator from Washington State and an old friend of McConnell’s. “He isn’t a party guy. He’s just — there. He’s just a fact of life.” Like a spy or a pinto bean, McConnell has used this blankness to his advantage, made it a carrier for designs greater than himself. His ascent in Republican politics came through his willingness to be the face of party prerogatives — fighting against campaign-finance reform during the Clinton and Bush presidencies, impeding a then-popular president’s agenda during Obama’s — that were distasteful to the general public, his shrugging willingness to play a villain when a villain was required.But beneath this unconcern is a different kind of self-regard, a sense of himself as a historical figure in waiting. In his first Senate race, his campaign paid for a rare two-minute TV commercial tracing the arc of his life and work at a time when his elected career consisted of two terms as the judge-executive — a county-level mayor, essentially — of Jefferson County, Kentucky. When he was named Senate majority leader in 2014, and The Louisville Courier-Journal described him as the third from Kentucky, his staff called the paper, insisting he was the second and demanding a correction. (Earle Clements only filled in briefly for Lyndon Johnson after his heart attack.) At the McConnell Center that McConnell founded at the University of Louisville, his alma mater, there is an exact replica of the mahogany desk McConnell used as a junior senator, which was once occupied by Henry Clay, a fellow Kentuckian and one of the heroes of the 19th-century Senate, who engineered the Missouri Compromise. There is a bronze statue of Clay standing at the desk, but the brass nameplate on the desktop says “Mr. McConnell.”But the particular way in which McConnell has always conceived of his own historicity is significant and unusual among contemporary Republicans. The Tea Partyers have their Mel Gibson-movie fantasies, the Trumpists their Pinochet-meets-“Die Hard” pastiches. But McConnell aspires to be not the bloody and maybe tragic hero in a revolutionary drama but one among a short list of undisputed masters of the machinery of American government, both essential to and dwarfed by the history of this machinery. Notably, the political philosopher he cites to the near exclusion of all others is Edmund Burke, the 18th-century Irish writer and Whig politician who essayed trenchantly against the French Revolution, and whose influence on 21st-century Republican politics you would have to squint very hard to make out.This vision is also unmistakably senatorial. McConnell recognized his future in politics by high school and narrowed his ambitions to the upper chamber by the time he graduated from college; on his law-school applications, according to his authorized biographer, John David Dyche, one of his professors wrote that McConnell ‘‘will be a U.S. Senator.” “I was running for the Senate in ’84 from the moment I was sworn in as county judge on Jan. 1, 1978,” McConnell once said — and he has never aspired to anything outside it. “I think most senators look in the mirror and think they hear ‘Hail to the Chief’ in the background,” Terry Carmack, who has worked for McConnell on and off since his first Senate campaign, told me. “But he always wanted to be in the Senate.” And from early in his Senate career, McConnell later wrote, “I wanted to one day hold a leadership position in my party, helping to call the plays and not just run them.”The Senate majority leader wields an elusive kind of power. The position, which dates back to the 1920s, is as paradoxical as the institution, which is given the authority to make great changes but also given as many tools to impede those changes as to enact them. To the Senate’s defenders, this is the “cooling saucer” of George Washington’s probably apocryphal explanation; to its detractors, it is more like an unreleasable parking brake on progress, never truly succeeding at holding back the future but ensuring that the country’s arrival at it will be as delayed and frictional as possible. At the turn of the 20th century, the Senate proved ineffectual in regulating railroads and banking. It failed to grasp the severity of the Depression until Americans had endured its hardships for years, offering only the meekest of remedies until Franklin D. Roosevelt forced lawmakers to do otherwise. Isolationists in the chamber impeded efforts to check Adolf Hitler’s advance in Europe; Southern conservatives were effective enough at delaying legislative action on civil rights to prompt the oft-quoted observation of William S. White, The Times’s congressional correspondent in the 1950s, that the Senate was “the South’s unending revenge upon the North for Gettysburg.”This began to change under the leadership of Lyndon Johnson in the late 1950s, but especially under Mike Mansfield, the Montana Democrat who served as majority leader from 1961 to 1977, longer than anyone before or since. Though he enjoys a lesser profile than Johnson, Mansfield is more admired within the Senate by Democrats and Republicans alike, as a magnanimous and gentlemanly conductor of the upper chamber’s fractious orchestra. “He treated everyone alike, without regard to politics or seniority,” Ted Stevens, the Republican senator from Alaska, once said. It was on Mansfield’s watch that the Senate passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, enacted Medicare, forced the resignation of Nixon without conviction and passed an array of post-Watergate reforms to the government and the Senate itself. Senators talk about Mansfield the way jazz musicians talk about Charlie Parker: He is the figure whose accomplishments they are doomed to be judged against forever, even as the context in which those accomplishments were possible recedes irretrievably into the past.McConnell first arrived in the Senate in what was arguably the most momentous year of the Mansfield era, 1964, as an intern for John Sherman Cooper. A moderate-to-liberal Republican, Cooper was then helping round up Republican votes for what would become the Civil Rights Act. McConnell, who supported civil rights as a college student, has spoken reverently of attending the signing ceremony for the Voting Rights Act in the Capitol Rotunda, at Cooper’s invitation, the following year. In his telling, it remains the platonic ideal of legislation, passed with the support of majorities of both parties.“I greatly admired Mansfield,” McConnell told me. “Mansfield did have a big advantage, however: a massive majority of his own party.” The Montana senator presided at the peak of a remarkable run of Democratic hegemony in the Senate, which the party had by then controlled for all but four years since the Depression. It was also an age of emerging liberalism within the Democratic ranks; the Southern conservatives who had been the gravitational center of the party, blocking anti-lynching and civil rights legislation in the Senate since the 1920s, were in retreat, a diminished force in the Democratic Senate caucus and not yet at home among the Republicans.In 1976, Mansfield’s last year in the senate, Ronald Reagan ran for president for the second time, losing the nomination to the sitting president, Gerald Ford. But Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in November, and by then the conservatives who favored Reagan’s candidacy had begun claiming the commanding heights of the Republican Party. They had also begun drawing in the white voters and politicians in the South and the Northern suburbs who, post-civil rights, were increasingly alienated from the Democratic Party. In 1980, Reagan won on the strength of these votes, and Republicans, for the first time since Eisenhower, captured the Senate. Neither party has held it for more than eight consecutive years since.In her 2016 book, “Insecure Majorities,” the University of Maryland political scientist Frances E. Lee argues that the political trends that came to a head in the 1980 election “changed the political calculations of members of Congress in a fundamental way.” In the old, asymmetrical Senate, Republicans had an incentive to behave as John Sherman Cooper did; stuck in a terminal minority party, their only hope of influence was to work with Democrats to make policy. Once every election came to promise the prospect of a change in power, however, everything lawmakers did came to be seen through the lens of the next election — and the ascendant congressional figures of the era, like Newt Gingrich, were necessarily the ones who most unwaveringly saw it that way. “After 1980,” Lee writes, “forces favoring more confrontation steadily gained advantage.”“I think there’s a lot to that,” McConnell said, when I described Lee’s thesis. He had himself invoked the good old days of Mansfield’s Senate when he took over as majority leader in 2015. But “most of the ‘good old days’ that are referred to,” he told me, “are days of Democratic dominance, with largely Democratic outcomes. People only tend to get offended when conservatism rises and you start getting different outcomes.”McConnell was elected to the Senate in 1984, to the seat that had once been Cooper’s. He was still struggling to distinguish himself midway through his first term when the Democratic senators Robert Byrd of West Virginia and David Boren of Oklahoma proposed a bill that would impose contribution and spending limits on political campaigns. McConnell had briefly advocated for campaign-finance reform at the outset of his career but soon reversed himself on the issue, eventually adopting a position that blended a constitutional free-speech argument with a frank acknowledgment of practical expediency: “I never would have been able to win my race,” he later wrote of his first Senate election, as a near-unknown running in a majority Democratic state, “if there had been a limit on the amount of money I could raise and spend.”McConnell proposed his own bill that would ban direct contributions from political-action committees to congressional candidates, a deliberately limited reform that would give Republicans cover to oppose the more sweeping changes Byrd and Boren were proposing. The Democratic bill died in the face of Republican opposition three months later.For more than a decade, McConnell fought one campaign-finance bill after another. Once the Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold and the Arizona Republican John McCain began their effort, in the mid-1990s, to pass the bipartisan legislation limiting the role of soft money in politics that now informally bears their name, McConnell became the primary strategist in the fight against it, in which he had the tacit support of most of the Republican Senate conference. It was the formative legislative battle of his career.“I’ve rarely seen a more determined and skilled tactician,” Feingold told me. McConnell was vilified by the major newspaper opinion pages and leaned into the role, becoming a regular presence on the Sunday-morning talk-show circuit. When reform advocates started referring to him as Darth Vader, he appeared at a news conference with a toy light saber. When he was in the hospital in 2003, recovering from triple heart-bypass surgery, Feingold sent him a note that read, “I miss my Darth Vader.”From the outset, McConnell understood two essential aspects of the campaign-finance-reform debate. The first was that senators — certainly his Republican colleagues and, more quietly, many Democrats — were more interested in being seen as supporting campaign-finance reform than actually enacting it. The second was that the popularity of the reform proposals among the public, while real, was also shallow, unlikely to factor in many constituents’ votes. For a junior senator like McConnell, volunteering to play “spear catcher,” as he put it, on campaign finance was likely to cost him little more than bad press and earn him the gratitude of his caucus and political capital within it. “I don’t know whether they will ever build a monument to the senator from Kentucky,” McConnell’s colleague Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican, later said in a floor speech, “but he is already memorialized in my heart. I will never forget the fight he has made.”The campaign-finance battle taught McConnell the tactics that would make him a virtuoso obstructionist during the Obama years. “His point of view was that, first of all, we’re going to have to filibuster this; we don’t have Democrats who are going to help us,” says Steven Law, the president and chief executive of the Senate Leadership Fund super PAC and a member of McConnell’s staff at the time. “And if at all possible, we need to hold every member of the caucus together. If there’s any crack in it, it will give license for others to jump ship.” McConnell and Law consulted Senate parliamentarians on obscure procedural maneuvers that could expand McConnell’s opportunities to block legislation with the filibuster — the ability of even a single senator to delay a vote as long as he or she can physically continue speaking on the Senate floor — which he did in September 1994, killing a major campaign-finance bill co-sponsored by George Mitchell, then the Democratic majority leader.Tom Foley, the Democratic House speaker at the time, called it “the worst case of obstruction by filibuster by any party that I’ve ever seen in my 30 years in Congress.” Mitchell condemned McConnell and his allies on the Senate floor. “The very people who want to keep this system which brings the institution of Congress into such disrepute are trying to be the beneficiaries of that disrepute,” he said — to “tear down the institution so that we can inherit the rubble.”“If there’s any power in this job, really,” McConnell likes to say, “it’s the power to schedule, to decide what you’re going to do or not do.” The converse of this, McConnell learned even before becoming minority leader in 2007, is also true: The greatest leverage the minority has is the ability to complicate the schedule. Drawing out deliberations can cripple the Senate, which is in session for only 34 weeks or so each year, most of which, in practice, are only four working days.The bluntest instrument senators in the minority have to wield to this end is the filibuster or, more often, the threat of it. To measure this kind of obstruction, political scientists often use cloture filings, which are the formal procedures for cutting off Senate debate to end or preclude a filibuster. When people try to quantify McConnell’s influence as minority leader in the Obama years, when his command of obstructive techniques made him arguably the most important Republican in Washington, they often point to the spike in cloture filings. The number of such filings, which had gradually crept upward beginning in the 1970s, jumped significantly in McConnell’s first Congress as minority leader in 2007 and 2008, to 112, nearly twice the highest previous number. They remained historically high throughout Obama’s first term and then nearly doubled again by the end of 2014.But McConnell also slowed down the process in more subtle ways, particularly in his yearlong effort to derail the Affordable Care Act, which made him once again the public face of a particularly unapologetic form of Republican intransigence. “He said, ‘Our strategy is to delay this sucker as long as we possibly can, and the longer we delay it the worse the president looks: Why can’t he get it done? He’s got 60 votes?’ ” Bob Bennett, the late Utah Republican senator and a friend of McConnell’s, said in Alec MacGillis’s 2014 McConnell biography, “The Cynic.” Senate committee Democrats would negotiate policy particulars for months with their Republican colleagues only to see the Republicans’ votes evaporate at the end of the process. McConnell’s staff, meanwhile, battered the bill relentlessly in public, publicizing the sweetheart accommodations Democratic senators were receiving for their votes. By the time Obamacare passed in March 2010, according to a CNN poll, only 39 percent of the country viewed it favorably, and McConnell had mostly run out the clock: There were less than eight months left, by then, until the midterm elections in which Republicans would take the House.Legislation is one of the Senate’s core responsibilities; the other is confirming executive-branch appointments, such as administration officials and judges. By custom, the Senate had previously approved district-court judge nominations in groups, in the interest of efficiency. Under McConnell’s leadership, Republicans insisted on confirming Obama’s nominations individually, drawing out the process enough that, by the summer of 2010, there were 99 vacancies on the federal bench and 40 “judicial emergencies” had been declared by overburdened courts.When Senate Republicans are blamed for obstruction, they are quick to point out that Democrats, when they were in the minority during most of George W. Bush’s presidency, filibustered judicial nominees, too — less frequently than McConnell, but often enough that Republicans had considered the “nuclear option”: getting rid of the filibuster for judicial matters, which would allow judges to be confirmed on a simple majority vote. But as McConnell escalated the use of filibusters, it was Harry Reid, then the majority leader, who finally decided to get rid of them for lower-court appointees in 2013.McConnell was furious. Facing Reid on the Senate floor, he declared that “our friend the majority leader is going to be remembered as the worst leader here ever.” McConnell used other procedural moves to gum up Obama’s subsequent executive nominations, and by August 2014, the backlog stretched to more than 100 appointees. After McConnell became majority leader, following that November’s elections, judicial nominations all but ground to a halt, with McConnell confirming barely a quarter of Obama’s court picks. “I believe that Mitch McConnell has ruined the Senate,” Reid, who retired in 2017, now says. “I do not believe the Senate, for the next generation or two, will be the Senate I was there for. It’s gone. The old Senate is gone.”“They’ve always sort of made the argument that somehow I started all this,” McConnell told me. “We didn’t.” Still, when McConnell inveighs now against Schumer’s efforts to block Trump’s executive-branch appointments, it is with the barely suppressed pride of an artist looking upon what seems to him a pale imitation of his finest work. “Far be it from me to complain about obstruction,” he told me, permitting himself a chuckle. “But generally, when I’ve been involved in obstruction, there was a point to it.”On Jan. 30, 2016, McConnell was at the Capital Hilton, attending the Alfalfa Club’s annual dinner, when he found himself sitting next to Anthony Kennedy, the Supreme Court justice. “We were talking about collegiality,” McConnell recalls. “I always say, to students in particular, ‘I know you all think we all hate each other, but we haven’t had a single incident where a congressman from South Carolina came over to the Senate and almost beat to death a senator from Massachusetts’ ” — an allusion to the infamous May 1856 episode in which the pro-slavery Democratic congressman Preston Brooks stormed across the Capitol and badly beat Charles Sumner, an abolitionist Republican senator, with a walking cane, a nation-dividing scandal that presaged the Civil War.As it happened, Kennedy had just been reading “The Caning,” Stephen Puleo’s 2012 book about the incident. The following week, he sent a copy to McConnell, with a letter enclosed. “There are times,” Kennedy wrote in the letter, “when an isolated episode is a portent of an event which will change the course of history. In this case, that episode took place on the floor of the Senate.”A week and a half later, Kennedy’s colleague Antonin Scalia was on a quail-hunting trip in Texas when he died in his sleep. “Very sad about losing Nino, as I’m sure you are,” McConnell later wrote back to Kennedy. News of Scalia’s death first reached him on his iPhone at the airport in St. Thomas, in the Virgin Islands, where he and Chao had just begun a vacation. At the hotel, Chao recalls, McConnell sat quietly and watched the news on the TV. Within an hour, he had come to a decision: He would use his power as majority leader to block President Obama from filling Scalia’s seat.A flurry of phone calls ensued. Leonard Leo, of the Federalist Society, whose advice on judicial matters wields unparalleled influence among Republican politicians, told McConnell that he was already hearing from some of the half dozen Republican presidential candidates wondering what to say at the televised debate that night. Josh Holmes, a campaign strategist close to McConnell, warned him that Ted Cruz, the senator from Texas, was likely to seize the issue of blockading Scalia’s seat in the debate, which he feared would make it harder to rally support for the idea. Cruz is unpopular with many of his Republican colleagues, including McConnell, and “if the first idea of it came from Ted Cruz,” Holmes told me, “it was an assurance that you were going to lose half your conference.”About an hour after Scalia’s death was confirmed, McConnell’s office issued a statement: “The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.” The decision was regarded, by McConnell’s allies and enemies alike, as the summation of his life’s work, encapsulating what they most admire or despise about him: a final, crowning act of audacious obstruction. “I felt that Merrick Garland deserved a hearing, a debate, a floor vote, and if Republicans felt he should be voted down, they could do so,” Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine, told me. But virtually every other Republican senator supported the decision.At the presidential debate that night, when the moderator, CBS’s John Dickerson, raised the question of what should be done with the Scalia seat, one candidate gave a curiously specific answer: “We could have a Diane Sykes, or you could have a Bill Pryor, we have some fantastic people,” Donald Trump said. These names were a pleasant surprise to conservative legal activists, who had long considered both Sykes and Pryor to be ideal choices for the Supreme Court. The names were less of a surprise to Trump’s campaign counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, who spoke to Trump earlier that day.McGahn was a specialist in election law, an expertise that had placed him on the same side of the previous decade’s campaign-finance battles as McConnell. Even as McConnell was fighting against McCain-Feingold on the Senate floor, the senator was making contingency plans to continue his fight by other means if necessary. By the time the law passed, in 2002, he had already assembled a legal team to challenge it in the Supreme Court. When the court ruled against him late the following year, his attention shifted to the Federal Election Commission, the government agency tasked with enforcing campaign-finance laws. According to Meredith McGehee, a veteran campaign-finance-reform lobbyist who is now executive director of the bipartisan campaign-finance-reform advocacy group Issue One, “McConnell understood pretty quickly, faster than other folks, that you can have the best laws on the books, but if there’s no law enforcement, it doesn’t matter.”The Federal Election Commission’s six commissioners, three Republicans and three Democrats, are typically picked by the Senate party leaders. Holmes, who was McConnell’s chief of staff, told me that of all the government agencies for which McConnell, as the Senate Republican leader, selected and vetted potential appointees, “the one that I know of where McConnell himself interviewed every single person was the F.E.C.” When McGahn — who, as general counsel for the National Republican Congressional Committee, fought against McCain-Feingold — was nominated to the commission in 2008, McGahn told me, “McConnell was very supportive every step of the way.”McGahn proved to be a transformative figure at the commission. “There had been other commissioners who were ideologically aligned with McConnell,” McGehee said, but “McGahn was not just an ideologue. He was a skilled knife-fighter.” During McGahn’s tenure, which ended in 2013, enforcement at the F.E.C. notably declined. According to an analysis by the Center for Public Integrity, fines assessed by the F.E.C. fell to less than $1 million in 2012 from more than $6.7 million in 2006.When McGahn’s services were recommended to Trump by his deputy campaign manager, David Bossie, it was ostensibly for his election-law experience. But McGahn, a dedicated member of the Federalist Society, saw another opportunity in the campaign. Shortly after news of Scalia’s death surfaced, Trump called him on the phone to discuss what he should say at that night’s debate. Watching the candidate rattle off names he had given him earlier that day, McGahn recalled in a speech at a Federalist Society dinner last year, “was really the beginning of the idea of a list.”The list of Federalist Society-approved judges that Trump would consider appointing to the Supreme Court, which McGahn and Leo drafted, would be one of Trump’s principal selling points to conservatives and also to McConnell, who had by then not only held open Scalia’s Supreme Court seat, but also 88 district and 17 circuit-court seats, in hopes that a Republican president would be in office in 2017. Leonard Leo recalls speaking with McConnell shortly before the senator met with Trump in the spring on 2016. McConnell, Leo told me, said he “was going to stress with him that the judges’ enterprise was extremely important.”From August onward, McConnell and McGahn talked periodically. The conversations “were around judges,” one of McConnell’s senior staff members told me. “How do we handle them? How do we prioritize them? Beyond the Supreme Court, in the circuits, how do we get a number of them into the system early, and how can we start to process them early?”By that month, the Central Intelligence Agency had discovered evidence that Russia had interfered in the presidential campaign, apparently with the aim of disrupting Hillary Clinton’s candidacy, and had possibly made contact with representatives of the Trump campaign. The agency approached congressional leaders to discuss the findings. According to Denis McDonough, Obama’s chief of staff at the time, Harry Reid urged the Obama administration to go public with the information. But the administration, chary of appearing to politicize intelligence, refused to do so unless both congressional Republican leaders consented. In early September, McConnell and Reid along with Ryan and Pelosi were briefed at the White House and asked by Obama to issue a joint statement to state election officials.Ryan and his chief of staff at the time wrote and circulated a statement. “We thought it was really a good sign that the speaker took the pen and drafted the statement,” McDonough told me. “What happened then was, everybody signed off except Senator McConnell.” McConnell has said his concerns had to do with wording regarding election infrastructure. McDonough says there were other substantial disagreements but declined to elaborate on what they were. Ryan says he took McConnell’s side in the dispute. The process of drafting the statement was drawn out for several weeks, “to the consternation and frustration of everybody — to include the speaker of the House,” McDonough says. “At the time, the speaker evinced to me considerable frustration.”On Sept. 28, all four congressional leaders released a letter warning state election officials of potential interference from foreign actors, which avoided specific mention of Russia’s role. Both Ryan and McConnell have said they were not asked to mention Russia. Several Obama administration officials, however, including McDonough and James R. Clapper Jr., Obama’s director of national intelligence, have retrospectively blamed McConnell, and sometimes Ryan, for “watering down,” as McDonough put it in an NBC interview, the warning. “To their everlasting shame, the leaders — McConnell, Ryan — refused” to make more information public, James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, said in an interview at the 92nd Street Y in December. “I think they’re going to have a hard time explaining that to history.”When I repeated Comey’s statement to McConnell, he bristled. “Well, the Obama administration screwed up the election and then started pointing the finger at everybody else,” he said. I reminded him that Comey, like McDonough and Clapper, had blamed him very specifically. “They were trying to blame everybody else but themselves,” he said again. “Ryan and I did what we thought was appropriate.”On Oct. 7, 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and Clapper’s office put out a joint statement, acknowledging for the first time that the intelligence community was “confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations.” But within hours, the news was swamped by the publication by The Washington Post of a video of Trump on the set of “Access Hollywood,” in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women. After the tape was released, Ryan released a statement saying he was “sickened” by Trump’s comments, canceled a campaign appearance with him and told his fellow Republican House candidates on a conference call that he would no longer defend Trump.But McConnell hesitated. “I talked to him at the time,” Holmes, the strategist, told me, “and he said, ‘Do you see any evidence that it would make any difference for candidates to distance themselves?’ ” McConnell called several members of his caucus who were in tight re-election races, among them Roy Blunt of Missouri. “I said, ‘Look, I’m doing all kinds of events today,’ ” Blunt recalls. “ ‘I’m not hearing that voters, at least who speak to me, are willing to abandon our nominee over this clip. So I’m sticking right where I am.’ ”McConnell put out a statement saying “these comments are repugnant, and unacceptable in any circumstance” and calling on Trump to apologize, but he did nothing to separate his party’s Senate candidates from Trump. Early in the campaign, The Times reported, he had planned for a worst-case scenario in which McConnell and his Senate candidates, colleagues recalled him saying at the time, would “drop him like a hot rock.” But in the last weeks of the campaign, he had come to think that severing red-state candidates from the party’s nominee could hurt them on Election Day.He sat up that night at the National Republican Senatorial Committee headquarters, watching the news, awaiting confirmation of what he imagined would be his fate: the end of a brief tenure in the majority-leader perch he had worked so long to reach. “I thought we were going to lose the Senate,” McConnell told me. “By 11 o’clock, we’d held the Senate. And I thought, No chance Trump’s going to get it. No chance. And by 1 or 2 o’clock in the morning — my God.”But however unexpected Trump’s victory might have been to McConnell at the time, he has retrospectively — and plausibly — claimed credit for it. He was quick to point out that Trump won nearly as many registered Republicans as Mitt Romney did in 2012, and one exit poll showed that “the single biggest issue bringing them home,” he said, was the Supreme Court seat he had held open. “It was a real masterstroke, in my opinion, to keep that seat open in 2016,” Tom Cotton, the Republican senator from Arkansas, told me. “I doubt Donald Trump would have won if that seat was not open.”The seat, which would be filled a year later by Trump’s nominee, Neil Gorsuch, would be the centerpiece of McConnell’s broader court-remaking project — a bridge from his obstructionist past to his next act. “A day or two after the election, I was in the car with him,” Brian McGuire, at the time McConnell’s chief of staff, told me, “and he said, ‘We are going to move judges like they are on a conveyor belt.’ ”A week after the election, McConnell called McGahn to begin strategizing. They would centralize the judicial-appointments process in McGahn’s office, a departure from normal White House practice. “It was really impressive to watch him in action,” McGahn said of McConnell. “His knowledge of the Senate, its history and its role, it helped crystallize my thinking on the best approach to not just nominating but getting people confirmed.”McConnell, who had kept so many of Obama’s nominations from the bench, was busy mapping out a strategy to avoid the fate he had so recently meted out. He would take advantage of Harry Reid’s decision to eliminate the filibuster for lower-court judicial nominees and, when Senate Democrats tried to block Neil Gorsuch’s appointment, would lead Republicans in voting to extend it to the Supreme Court. McConnell instructed Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, that they were going to diminish the weight they assigned to “blue slips,” a procedural formality that allowed home-state senators, even from the minority party, an opportunity to say whether or not a judicial nominee should receive a hearing on the Judiciary Committee. Under recent committee chairpeople, this had been treated as an informal veto power, one that McConnell’s Republicans had used to great effect in the minority in the Obama years. Under the new interpretation, that would no longer be the case for circuit-court judges. And McConnell would prioritize judicial nominations before other kinds of nominations on the Senate schedule and fill the more influential circuit courts first.It was a sort of skunk works, running with the ostensible blessing of a president who only rarely seemed to remember that it was running at all. “I think that years from now, people will look back and say that the transformation of the judicial branch was one of this administration’s greatest achievements,” Marc Short, who was Trump’s legislative director at the time, told me. “But I candidly don’t feel like that’s still fully felt internally.” Trump and his high-profile advisers, like Stephen K. Bannon — an avowed nemesis of McConnell, whom he viewed as the personification of the Republican establishment — preferred to speak of grand legislative visions, none of which would come to pass: a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill, the repeal of Obamacare and its replacement with “something great,” a government-gutting budget, the long-promised border wall.When the Republicans’ seven-year crusade to dismantle Obamacare effectively ran aground in the Senate the following July, it was McConnell whom Trump blamed for the bill’s failure. After McConnell, speaking at a Rotary Club event in Kentucky, chided Trump for his inexperience and high hopes — “I think he had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process,” McConnell said — Trump called him in a rage, then took to Twitter: “Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn’t get it done.” A reporter asked Trump that day if McConnell should step down. “If he doesn’t get repeal and replace done,” the president replied, “and if he doesn’t get taxes done, meaning cuts and reform, and if he doesn’t get a very easy one to get done, infrastructure, if he doesn’t get that done, then you can ask me that question.”The abuse continued intermittently throughout the Senate’s August recess, in which McConnell also criticized Trump’s statements in the wake of the Charlottesville white supremacist rally. “There are no good neo-Nazis,” McConnell said in a statement. Finally, in October, McConnell and Trump sat down over lunch to clear the air. “I was trying to remind him of the significance of some of the things that had been happening,” McConnell told me. “Because he was in a real downer over the loss of Obamacare. And we all were. I understood that. But I think he was concluding, too soon, that it wasn’t going to be a good Congress.”McConnell walked Trump through the judicial appointments that he and McGahn had been moving through the Senate. As they were speaking, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Trump’s spokeswoman, came in to tell Trump that he was due at a news conference in the Rose Garden.The news conference marked Trump’s first acknowledgment of what McConnell and McGahn had been quietly doing for months — an achievement that seemed to just then dawn on him. “Something that people aren’t talking about is how many judges we’ve had approved, whether it be the court of appeals, circuit judges, whether it be district judges,” Trump said.McConnell seemed to realize something, too: That his spare communication style was not the best way of dealing with this particular president. He now speaks to Trump several times a week. “I think that one of the things that the leader has done a better job of over time,” Billy Piper, McConnell’s chief of staff until 2011, told me, “is understanding that that’s an important part of a positive relationship with the president: direct and frequent communications, so that the president, you know, is hearing directly what’s going on and how his agenda’s being advanced, as opposed to getting it through third parties or news reports.” He added, “That’s probably not McConnell’s intuitive nature.”The day before the midterm elections, McConnell spoke at a local Republican Party event in the rolling hill country on the periphery of Bowling Green, Ky. He arrived dressed like a retiree on a birding cruise, a fleece vest over a plaid shirt, baggy jeans and brown suede Rockports. He made his way to the front of the room, as Ryan Quarles, a former intern of McConnell’s who is now the agriculture commissioner of Kentucky, bounded onto the low stage and took the microphone. “Two years ago, this country changed,” Quarles said. “And I have a question for you: Are you better off than you were two years ago?” Standing on stage right, McConnell, who was better off than he was two years ago, smiled almost imperceptibly, and as the crowd cheered, he allowed himself a couple of gentle golf claps.“You watched the mother of all fights last month,” McConnell told the crowd when it was his turn to speak. “Brett Kavanaugh is going to be a great Supreme Court justice for a very long time. They tried everything in the book, but I think we proved two things, my friends: Presumption of innocence still applies in America, and the Republican Senate is not going to be intimidated by an angry mob!” McConnell proceeded to offer a summary of his last two years in office: the judges appointed, the taxes cut, the regulations rolled back. It was only later, after Rand Paul — the other senator from Kentucky — delivered a spirited tribute to the president, that I realized McConnell had barely mentioned him, uttering the name “Trump” just once in his nine-minute speech.“It’s a statement of the obvious that Donald Trump and I are very different,” he told me several weeks later, after the election. Still, he said, “I think we’ve both focused on the things we agree on and not some of our personality differences.” He went on: “When there have been policy areas that I think require some reinforcement, I’ve done it, for example, his skepticism about NATO,” and other issues. “On a whole lot of other things that the president likes to talk about, I just choose not to engage in that. I don’t think it’s my job to. Again, I’m going to do everything I can to maximize chances of success during this opportunity we’ve been given, which comes to an end in a month. Because, you know, when Pelosi and I talked to each other, we were both kind of struggling to think of things we might work on together.” He laughed. “I mean, it’s just sort of not a natural thing.”The remaking of the judiciary is one of the few aspects of the Republican agenda that is unlikely to be slowed down by November’s congressional elections, which gave the Democrats a decisive majority in the House of Representatives, but also expanded the Republican majority that McConnell leads in the Senate by two seats. This means less time wasted on quixotic legislative efforts, like the Obamacare repeal effort, and more time for appointments.One of the bittersweet facts of the Senate majority leaders’ job is that their legacies are rarely perceived by the broader public as their own. Mike Mansfield may have played a central role in negotiating the passage of the Civil Rights Act, but most people who are not Senate history buffs — that is, most people — remember it as Lyndon Johnson’s triumph. Harry Reid may have seen the Affordable Care Act through the Senate, but nobody calls the law Reidcare. McConnell’s portrait no doubt will hang somewhere in the Capitol; perhaps he will get his name on a room like Mansfield, a balcony like Bob Dole. But for everyone outside the tribe of the Senate, it is likely that when McConnell’s remaking of the judiciary is remembered, he will be a figure off to the side, perhaps slightly out of focus, in a photograph of Donald Trump.When I asked McConnell how he felt about his legacy and Trump’s being so closely linked, he rejected the premise. “I don’t think so,” he said. “I think the most consequential call I made was before President Trump came to office.” I asked what he meant. “The decision not to fill the Scalia vacancy,” he said. “I think that’s the most consequential thing I’ve ever done.”But what about the judicial appointments? I asked. Surely those would be remembered as a partnership between him and Trump.“Well, that’s fine,” McConnell said. “Because he’s done what I thought ought to be done.” Judges, regulations, taxes. “If Marco Rubio had been president, we’d have done it. If Jeb Bush had been president, we’d have done it. I say that not to take anything away from President Trump, but he took good advice on all three of those areas that are —” he slowed down for emphasis — “traditional. Republican. Positions.”After the Kavanaugh confirmation, Christopher R. Browning, the eminent historian of Nazi Germany, wrote an essay for The New York Review of Books revisiting the story of Paul von Hindenburg, the feckless German president of the Weimar era. In an effort to shore up his faltering conservative coalition, and contain the German left, Hindenburg allied with and installed as chancellor Adolf Hitler, a man he considered a lunatic but a manageable one. “If the U.S. has someone whom historians will look back on as the gravedigger of American democracy” as von Hindenburg was to the Weimar Republic, Browning wrote, “it is Mitch McConnell. ... Like Hitler’s conservative allies, McConnell and the Republicans have prided themselves on the early returns on their investment in Trump.” It was the eternal pragmatist’s delusion: The assumption that politics ultimately belongs to them, and not to the demagogues and revolutionaries who so often pull them along in their wake.“I think to expect Republican elected officials not to try to achieve as much as they possibly can, that they’ve always been for, out of pique over presidential behavior, is nonsense,” McConnell said when I read him what Browning had written. “He got elected. And we’ve been able, as a result of that, to achieve things like tax reform. It had been sitting there undone for 30 years. We’ve discussed ad nauseam the courts. A lot of deregulatory activity that we think has contributed to a robust economy. So critics like that expect us all to just join them in a huff and do nothing? Really? I think my responsibility as the majority leader of the Senate, in a Republican administration, is to achieve as much as I can for the American people along the lines that I’ve believed in my entire life.”That, of course, had been Browning’s point; setting aside the particulars of the comparison, I asked, “Do you ever worry that with the record of success that you’ve had, that you’re strengthening the hand of a president who does seem, in some ways, very much inclined to do damage to institutions of American governance?”“Well, I mean, the ultimate check against any of this is the ballot box,” McConnell replied. “And one could argue, at least with regard to the House of Representatives last year, that there were plenty of people who wanted a midcourse correction.” The results of the election did not seem to surprise him. “The party has to be bigger than white men who didn’t graduate from college,” he told me late last year. “And you look at what happened to the House of Representatives. Look at the suburbs. It’s no secret, it’s right there to look at. We were losing women” — a chronic problem for the Republican Party, he acknowledged. “And that’s not a sustainable position, politically, if you want to be a competitive party.”It was a statement of gloom that, if you scratched off its outer layer, revealed a sort of sanguine optimism: A belief that the system was, ultimately, self-correcting. Whatever Trump had unleashed in the Republican Party, its damages would be visited upon the party, not the country, and they would be temporary. The demagogues would burn themselves out, and the pragmatists would rebuild upon the ashes.Shortly after he left office in January, I asked Paul Ryan if he and McConnell ever commiserated about having to deal with Trump. Ryan let out a long sigh. “Boy, I really want to answer that question,” he said. George Will, the Washington Post columnist, who has known McConnell for decades, told me: “He has never said anything in my hearing about Mr. Trump. It is, however, a safe inference that he knows he is dealing with a child.” In his recent public-speaking appearances, McConnell has often recommended “The Soul of America,” a book published last year by Jon Meacham: A tour of the political responses to social crises in American history and “a reminder that periods of public dispiritedness are not new and a reassurance that they are survivable.”In one of our conversations, I brought up the book. “What do you see as your role, the majority leader’s role, in a time of crisis?” I asked McConnell.“Well,” McConnell replied, “I think what I have to do, my goal, and depending upon what the numbers are, and what’s achievable, is always to get as right-of-center an outcome as possible.” He brought up the example of the Budget Control Act of 2011, which we had been discussing: a bill produced from a high-stakes negotiation between the White House and congressional Republicans in which McConnell, breaking with newly elected Tea Party hard-liners in the House, played deal maker, providing the Democrats with bipartisan cover for a necessary debt-limit increase while also securing cuts that Republicans had sought.“I mean, at the risk of sounding like I’m patting myself on the back, who would have ever thought with Barack Obama in the White House you could get something like the Budget Control Act in August of 2011, which actually drove down government spending for two years in a row?” McConnell said. “To me, given the numbers, and if you prefer America right of center, that’s my definition of success.” I was startled not just by his frankness but by the type of crisis that McConnell’s mind had gone to, which was not exactly the kind of worst-case scenario that was foremost on many minds during Trump’s presidency.Later, I put the same question to Paul Ryan: What did he think his role, and McConnell’s, was in a crisis? “First of all, I think the country’s strong and is going to be fine,” Ryan said, sounding very much like the youth basketball coach he now is, reassuring the parent of a 12-year-old who was lying at half-court clutching his knee. “And I think it is to preserve the institutions. The way I described it to my staff these last two years, when we had unified government, was, our job is to build the country’s resilience and its antibodies, so that it is stronger and better prepared for whatever comes its way. And then make sure that those institutional guardrails are upheld. Mueller wasn’t fired. There wasn’t a constitutional crisis.”I noticed that Ryan was speaking in the past tense now, as if this were already an era of American politics safely mothballed away in the closet of history. “There’s a lot of chatter, there’s a lot of tweeting, there’s a lot of all that,” he went on. “But institutionally, everything’s fine. You know, we didn’t impeach Rod Rosenstein, you know? We didn’t do things like that. A lot of chatter about it, but the institutions are there, they’re standing.”“Does Trump share your view, and McConnell’s view, of institutions?” I asked.“No,” Ryan said.The day after the midterm elections, Trump fired Jeff Sessions, the attorney general whose decision to recuse himself in the matter of appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Russian involvement in the 2016 election had always infuriated him. The following day, the Arizona Republican senator Jeff Flake co-sponsored a bill with Chris Coons, the Democratic senator from Delaware, protecting Robert Mueller’s investigation from presidential interference. McConnell has repeatedly avowed his support for Mueller’s investigation, but he refused to bring the bill up for a vote, and when I went to see him later that month, I asked him why.“It’s a futile gesture,” he told me — which, in the tightly controlled vocabulary of McConnell’s politics, is the gravest of insults. “Even if this bill were to pass the Senate,” he went on, “it wouldn’t pass the House. If it passed the House, it wouldn’t be signed by the president. I don’t have time for that kind of futile gesture, particularly when there’s no threat. It’s not going to happen.”When I spoke with Ryan, I asked if he and McConnell had planned for a scenario in which Trump decided to fire Robert Mueller.“Yes,” Ryan replied unhesitatingly.“What was the plan?” I asked.“I’ll just leave it at that,” he said. “Did we discuss it? Yes, we discussed it. Yes, we were prepared if that actually would have happened.” A minute later, he added: “I can answer that with a question: Has the guy been fired? No, he’s continuing on.” These were the proverbial adults in the room; they had this.But the problem was that the adults kept leaving the room. On Dec. 20, James Mattis, the defense secretary, quit after Trump abruptly announced that he was pulling outthe 2,000 United States troops deployed in Syria and 7,000 troops from Afghanistan. “My views on treating allies with respect and also being cleareyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held,” he wrote to Trump in his public resignation letter. “Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.”Interested in what McConnell would have to say about this, I texted his press secretary, David Popp, asking to speak with him that afternoon. Popp wrote back to say it was unlikely; they were in the thick of negotiations to stave off the government shutdown that was then looming.Six days later, I got a phone call from a Virginia area code. “Hello,” said the voice on the other end, “this is Jim Mattis. Mitch McConnell called and said you’re interested in talking to me. What can I do for you?”Mattis was genial and relaxed — distractingly so, given the circumstances. “I’m just kind of hanging out,” said the man who in three working days would be handing over the keys to the most lethal war-making apparatus on the planet, on the orders of a president with whom he had voiced irreconcilable differences about America’s place in the world. “You know, doing the usual stuff.”I had a lot of questions for Mattis: What was it about the Syria and Afghanistan withdrawals, among all of Trump’s foreign-policy and national-security decisions, that prompted his resignation? Was he concerned about Trump outsourcing the war in Afghanistan to Erik Prince and Blackwater, as Trump had reportedly considered? “I’d prefer not to talk about those,” he said of the troop withdrawals. “Let’s keep it focused on Senator McConnell and his leadership, which I, as you can tell, I leave Washington deeply appreciative of what he did for our military and for our families, and for our strategy going forward.”I asked if, in his opinion, there was a divergence in foreign-policy values between Republicans in Congress and the White House. “Well, I’d leave that for you to determine,” he said, before allowing himself what seemed like a hint: “Certainly, when foreign ministers of defense or foreign leaders visited and they asked who they should talk with, I always spoke about Leader McConnell, because he could reassure them.”I had been told to expect the call, but still, as we spoke, I was preoccupied with the question of why it was occurring. I hadn’t asked to speak with Mattis, specifically; a couple of weeks earlier, I asked Popp if there was anyone in the administration who might be able to shed light on McConnell’s relationship with Trump — the sort of request that usually yields a legislative-affairs director, maybe a deputy chief of staff.The weekend after Mattis tendered his resignation, Trump abruptly praised McConnell on Twitter, for only the second time that year and sixth time since becoming president: “Mitch McConnell just told a group of people, and me, that he has been in the U.S. Senate for 32 years and the last two have been by far the best & most productive of his career. Tax & Regulation Cuts, VA Choice, Farm Bill, Criminal Justice Reform, Judgeships & much more. Great!” And McConnell, instead of pointing me to someone who would testify to his harmonious partnership with the president over these two best and most productive of years, had picked the man who had just entered an emphatic no-confidence vote in Trump’s presidency and who was, at the moment, telling me about a hunting trip he took to Wyoming a couple of years ago: “That area from Gillette, all the way across Cody and over to Jackson, God, I tell you, that’s heaven on earth, isn’t it?” Mattis said.I agreed that it was.“All right, you take care, Charlie,” Mattis said. “I’ve got to run.”A few weeks later, Popp texted me a cellphone number for John Kelly, who until a week before had been Trump’s chief of staff. A retired Marine Corps general, Kelly had been assumed to be, like Mattis, a load-bearing wall restraining the Trump presidency from a collapse into truly dangerous chaos. And yet Kelly testified unwaveringly to McConnell’s close relationship with the president: “He and the president spoke frequently, you know, on every topic you could imagine,” he told me. “They were compadres, so to speak.”Why, I asked Kelly, did he think that McConnell had exclusively referred me to people — himself, Mattis, Don McGahn — who were widely understood to be keeping Trump in line, and were all, by now, gone from the administration? “You know, I know you don’t mean it this way,” Kelly replied, “but you almost come across like it was some type of conspiracy. And it wasn’t.”On Jan. 8, Popp, emailing in advance of my last interview with McConnell, sent me a couple of pages from the Congressional Record for April 18, 1985. “The Leader wanted me to make sure you saw this before Thursday,” he wrote. It was McConnell’s maiden floor speech, a celebrated rite of passage for new senators and an occasion that McConnell had used to stand up to the policies of a popular president of his own party, speaking in support of a bill imposing sanctions on the apartheid government of South Africa, which the Reagan administration considered an ally.“I am a new member of the U.S. Senate, the world’s greatest deliberative body, and in my first few months here I have witnessed what the Senate can do, when it wants to,” the 43-year-old McConnell, practically a teenager by Senate standards, began. He exhorted his colleagues to join in “a unified effort to correct one of the most abhorrent and criminal examples of injustice evident in the world.”“As much of a fan as all of us were of Reagan,” McConnell told me two days later, “I ended up actually voting for the bill and in favor of overriding his veto.” The bill passed.Earlier in the conversation, I asked him whether, if a hypothetical shutdown-ending compromise landed on his desk that would command a veto-proof majority in both his Senate and Pelosi’s House, ending the standoff over the protests of Trump but without need of his signature, he would bring it up for a vote. “No,” he said. “What you need in order to make a law is the presidential signature.” This was not entirely true, and in the coming days, some of his Republican Senate colleagues, growing weary of the shutdown, would begin hinting that he was not as powerless as he presented himself to be: “It’s hard for one person to fix anything around here,” Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska senator, told Politico. “Unless you’re the president. Or the speaker. Or the majority leader.” McConnell, the master of using the Senate to thwart presidential ambitions, had become his party’s most prominent defender of the idea that this was impossible.The apartheid speech, the Mattis and Kelly testimonials — the self-portrait they suggested, of a man on the right side of a historical record that might judge the current president more harshly, was clear enough, even if McConnell would not have permitted himself to describe it so directly. In one of our interviews, I had asked him about the statement he issued after Charlottesville — a forceful denunciation of Trump’s words that carefully stopped short of criticizing Trump himself by name. When I asked McConnell why, he offered only a tautology: “The way I expressed myself was the way I thought I ought to express myself.” He has always wanted the mantle of principle but also the agenda. The question is whether his attempt to have both will be remembered as shrewd politics or as an act of moral compromise — or both.The thing is, the apartheid speech he wanted me to know he had made — it was good. “Conservatives and liberals, Republicans and Democrats, can and should act in unison,” McConnell, standing for the first time at Henry Clay’s desk, the eyes of his new colleagues and history upon him, had said. “And we should act now.”"
